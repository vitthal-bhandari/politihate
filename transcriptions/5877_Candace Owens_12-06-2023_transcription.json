    "text": " All right, guys, we are banned on YouTube, but they cannot keep us down. Instead, we are live on Facebook today. Very exciting. We're going to talk about the YouTube ban and what it means. Plus, later on in the show, we're going to be talking about the few that nobody saw coming. Robbie Starbuck and Megan Fox. Yeah, it's regarding her allowing her sons to wear dresses. And in response, she has seemingly threatened him with witchcraft, witchcraft, which is totally bizarre. Yep, all that and more today coming up on Candace Owens. All right, guys. Hello, Facebook family. This is very exciting to do a live show and I am doing this live show kind of randomly because I'm sure if you follow me over on Instagram, you know this by now or if you follow me on Twitter, but my show has been temporarily banned from YouTube. It's quite shocking. You would expect me to be angry about it, but I'm not actually feeling angry about it. I feel calm. I know exactly what is true and exactly what is false and we have been through these sort of cycles before. Before I get into what specifically YouTube has an issue with, which I can't really give you specifics because the point of all these platforms is to keep their policies opaque so that they can ban you at any time for any reason to meet the times. Before we go there, I want to at first just say in general, it seems that times are changing. The facts don't change, but people's feelings about the facts eventually do. One such example of that, by the way, is Mark Zuckerberg himself. And I actually wanted to say this to commend him because it's really rare for a lot of these tech execs and these founders and the Silicon Valley heads to come out and admit that they were wrong. In this circumstance, Mark Zuckerberg is coming out and admitting that he unfairly censored people throughout the period of COVID. Take a listen. Let me just take some of the stuff around COVID earlier on in the pandemic where there were real health implications, but there hadn't been time to fully vet a bunch of the scientific assumptions. And unfortunately, I think a lot of the establishment done that kind of waffled on a bunch of facts and asked for a bunch of things to be censored that in retrospect ended up being more debatable or true. And that stuff is really tough. I really undermines trust in that. More debatable or true people that were censored on Facebook during the times of COVID, myself being one of them repeatedly. It was actually the worst experience I've ever had with Facebook since I opened my account back in 2007. I had never seen them more dedicated to information that was false while trying to claim that people that were sharing different information were lying. And as I said, I'm not here to make fun of Mark Zuckerberg for that because I think it takes a level of humility to admit that you were wrong. And he is doing just that. By the way, if you want to know where that clip is from, it's from the Lex Friedman podcast. He sat down and he had that chat. But we all remember it, obviously. You couldn't even write the word vaccine on Instagram at a certain point. You weren't able to share posts that had the word vaccine written into it. People were trying to get clever and writing different words like vaccine or taking out the two C's so that Facebook wouldn't detect that you were discussing something. And what was especially shameful was that people that were being censored, people that were following along with the medical establishment and simply sharing what happened to them. I was talking about my girlfriends who did exactly what they were told. They listened to the medical establishment. They wore a mask at 24-7. They avoided their family and friends. And when the vaccine was rolled out, those individuals went and they got it. And then they had some sort of a reaction, one of the biggest ones for young women at that time, were that it was impacting their menstruation in some way. But if you came out and you said that before the medical establishment acknowledged it, and eventually they did, you were gaslit. You would have your account censored. You would have your account shut down. And could you imagine being that individual? It's the worst kind of gaslighting that could happen. You did everything right. And then they're telling you that you are a liar. Months passed. I talked about that on my show. I know fear. Months passed. And then suddenly, I think it was an article in the New York Post. The FDA and the CDC were suddenly saying, oh, yeah, no, it is impacting menstruation. And we're now going to dedicate some money into examining. Why? But did those people ever get their accounts back? I don't know the answer to that. Maybe Lex Freeman should have pushed him on that. What about the people that you kicked off of your platform permanently for sharing the truth about what happened to them? And this is how it always works, by the way. Everything happens culturally. People get obsessed with it, whether it's true or whether it's false. And suddenly, people start changing policies across platforms about what you're allowed to speak about. I actually think one of the greatest examples of that, Facebook currently has a policy. I bet they're not too active and engaging with that policy. But I call it a BLM policy sponsored by Candace Owens by accident. You remember when I jumped onto a live just like this and I started talking about George Floyd. And that was during the times when nobody knew anything about George Floyd other than the media said he was a hero who died because there was racism in America and you were not allowed to dispute that. And then I went on live and I just started talking about his criminal history, factual criminal history. And that video garnered something like 140, 150 million views. And people were outraged because how dare someone inject truth. We prefer this narrative. It's 2020. We liked this police brutality narrative. There's a lot of money going into this. People are partnering with Black Lives Matter. Well, now believe it or not, you are not going to believe this at all. But Facebook has a policy that you're really not allowed to talk badly about criminals. Now this was not a policy before I had my video. It is now a policy today. I am not kidding. We have to call this the Candace Owens policy. But here's what it says. I'm going to read you directly from Facebook's policy center. It says, violent speech is what's forbidden. Non-violent speech or support in written or visual form. Dehumanizing speech or imagery in the form of comparisons, generalizations, or unqualified behavioral statements. Two or about, and has a list, not that list, is sexual predators. You cannot use dehumanizing speech against sexual predators or violent criminals right there. You cannot use other criminals, including but not limited to thieves, bank robbers, or you can't say things like all like people are criminals. Could you imagine having your account hit because you somehow dehumanized a violent criminal? So a person went out and murdered someone and then you went on and you said something about that individual who murdered someone. Facebook could hit your account. That is the truth. So we're not going to do that today. We're not allowed to do that today. But these are the sorts of things that you're seeing. And if you really want to talk about how this really just meets the moment is how they will randomly change such a strong policy to suddenly fit in with a perspective like as an example of the Ukrainian war, unbelievably. Facebook of course has a policy that you cannot call for the death of certain citizens. That makes sense. We would want to do that. I wouldn't want to do that. I don't want to hear anybody doing that on Facebook calling for people to be killed. That's a sensible position to have. What Reuters reported in March 10th of last year, I'm going to read you directly, that meta platforms will allow Facebook and Instagram users in some countries to call for violence against Russians and Russian soldiers in the context of the Ukrainian invasion according to internal emails that were seen by Reuters on Thursday in a temporary change to its hate speech policy. The social media company is also temporarily allowing some posts that call for the death to Russian president Vladimir Putin or Belarusian president Alexander Lukashenko according to internal emails to its content moderators. As a result of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, we have temporarily made allowances for forms of political expression that would normally violate our rules like violent speech such as death to the Russian invaders. A metaspokes person said in the statement, we still will allow credible calls for violence against Russian citizens. That's interesting. Now that calls for the death of or calls for violence can be considered political expression as long as you are doing it against Russians. I bet that that would not be allowed if the Russians were doing it against Ukrainians. I would prefer a policy where they said either neither or both can engage. That would seem like that would be fair. But it's not about fairness anymore. It's not even about truth anymore. My colleague Michael Knows asked that question, forget if we have free speech. Are we even allowed to say true things? Are we even allowed to say that I went and I got this shot and it impacted my menstruation if it truly did happen to me? Are we even allowed to say this is George Floyd's actual criminal record that I think that you guys should know about before you put angel wings above him or halos on his head or draw morals and have your children wearing his face on a t-shirt? I don't know what the answer to that question is. It seems to me to be that it's not. But the moments change as I mentioned, BLM incorporated has now been exposed for their shoddy expenditure. Thanks in large part to my documentary where I showed you where all the money was going and of course know that money was not going to support black Americans despite the individuals who were made to feel guilty for being born white and the individuals who were oppressed to open their wallets and give their money because being white seemed at least to me to be a crime for a short period of time as we saw these riots, as we excused criminality all to accept and to put forth the prevailing narrative of the day. And now that prevailing narrative has switched once again, which brings me to the reason that my YouTube account has been banned. YouTube has a policy which they won't admit is a policy, but it is one that if you properly gender someone, you can have your account hit if that person does not feel that they are that gender that day. So reality does not matter on YouTube. People's feelings about reality does, which is a shocking thing. You're watching this live and you're looking at me and you're thinking, there's Candace, a black woman. But if right now I say I actually don't feel like a black woman, I feel like a Mexican man. And you say, okay, I am sorry you're having a bad day, Candace, but you are a black woman and I get really angry and I say, no, no, I feel like a Mexican man. And you make a YouTube video talking about this debacle and you say, well, it's kind of different, but Candace is saying a lot of problems. She's a Mexican man. She's obviously not a Mexican man. I don't even know if she's been to Mexico. Then you to wish that video and they would take it down. They would say that you have violated some nebulous opaque, unclear policy about hate, hateful conduct. It's hateful for you to acknowledge reality and that is a very scary place to be in. No, I am not calling for the death of Russians or the death of any other groups of individuals nor would I ever call for the death of any groups of individuals because that's wrong. Rather, I am acknowledging reality. And so YouTube would like us to just stop talking about gender ideology, to not talk about the plenty of individuals who say they are transgendered and want to talk honestly about the procedures and the pills that they are on. You see, when it came to COVID, it seemed like the medical establishment was in lock step on the narrative. Even if the narrative was wrong and even if they lied and they changed their minds about certain things, at least they agreed, regarding gender ideology, that is not the case. Medical establishment is very much divided. As just one example in Sweden and in Finland, they've completely stopped giving out hormone blockers to children. So you would think that that would be relevant for parents to hear if they are considering putting their children on hormone blockers. YouTube says no. This is the only thing you can say is that children must be affirmed whatever they think and you cannot question the drugs or the methods or why it is that America, the United States of America, seems to be the country that is pushing this the most, not even in Europe amongst those European countries. Are they pushing it this way? But again, it's all about the prevailing narrative. And right now, the prevailing narrative is that you have to lie to keep your living on YouTube. Here's the thing. I stood up to the COVID madness and I stood by my figurative guns. I stood up to the madness of BLM and said that I thought that the organization was fraudulent from day one. And in this circumstance, and especially because it is so insidious and refers to children and seems to be wanting to place these values on children, I will stand up to it because I'm a mom first and being able to tell the truth seems like a most basic act of courage that I can do to ensure my children's future in this country that I love, but in which I do not recognize, I don't recognize this country. I will not lie for a living. So I want to say to YouTube as they reassess my account and as I am banned for this month, I want them to know that you cannot compel me to lie for a living. I'm not a buck that can be broken. And that's all I'm going to say about that. It's finally summer here in Nashville and when the weather is this nice, I love to grill out in the backyard with my family.

All right, let's jump into some of these topics that are happening over the weekend. Very shocking. The Robbie Starbucks versus Megan Fox food was something that I think none of us saw coming so we can kind of talk about what really happened and really what's at root of this, which is actually almost much bigger than even their feud. So essentially it began when Robbie Starbucks tweeted alongside a photo of Megan Fox and her three kids. So I want to be clear that the particular photo in question seems to me to have been taken by paparazzi and when paparazzi take photos of children, I am inclined not to share them on the internet. But Megan Fox then took this photo and shared it onto her Instagram. So now I believe this is in the public domain. The mother has shared this photo, which was initially taken by paparazzi, which means that this photo is not premiering here on cana sewn to space book. It's already owned by Facebook and Instagram because Megan Fox has put it onto her personal Instagram page. I just want to say that. So essentially he tweeted alongside this photo of Megan Fox, we are still going to blur out the faces of the children because I just think that's responsible, even though she did not blur out the faces of her children. And Megan wrote, I'm end up part and Robbie Starbucks wrote this caption with it. He wrote, these are Megan Fox's sons. We used to live in the same gated community and our kids played at the park. I saw two of them have a full on breakdown saying they were forced by their mom to wear girls' clothes as their nanny tried to console them. It's pure child abuse. Pray for them. Now to be clear, he in a separate tweet alleged that this incident took place five years ago, that there was a nanny and there was another person that was present. Megan has not outwardly come out and said that her child identifies as a young girl, but people are obviously responding to this picture in which first and foremost all three or four boys have very long hair. One of them has his hair cut into bangs and he is wearing a shirt that says, was it girls' rock? Go girls. Some tie dye shorts that are shorter. You definitely say these are not boys' shorts by any means. So this is what has caused this sort of viral episode and people are discussing this and talking about whether or not this is real or whether or not she has impacted this upon her children. Well, Megan Fox saw this and was obviously outraged by this because it's her children. I totally get that. If somebody was talking about my children any capacity, I would probably be outraged. But let's get into what she said. So Megan responded by saying, I really don't want to give you this attention because clearly you are a clout chaser, but let me teach you something. You're regardless of how desperate you may become at any given time to acquire wealth, power, success or fame, never use children as leverage or social currency, especially under malevolent and erroneous pretense. Exploiting my child's gender identity to gain attention in your political campaign has put you on the wrong side of the universe. I have been burned at the stake by insecure, narcissistic, impotent little men like you many times. And again, I'm still here. You effed with the wrong witch. Very interesting ending to that. You've effed with the wrong witch. And to follow up that interesting ending, she published this under her Instagram stories. Now to be clear, this is not actually her. So she's trying to be tongue in cheek here. But it is a story that appeared in the New York Post with the headline, I caught witches holding a carcass eating ritual on my security camera. That's a real story that somebody set up a security camera and they caught naked people that appeared to be eating a carcass, a dead animal. So Megan published that under her stories with the caption, me outside of Rob Starbuck's house. Very, very strange, a lot to unpack there. So let's first just go through what Megan Fox has said about her own children because to be fair, rather than me commenting on the situation, I want to just actually use what she has said concretely about her own kids. To parade magazine this year, she said, quote, when I became pregnant with Noah, I could feel through my mother's intuition, I suppose, that he was not subscribing to gender stereotypes. So I decided to provide an environment for him early on that would allow him to discover how he wanted to express himself. If a boy loves princesses and a girl loves baseball, that's not indicative of their sexuality. It's indicative of their communication and creative expression. We can't limit children by telling them how they should play. So that is her saying that she knew that while she was pregnant, that her son was not going to subscribe to gender stereotypes. I'm not going to provide any commentary there. You can take from that what you will because there's a further conversation that needs to be had. Now, her partner and her son's father is Brian Austin Green. In 2017, Green also stood up for his son back when Fox shared a photo, which I am not going to show right now, but it is in the public domain. It is on Instagram of Noah wearing a dress from the Disney film The Frozen. At that time, what Brian Austin Green said was, my son, he's four. I've heard from some people that they don't agree with him wearing dresses. To them, I say, I don't care. He's four. If he wants to wear it, then he wears it. It's dresses or goggles or slippers or whatever. It's his life. They're not my clothes. I feel like at four at five, that's a time when he should be having fun. He's not harming anyone wearing a dress. So if he wants to wear a dress, good on him. So essentially, mom's like, I got an intuition that he's going to want to bend stereotypes, gender stereotypes. And now dad's coming in behind. He's like, listen, he's only four kids dress up. It's not weird. He's just a young kid. But that was back in 2017, obviously. He is no longer four years old. And we have Megan, who told Glamour Magazine last year this. She said, Noah started wearing dresses when he was about two. And I bought a bunch of books that sort of addressed these things and addressed a full spectrum of what this is. Some of the books are written by transgender children. Some of the books are just about how you can be a boy and wear dresses. You could express yourself through your clothing however you want. And that doesn't even have to have anything to do with your sexuality. So from the time that they were very young, I've incorporated those things into their daily lives so that nobody feels like they are weird or strange or different, she added. Now here I can add commentary. And again, I am not going to make it about her son, Noah, being too. I'm going to make it about myself because I have a two year old boy. And I will say that my two year old does not pick out his own clothes. He can't even sit still in a store. So the idea for me of a little boy wanting to wear a dress versus having the dress bought for him is a question mark. And this journalist could have followed up and asked that question, but they did not. So we can't infer how this took place. But you know, two years old is when boys first start speaking. So they wouldn't necessarily and some boys don't speak until three and older, but two is usually the earliest that boys start to begin to speak. So it's interesting that she's acknowledging that he's worn dresses since he's two. And is this just as a question, Megan buying these items because she had an intuition when he was in her stomach that he would want these items. Again, questions that we would have to ask Megan Fox, Megan, I welcome you on to the platform to discuss this because I am very interested in this. And it is a riveting political discussion that we are having. Megan Fox went on in 2019 to say this, that her eldest doesn't care about being made fun of for wearing dresses to school. He designs, he draws outfits. He's very talented, but he's still six. She said during an interview on the talk, he's really into fashion. He's the one like sometimes he'll dress himself and he likes to wear dresses sometimes. And I sent him to a really liberal like hippie school, but even there here in California, he still has little boys going like boys don't wear dresses or boys don't wear pink. We're going through that now where I'm trying to teach him to be confident no matter what anyone else says. She also explained that he briefly stopped wearing dresses but began wearing them again. He came home and I was like, how was it? Did any of the friends at school have anything to say? He was like, well, all the boys laughed when I came in. But he's like, I don't care. I love dresses too much. So there's no doubt. I think it's probably obvious that by now this is something that her son enjoys. She's saying that her son enjoys. But as I said earlier, I would love to talk about him being too and who first bought the dress for the young boy and things of that nature because I have had conversations with Wall Tire. I had a very long podcast episode with Wall Tire. If you haven't watched it, I welcome you to. It is on YouTube. Just search Canada's owns and Wall Tire. Wall Tire is a man who lived as a transgendered woman for decades. He even went through with the bottom surgery and his entire story begins when he was four and his grandmother gave him a dress. It's a super interesting story. And again, I would love to better understand the parents of children with gender identity questions. Now, I'm going to point you to a study because I think that's a lot on Facebook. I think you are allowed to talk about the experts. I want to be clear that this study was done in March of 1991. It's been interesting to see, as Mark Zuckerberg says, that science really changes, that the experts change their analyses. When I was growing up, I took psychology courses in school and we called this gender dysphoria disorder. We learned that that was what it was called in the DSM-5. Now my understanding is that has now been updated and they no longer consider gender dysphoria to be a psychiatric issue. I want to express that the science has changed on that to be extra careful here on Facebook. But back when it was acknowledged as a psychiatric issue, this comparative study was done and it's really fascinating. It examined the mothers of boys with gender identity disorder and they compared this with matched controls. I'm just going to read you the abstract of this study because it's fascinating. It says, this pilot study compared mothers of boys with gender identity disorder with mothers of normal boys to determine whether differences in psychopathology and child rearing attitudes and practices could be identified. They're just looking at are you raising the children different or are the children really suffering with this? It goes on to say, the results of the diagnostic interview for border lines and the Beck depression inventory revealed that mothers of boys with gender identity disorder had more symptoms of depression and more often met the criteria for borderline personality disorder than the controls. 53% of the mothers of boys with gender identity disorder compared with just 6% of the mothers of the control study met the diagnosis for borderline personality disorder on the diagnostic interview for border lines or had symptoms of depression on the Beck depression inventory. That is shocking. 53% of the mother of boys with GID compared with just 6% of the controls and I will very happily link that study in post for you to read that yourself. Again, very interesting. What we're seeing again and again is that this brings into question, is it the environment or is it actually the child? Is it Megan while she's pregnant, sort of thinking these things and wanting these things to happen? Or is she being honest? Really are her boys, her boy, are they? This is who they've always been and she could really realistically sense that in the womb while she was pregnant, she just knew that they were going to bend gender stereotypes. Well, Bill Maher had something to say about this. He did a true Bill Maher fashion on his show, Real Time with Bill Maher. He was showing how the rates for Americans that are identifying within the LGBTQIA plus community keeps doubling with every generation and he sort of starts with the generation back in 1940s which had less than 1% the baby boomers, 2.6% identified as LGBTQ plus generation X, 4.2%, millennials, 10.5% on a millennial identified as LGBTQ plus, that sounds correct to me. Then generation Z doubled 20%, 20.8% for generation Z. And finally, we are arriving at the year 2020 and 41.6% of individuals identify as LGBTQ. That was being funny, instead if we keep up with this, by 2040, 82%, you can see right now the chart 82.2% of us are going to identify as LGBTQ if these trends keep up and then he said by the year 2080, 2060 rather, 100% of us will be LGBTQ in his audience laughed at this. But then he started talking about how these trends are geographic and this is why it's so crucial for us to be able to have an honest discussion and this is what he did brilliantly in this clip now. What I love about even showing Bill Maher is that this is an apolitical discussion, right? I am considered a conservative, he is considered a liberal. He is actually at points I think would be considered leftist. And yet we're agreeing that obviously what this necessitates is further conversation, not censorship as YouTube is employing. We should be able to have open conversations, rational conversations. We do not need to threaten people. We don't need to, as I said before, call for death or anything of that nature, but we must be able to have rational conversations when we start to realize weird trends and disparities and such is the case as the geographical nature of these trends. He showed how in Los Angeles, the numbers are exploding. Los Angeles is where Megan Fox lives, right? There are so many children that are acknowledging that they may be transgendered, whereas in places like, well, I don't know, here in Tennessee, you're just not seeing those things. So let's just take a listen to what Bill Maher had to say very briefly. If you attend a small dinner party of typically very liberal, upper income Angelenos, it is not uncommon to hear parents who each have a trans kid having a conversation about that. What are the odds of that happening in Youngstown, Ohio? If this spike in trans children is all natural, why is it regional? Either Ohio is shaming them or California is creating them. Which is it? What do you think it is? I will definitely read your guys' comments after this. You guys know I'm always in the comment section like Brett Cooper. What do you think it is? He's asking the exact same question that I have asked on my show over and over again. Is this something real? Or do we need to be looking at the environment of these children? Is this natural or is this environmental? And what this definitely is, is a fair question to ask. Now looking into Megan Fox, we can't possibly say how she is raising her children or the impact of how she is as a mother. That would not be fair. But what we can take a look at are her public actions. I think it is fair to say how does she represent herself as a public figure. And in recent months, it has been interesting. Megan Fox is, in case you didn't know this, she is engaged to machine gun Kelly and they very much lived their relationship online out loud until recently. When they had some sort of a breakup, I just want to point you to one post, really just of her acknowledging their engagement. She posted this again on her Instagram. This is in the public domain. She wrote, we asked for magic. We were oblivious to the pain we would face together in such a short, frenetic period of time. Unaware of the work and sacrifices the relationship would require from us, but intoxicated off of the love and the karma. Somehow a year and a half later, having walked through hell together and having laughed more than I ever imagined possible, he asked me to marry him. And just as in every lifetime before this one and as in every lifetime that will follow, I said yes. And then we drank each other's blood. I'm sorry. Did I read that right? And then we drank each other's blood. Now, in case you're thinking she wrote that to be cute or to be funny, you should know that she also spoke about the fact that they drink small amounts of each other's blood in other interviews. I can't remember if it was for Vogue or whether it was for Glamour, but it was for a magazine. There was a video and she talked about the fact and here it is, a Vanity Fair headline that she and Machine Gun Kelly do drink each other's blood, but it's only for ritual purposes. So again, you're hearing that word ritual. You see that she posted that joke headline. This will be me outside of Robbie Starbucks House. And then she essentially acknowledged in his post to him that he messed with the wrong witch. Either she finds the idea of witchcraft to be so hilarious that she's pretending to be a witch on the world stayed perpetually or she's telling us who she is. Here is another post from Megan Fox's Instagram regarding these two star crossed lovers. She wrote the tale of two outcasts and star crossed lovers caught in the throes of a torrid solar flare of a romance featuring feverish obsession, guns, addiction, shamans, lots of blood, general mayhem therapy, tantric night terrors, binding rituals, chakra sound baths, psychedelic hallucinations, organic smoothies, and the kind of sex that would make Lucifer clutch his rosary. Again, I am not going to offer any commentary. I am going to allow Megan Fox to tell us who she is. It's interesting that she came clapped back, so to speak, at Robbie Starbucks by claiming that him discussing this issue, which again is a very relevant cultural issue, whether he had talked about her children or someone else's in the public domain. She says that he's clout chasing, which is really bizarre to me. I think one thing I think is fair to say is that she doesn't have the same career credentials as Denzel Washington or Angelina Jolie, a list of some of Megan Fox's movies. This one I don't know if we can say on Instagram. I mean, if we can say on Facebook, but it's a movie title, Super Zim and I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not going to say on Instagram. I'm not sure who posted this again. This is already in the public sphere. It's her and Courtney Kardashian sitting on a toilet with their tongues out. Courtney Kardashian is straddled over her as you can see in this photo. This is a campaign for you in case you were wondering what is this. When am I watching? It looks like soft core pornography. It's shocking that it's allowed on Instagram. It's shocking that this is allowed on YouTube and me talking about issues is not. But it is. This is actually from their skims shoots. They wrote the caption, should we start in only fans? Sure, if you guys would like to. I do think that it is valid, at the very least valid, for people to have a discussion about the mindset of parents that are raising children always. I think it's an ongoing discussion no matter what it is, even if it's a child that is doing heroin at the age of 12. We always say, let's look at the parents. Let's examine the environment and see what could be impacted. Attacking that, sometimes you see kids that are going through a divorce at home, start acting out, they come to school, they want to get into fights, they start smoking pot. We always are able to examine the parents and to examine the stability of those circumstances. Is it suddenly not fair when it becomes the topic of transgenderism? Well YouTube says no. What could be behind this push, this new lockstep idea that we can't even talk about transgenderism, even if we're reporting on things factually? One thing that could be related, and I'm not saying it is, is the fact that in the 2020 report, Abve, which is the Lupron manufacturer, brought in $752 million in revenue. Lupron, in case you were not aware, is the company that makes the puberty blockers for children, also the same puberty blockers that are used to castrate pedophiles. That is just the truth. Those drugs are also used for that. We could ask a question, we won't know the answer. Could it be the same industry that once censored us from talking about vaccines and COVID, that is the same industry that is censoring us from talking about transgenderism and having a rational debate on it? As I said, we won't be able to get to that answer today. Congress once again allowed itself to be pushed into appeasing the administration and raising the debt ceiling for the 79th time.

She wrote, what they're all trying today is control us, control what we drive, what we say, etc. They can go bleep themselves. I for one cannot be controlled. I will do what I want, say what I want, and drive what I want. In Candace, I see a woman before me, not color. I was taught we all bleed red. I just adore you. Keep doing what you're doing. You have my full respect. Elizabeth, thank you so much for that comment. And yes, it is about control and it is sad. But we do have to also hold on to moments where people are fighting that, people with a tremendous amount of power as one example, Elon Musk. Maybe one day, and maybe people like Mark Zuckerberg will see what Elon Musk is doing and realizing that the fight for freedom is more important than being liked and receiving money from people. That I believe are not here for our best interests. Holly Smith writes, systems are losing and trying to make a last push at this senselessness. You say it's so plain and they are left chewing fingernails. Yeah, guys, what you have seen today is a sample of my show. This is a sample of my podcast. And it just seems so bizarre that it would be banned. And it's so cruel to see the left sort of celebrating and applauding that and saying, this is a good thing. It's not a good thing. We need to have speech. I would never want to see someone who disagrees with me on the left be centered. I wouldn't want to see Bill Mar be censored. And there are tons of Chelsea Handler, I totally disagree with everything she says, but she has a right to say it. And if she disagrees and she does disagree with my perspectives on this, she talks about it on her podcast. I want to hear her disagreements and I want to be able to answer her disagreements. I do feel that my husband always says, you know, an animal backed into the corner fights the hardest. And I do think that there is some sense that they are losing the transgender debate based on rationality, especially when they do such extreme things, like censoring me, censoring Michael Knows, demonetizing Matt Walsh, all of these things that they have done. It doesn't make it look like it's because they're on the side of truth. And so maybe we are hearing the last squeals of a dying animal, so to speak. All right. Miriam Kuzim Kova, Mishkova, I think I said that good. Right. Here in Slovakia, we still have a normal world, but I'm watching your account with an open mouth and worried what is coming to you up from the USA. It is very interesting to talk about countries in the Eastern quarter. I speak about a lot on my podcast. You guys are already subscribed and watch it about how different the mindset is over there. And it does seem unimaginable. And I think by the way, that puts us in tremendous peril. I think that people are looking at what's going on in America and thinking these people are incredibly weak. They're confused. They don't have a difference between right and wrong, left and right girl and boy. And it is not the message that we want to send out. You know, we don't want to send out that we are ripe for a takeover. All right, you guys. Lydia Jones writes, may God continue to give you wisdom, guidance and protection. Thank you for not cowering to the oppressors. Lydia, thank you for saying that. I always say to people when I see them, they go, how can I help? How can I help? And you would think people are like, what can I donate to? What's the cause? Actually, just pray. I do believe the prayers have gotten to me to where I am today that I have been able to sort of dig my heels in the figurative sand. And I've been protected by something. And obviously that has to be God and it has to be because I know that there are so many people across the world that have been praying for my success. I've been in this for a long time. I have never capitulated to the prevailing narrative of the day. And sometimes, of course, always it comes at a tremendous risk to my life and my livelihood. But I know that my goal every single day is to simply put my head on the pillow and I need to know that I didn't lie to my audiences because the right sponsor came along with a big check and promised something. And eventually, we are vindicated in our beliefs. We are vindicated when Mark Zuckerberg sits down and he says something like he said in that podcast with Lex Friedman that they got it wrong. I wish he would take it a step further and reinstate the accounts that were punished for that wrongness. But hey, I'll take a little bit of humility. All right, you guys. That unbelievably is all the time that we have for today. I'll also remind you guys, for those of you that are interested in exploring the vaccine series, I have an entire vaccine series for new mothers called A Shot in the Dark. If you just Google A Shot in the Dark on YouTube, it will pop up and you can see the first three episodes for free. The rest of the series is available exclusively on Daily Wire Plus. Thank you so much for joining us today. Maybe I'll be back tomorrow. Maybe I'll be live on Twitter. Who knows? I'm all over the place this week. I'm everywhere except for on YouTube. So be sure to come back here tomorrow for a brand new episode."
