    "text": " Coming up on this episode of the Doctors' Pharmacy. Getting off of processed foods and onto real whole foods, that natural ability for us to regulate our hunger just happens. So one of the biggest things we can all do is just stop eating things with labels on them. Hey everyone, it's Dr. Mark. I know a lot of you out there are practitioners like me helping patients heal using real food and functional medicine as your framework for getting to the root cause. What's critical to understanding what each individual person and body needs is testing, which is why I'm excited to tell you about Rupa Health. Looking at hormones, organic acids, nutrient levels, inflammatory factors, gut bacteria, and so many other internal variables can help us find the most effective path to optimize health and reverse disease. But up till now, that man, you are usually ordering tests for one patient from multiple labs. And I'm sure many of you can relate how time consuming this process was, and then it could all feel like a lot of work to keep track of. Now there's Rupa Health, a place for functional medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty labs from over 20 labs like Dutch, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more. Rupa Health helped provide a significantly better patient experience and it's 90% faster, letting you simplify the entire process of getting the functional medicine lab tests you need and giving you more time to focus on patients. This is really a much needed option to functional medicine space, and I'm so excited about it. It means better service for you and your patients. You can check it out and look at a free live demo with a Q&A or create an account at RupaHealth.com. That's R-U-P-A Health.com. My main goal with diet is to use food as medicine, but even when we eat super well, most of us are missing out on certain essential nutrients. Our soils have become depleted and our digestive tracts just aren't working so great. They're compromised by stress and toxins and they just can't absorb nutrients as efficiently as they should. And that's why I always use and I recommend to my patients a multivitamin mineral as nutritional insurance. It covers the basics for all our day-to-day body functions, all the things that we need that our food might be missing, but there are so many products out there I wouldn't go near because they contain artificial fillers or inactive ingredients and you have to be pretty picky. The one I trust and take myself is athletic greens. They use high quality, highly absorbable forms of vitamins and nutrients from real whole foods. Athletic greens comes in a powder that tastes great and mixes easily with water or smoothies and specifically supports my gut health, immunity, energy and recovery. And it's not just vitamins and minerals. It has phytonutrient rich super foods and adaptogens and pre- and probiotics and even digestive enzymes. I love that they add the digestive support in their powder since so much of our immune strength and overall wellness starts in the gut. It's really one supplement that covers so many bases and you'd be hard pressed to find something else in this comprehensive form in any single other product. I use athletic greens in the morning as part of my daily routine and I love having it with me whenever I travel. I also love that it's diet friendly whether you're vegan, paleo, keto, dairy free or gluten free. Right now athletic greens is offering my audience a full year supply of their vitamin D3K2 liquid formula free with your first purchase. Now these two nutrients are also so vital for a strong immune system and strong bones and many of us are not getting enough of them. I use the athletic greens powder and their D3K2 formula to make sure I get extra nutrients that compliment my diet. They're also going to give you five free travel packs as well. Just go to athleticgreens.com forward slash hymen to get your free year supply of vitamin D3K2 and five free travel packs with your first purchase. You'll get it delivered straight to your door and I promise you'll feel the difference athletic greens can make in your daily wellness routine. Again that's athleticgreens.com forward slash hymen. Now let's get back to this week's episode of the Doctors Pharmacy. Welcome to the Doctors Pharmacy. I'm Dr. Mark Hyman. That's pharmacy with an F. F-A-R-M-A-C-Y. It plays for conversations that matter and if you ever hungry or hungry all the time or can't figure out why you can't stop eating or binging, you better listen up. Because this is a podcast that's going to help you understand why and what to do about it. And it's with none other than my friend, colleague and medical director at the Ultra Wireless Center, Dr. Elizabeth Boham. And one of our special episodes called House Call. And today we're so excited to have you back to talk about this really vexing problem which is hunger. And if we all didn't struggle with eating and overeating and obesity it wouldn't be a big deal. But our hunger regulation is something that most of us don't think about. We think we're at the effect of our hunger and not at the cause of our hunger. And that we can't really do anything about it. That if we have cravings and we want to eat big old muffins and donuts and we just have to have them, then there's just nothing we can do because willpower certainly can't fight those cravings and urges. And we think that's just how our bodies will work. But I can tell you and you can tell me and we can tell each other after seeing so many thousands of patients that this isn't true, that we do understand the science of hunger. And we're going to talk about hunger today in a particular way because I think there's so much we can do to regulate our appetite so we're not starving and overeating. And I found that for myself, if you don't eat, right, you definitely feel your blood sugar swing all over the place. You feel hungry and you feel out of sorts and you tend to overeat. So none of us want to do that. So how do we naturally regulate our appetite? And I think most people don't understand that if you have an inherent wisdom in your body that knows how to regulate the hunger. And you can have hormones that control your weight and metabolism and appetite. If you're off just by 100 calories a day and you're, by the way, no one can count calories because it's kind of a ridiculous effort in the sense that you can guesstimate. But if you're off 100 calories a day, over the course of 20 or 30 years, that's 30 or 40 pounds of weight gain in terms of the accumulative effect of those 100 calories that you're off every day. So it's really about letting your body's own intelligence come back to find out how to regulate these. Let's tell us about the sort of biology of hunger and particularly about this particular hormone ghrelin, which is missing. Maybe people heard about it. Don't really know what it's about. It's really an important appetite regulator. And the key to appetite regulation is regulating this particular compound ghrelin, which is so prevalent and so dysregulated in our bodies. Yeah. Oh, Mark, it's great to be with you and everybody again today. So thanks for having me. And I think it's such an important topic, like you said, because with when our hunger is out of control, it is very hard to control what we eat and why we eat. And so it's important to understand how all these hormones work together. And like you mentioned, taking a step back and listening to the natural intelligence of our body is really important for maintaining a healthy weight and having great energy and vitality. And so ghrelin is really an interesting hormone. And it is secreted from the stomach, mostly stomach and part of the small intestine. And it goes to the brain and then it says to the brain, okay, you better eat. You're hungry. So it is that hormone that makes us feel hungry. And so when we eat, typically, our ghrelin levels go down. And we'll talk about this a little later. Sometimes our food composition, what we eat in a typical meal impacts our ghrelin levels differently. So when we eat, typically our ghrelin levels go down and it says, okay, now you're full and you can stop eating. And so what are the reasons people always say, don't eat too fast or if you're hungry, take a few minutes to make sure you still want to get seconds is just to give the body time for the hormones to shift. So and for that ghrelin level to go down. So the other reason we know a lot about ghrelin is because when people lose weight, they often feel more hungry. And I always explain this to my patients. You know, I'm like, you know, they need to and want to lose weight. And when they do, sometimes they feel more hungry for a period of time. And I think that's a really natural, normal thing. And we sometimes have to work through that to continue to get to our goal if we're working to lose weight. So we've got a lot of hormones that have an influence on what we choose to eat when we choose to eat. Yeah, it's so critical because if we don't understand how those are regulated, it's really a big deal. I think, you know, when you're not eating and when you're losing weight and when you have an eating for a while, your body will naturally produce this hormone in your stomach that makes you hungry, which is a good thing. So we don't start to death, right? Right. And so, you know, it goes down if you eat and, you know, so forth. But if you have a diet that's causing a dysregulation of that hormone, it can really create a problem. And I think, you know, when you mention the microbiome, which also is key, but the, you know, if you're overweight, it seems like the hunger is so dysregulated. So people are literally overeating and they're already so obese and it just seems to be counterintuitive. Why would people feel like they need energy if they're already so overweight and they have so much energy in their body? But it really is about this particular hormone rate that's being dysregulated. I mean, one of the things we know with, with ghrelin is when people, when they do gastric bypass surgery on people, the ghrelin levels do decrease. And one of the reasons why that surgery can be successful, I say that with some caution because there's, depends on how you define success. And there's a lot of issues with the surgery that, you know, important for us to talk about. But where they can be successful for some people is decreasing that ghrelin levels and helping their hunger. And not that I recommend the surgery necessarily for people, but that is one way that it works because it decreases your hunger. Yes. So tell us about how, from a lifestyle perspective, we're affecting ghrelin and what we can do with our diet, with our timing of eating, with sleep and other factors that are really driving a lot of issues. Yeah. One of the things we know is when we have a meal that has sufficient amount of protein in it that our ghrelin levels decrease and we feel less hungry with that type of a meal. So it's really important, you know, we've talked a lot about how insulin can trigger hunger too, right? But ghrelin also, so when we eat a meal that's balanced, that has sufficient protein and fats along with all the good healthy carbohydrates, that helps with making us feel more full and not as hungry. So it's really important to think about each of your meals in your day and say, okay, did I have sufficient protein there? And remember, protein is like your eggs and fish and chicken and beef and beans and legumes and nuts and seeds, and that protein will help when you consume it help that ghrelin go down and make you feel more satiated after a meal. And ghrelin is one of those reasons that that occurs. You mentioned also with lifestyle, sleep. Sleep is critical. When people are sleep deprived, ghrelin levels go up and they're more hungry. And so we're seeing an epidemic of sleep deprivation in this country and worldwide even, right? So we're seeing this epidemic of sleep deprivation, which is one thing that's driving higher levels of ghrelin. And we want to make sure that we're getting adequate sleep. If somebody has this process called sleep apnea, if somebody has interrupted sleep where they are having episodes where they're not getting oxygen into the body, that's what sleep apnea is. They're having episodes where either they're somewhere in their nasal area, the back of their throat that's preventing oxygen from getting into the body, then the body has to wake itself up to take a deep breath. So people will often be snoring and then will stop breathing for a period of time and then take this really big deep breath. They might not even realize they're having these episodes of apnea or not getting oxygen into the body. But what we're learning is that when you have sleep apnea, ghrelin levels are higher. So people who have sleep apnea have higher levels of ghrelin. And again, one reason why that drives this vicious cycle of weight gain, obesity, weight gain, obesity fatigue, hunger, hunger hunger, right? So it drives this vicious cycle. They know that when people have sleep apnea, their levels of ghrelin are higher than the same group of people that even have the same body weight. So even if both groups are overweight or obese, if you have sleep apnea, your level of ghrelin will be higher. And so it's really important that we pay attention to the sleep, work with our patients and find out, you know, are they getting adequate sleep first of all? And is adequate hours of sleep that is? And of the hours of sleep that they're getting, are they restful? Are they sufficient? Is there any concern about apnea or something that would be disrupting their sleep? But you know Liz, it's really true that, you know, sleep apnea is a big factor. I remember a patient I had who was a lawyer and was telling me about his struggle to lose weight and he needed to lose about 50 pounds. He says, nothing you could do about it. I said, well tell me about your life. What do you do? I'm like, what do you do? I'm going to do this now. But I have to stand up on my desk every day to work. Otherwise I fall asleep at my desk. I'm like, oh, well maybe I have sleep apnea. So we tested him, he had severe sleep apnea. We put him on a sleep apnea and he lost 50 pounds like that. And I think, you know, most people don't understand the connection between sleep. But it's not just sleep apnea. If you're not getting enough sleep. And you and I both as doctors know that when we were on call and we're working all night or we don't sleep, that we tend to crave more food. We crave carbs, we crave sugar, and our appetite's so screwed up. And I remember this one study, it was a healthy young 20 year old who weren't overweight, who were sleep deprived on purpose compared to a control group. And they found that the sleep deprived group were much hungrier and they would crave more carbs and sugar. So that's an interesting phenomenon. And that's why we see that gender incredible consumption in this country, these products who were sleep deprived as a nation and poor quality sleep. And there's 70 million people that suffer from some type of sleep issue, which is a lot of people. I think maybe even more actually. It's a lot of people. And so it's not just sleep apnea, but it's all the sleep deprivation. And so what about sugar and carb and stuff and artificial sweeteners? How did that affect grailin and how do we should be thinking about our diet in terms of regular appetite when we eat those things? Yeah, so it's interesting that foods, you know, foods when we're, our stomach is empty, we produce more grailin. And then when we eat, our grailin level decreases and we feel more full, right? So, or we're not as hungry. So we know that carbohydrates as well as protein and fat can all result in a lower grailin release. And as I mentioned earlier, it's really important to have that meal that's balanced with good protein and fat and fiber to feel full and cause that suppression of grailin. But one study that was really interesting, or many studies that are interesting, they're looking at these non-chloric sweeteners and how they impact the grailin. And so they've been able to show that artificial sweeteners don't suppress grailin in the body. So we think that when we are reaching for these low calorie sweeteners, these artificial sweeteners, that, that, okay, we are not getting any calories, but we're getting this, this, this, this. substance that is, you know, going to, it is going to make us feel more, more satiated, but actually not at all. So artificial sweeteners don't suppress the, the grailin levels in the body, like food does, like whether it's carbohydrates or protein. And so, you know, people who consume artificial sweeteners actually feel more hungry a lot of the time. And, and, and that's a concern in terms of food regulation and what you were mentioning before about listening to our bodies, natural hormone levels and the, the natural things that drive us to eat or naughty. And I think that's really important when it comes to these artificial sweeteners. You know, there's, there's, we think some people will come in and be like, okay, that I can, it's like a free food, but it's really not in terms of how it's impacting our hunger and satiety. Yeah, it's true. I mean, I think so. So you think that, oh, for you, you know, something that makes you mimic sweetness like the artificial sweetener would sort of suppress your appetite, but it doesn't do drink, you know, treat your car to social sweeteners and you want more and more food, which is really concerning. Yes. And there are a bunch of other things that affect the effect you mentioned stress. So, you know, sleep deprivation, you know, lack of sleep in any way, but also stress, as a huge role in your growing, right? Stress has a huge impact, you know, stress can, high levels of stress will cause us to have higher levels of ghrelan and eat more. And, you know, isn't that fascinating? You know, it kind of probably makes sense from an evolutionary perspective that if we're going through a stressful time, we want something to be triggering us to make sure we're getting enough food. So we are staying alive, right? So that probably makes sense evolutionarily, but it's important for us to pay attention to that when we're working with our patients and help them understand that this chronic stress that they're under can really be disrupting their hunger cues. And so, you know, we know that, as I mentioned, ghrelan can cause, or stress can cause high levels of ghrelan, and for some people cause them to eat, we feel more and more hungry and want to eat all the time. And so in order to help them feel less hungry, one of the things we have to talk about is that chronic stress that they're under. And what can we do to help with managing that chronic stress? You know, whether it's getting outside and enjoying nature and doing regular exercise, getting on a good meditation program, doing your breathwork every day, you know, journaling, gratitude, working with a therapist, doing some other types of treatment like EMDR or, you know, other ways to help release some of this chronic stress from the body, you know, is really important for many people. That's huge. That's huge. So the other thing that, you know, people talk about with ghrelan is, you know, other things that regulate appetite. So stress we talked about. What about other foods like protein and fiber and fat? How do those affect ghrelan? Right. Well, they'll trigger ghrelan levels to go down after you consume them. So it's really important. You know, we work with all of our patients to say it every meal, each meal you have, make sure you've got a good source of protein, a good source of fiber, which is all your vegetables and beans, legumes, nuts and seeds, ground flax seed, and healthy fat, and every meal, because that's going to help you feel more satiated. It's going to help those ghrelan levels go down. I mean, we also know things like cannabis, right, can cause ghrelan to increase. And that may be why people get the munchies, right? And so it's important to understand what things you're doing and how they're impacting your hunger in your body. Mm hmm. Mm hmm. Yeah, I think that's right. I think, you know, obviously people will put a lot of things at the munchies, but sure. And that drives appetite. So how do we work with people who have these problems? How do we sort of help? And by the way, you know, one of the things that I wanted to mention was sort of the theory about gastric bypass. One of the theories about gastric bypass is that since grilling is producing the stomach that when you have a gastric bypass, it shuts down the ghrelan levels. But I'm not sure. I'm not sure if that's the only, the only thing that's going on. And I think the reason I say that is it was a recent randomized controlled trial comparing people who had gastric bypass with those who were being treated. Those who were matched to them, but who didn't have a bypass, but just went on the bypass diet. And they both lost the same amount of weight. Now, I don't know what their appetites were like or if there was a difference, but they basically went and lost the same amount of weight. So I mean, very curious actually to look at the fine print of studies, see if the people who didn't have the bypass were hungrier. They just starved them in lost weight or if it was, they actually cut down their diet and they actually were able to accommodate to a lower or intake. Yeah, I think it's really important. What you just said is that and prior actually prior to working with you at both Canyon Ranch and the Altshauwelna Center, I worked in a practice where we worked with surgeons who were doing gastric bypass surgery. So I saw a lot of patients who were going through the surgery and I saw a lot of the side effects and the negative side effects of the surgery as well. And what I think is what you mentioned is really so critical to understand is that when we can help people get off of this vicious cycle of hunger and eating and hunger and eating and hunger and eating, when we can help them break that cycle, they can be successful at getting to where they want to be in terms of their intake of food. So you're right, maybe at the beginning, when for that group of patients who didn't have the surgery, that first couple weeks may have been really hard of saying, okay, I'm going to really cut back on the amount of calories, the types of calories that I'm eating, the balance of my nutrients. And they might have felt really hungry for those first couple weeks, but we see this all the time. Once people get through that time, they start to feel better. They don't have that hunger anymore, that drive to constantly eat and snack and choose unhealthy foods. And then they can kind of start to be successful. The surgery prevents, makes it so you can't eat for those first few weeks. And then that just spirals into, yeah, but then of course you're dealing with all the side effects of the surgery, unfortunately. So, you know, that is an interesting thing that we see, right? Fascinating. And you've seen patients with this and you've had, I remember many patients who had struggled with this and you get their numbers dialed in and you kind of sort through everything with them and they do so much better. So, can you tell us about this patient? The 45-year-old guy was like hungry all the time, was overweight and struggling with his sort of appetite and hunger? Yeah, you know, I mean, so he came to see me and he was really trying to be healthier. I mean, he was working hard to be healthier and really frustrated that he couldn't get his weight to where he wanted it to be. And he had gained 25 pounds over the last couple of years. He was feeling hungry all the time. He didn't have the same level of vibrancy anymore. He was just feeling kind of sluggish and low energy. He, you know, we noted when we did his vitals and his physical exam that he had really gained a lot of weight around his abdomen and around his belly, right? And he was really, he was really, really frustrated with that visceral adiposity, that belly fat that's really causes a lot of inflammation in the body causes high levels of insulin and, you know, is associated with all of those negative things like heart disease and stroke and cancer. So he gained a lot of weight around his belly. His waist to hip ratio was one, which is higher than it should be. And, you know, when you look at his diet, he was trying to be healthier, but he was grabbing coffee. Drink for breakfast. You know, at lunch, he was having orange juice. He had switched that out and said, a soda sandwich and chips. You know, he did have a few beers at dinner, you know, you know, and then maybe snack on crackers and popcorn after dinner. And, and, you know, so he was trying, he felt like he was trying to make the healthier food choices, but we saw a lot of issues when we really delve deeper in terms of his diet where we needed to do some work. And we also, when we got his full history, realized, you know, that he was a snorer. So he was, you know, he was, he was snoring frequently. And, you know, we talked about how snoring can be a sign that you may have sleep apnea. I mean, there's lots of other signs too. High blood pressure, weight gain, fatigue, you know, falling asleep during the day, or when you don't want to fall asleep. So, so, but because of all this, I really encouraged him to get a sleep study. And we found out that, you know, he did end up having sleep apnea. So, but what we saw with his blood work, we saw high levels of fasting insulin. They were, they were 10. We saw a C reactive protein that marker for inflammation was really high. We saw that his, he had low levels of vitamin D and we know vitamin D is critical for, for so many things in our health, including insulin sensitivity. We saw that his omega 3 fat levels, you can do it, something called an omega quant, which looks at the amount of omega 3s in the red blood cell membrane. And we saw that his omega 3 levels were low. And we know that omega 3s are really important for resulting in, you know, helping lower inflammation in the body. We can also do some special testing of something called an organic acid testing. And we did that for him. And we saw that his mitochondria, which were, which are the powerhouse of your cells, needed a lot more support. And one of the reasons that people develop problems with, with hunger and weight gain and insulin resistance is when you with issues with their mitochondria. And we saw that we needed to really support that. He had high levels of free radicals or oxidative stress. And so there were a lot of things we needed to work on with him. One of the first things we did is we got him, his sleep apnea treated. He got a CPAP machine and he started to feel better right away. You know, patients resist this a lot, but, but you know, we see that when they, when they really do jump on board and start using that CPAP machine and it's fitted right. Many times they just feel so much better. Their energy is better. And one of the reasons, and their hunger decreases because that ghrelin decreases. Because remember we said that if you have sleep deprivation or sleep apnea, your ghrelin is going to be higher and you're just going to, you're going to just be wanting to eat and eat. So that was one of the first things we really, really helped him do. And it really was very helpful for that, that decreasing his hunger and that drive to just eat and eat. We also really supported him nutritionally with cutting way back on his carbohydrates, getting more vegetables in his diet, more nutrient dense foods. We gave him some supplements that supported his mitochondria like CoQ10 and B vitamins and alpha lipoic acid. And, you know, and he did really well, you know, I mean, with some of these simple shifts, he started to lose weight. After like six months, he got, you know, down to his ideal weight. After about four months, his weight, waist hip ratio got to 0.9, which is really where we wanted to see it. And he just started feeling better and he was having more energy and not hungry all the time. And he really understood what foods to choose. And then most importantly, from my perspective was that, you know, we just really decreased his risk of all sorts of diseases, right? Because we know that that insulin resistance pattern drives heart disease and stroke and cancer and dementia and diabetes. And, you know, so we really, you know, that was really great that we were able to intervene at this age and I think help prevent a lot of diseases for him in the future. 100%. So, you know, hunger is complicated because it's, you know, it's not, you know, we talked about a lot of the aspects of regular hunger, right? The protein you eat, the fat you eat, how much starch and sugar you eat, because those make it worse. Artificial sweeteners, whether you use substances like cannabis, for example, sleep deprivation, stress. And so even hormones or, you know, levels of insulin, which goes along with carbohydrate intake, all drive our appetite. And so if we begin to understand how to regulate our appetite, we can really have a huge impact on our metabolism and health. Why do you think people's hunger is so dysregulated? And what are the other sort of strategies from a functional medicine perspective that we can use to help people get into the place where they're feeling even and not swinging all over the place with hunger and cravings and sugar? I mean, I think the biggest reason that people are so dysregulated is from our food supply. You know, I think it's, you know, it's hijacked, as you always say, our taste buds and our drive for food and just helping people get on to, you know, getting off the ground. You know, getting off the processed foods and on to real whole foods that that natural ability for us to regulate our hunger just happens. So one of the biggest things we can all do is just stop eating things with labels on them, right? And, you know, stop eating processed food because so many things, even if, even if they're sort of marketed as being more healthy, have things in it that contribute to hunger and dysregulated hunger signals in our body. So I think that's really the first thing we should be focused on with everybody. So our diet and then sleep, right? Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. The other, like we said, people are just sleep deprived in this country. We're living this lifestyle of sleep deprivation and chronic stress. And all of that is just driving our hunger. And we're not really, you know, able to listen to our body. If we're just going, going, going, looking at our phone, you know, checking an email, rushing, eating quickly, you know, not taking the time to let our food digest and signal that we're full, you know, we're just rushing, rushing, rushing, you know, and not sleeping and not managing stress. You know, we're not paying attention to what our body naturally knows how to do. So true. So with people who are struggling with hunger and cravings, you know, I think one of the books that I really loved about this is called The Always Hungry by David Ludwig, who's a friend of ours, brilliant book. He's a Harvard professor and he's really studied the biology of hunger. And he showed that, you know, you can literally train the brain to not be hungry by regulating what you're eating, by increasing fat, protein, decrease, starts to sugar, timing, eating when you're eating, you know, not being late at night, making sure you have a little period of a fast snacking is probably the worst thing. When you go to the grocery store, most of the food is snack food, which is crazy. You know, and it's just like, I don't even go into those aisles, but it's mostly just snack food. And it's just striking to me how we've kind of gotten this culture of eating all the time and snacking and hunger and ups and downs and something that we can really manage by addressing these underlying biological systems and paying attention to the simple daily rhythms that we need to follow in order to regulate our appetite. And then, you know, I just noticed in my own biology, when I'm dysregulated, I get hungry, I get cravings, I want this and I'm eating well and I'm eating whole foods and I'm giving myself the nutrients I need. I don't feel hungry. I don't want, so suddenly, I'll be forced to get a little hungry. That's fine. Or if I'm working out a lot, I'll get a little hungry, but it's not this crazy. Oh, I want to eat, you know, a muffin. I have to have something bad. So I think there's a real science of hunger and privilege and more on this topic. I'd encourage them to read his book called Always Hungry. He's got a great cookbook that goes along with it. But, you know, this is something we see all the time, Liz. We see so many people struggling with weight and with metabolism and hunger and cravings and feel discouraged. But, you know, I've found people living within days can change quickly their biology and get rid of the craving, get rid of the hunger. And remember, there's one woman who came to one of my workshops years ago in Ultra Metabolism, I think. And we basically put people on a really simple whole foods diet. We even broth and protein shakes and lots of vegetables and good quality protein and good fats. And she was like, look, I'm never going to be able to do this. I've been craving sugar my whole life. I have to eat it. I don't know what to do. I'm really worried about it. I'm so stressed. I'm going to try it for a couple of days to see what happens. And the design of the program was really designed to regulate these hormones, to regulate the ghrelin and to regulate the insulin and to regulate the blood sugar. And the brain chemistry and within two days, she's like, I can't believe it. I don't have any cravings anymore. I don't want this. I don't want that. So she's like so happy. And I think people don't realize just how close they are to feeling good and get rid of all those cravings that are really driving their behavior. And you can't do it really without using the science of understanding all of this. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's so powerful. And people's bodies change really quickly. I mean, and they can start to feel better really quickly with just some simple changes. I agree. I love that book. Always hungry. Question mark. I recommend it to so many of my patients.
