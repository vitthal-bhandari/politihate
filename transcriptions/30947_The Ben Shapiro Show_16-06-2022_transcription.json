And we'll Joe Biden, he is facing down the prospect of a very serious recession on his watch the Federal Reserve actually jacked up the benchmark interest rates by 0.75 percentage points. That is the biggest increase since 1994. They're doing this because they see that the threat of inflation is really serious. And then over the course of the next decade, you could see stagflation if they do not get the inflation under control right now as in right now. So they are attempting to shock the market back into something resembling normality. According to CNBC, the Federal Reserve on Wednesday launched its biggest broadside yet against inflation raising benchmark interest rates three quarters of percentage point and a move that equates to the most aggressive hike since 1994. And in weeks of speculation, the rate setting federal open market committee took the level of benchmark funds rate to arrange 1.5 to 1.75 percent. That is the highest since just before the COVID pandemic began in March 2020. It's unclear whether that is going to really reset the deck here, especially because again, that is very historically low. The fact is that when Paul Volcker was jacking up the interest rates in the early 1980s, we're nearing 20 percent on the interest rates in order to ratchet down the inflation. It's unclear to me whether an overall interest rate of like 1.5 1.75 percent is really going to jack down the inflation to the extent necessary given how hot the economy is running right now. How hot inflation is running right now, which is why you've seen Jerome Powell and others suggesting this is just the first of many. The likelihood is that we are going to have to be around a 5 percent interest rate before we start to see inflation really collapse and us go back to sort of a normal rate of monetary inflation. Jerome Powell announced the Fed boost yesterday. Here he was. From the standpoint of our congressional mandate to promote maximum employment and price stability, the current picture is plain to see. The labor market is extremely tight and inflation is much too high. Against this backdrop, today, the federal open market committee raised its policy interest rate by three quarters of a percentage point and anticipates that ongoing increases in that rate will be appropriate. Okay, and Powell continued by saying that their goal is to return inflation to a 2 percent objective. I've always thought that this objective is very silly because there's a baseline notion was promoted by Milton Freeman, the Chicago School of Economics. And when you create an inflation rate of 2 percent, it sort of greases the wheels of the economy. The big problem, of course, is that if you do a 2 percent inflation rate for say 10 years, you have now depreciated the value of money by 20 percent, 2 percent times 10. So the very idea that the government should be in the business of devaluing your asset base to force you to spend is Keynesian. And I don't like that. I think that the government should really be there to basically backstop the economy in case things go wildly wrong. In case there's a major shock, exogenous shock to the system, there's a run on the banks, for example, that's what the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was originally supposed to do to make sure that the bank didn't just seize all of your assets and they would backstop that. Now, we gave the Federal Reserve basically the power to control all of the economy. And there's something deeply wrong with that. The economy was never supposed to be controlled by a bunch of guys and suits behind closed doors. In fact, that was the accusation that socialists used to make about capitalism is that it was a bunch of fat cats in a back room, smoking cigars, and deciding the future of the economy. That's not capitalism. That's more akin to socialism, a centralized economy, making decisions top down. Well, the Federal Reserve, which has been tasked with keeping unemployment low and also keeping inflation low, normally those are the jobs of policymakers, not the jobs of a bunch of central bankers. But this is what we have become now, is a case made by Muhammad El-Aryan in one of his recent books, the head of Aliance. He has said before that one of the big problems with the global economy right now is that effectively speaking, we've outsourced all policymaking, so a bunch of central banks around the world and all of them have the same sort of congenital issues you see when it came to outsourcing all of our COVID policy to the bureaucrats. When you tell the bureaucrats that they have endless purview to do exactly what they want, what you actually end up with is not a diversity of options. You end up with an echo chamber in which everybody understands that if they are the outlier, they're the ones who's likely to get clocked. So what you're seeing around the world right now is actually an increase in interest rates and an attempt to tamp down inflation. So that means we are very likely to tip into our recession. Here is Jerome Powell, however, saying that we want to return inflation to that 2% objective. The Fed's monetary policy actions are guided by our mandate to promote maximum employment and and stable prices for the American people. My colleagues and I are acutely aware that high inflation imposes significant hardship, especially on those least able to meet the higher costs of essentials like food, housing, and transportation. We are highly attentive to the risks high inflation poses to both sides of our mandate. And we're strongly committed to returning inflation to our 2% objective. Well, Jerome Powell is trying to sell you a bit with goods about how he's going to get everything under control. Well, do you not like it when people try to sell you things they don't know anything about that they can't actually handle? When it comes to auto parts, that's kind of what happens every time you go into one of those big box part auto stores. They don't know what they're talking about.

Be sure when you check out Ray Shapiro in there, how did you hear about us box? So they know that I sent you, check them out today at rockauto.com. So as I say, the current interest rates are the ones that are not going to last for very long. According to CNBC, the Fed's benchmark rate is supposed to end the year at 3.4 percent, according to the midpoint of the target range of individual members expectations. That reflects an upward revision of 1.5 percentage points from the March estimate. The committee then sees the rate rising to 3.8 percent in 2023. This, of course, is taking a serious toll on the real estate market where all of the mortgage rates are rising in tandem with the interest rates, because mortgages are becoming more expensive. Again, when the credit system begins to dry up, when it turns out that money is not as loose as it once was, what this means is that stocks are going to evaluate lower. I would expect that when it comes to the stock market, what you're going to see is another step down for the stock market. Because one of the other factors here is that you're actually starting to see the retail sales slipping according to the Associated Press. Americans trimmed their spending unexpectedly in May. I don't know what unexpected means. It's not super unexpected given the fact that eventually people are going to run out of the pandemic stimulus money that was poured into their pockets by both the Trump and the Biden administrations, and particularly by the Federal Reserve. And that when that happened, they were going to look at the prices and say, I can't afford a lot of the stuff that's happening. This is what inflation does. When you have a real wage reduction, thanks to inflation, while you end up with these people eventually figuring out that they actually can't spend that money. They need that money. Well, that's what happened last month. According to the Associated Press, Americans trimmed their spending unexpectedly in May compared with a month before, underscoring how surging inflation on daily necessities like gas is causing them to be more cautious about buying discretionary items. US retail sales slipped 0.3 percent last month down from a revised 0.7 percent increase in April. The Commerce Department said on Wednesday, a sharp decline in auto sales, largely because of higher prices and shortages of new car inventories to press that retail sales figure excluding auto's retail sales rose at 0.5 percent last month. But excluding sales from gas stations, retail sales slipped at 0.7 percent, showing how higher prices at the pump are accounting for more of shoppers overall spending. So that's actually a pretty serious drop in retail sales. 0.7 percent is actually fairly serious. And the only thing that is driving retail sales and anything remotely approaching positive territory is the fact that gas is so expensive, which again is a very, very bad thing for consumers. Sales online fell 1% as shoppers went back to physical stores. Sales at food stores rose 1.2 percent, but that's not because people are buying more food. It's because the prices are higher. Business at restaurants was up 0.7 percent as well. Again, all of that is just reflective of the inflation. But in terms of real consumption, real consumption is actually starting to go down. And what that means is that what you're likely to see is, as I say, another slip in the stock market because right now the PE ratios, the price to earnings ratios and a lot of stocks are way out of whack. That happens when you pour a lot of money into the economy because people take that money and they look in the market and they say, okay, where's the stock? Where can I put this money that it's going to earn money for me? And so they look at companies that may not have amazing earnings, but they project out five years that they're going to have earnings. And I'm just telling you something about stock projections and earnings projections from companies. Companies don't know what they're going to be earning in five years. Companies don't know what they're going to be earning next month. In the notion that companies have some sort of grand plan and that three to five years from now, their projected earnings are going to look anything remotely like what they projected. Maybe in some cases, that's true. In a lot of cases, it simply is not. If I go back and I look at the earnings plan that we put on the table for our original investors here at Daily Wire, I can tell you it was wildly wrong. And thank God, it was actually extraordinarily low for what the company actually has done. I mean, to take a quick example, when we put out our business plan, our original business plan suggested that this podcast was going to be earning a tiny fraction of what it actually earns on an annual basis. So when companies put out their earnings plan and then people jack up the price of the stock, the price of the stock compared to the earnings plan as opposed to the actual earnings today, what you end up with is a PE ratio that is wildly out of account. Well, what happens when the economy starts to sink and those earnings, the actual earnings go down? So right now, the prices are coming down because people have less money to speculate with. Okay, what happens? So that means the P&E ratios are starting to come into alignment. Right now, the earnings are here and the price is here and the price is starting to come down back toward the earnings. What happens next month when the earnings go like this, boom, when the earnings bump down? Well, now the PE ratio is back out of whack. So what's going to happen on the price? That's correct. It's going to drop. People are going to sell off that stock because they don't see the earnings potential on the stock that they are actually buying. And so what you're going to see, I would imagine, is another bump down in the stock market over the course of the next few months, all of which is very bad for the Joe Biden administration officials significantly cut their outlook for 2022 economic growth. They're now anticipating 1.7% gain in GDP. That is a massive cut that is down from 2.8% from March. The inflation projection engaged by personal consumption expenditures also rose to 5.2 this year from 4.3% through core inflation that excludes food and energy costs. Okay, the core inflation is 4.3%, which is still super duper high. All of this is really, really bad. Now, the committee is trying to claim that they are going to be able to avoid a recession by bumping the interest rate by 75 basis points. And I find that very difficult to believe. They put out a statement saying, overall economic activity appears to have picked up after edging down in the first quarter, which is weird because now we have retail sales dropping. Job gains have been robust in recent months. The unemployment rate has remained low. Inflation remains elevated reflecting supply and demand and balance is related to the pandemic, higher energy prices and broader price pressures. Actually, it's also reflecting tremendous business uncertainty about what Joe Biden is going to do in terms of regulation. One of the reason that the gas prices as high as we'll discuss in a moment is because the Biden administration continues to restrict the production of oil and gas. And even if they say we want to jack it up temporarily, what they really mean is that one year from now, we want to crack down again. Well, the problem is that investment in oil and natural gas resources has a long tail. If you invest today, that investment does not actually start to bear fruit for several years. Well, if you know that in a year, the Biden administration is going to crack down again when the oil prices drop, why would you invest money in the oil and gas industry? And you need that money in order to grease the wheels for the actual oil and gas drilling today. In other words, future projections, what an industry is going to do affect price point today. And the Biden administration keeps neglecting this because they don't understand basic economics or because they don't care about basic economics. The estimates has expressed through the committee summary of economic projections. The inflation moving sharply lower in 2023 down to 2.6% headline and 2.7% core. Those expectations are little changed from March. But again, that seems pretty optimistic given the level of increases in the interest rates that they are currently announcing. The cost of everything is going up right now from gas to groceries to vacations. Even credit card fees are now going up. Well, it's time to do something about it. If you're a homeowner, your equity is still up, like 20% since last year, that equity can be accessed as cash for the things that you need right now. You need to call American financing, get that free mortgage review I've been talking about for months at this point. They're going to look at your entire financial picture from your home lawns, your equity, even your high interest debt. They'll review all of it and they'll do everything they can to help save up to a thousand bucks a month plus tens of thousands of bucks long term. Think of the difference that can make them pick up the phone and learn more. There are a bunch of different financial options that are currently available in the market, even though the markets are going the wrong way right now. If you start soon, you could skip two payments. You might close in as fast as 10 days with money becoming tighter. Now is an excellent time to think how you could save or how you can access some extra capital called 866-721-3300.

Larry Summers, who is right about inflation and I think is going to be right about recession. He says stagflation is going to be the next step here. Here he is on CNN, the former Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton. I'd be very surprised if we didn't still have inflation at a meaningful rate a year from now. It may well come down. I think it's probably likely to come down from the 8 plus percent range that it's been at. But we're still going to have inflation for quite some time to come and we're probably going to have a slowing economy as well. So there's going to be an element of what people call stagflation. Well, all of this is wildly predictable given the policies pursued by the Biden administration and it's undermining Americans' faith that anybody is actually able to handle the economy. Which by the way might be a good thing in the same way that the undermining of the experts with regard to COVID may be a good thing because it actually allows you to take a look at the evidence and assess whether you ought to delegate your freedoms out to a bunch of bureaucrats who engage in effectively single factor analysis, the worst form of all political analysis. We look at one thing and the one thing is the thing that matters and you ignore all of the other extraneous issues. That creates really bad policy. If you just look at one thing in life and the one thing in life is the prison through which you've everything you're likely to miss. Pretty much all the perspective in life. This is what happens when you have bureaucrats who are dedicated to acronym agencies that only focus on this tree. They never look at the forest. They just look at this tree. More Americans are focused on the forest because there are many aspects of their lives and economic aspect of their lives. Just what they do in their job. There's how they spend. There's where they send their kids to school. But if you are the person who's in charge of the Federal Reserve, all you care about is the things you've been tasked with, right? The interest rate and the unemployment rate. That's it. And you're only going to take into account those few factors. That's not enough. Which is why again, as I've said before, the Hayekian point of view, the FA Hayek point of view, which that the collectivized knowledge of the world is much, much larger than any specific knowledge even by an expert in a particular industry. It rings true. And it's why markets are supposed to be left to their own devices. If you actually wish to see supply and demand meet their actual level in the real world. Americans faith in these institutions has been undermined by their absolute incompetence. According to the Washington Post, the Federal Reserve's missteps in waiting too long to tackle the greatest run up in prices in four decades has shaken trust across markets and the American public. That it is up to the task of curbing inflation. On the eve of a high stakes Fed policy announcement, investors, economists, policymakers were on edge over how sharply the Fed would raise interest rates to deal with inflation, which in a new peak in May. And this is all very disturbing to me. That we're all supposed to sit around and wonder whether we have enough money for our groceries next week based on what your own pal and his buddies have to say. That's not the way any functional economy should work is that a couple of guys in rooms somewhere decide whether you get to pay for your groceries next week. Even more concerning our new signs that families have lost faith in the Fed's policies, consumer sentiments in June, saying to a low not seen since the 1980 recession, according to a University of Michigan survey, a poll by the Washington Post and George Mason University's Char School of Policy and Government found that most Americans expect inflation to worsen in our country. And they're adjusting their spending habits, a mindset that can make the surge in prices even worse. Fed policy makers were already under enormous pressure to slash inflation without inviting disaster for the recovery or spring a new round of job losses. Now, the Fed is in need of more fraud position. One that goes beyond monetary policy and said targets the Fed's most essential tool of all its credibility. Again, if you don't trust the Fed to get things under control, then when the Fed announces interest rate increases or falls, that is going to start to become disconnected from how people treat the market. Well, the Biden administration's lack of sure footedness in this area, because again, they have an agenda and they're going to ram that agenda through regardless of whether it actually hurts or harms or helps Americans doesn't matter to them. You know, that commitment to an ideological agenda, Uber, Alice, above all else, is just, it's obvious on its face. So Brian Deese, White House economic advisor yesterday, for example, he was saying, we don't need to lower corporate tax rates to get people to invest in the United States. So then what are you going to do to get people to invest in the United States? Exactly. More regulations? Are you subsidies? What are we talking about here? You don't need to lower the corporate tax rate anymore. It's already a historically low rates. In fact, what we need to do is reform the corporate tax system to reduce incentives for companies to just take profits and productions and move it overseas. What we need to do is we need to have a more stable corporate tax system and incentives to invest here in the United States. Okay. So in other words, he's going to pay a bunch of green companies taxpayer cash to come here, but we're not going to lower the corporate tax rates. Instead, we should increase them. Again, all this is disconnected from reality. And he doesn't stop there. My favorite part of this particular interview is when Brian Deese is asked specifically about predictions regarding the economy and inflation. He's like, we're not going to make any predictions. Well, he should be able to make like some. I mean, is net what policy is about is trying to foresee the consequences of the policy. Here's Brian Deese for swearing all predictions. We know there's a lot of global uncertainty out there. We know that the price of oil and the price of gas at the pump are being affected by Putin's brutal war in Ukraine. But what we also know is if we take the kinds of steps that we're talking about, we will get to that process quickly more quickly. We will What is quickly? Can you define quickly? Any give me just a ballpark. Like, you know, we're looking at a six month situation with the kind of numbers we're in right now or we're looking at two years. As Larry Cardlow just said that he estimates. Look, there's a lot of people who are out there who are in the predicting business. We are in the building business. We are in the business of trying to put policies in place that will actually accelerate that outcome. Well, I mean, if you are if you're actually in the building business, like I've worked with contractors before, they're always wrong, by the way. But at least you need an estimate as to when they're going to finish their work. If they say to you, you know what, we're going to start this project. We have no idea. We're going to finish. No clue. And you're like, well, can you give me a range? Are we talking about like three months? Or are we talking about 10 years? Like, well, you know, no, no prediction. We're not in the prediction business. We need your money. I promise we'll do the work, maybe. But we'll get back to you on that. Are you going to hire that person? All right. Well, I'm particularly not going to hire this administration when they have no clue how to bring the price of gas down. And again, this is very easy. You allow refineries to come back online, you relieve environmental regulations. You stop yelling at the oil companies. That is how you do this. You stop alienating oil producers like the Saudis, which is what Joe Biden has done for a year and a half to no effect, by the way, except to strengthen the Iranians and jack up your oil prices. This administration, when it comes to the oil and gas issue, this is a perfect example of how ideology dominates pragmatism from this administration. It really is amazing. So Korean Jean Pierre, the absolutely incompetent press secretary for the president of the United States, she is now engaging in the Joe Biden's favorite game. So Joe Biden has this game. He's been playing it for years, where if you don't do what he wants you to do, it's because you're unpatriotic. I mean, he used to do this when he was vice president. He'd say, big corporations need to pay more. Petri is his man. Love the flag, man. Hire Jackson or more. Like, there's been a hallmark of the Joe Biden ridiculous stick for decades at this point. So now Korean Jean Pierre is going to channel Joe Biden. She says it's unpatriotic for oil and gas companies not to produce more gas. What do you think that they're doing? You think they're there being like, you know what, we're sitting in the back room and we're going to not pump gas because we're really or is it that you have restricted supply? Like now would be a great time to pump more gas. You know why? Because the prices are super high. Price are not going to be this high again, you imagine in a couple of years. So now's an excellent time to pick up all the profits on the table. This is what supply and demand normally do. But she's suggesting, of course, that it's just about lack of patriotism. First of all, I'm not going to hear about lack of patriotism from an administration that is more comfortable putting a gay pride flag on an American embassy overseas than it is on putting an American flag on American embassy overseas. We have to add a moment, but here's Korean Jean Pierre. We say it as a patriotic duty as we're as we've talked about, there's war happening right now in Ukraine that was caused by caused by Russia, which is why we're seeing these hikes and gas prices, especially since Russia has amassed, started amassing troops on the border. We saw a we've seen a $2 increase of gas prices. So we know where to put the blame on the war, but oil companies, they have oil refineries, they have responsibility to what they have been doing is taking advantage of the war. Unbelievable. It's unbelievable. So they're on their own put inside the oil companies. Nailed it. Well, if this sort of stupidity puts you in mind of death, which, you know, for many of us, it does. It's time to think about doing something productive with that thought right now. Why don't you write a will? You need one. If you're responsible human, don't let the state decide what happens to all the stuff you leave behind. Aside from protecting your assets, your home, your savings, your car, a will gives you the power to say, who's going to raise your kids? If something God forbid happens to you and your spouse. I have a will, my wife has a will. Without a will, guess who decides? The state. Yeah, those guys. I don't know about you, but I'm not interested in doing that, which is why I have a will. A will also protects the living. Advanced directives ensure your medical decisions are honored when you're unable to see them through. It allows you to point to trusted friend or family member, your power of attorney. And it's not hard because of Epic will.

I tell you, she's gonna yell at people out being on patriotic and blame people and blame Putin, but they have no plan. So, Korean chomp here was specifically asked, are you going to help subsidize new refineries? Right? You keep talking about lack of refinery capacity. You keep telling all of the oil companies. They need to jack up the amount of oil that they are refining into gas. Right? This is what you say. So, how about it? You know, we leave regulations on the refineries because we haven't built a new refinery in this country for a couple of decades minimum. Here's Korean chomp here being like, nah, not so much. The country's refineries are aging. A major refinery really hasn't been built in this country since the late 1970s. If one were to be proposed with a presence, support the construction of a new refinery or a posting. That what I've not seen any of that reporting. And that is not something that I can confirm from the podium at this time. Yeah, of course you can. Of course you can. By the way, then she was asked, okay, what happens if a hurricane hits the Gulf considering their bunch of our fineries are in the Gulf of Mexico area? And she's like, well, we don't really have a plan for that. I mean, it's not like who could predict such a thing? Everyone? I mean, the question is being asked right now, isn't it? Oil analysts, they say that one thing we all want to be concerned about is the prospect of a hurricane hitting refineries on the Gulf Coast. Are you aware of any steps the administration is taking now to gird against that? I don't have anything on a hurricane at this moment. Like what we're going to do to take steps on hurricane and oil refinery. I'm happy to check in with the team and get back to you to see if there is a plan in place. But I don't have anything for you at this time. Interesting. So there's no plan on like anything that would actually protect our current oil production or expand our oil production. The reason for that, by the way, is because they don't want to expand our oil production. This is all ideological Jennifer Granholm, the energy secretary, who was asked about all this. And she's got nothing. Ultimately, America will be most secure when we can rely upon our own clean domestic production of energy. That's the problem for these companies. These companies are saying, you know, you're asking me to do more now and invest more now when in fact, five or 10 years from now, we don't think that demand will be there. And the administration doesn't even necessarily want it to be there. I'm John. We really want to see us move to clean energy, but we also need to see this increase right now. And we are asking the oil and gas companies as well to diversify. I mean, this is crazy. So she's saying we want to crack down on the production of oil and natural gas, but please produce more of it right now. And then, of course, our final solution. And she tells MSNBC, of course, of course, is more green energy. The price of gas right now is five bucks a gallon. That's the national average right now. And you're talking about strapping windmills at the top of your car or something. Go for it, lady. Ultimately, the solution to make us energy secure, to make the Baltic states energy secure, to make the entire world energy security is to move to clean energy. No country has ever been held hostage to access to the sun or to access to the wind. And ultimately, those are the price volatility continues to, at least on clean energy, there's no volatility. It continues to drop. We're not under the thumb of petro dictators. And ultimately, that is the solution. They can't hold us hostage. If we're getting our energy from the sun or from the wind, I have some news for Jennifer Granholm. There are many nations on earth that are still dependent on the sun and the wind for energy. We call those third world undeveloped nations. It's bad to live there. Carbon-based fossil fuels are by far more efficient than the current green forms of energy that she is talking about, the supposed clean forms of energy that she is talking about, way more efficient. It's just, it's amazing. It's amazing. But this administration is fully committed to its own ideology and not to actually helping most Americans, which is why the Biden administration's response to inflation that is approaching double digits and an incipient recession. And a war in Ukraine that now seems to be turning the wrong way. Their response is, let's trans the kids. I'm not kidding. That's what they announced yesterday. This is going to be their big cultural response is we can't win on the economy. We tried gun control. It didn't go anywhere. We've tried a bunch of stuff. So where we're going to put all of our chips in this poker game and take all of them, slide them in the middle on trans the kids, which is one hell of a move by this administration. I mean, truly amazing. When you've got the 20 year old wokesters from Twitter running your administration, things are likely to go wrong for your left, or only speaking, according to the Agnes France press, the AFP, Biden fires culture war salvel with big LGB TQ plus minus divided by sign ampersand celebration. By the way, apparently, I'm not the only person who has trouble with the ever expanding acronym Joe Biden yesterday. He was having the celebration at the White House and he was completely unable to get through the acronym. And this is the first time I've ever been sympathetic to Joe Biden's brain not working properly. We're also proud to have signed an executive order in my first day in office to combat discrimination against LGBTQ L. I excuse me, plus Americans in housing and health care and education and employment, financial service and the criminal justice system. We're proud to sign discrimination guidelines. LGBTQ BL C key chip. BL I do love a good sandwich. BL T. Delicious. By the way, Joe Biden also celebrated this LGBTQ thing by this giant event at the White House by wandering around. So that that was encouraging as well. This was Joe Biden. I mean, you can see he's like packing up after the speech. And once again, old man wanders around. Somebody needs to help him. Somebody direct him. Come on, guys. Where's the support staff? Areas looking vaguely into the distance. No one knows what's going on. He's just wandering. They're going to find him on a street corner somewhere in Washington, D.C. And after issuing some sort of amber alert for his whereabouts, the president of the United States. So yesterday he announces the pride is back at the White House. Mm. You know, it's not back in the White House. Anything resembling decent policy or the protection of innocent children. Here is the president of the United States. Last year, we hosted this event and the message is simple. Pride is back at the White House. Today, one, this has been the most pro equality administration in history led by guys like Pete Buttigieg. And so many others. I think we have more LGBTQ plus people than any administration or every administration combined. No, I really mean. Well, that that is an accomplishment to have the most people who are not heterosexual than any administration ever. And really, congratulations to the United States. This is what a place in the future of the United States is success. And how many people of alternative sexual identities work in the White House? Not on whether you can actually produce good policy, but how many of you wish to sleep with people who are not of the opposite sex exclusively? That would be, that would be, I think, the most important potential here. Really, really important stuff from the Biden. But it wasn't just an event celebrating tolerance and diversity over at the White House. It was actually the issue of an executive order. Or as the White House puts it, a historic executive order advancing LGBTQ plus I plus minus divided by time to S M N. Empersand command send equality during Pride Month. And now this is fairly incredible what this administration is now doing because the policies they are now undertaking. Amount to the federal subsidization of the transing of your child. That is what these policies now amount to. They can't solve the economy. They can't figure out gas prices. But they can make clear that you as a parent should have no say when your five year old decides that he is a she and the school decides to start giving hormone treatment. And if you bring your kid to a therapist and the therapist says, you know what we might want to do some waitful watching and see if this dissists on its own, which happens for the vast majority of kids. Well, maybe that therapist is now criminally liable. I'm not kidding. This is something the administration is trying to do. They are now calling it conversion therapy. If you say that a girl is a girl, this is now conversion therapy. Whereas it is gender affirming therapy. If you say that a girl who believes that she is a boy is a boy. This is full reversal of the English language. See, normally you might think it was gender affirming therapy to say that a girl is a girl. You are affirming the gender of the girl in front of you. But according to this administration, that is conversion therapy because you are converting a girl who thinks she is a boy back into a girl. Whereas gender affirming therapy would be to tell the girl that she actually is a boy. That's affirming her gender. Now, for all this is very confusing and nonsensical. That's because it's completely illogical, propagandistic garbage that harms children. But this administration is four square behind it. So here is what the White House released. President Biden believes no one should face discrimination because of who they are or whom they love. This kind of bumper sticker slogan earring is so unbelievably reductive. First of all, Joe Biden clearly believes that people should face discrimination because of quote unquote who they are depends on who they are. And then everyone in America believes that some people, if their actions are reflective of who they are, there are some people who we are not particularly tolerant of. And this runs the gamut. This is what criminal law is all about. That's not mean we should discriminate against gay people, for example. But that statement is just far too broad. Or whom they love. There are a lot of people who love people they should not love. OK, I'm not talking here about gay and lesbian people. I'm not talking about adults. But there are certain activities in America that we still consider criminal with regard to these arguments that are just too broad. They're just bumper sticker slogans. Since President Biden took office, he has championed the rights of LGBTQ plus minus divided by sign Americans and people around the world accelerating the march toward full equality. As president, he's visiting Saudi Arabia today, by the way, as President Biden said during his first joint address to Congress, the president has the back of LGBTQ plus people around this country. That is why he's taking these bold actions today to mark pride month. Ah, the greatest, most holy month. It's like advent. It's like American advent pride month. President Biden will sign an executive order advancing equality. So what exactly is he going to do? He's going to address discriminatory legislative attacks against LGBTQ plus I minus divided by sign children and families directing key agencies to protect families and children. Preventing so-called conversion therapy with a historic initiative to protect children from the harmful practice, safeguarding health care and programs designed to prevent youth suicide, supporting LGBTQ plus one of the children and launching new initiatives to protect foster youth. So what exactly is he proposing? This is again from directly from the White House. Now I'm making it up. This is their wording. Over 300 anti LGBTQ plus minus divided by sign laws have been introduced in state legislatures over the past year. Many of them specifically target trans, gender, children and their parents by banning access to medical care or support at school. Okay, what those law, what those laws actually do is say before you start feeding hormones to my kid, you have to get my permission. Also, you should not be teaching about gender fluidity to three year olds and five year olds and seven year olds. Also, you should not be carving up teenagers. You shouldn't be cutting the healthy breasts off of young girls who are having a mental breakdown. You should not do this. This is a bad policy. And that's what those laws say. Joe Biden opposes those laws. President Biden is quote addressing these harmful hateful and discriminatory attacks head on, not only by speaking up from America's families, by taking actions as stand up to bullies targeting LGBTQ plus I minus people. First of all, you have to admire the goal of people who suggest that the complete destruction of gender. The the touting of absolute radical gender theory lies to children somehow is about protecting kids. The absolute unmitigated arrogance and gall of these people to wreck the lives of tens of thousands of not hundreds of thousands of kids across the country in pursuit of their gender widget garbage. It's truly an amazing thing. They're out there to harm kids. But no, but we're here to help the kids. It's all not helping the kids bull. That is that is untrue to help support impacted families. President Biden is charging the DHS DHS, the Health and Human Services Department with protecting all of these children and families from attacks on their access. To healthcare and has instructed HHS to release new sample policies for states on how to expand access to comprehensive healthcare for LGBTQ plus I minus patients. The president is also directing the Department of Education with addressing the impacts of state laws that target these students and has charged the Department with releasing a sample school policy for achieving full inclusion for LGBTQI plus students. What does this actually mean in practice? It means they're going to try to withdraw federal funding from any school that does not allow a boy to go into the girls bathroom. That they are going to try to connect federal funding to schools not telling parents about children attempting to be socially transitioned at school. That is what this administration is going to do and it doesn't stop there. There's much, much more to come. So you you're worried about whether you can put food on the table tonight? Well, the president is also laser focused on whether your five year old boy is actually a girl and what he can do to make sure that you have no say in the matter. Now, if all of this makes you think, man, I just want to crawl in a hole and die because this administration is just a disaster. Before you do that, get life insurance.

Again, laser focused on the things that matter to American families, like whether we can cut the healthy breast off your 15 year old girl. Quote, addressing conversion therapy as a candidate, President Biden pledged to help and so called conversion therapy, a discredited and dangerous practice that seeks to suppress or change the sexual orientation or gender identity of LGBT QI plus people. Okay, so first of all, when you think conversion therapy, this is what the left loves to do. They like to take terms and actually have a meaning. And then they broaden that meaning to include a bunch of things that are not the original term. And then they try to go after it. Okay, so conversion therapy originally meant, and this is what you're thinking of when I say the words conversion therapy, somebody's strapping electrodes to kids who they might be gay. And then trying to essentially create a Pavlovian response that is anti gay. Right, that is what when people think conversion therapy, that's what they think. They think electro shock that is being applied to gay kids. That is not what this administration is talking about. They're talking about a kid comes in and is sexually confused. And the pastor or the psychologist or the psychiatrist talks to them about that without saying clearly you're gay and we should just celebrate or clearly you're a member of the opposite gender. Yeah, like that one is totally insane. So if a child comes in and says, I'm a member of the opposite gender and the therapist says, you know what, you clearly have a biological sex. Let's talk about why you're feeling misaligned. And maybe we'll wait, maybe we'll see if maybe these feelings to assist or maybe we'll talk about what you can do to live comfortably inside your own body without you know, lapping off body parts, reconstructing genitals that don't properly function and pumping you full of hormones that may shorten your lifespan and or give you osteoporosis. If you do that, if you say that as a psychologist, Joe Biden says that you are now engaging in conversion therapy. Today, according to the White House, President Biden is using his executive authority to launch an initiative to protect children across America. It protects kids to prevent them from getting the medical care that they seek and that parents seek and crack down on this harmful practice, which every major medical association in the United States has condemned. Well, actually, that's not true. Many medical associations have condemned traditional conversion therapy because it's bad and ineffective and immoral. But that is not the kind of conversion therapy that you are talking about, again, you've broadened out the term children who are exposed to so called conversion therapy face higher rates of attempted suicide and trauma. Again, the data that he is attempting to cite here, no footnotes, I've noticed numerous states across the country have already passed bipartisan laws to prevent exposure to so called conversion therapy with Republican and Democratic governors signing state bans on conversion therapy in law. Yet despite these efforts, many people in the United States and around the world are still subjected to this practice. Again, bans have been signed with regard to electrifying kids. However, bans typically are a bad idea when you are talking about a kid questioning their sexual orientation or gender identity and someone talking to them about it without immediately affirming everything that the kid believes. President Biden is now charging HHS with leading an initiative to reduce the risk of youth exposure to this dangerous practice. HHS will explore guidance to clarify that federally funded programs cannot offer so-called conversion therapy. Well, first of all, like, we're federally funded programs regularly offering traditional electro-degenerative conversion therapy that I miss. President Biden is also encouraging the FTC to consider whether the practice constitutes an unfair or deceptive act or practice and whether to issue consumer warnings or notices. He's directing the secretaries of state, treasury, and HHS to develop an action plan to promote an end to so-called conversion therapy around the world and ensure that US foreign assistance dollars do not fund the practice. So yes, to funding abortion all over the world. No, to funding psychologists overseas or dealing with kids who are gender confused without immediately declaring they're a member of the opposite gender and it's time to chop off a really, really strong stuff here from the Biden administration. You know, standing up for the things that matter for not only children here, but children around the world. The sort of NatCon, the nationalist conservative critique of the of the liberal governance of the United States is that basically it used to be that when America would drop a bomb on a foreign nation and have an American flag on it, now what the left is basically done is if they stick a gay pride flag on the bomb, it'll drop the same bomb, but declare it virtuous. And it's hard to see where the meme is particularly wrong when it comes to Joe Biden at this point. So what else is he doing? Because of discrimination and bullying, nearly half of LGBTQI plus youth seriously considered suicide last year. Again, a lie. Okay, the idea that the high suicidal ideation rate among kids of alternative sexual identity and gender ideology that this suicide rate is driven primarily by bullying and discrimination. It's a lie. The data do not back this up in the most tolerant areas of the country where by the way, the the rates of identification in this broader rubric are now extraordinarily high, right? They are centralized in very specific locations with very specific ideologies. The suicidal ideation rates remain incredibly high because as it turned out, certain types of identification and certain types of activity are highly associated with suicidal ideation, regardless as to whether mom and dad give you the thumbs up or the thumbs down. LGBTQI plus people of all ages says the Biden administration also face significant barriers to accessing healthcare and health disparities to safeguard access to healthcare for LGBTQ plus I minus patients and address the LGBTQI plus youth help mental health crisis. President Biden is taking is charging HHS with taking steps to address the barriers and exclusionary policies that individuals and families face in accessing quality, affordable comprehensive healthcare, including mental health care, reproductive healthcare, and HIV prevention and treatment. The president's order changes charges HHS to work with states to promote expanded access to gender affirming care. That's right. Now, the federal government is going to be subsidizing your state to give your kids a bunch of cross sex hormones. Excited? Joe Biden is. I mean, let's be real. He's not really excited about this. He doesn't know what's going on. He's got a bunch of idiot interns from well as Lee who have figured out how to militarize the American government on behalf of their radical gender ideology. And he's asleep in the back room after eating a bowl of cream of wheat. That's what's actually going on here. You think Joe Biden is sitting here writing these policies? He ain't. He didn't even know what's going on. It also charges HHS to help prevent LGBTQI suicide by expanding youth access to suicide prevention resources. Well, you know, one of the reasons why perhaps we have higher suicidal ideation rates across young people in the United States is the promotion of this ideology. Maybe that is one of the reasons why it's very weird as the ID of LGBTQ plus rises in society. Look at that suicidal ideation rate. It's going up. Wow, that's amazing. So you would imagine that it was going down because as more people come out and as tolerant advances, you would expect the suicidal ideation rate to come down and cut wrong. It turns out that they are both rising in tandem, which suggests an association, does it not? But don't worry, Joe Biden has even more. He says that children and families from LGBTQI plus groups deserve the same dignity and respect as all American families, but they continue to face significant barriers and discrimination wrong death centers. For LGBTQI, plus young people, family rejection can lead to disproportionately rates of homelessness and over representation in foster care, etc, etc, etc. It just goes on and on. He's doing more about making sure that your kids are a member of a sexual minority than he is making sure that you are not paying $5 for gasoline. That is for sure. So he also went after specifically Florida and Rhonda Santis, of course, and this, of course, is the most important thing because Democrats think they're going to win on the basis of this. Okay, final note here, final note. The Democrats, when they claim that their goal is not to mainstream this stuff into the minds of kids, just understand that along. It absolutely is. They openly say it. It is not just about tolerating people who have a genetic predisposition toward particular activity. It is not just about making life easier for those people. It is about promoting an agenda and clearly doing so, which is why it is not the world's most tremendous shock that the Michigan Attorney General, this is the quote of the day, the Michigan Attorney General apparently said, and I am not kidding. This is the thing this person said, quote, drag queens make everything better. Hey, here we go. Her name is Dana Nestle. She was speaking at a civil rights conference in Lansing. And here is what she had to say. And you know what I'm saying? That was really not a real session. I think it's a drag queen for every school. That is all that it's been going. A drag queen for every school. Ah, a chicken in every pot, a car in every garage, a drag queen in every school. Well, at least they're saying the quiet part out loud now. At least we know what the actual agenda is. And that is recruiting your children into a cult of expressive individualism that is going to wreck their life and also ruin the future of America. Good job, everyone. Seriously, a drag queen in every school. This is what we should, you know, we've got some pretty serious educational issues in America. Like for the, for example, the fact that we have massive educational gaps in math and science between the races. And we have schools that are completely failing on every score. And we had people who were completely out of school for a full year and are now a year behind. And kids can't read competitively with their peers in other countries and they can't write competitively with their peers in other countries. We have massive educational problems here in the United States of an entire generation of people who have been informed that the United States is congenitally evil and unfixable. You know, we have a lot of problems, but all of that can be fixed by a drag queen in every school. A drag queen in every school. This is what the Democrats are focused on like a laser beam. According to the federalist, K through 12 schools must allow boys into girls private areas now to obtain federal funds for lunches at breakfast and snacks. That's what the Biden administration announced this month. A U.S. Department of Education spokesman told the federalist the Biden administration press releases from several agencies announcing his policy will be followed by formal rulemaking in June. So you want to feed your kids? You got to make sure that Bobby goes into James bathroom. Really important. John L. Susser, executive director of the Indiana Non-Public Education Association said via phone quote, it seems to be playing politics with feeding poor kids, which is really unfortunate because of the school feels they cannot participate because it's in conflict with their mission or values. If religion exemption is not granted, you're taking away a program that's feeding low income kids. And by the way, speaking of taking away educational opportunities for kids, speaking of destroying religious institutions, I have been proclaiming for a while that the agenda of the left is to completely destroy educational institutions of religious bent and traditional values in this country. And now it is perfectly clear that this is what the left seeks to do. The most obvious example of this is something happening at the Shiva University. So the Shiva University is the largest modern Orthodox institution, educational institution in the United States. It is home to tens of thousands of Orthodox Jewish students. It is an Orthodox Jew as the name might suggest. Yeshiva University is an Orthodox Jewish institution, which means that it follows basic black letter Jewish law, meaning that it is not in favor of homosexual activity, because you know the Bible and stuff. Well, now a New York court has ruled that Yeshiva University must host an LGBTQ plus club on campus must. It is a an openly religious institution with the name Yeshiva in the name half of the university that the slogan of the of the university by the way is Torah Ummada, which means Torah and secular studies. Okay, Torah Ummada was meant to be a rubric for a broader integration of secular knowledge like science and math and literature with Talmudic studies. This is what Yeshiva University was dedicated to. Well, now a New York court has said you cannot be a religious institution that does education in the state of New York. You can't. This is literally what they said. Judge Lynne Kotler ruled on Tuesday according to the Jerusalem Post that why you as a non-religious organization is subject to New York City human rights law. Now you might say to yourself, wait a second, a non-religious organization isn't it called? Yeshiva University, wrong, wrong. You see it's an educational institution that does religion kind of. This is what they are saying now is what a this is what a court just ruled. That is the New York County Supreme Court. They directed it to immediately grant plaintiff why you pride alliance the full equal accommodations advantages facilities and privileges afforded to all other student groups at Yeshiva University. So presumably you now have to have a Christian alliance at Yeshiva University. And presumably you have to have a full on Orthodox Jewish alliance any sort of Muslim or Christian university in New York City. Because after all, listen, they want the, they want you to be left alone, right? All they want to see left, well, actually no. Actually, what they want is for you to reflect all of their views and destroy your own value system in the process. And if you oppose them, they will destroy you. In the decision, the judge determined Yeshiva University is not a religious corporation. It's called Yeshiva University, you dumbass. In addition, she ordered the defendants, why you University president Ari Berman be quote permanently restrained from continuing their refusal to officially recognize the why you pride alliance as a student organization because of the member's sexual orientation or gender and or why you pride alliance's status mission and or activities on behalf of LGBTQ students. In 2020, why you wrote a paper titled fostering an inclusive community on the issue of LGBTQ people in its institution. Yeshiva University is wholly committed to and guided by Halacha, which is Jewish law and to our values, the paper began. These direct our every effort in establishing a care and campus community that is supportive of its members. In the document, why you said that a team of administrators, psychologists and rabbis spent four months meeting with individual students and alumni, and then they announced steps that they would take to address the concerns. And they talked about increased support for students who have raised concerns regarding sexual orientation or gender identity or ensuring there's a clinician on staff with specific LGBTQ plus experience. And the matter, the none of this matters. Because a religious institution is no longer religious institution, according to the courts of New York. Why you as a private university, by the way, it is not a public university. It has four campuses in New York City. So, this is the agenda of the left is never tolerance. The agenda of the left is domination is just domination and they wish to extend this domination to younger and younger kids, not just colleges, not just adulthood to younger and younger kids, which is why the propaganda association, the world professional association for transgender health, which is a wild propagandistic organization, said that they have now changed the recommended minimum age for starting gender transition isn't that exciting that they're moving it down, ever, ever down. So now they say hormones should be started at age 14. 14 year olds, we should be giving young 14 year old boys cross sex hormones. Absolutely. Why not? They can't consent to sex. They can't have a cigarette. They can't have a drink. They can't buy a gun, but they can start the process of transition. Boys can start the process of becoming sterile and cutting off their genitalia. And girls can start the process of sterilizing themselves and cutting off their breasts. It's all very, very exciting. And if they're really lucky, maybe they can carve a piece of their own body off and form it into a fake penis and sew it onto them. Wow. All the opportunities available to these kids, aren't you? Just don't you just feel like so many opportunities were foreclosed from you when you were a kid when mom and dad were like, nope. Seems like you got a penis, you're a boy. Those bigots know all of human history and all mammalian biology and all. So much bigotry in the real world. I'm so glad that W. Path is here to change all of that. So now they say that some surgeries should be done at age 15 or maybe 17 a year or so earlier than previous guidance. The group acknowledged that it's potential risk, but said it's unethical and harmful to withhold early treatment, which of course makes sense because they believe that biology is an imposition on your subjective sense of self. Biology itself, reality, is an imposition on you. This is the perfectly predictable result of what I've called over and over in the words of Robert Bella, expressive individualism. When you believe the only thing that matters is your feeling on the inside, everything that inhibits your feeling on the inside is opposition to you. That includes the real world and includes your parents. It includes your society and includes your community, includes roles, rules and science. All of those things are completely secondary to what you feel on the inside. And that feeling that begins when you're a kid, that begins as early because we all have feelings, don't we? And that's the important thing. The association provided the associate, the associate, oppressed with an advanced copy of its update ahead of publication in a medical journal. I mean, just, you know, you can find a medical journal now to basically pre-print anything. The update is based on expert opinion and review of scientific evidence on the benefits and harms of transgender medical treatment and teens, whose gender identity doesn't match the sign, the sex they were assigned at birth, the group says, such evidence is limited, but it has grown in the last decade. Oh, is that? Oh, no, actually, it hasn't. There are no good longitudinal studies that demonstrate a radical reduction in suicidal ideation among kids. And again, the notion that reduction of suicidal ideation requires that we pretend that boys can be girls. That has some rather large societal costs. Does it not particularly when you indoctrinate all kids with this idea? But after all, if there's one thing that we have learned over the past few years, it's that science is really what matters to the left. They care deeply about science, which is why they're still telling you that you need to give a COVID shot to your baby. This is their new thing. They're saying that COVID shots, they're all excited. All the FDA advisors are endorsing first COVID-19 shots for kids under five. Now, you might say to yourself, hold up a second. Isn't it true that a vanishingly small ranging on the non-existent number of small children have died from COVID alone, like without pre-existing conditions? Isn't it true that the death rates for children verge on the non-existent? Yes, you're right about that. That is true. But you should still get the shot. It's very important that you get the shot. You should get the job because after all, it's going to prevent transmission of the disease from, well, if I can do that, and they should get the shot because it'll prevent them from, well, I mean, they weren't going to die anyway. And also, there have been some really good long-term studies on the effects of these vaccines on, well, actually, not really. But it was unanimous. The FDA says, the FDA advisory board, they say it's all good to go for your six-month-old to pump that kid full of that COVID vaccine. The outside experts voted unanimously. The benefits of the shots outweigh any risks for children under five. That's roughly 18 million youngsters. They're the last age group in the United States without access to COVID-19 vaccines. Many parents have been anxious to protect their small children because they've been lied to by the media. And one of the things that I think has been so encouraging throughout this entire pandemic is the way that we have followed the science, right? We still have Dr. Anthony Fauci out there saying that it's time to get your sixth and seventh booster. Sadly, Dr. Fauci tested positive for COVID, which he did all the right things. Dr. Fauci, not only was the great proselytizer on behalf of not just the original vaccines, I like the original vaccines, or the booster, which again, useful for people, or particularly the risk people who are older, people have preexisting conditions. But Anthony Fauci has basically made zero COVID his goal. But in his own personage, he was unable to prevent the transmission of COVID. According to the New York Times, Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's top medical advisor for the coronavirus pandemic has tested positive for the virus and is experiencing mild symptoms. The National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases said on Wednesday, he was on positive on a rapid antigen test. He was fully vaxxed against the virus. He had been boosted twice, which again, the vaccine prevents serious illness and death. It does. That's what the stats show. It does not prevent transmission. Age of done. And not with regard to Amacron, not really with regard to Delta, he's currently taking Pax Livid, the Pfizer Antiviral Therapy authorized by the FDA for treatment of COVID-19. This was the first positive test for Anthony Fauci at age 81. But says the New York Times he's hardly the only big name sufferer. Again, you're gonna get, you're gonna get Amacron. You just are everyone's because it's now effectively like the flu or the common cold. You're going to get it. Now you can take preventative measures, spread yourself from dying from all this. But it's just a reminder that all of the lies that you were sold over the last couple of years that if you took the vaccine, it was going to prevent transmission. That's why if you were young and healthy, you had to take it. It was important. You were going to stop grandma from getting it. Well, that wasn't true. It wasn't true. Now, that doesn't mean that you shouldn't have taken the vaccine. I took the vaccine. I was double vaxxed, but I'm not boosted. The reason I was not boosted is because I did not need a booster because I now had vaccinunity. And that meant that when I actually got Amacron, which I'm fairly certain I had a few months ago, is my kids had it. That when I got Amacron, that it was pretty mild. It was probably the 15th worst flu I've ever had, maybe. But again, the idea here is that when it comes to the science, these are the experts. And it's always good to look to our neighbors to the north to see how the left would be if they had full control of everything. Not only have they abolished the right to self-defense in Canada, now they're talking about how full vaccination means three shots, not two. Although two doses still still protects significantly well against severe disease and death, two doses are not enough now to protect against infection and transmission. And that is why we are transitioning now to an up to date vaccination definition of what it means to be adequately protected against COVID-19. Fully protected with two doses, doesn't work anymore. Okay, well, actually, as it turns out, according to Anthony Foucher, neither does two doses plus two boosters if you're talking about prevention of transmission. But again, we should trust the science because when they say it's time to chop the healthy body parts off of small children, well, you know, they are the scientists. Just like the Federal Reserve, they were the experts. The experts, you should always trust them because they're never wrong except for apparently all the damn time.

Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Biden administration celebrates Pride Month with executive orders meant to ensure that more children are drugged and castrated. Also, protesters interrupt a drag queen story hour and are now being investigated for a hate crime because of it, but a hate crime against who. And Texas lawmakers sent a letter to the White House asking for an official legal definition of the word woman. Good question. Based on my experience, they're not going to get one though. Ibram Kendi has a new book out meant to indoctrinate more children into the CRT cult. In our daily cancellation, George Washington University changes its colonial's moniker for reasons that make no sense whatsoever. We'll talk about all that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show."
