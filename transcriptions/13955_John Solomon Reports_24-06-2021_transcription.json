When you hear this, I know it's going to make your blood boil, but there's a way to fix this. We got to get this out to the American people so that they can get to their policy leaders and fix what you're about to hear. Joining us right now is retired Air Force Captain Darren Selnick, who not only served his country in the military, but then he went and worked at the VA and served as a senior policy advisor to the VA secretary under President Trump and was responsible with that team for bringing a lot of things, new ideas to the VA like choice. How about that one? A neat idea. Veterans getting a choice for their health care. Darren, welcome to the show. Thanks, John. Happy to be on and talk about this very important subject. Oh, it is. And I read a couple of your op-eds and I literally fell off my chair because the data you are showing is that there is a new wait time scandal. Remember the one back in the Obama years where veterans aren't getting care in the time frame that they're promised under the law. Tell us what you found with the data. You went and got real data. You did like journalism. Too bad news organizations are doing this work. Yeah, I mean, it's hard to get the data. In the Trump administration, I was a senior advisor to the secretary. I helped create the Mission Act and then I helped implement it. So I know where the data is, but when you're not in the organization actually getting the data is hard. So you have to kind of scrounge around what is the VA actually tell people in testimony what's actually on the website and what is in their actual budgets. You can get actual numbers from the budget. So I have the advantage of knowing where to look and sometimes finding the nuggets and information. But let's start off with the top line number that the secretary gave a couple of few months ago. And that is the fact that there's 19.7 million last year delayed or canceled appointment at the VA did during the COVID. And so expecting a wave of veterans to use the VA. So that way that 19.7 million never needed to happen. Community care, although was shut down partially for a couple of months, or the height of COVID was fully open. And I can tell you, you know, as a retired Air Force officer, I use camp penalties here in the air ocean. Right. And at the height of the pandemic, I needed to get dermatology. And while the VA was telling veterans no, it's not clinically appropriate. We're not going to let you, we're not going to follow the law. We're not going to let you do what you need to do to go get care. Instead, we're going to delay your care. Camp Pendleton, although they shut down their hospital, their biggest concern was simply, Hey, let's get you out there. You need dermatology appointment. No problem. And if for some reason dermatologist is not open, let us know. And we'll find you a different dermatologist is that is open. The community could never shut down because then they would go like this. So at the height of COVID, I was concerned about something that I saw on my face as the potentially cancer. It's that fortunately it was not. But I was able to see a community dermatologist two and a half weeks from the data request. Wow. And I had my authorization that day. And the concern at the DoD, Camp Pendleton was not saying I was too stupid to know whether I should go in the community or try to keep me out, but simply can make sure I got my care as quickly as possible. And if I was having a problem, they could contrast that to the VA where you have, you know, testimony from GAO and whatnot, saying that their studies have shown that it's taken 42 days, almost 42 days, 41 days. Unbelievable. To get an appointment in the community and they canceled or delayed 19.7 million appointments. That's dangerous, taking everything else away because we know from studies that the health community, the biggest concern they have in this country right now from COVID is all the delayed care that people didn't get during COVID. And that actually kills more Americans than COVID has or will ever happen. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Those things we like. Yeah. So that is the problem. And then the way you're able to track about how long it takes the wait times, just like Phoenix VA is not producing wait times, accurate wait times. They are made up wait times. They're based on the old pre-mission act standard. And so the common sense thing that everyone would say was, hey, when I called to make an appointment, how long does it take between the time I called to make the appointment and when I can be seen? Yeah. Dude, that is the normal common sense. And that's what we put in the regulation, data request. VA's not reporting any appointments based on data requests. They do a trick called a patient indicated date, clinically indicated date. So rather than accounting from the day that you say you need an appointment and starting to clock to the first available appointment, they say, no, we don't think you need appointments for two weeks. So we're not going to start a clock. So for two weeks, it's totally ludicrous. So we don't know what the actual wait times are at the VA medical centers because of the hiding them. And they're hiding them because we know they're bad. They're bad. We know they're bad because, guess what? If you cancel or delay 19.7 million appointments, they don't go off the book. Nope. That means that they've been veterans are waiting for months or maybe a year. Who knows how long? And so they don't want to report them until the numbers are just absolutely, absolutely bad. And I've had TV reporters following them. We've had the Hill ask the numbers. They have not given the numbers and they even told the Hill that we can't even keep track of the actual wait time. So it's absolutely disaster. Even though there's a legal requirement that they keep track of it, right? Oh, absolutely. In the official law, we put in a requirement that veteran to any time whether they need health or not, they should be able to at least check to see if they would qualify for distance or wait times. Yeah. Yeah. Veterans should be able to call and cheer you to get what is the wait time, any time they want to see a is this, do I want to go in the community or what I'm in the VA? What's the wait time? And so if they're telling them the wait times, they're not telling them the accurate wait time. And that's a problem because veterans need to be able to get to care. Time to care that they need them. Yeah, no, that's right. You talked about the mission not accomplished, meaning that if the missions to get health care and then you have your appointment canceled, how many people don't come back? And there was a stunning statistic in the recent op-ed you wrote for USA Today. A third, 2.3 million, there was no indication that they ever got a follow-up visit, ever got the health care that they were seeking when their first appointment was canceled. That is stunning. That's a third of our veterans who may not have gotten the care that they deserved. How can this be? Well, the IG did that analysis. And so the VA is really bad at follow-up. And so we don't know how big that number is because that's getting a little bit old from last fall. But this is what happened in Phoenix, right? Veterans had secret wait times, secret wait-list. And look, I knew a veteran was delayed during that time that had indications of cancer. They didn't follow up with him. He didn't get his appointments. And then they ended up having a stage for cancer and dying. So this is a deadly, deadly stop. And when you went, when one third of the appointments you canceled, you don't even know what their status is. You don't know how bad it is. And so I have some other startling numbers that I've just recently dug up. Please, let's share these. People need to know how bad this situation is. It's an atrocity. So I looked at everyone understood during COVID, whether it was right or not, there was a decrease, but we're post-COVID now. It's fully open. Kneecare is fully open. And so I took a look at the number of veterans who were using the VA 2019 before COVID head, using the VA now, and how many appointments are actually happening. And so, despite what you might hear, less veterans are actually enrolled in using the VA today than they were in 2019. Between 2019 and 2020, this is in the budget of the VA, the actual number of patients. Because they have to put that in their budget. Now, remember, VA is asking for record budgets, but they have less appointments happening than they had in 2019 than they have less veterans. In terms of the amount of roles in the VA system, you actually have 47,000 less veterans in 2020 than 2019. In terms of unique patients, the actual number of patients that actually use the VA versus so many roles, they have 59,000 less patients. In terms of the actual number of appointments, when you take the appointments that are done at the facility plus the appointments in the community care, you had averaging this time in 2019 7.9 million appointments per month. Wow. In 2021, based on the numbers the secretary just gave out, you're down to 5.9 million appointments. So, you're 2 million appointments month left when you take into account. Now, you're 5% more appointments in the facilities, but you have an 85% drop in the number of appointments in the community. And that's just another indicator showing that they aren't letting veterans go into the community. The number is staggering. 2.7 million appointments on average per month in 2019 in the community. Right now, according to the secretary of testimony last week, we are down to 416,000 appointments in the community. Wow. So, it's described for our listeners what's happening, what's the dynamic. So, someone tries to get permission from the VA to go to the community and they can't. Is that what's happening? Or they've just gotten so frustrated they throw in their hands up and say, darn it, I'm not going anywhere. I'm not even going to bother. Both. This is what we're experiencing. And so, one trick the VA is doing to try to keep wait times down is there's a standard of 28 days to special care. So, we have heard time to time to time again from veterans of VA scheduling the night for day 27. So, they meet the wait time. So, they keep me at day 26. They call me up and cancel my appointment. And then they reschedule me again and then they cancel me again. Wow. So, if you're doing wait times correctly, if the VA cancels you, you're still, your wait time is still there. And you should be automatically into the community, but they're not letting them into the community. So, that's one thing. The other thing like the GAO, we reported in the testimony, is veterans are giving up. When it takes you weeks to get an authorization and 42 days to get an appointment, they are, I mean, they are literally giving up. You know, I'm also hearing about, you know, veterans constantly complaining about is taking hours and hours and hours and hours to get to even get a hold of somebody to get an appointment. And it's really bad because you also have entire delegation, eight delegation. Massachusetts, right? Yeah. Well, Massachusetts, but the most recent one from June 2nd was the entire 10 state delegation of state of Washington, mostly Republicans and Democrats. Let me just give you a quote from their letter. It was a four-page letter without the signatures. Then we got the signatures explaining about how bad things were for veterans and they wanted answers to it. Here's just an excerpt from, from, from, on their summary. And remember, this is Republicans and Democrats. It's a bipartisan issue. Here's my quote. Here's the quote from them. Veterans have experienced long-way times for appointments at VA facilities, as well as with community providers. Phone calls go unanswered. Appointments are delayed, and community providers often wait up to two months to receive authorization for necessary medical... Unbelievable. I mean, that's, that's, I mean, that's what we have. We had the delegations in the state of Massachusetts. So we're getting delegations, you know, we talked to, I talked to members, the staffs on the Hill all the time, and it is, it is bad. I mean, they are not getting it. I have talked directly with helping one female veteran who had all of her community care canceled, trying to get back. I talked to a frontline primary care clinician, and she directly told me this was, this was two months ago. She directly told me, he said, look, you need it in the community. I'm going to put you in this community, but you're probably not going to get it. And so the veteran said to her, well, why not? He said, well, I agree that you need it. He said, but I don't have any authority anymore on this. The chief of staff has the authority, and this is what she said, which was really startling. She said, in the prior administration, no problem to get your community care. But in this administration, we have been told by this administration, keep them at the facility, if at all possible, don't let them in the community. She was telling this to the patient because she didn't want to take the blame to the patient. They're thwarting the will of Congress. They passed a whole law to make this possible. It's just unbelievable what's going on. They don't care what the law says. They don't care what the regulation says. With the law and the regulation, if they cannot get you an appointment for mental health time of care within 20 days from your data request, you have the automatic right going to the community if you want. If they can't get you a specialist with data request, you have the absolute right. They can always do better. It was probably the best medical interest in there, but they cannot do worse. They are doing worse. I use TriCare as a model when I was in VA. We set up an assistant to make sure that when the veteran wanted to meet care, they would get an authorization in a call within two business days. Then GAO says they have not done that. They are taking 19-day process, which is a two-day process because they are trying to find every way to keep in the community and keep them out of the community and into the VA. It is shameful what they are doing. What's their motive? I mean, you assume that people that go to work for the VA went to work there not just to get a job, but because they have some interest in helping veterans. But if you are thwarting the options that Congress created to solve the prior wait time crisis, prior crisis of neglect, you would think that with those law, let's make it use it. What is it about bureaucracy, dollars, budget? Or is it just pure, we are trying to stop on something that Donald Trump and the Republicans gave us? I don't think it aimed at Donald Trump. I think it's some of the things that you said. This is the same culture that the current secretary dealt with as Chief of Staff to Obama in 2014. It's the same culture with the same thing in mind. You asked a very good pertinent question, which is, why would they do this? I would tell you, the vast majority of VA employees are horrified that this is happening, which is why they tell me they leak information to others. But there's a level of middle and upper management, which are career, and I've seen this, I've been in an IVA for 20 years, in the Bush and the Trump administration. They think they know better than VSOs, veterans, the hill, the American people. They think this is my agency. When people don't understand, what is this administrative state or detail? What is this? This is the career bureaucrats who think they know better than everybody else. They think they want to have the control and they are growing their empire. Why would they do this? They do this because despite what they say, they know that a large percentage of veterans have given the choice will not accept this kind of customer service these kind of wait times and will go into the community. 80% of veterans already have other health insurance. VA, despite spending over $13,000 per veteran, theoretically, the average veteran only uses VA for 35% of their care. They're in the community already, and they're in the other health insurance for 65% of their care. VA is the most expensive health care. They also see the few amount of patients they only see on average 10 patients a day when they're fully operational. Why would they do that? They do that because they are of the money and the power and the budget. The community care money is separate from the facility's money, but their overall facility's money for a few years is based on how many patients will show up to the medical facility. If they lose the patients to the community because of the poor service- They lose the dollars, right? Then they will lose staff and funding for the medical center. It's not that year, but the following year is because they have an internal mechanism that says, hey, look, how many patients did you have? And that makes sense, right? How many patients do you have there for how many dollars did you have for staff? And they don't want to lose it. Instead, they go to Congress asking for and getting billions of dollars or $20 billion more over the last year. They're adding 17,000 staff. And I have to just say to staff in the LSE, I said, why would you give an organization that has less customers, less patients, and are doing less business to your appointments in the last two years? Why would they get $20 billion more a year to do less? Unbelievable. It's just mind-boggling. It's not being used on the bedroom. Yep, no, clearly not. No. It's going to their own pockets in bureaucracy. That's what it is. More staff to do what? We gave our promise to these veterans that we would give them care for putting themselves in harm's way. And this is how we treat them. I'm just mortified. I've written many of these stories going back 10, 20 years as an investigative reporter. But this one burns my tail more because there were so many things done to actually alleviate this problem. And they're just skipping through the solutions. Let me ask you about what happened over the weekend. Dennis McDonough, FBI secretary, announced a new transgender certary policy. What does that do to this system? And is this a bad time when you got growing lines ready? Well, it's a big problem. And different problems for a number of reasons. VA was created. And up to 1996 was only for service-connected injuries. And most people still think VA is just basically ending service-connected. VA is not to be your everyday health care plan. Right. It was not meant to be Kaiser. And even with a Kaiser, people say, well, transgender, Kaiser offers it. Well, Kaiser offers it if you buy it. Kaiser offers it if you pay an extra premium for it. And so VA is focused on supposed to be service-connected. And for those who are not service-connected, take care of their normal health care needs. And normal health care plan, they don't have dental. They don't have elective surgeries. One female veteran was laying this meeting who was upset about the transgender stuff. She said, look, you will take a guy and you will do transgender surgery on him and give him breast augmentation. But I have, I need breast reconstructive surgery from what happened to me in combat over in Iraq and everything. But they won't give that to me. I just don't know if it will. So it is this upside down. The problem with this and my concern with this is that there's a normal process. Okay. And so if you're going to add a brand new benefit, you may or may not legally be able to do it depending on how you want to do this. It may make Congress to do it. But if you can do it, you got to do a regulatory process and stuff like that. But these big decisions, whether you like the decision or not, any big decision to add a big new benefit, not part of it, especially one that can be seen as elective surgery. And we don't, you know, look, if you're going to do elective surgery because people feel bad about themselves and that go both ways in terms of people who've had that kind of surgery who then regret it and then went on do it. Then you've got to go through a proper process of going talking to your stakeholders, talking to Congress, talking to veterans. You just don't on your own make a big announcement because it's politically advantageous for you to do that. So a lot of people could perceive, and I don't look, I don't know why he did it all the way. He's not a veteran. There's no anything about health care. So you could specifically be perceived that this was a political motivation, that it was pride month and rather than doing due diligence. And talking to people, hey, we're thinking about this. What do you think? What are we going back to instead? Yeah, and steady say, Hey, if I do that, if he had done the right way, the right procedure, he couldn't have got it done in June. So he could have made an announcement too. So he just went ahead and made the announcement so he could go have a feel good to the president's base. Yeah, the other thing concerning about this is that he has had in testimony and not just mine, in these letters, he's taking a lot of heat from the poor health care he's doing. And it could be perceived once again that the reason he did this was to take the heat off the poor health care, change the topic, change it to, I mean, he say he's going to take two years to do it. So change the topic, change it to do something shiny object distraction, right? There's shiny good objects, that you get to stop talking about the fact that veterans are not getting their health care. They have long wait times, or they don't know what the wait times are. And that the right care could be killing them. Take it off of that, take it off of what the 10 member delegation, state of Washington or the member delegation from Michigan Massachusetts, right? Yeah, that's Tuesday. Take it off of that and put it on a topic that even if you agree with it, it's going to take two years before it would even possibly even happen. Real, it's just unreal. I got about a minute left. I want to ask you one last question here. What, you know, obviously these wait times were going at the back end of the Trump administration because of the bureaucracy and enforcing its will. But what has happened since Joe Biden has gotten in because I'm hearing from a lot of veterans that it's got substantially worse, January, February, and you ask, well, what it is, just it's hard to get your call answered. It's you can't get appointments. You can't get referrals. Has there been something, you know, you're an insider, you saw it. What is Joe Biden and his administration and Dennis McDonough done to make a difference? Because I'm hearing from veterans complaining about this very issue. Simple policy and operation. So in the Trump administration, we held their feet to the fire on operations and we wouldn't accept poor operations. So operations has taken a big dive and you've seen that in the wait times for, you know, the call centers and the delays in the responses. But a lot of operations, depending on policy, are what a new administration is telling doctors and leadership, hey, don't let them go into community, keep them at your facility, then that that changes the whole way they do business. And so they're just not responsive to the way they were. Because I think the doctor said it best to I talk to. And she said, prior administration, no problem, can you care? Now, it may have been a little slow. It may have been positive. But the philosophy, the push from that administration was, you know, you, if veterans want to communicate and they'll go, you're going to give it to them and you're going to get to as fast as you can. This administration is specifically said, try to stop them. And they're doing every trick in the book to try to stop them, whether that's not using the law, the regulation scurting it, or just diverting. That's different. And new administration has great push and sway on how operation is done. They put out command and control. Yep, command and control. That's what has happened. And veterans have noticed it. That's why you're getting so many bipartisan complaints. Yeah, the VA has done something that's almost impossible in Washington to do these. They got Republicans and Democrats degree on something. This is outrageous. You know, it's amazing. Yeah. Captain Selenik, I want to thank you first for your incredible service to our country as Air Force veteran to the VA. And you're continuing that service today by highlighting this stuff, getting this into the public domain, we can try to fix this. And I just want to thank you for the courage and the incredible responsibility you've put into this. I mean, the data is solid. You're there's no doubt about what you're saying. And that is a great public service. It really is. Thank you, John. And I really appreciate you highlighting this issue because we need more people to understand what's going on. So that we can protect our veterans and get them to care that we got to shine the biggest light we can find. That's the best antiseptic. And you've done a great job helping us do that today. So I really appreciate it. Thank you so much. Appreciate being on. All right. Have a good rest of the day. All right, folks. I know you're angry. Yeah, you should be. This is not not something we should tolerate. But let's go to quick commercial break. We'll come back and wrap things up for the day. When I'm away, I trust my home security system to keep criminals out. But this blew me away. A cop buddy warned me about an even worse crime they're seeing. It's called house stealing. And I could already be a victim and not know it. Criminals start by picking out a house. Like mine, then they assume our identity, which is easy because everything about us, including our home and property is online. Then they forge a home transfer document and take over as the new owner of my house. That's house stealing. And then they can take out loans using your equity as collateral. My home is my most valuable asset. That's why I protect it with home title lock. First things first, check on your home's title to make sure it's still in your name. Do it now at home title lock.com and use promo code free. Bill send you a scan of your home's title and your first 30 days of triple lock title protection is free. That's promo code free at home title lock.com promo code free at home title lock.com. All right, folks, that wraps up another edition of John Solomon reports. I'm still numb after hearing all the things that Darren told us. But you know, this is what sometimes happens in government bureaucracy. And the key thing is let's get the facts out to the American public to policymakers so that they can go make decisions and try to cut this off at the past before it gets worse before we see even more consequences to the impact of these delays. We're very grateful. Hope you're doing well. We'll talk to you tomorrow and we'll have a new edition and some really great guests. We're going to be going to Alaska tomorrow. It's going to plant that thought in your mind. Alaska and June or July. Not a bad place to go. All right, have a great night.
