We're trying to solve the deficit and national debt problem That's not being funny about this, how do they derive 2.75 trillion dollars, sir? Well Steve, it's good to be here, this is all part of the false reality They're trying to spend where two men can have a baby or two women can have a baby Or you can devalue currency, it does cause inflation There have been two trials so far, three different groups have led against over 20 families and in Texas it was 50 million In Connecticut it was a billion, but then they had three other charges that the judge had to bring back the jury That's why some of us made it would be around 2 to 3 billion And then they actually requested in the court yesterday in their filing They requested $5,000 per time that there was any social media imprints of some calculation they made of any of my material And non-San Diego, which is less than one tenth to one percent, I barely ever covered it And so they're asking for 2 trillion, 750 billion on top of everything else For those who don't know, that's bigger than the GDP of France That's bigger than the GDP of India every year, India has 1.3 plus billion people Most of our world countries don't operate in 20 years off 2.75 So it's total insanity, it's total bizarro world And just to recap briefly what happened was I barely ever covered Sandy Hillary ran against Trump all at the last month, he didn't pay 2016 They then sued me in 2018 over four years, got all of our discovery Had no case of boundness in default in the judge told the jury in Texas in Connecticut that I am guilty Or still another show trial in Texas with two other plaintiffs coming up in a few months And so that's two of these that are done a third one And so we're talking about just an incredibly organized plan In fact, they admitted last week finally that a big Democratic party think tank and separately A big Democrat party connected PR firm was running this from before the time they even sued me And coordinating with the media, everything has been coordination with the courts Because I'm a villain so I deserve it And so this is literally the Alex Jones precedent now the lawyer But suing Kanye West for 200 plus million dollars because he covered the coroner's report That he did not have any injuries that were killing other than fentanyl And methamphetamine and some other drugs They're now suing Kanye West for his speech and the lawyer said we're using the Alex Jones precedent under a Kupma system of false advertising claiming Kanye said that George Floyd wasn't killed by the cops So he quote, make money So that's how they plan to eradicate the first amendment they're now on every major corporate channel Admitting they're coming after everybody now in Democrat controlled Jurisdictions that are controlled by the Soros judges of the Soros Prosecutors and the Soros counting attorneys and in fact here in Austin The counting attorney is an open communist. He says he's a communist put in by Soros The judges of big Soros supporter on her Facebook She literally has blue hair and says she supports SJWs and Antifa And so this is the law fair taken to the next level And so people wonder why I was laughing during the verdict A few weeks ago the first billion or it was 965 million Technically one of four charges only one's gone forward now That was the first jury charge And so and that was cool for inflicting harm and hurting people's feelings And so now they want two trillion seven hundred and fifteen billion dollars And again, I don't have three million dollars cash I've got a small lake house in a regular Soros house I don't have five million total in assets They know that this has meant to scare everybody ahead of the midterms And put a giant chilling effect into free speech I don't think it's gonna work Steve Are you saying the actual of the two point seven five trillion dollars Actually has some reality to it I mean that's actually in a court filing and this will actually have You'll have to fight this or is that just something to throw out there As like a smokescreen Or is this reality that on top of the bayon on top of the 50 million They're coming at you for the two point seven five trillion Well, obviously I can't pay a billion In the rest of my life I couldn't pay a hundred million dollars Except inflation so bad all the few years a hundred million dollars Just buy you a big dinner At a stake house like Zimbabwe or while I'm a republic So unless the inflation gets that bad I could never pay off a hundred billion A ten million dollar judgment would have been Extremely hard for me to go to my listeners and ask for the support to do And so that's why we're in bankruptcy So they're not shutting us down, they're not silencing us The plaintiff lawyers openly remember the Democratic Party and Senator Blumenthall Have bragged that their mission is Is the silence being to shut me up? But yes, they put the court filing That they once have a two point seven five trillion that's that's that's two thousand seven hundred and fifty billion Unbelievable Alex talk to us about what does this mean going forward? We're still going to have Alex Jones because I think a lot of people last night When they saw this and it's one of the reasons I'm so glad to have you on By the way, if you want to see where Alex Jones thinking is right now Go to Amazon and get The great reset the war for the world because this thing in China right now shows you That what she thinks of Fading and declining power. Okay, we're going to talk about more about that later Go to Amazon the great reset in the war for the world is the best description of the global situation we're in Is this are we still going to have Alex Jones? I mean, how do you struggle through this one? Well, I've talked to a lot of smart folks and And I can curve their analysis and plus the lawyers in Texas Anakin etiquette and nationally have said this to sit our mission is to silence him and everybody else the questions Official narratives. So we're under chapter 11 Subchapter 5, which is not a liquidation for those that don't know it is a reorganization And so as long as I basically accept almost no money And that's in my current deal I'm getting paid $25,000 a month, which doesn't pay my personal legal bills show as long as I will work almost for free The people that take about two years ago through appeals even if they win Which most experts think they won't or the will of loss completely gone So one way to have rigged courts in Austin and in New Haven, Connecticut All the appeals courts, but if they're unable To to to to to to shut us down which they won't be able to under the chapter Five we have indefinite and limited amounts of times as long as God gives us But but also we have at least two years of appeal So rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated But they've done this to intimidate the listeners that think, well, that's it for Jones I shouldn't support him. They'll never pay two trillion seven hundred fifty billion That's just meant that the moralizes of make us give up But it's only gonna make my list reach my heart or they see right through it A fantastic I tell you what we've got Libby Evans What I want to do is play that when we get back because that's that's a longer clip And Alex I'm gonna want you to see this because I know you're joining us by phone Alex give us two minutes right now before we're gonna break on Where do you think we understand you're under amazing incredible pressure Amazing effort to shut you down Where do you think we stand now with two and a half weeks to go because one of the reasons They're coming at you so hard and everybody else is they're in full panic mode So where do you think we stand as we run up for a couple of weeks to November 8? Well, quite frankly, I think even bigger news in their giant announcement They went to plus trillion dollars Was you getting four months when dozens and dozens of Democrats and Republicans And then held in contempt You testified all those other times and the point you made about listen I've been judged by this judge. That's fine. Now coming up in just a few weeks The people will judge this regime and you're right. They are in full complete panic mode And all the numbers show a gigantic landslide not even their election fraud Is gonna be able to stop my concern is what will they pull A power outage when most cyber attack I don't know But definitely their corner rats. They've shown they're willing to do anything And so we all need to be really focused fully engaged and Doc letting everything Alex Jones joins us by phone We're gonna take a short break. Alex Jones is gonna stick with us Libby Evans is gonna come in We've got a clip and I'm on one Alex Jones's commentary and Libby's With the inflation on fire Today daily males got 2.75 million I have crossed the southern border We know that numbers twice but they're even reporting from government documents 2.75 million You've got an invasion of the southern border complete meltdown of the economy Inflation out of control Problem after problem China is now she has thrown down hard against any failing power With all that we're gonna show you a video on the other side to open the B block That will shock you This is where Joe Biden has spent his time and this is who Joe Biden spending his time with Sure commercial break The one and only Alex Jones Libby Evans from Post Millennial next in the war room I'm in Washington DC and I'm going to the White House to speak to the President of the United States You know my phrase I fear I may have girl lost too close to the sun Well that's how I feel today because I get to sit down with Joe Biden and now this news And I get to ask him a few questions surrounding trans issues in the United States And talk to him about my transness And I really just want to represent my community the best that I can And you know what as silly as I am on here I'm ready to step up and show that trans people were not going anywhere And that trans kids they deserve a fighting chance to be their true selves Okay, oh my god, I'm running late Let's go And y'all are obviously wondering what I'm gonna wear to meet the President Here you go It's the trans flag colors You right? It's the heels? Okay Dylan you're gonna be great I love you Let's go Come on, do you think I just knock on the front door? Let's go Looking for the President's dog Our Queen, love you, I love you We're about to go, is there anything in my team? Leaving on Cloud9 The President of the United States gave me a cookie He gave me a cookie in the Oval Office Now here's the question, do I eat it? Or do I save it? It has a seal Please honestly tell me Hey everyone, I got to pet the dog I got to pet his dog I'm still in shock and don't be mad But I don't get to post any of the footage until after the interview airs on Sunday night But it's gonna be worth it because I can't wait for you to hear everything that we talked about I left with a lot of hope and optimism Not only for just trans people but many different topics And the fact that our President has watched Days of Grouhord It's kind of epic And I'm not gonna lie, I have been I've been having a rough go of it lately A lot of darkness And today was what I needed to keep going Also if you live in the US and can legally bow, this is gonna be one of the most important elections of our lifetimes So please get out and bow next month There is so much darkness in this world I mean sometimes the bad actually outweighs the good But we have to get in the mud right now And we're gonna clean up successes Okay, with the world in a crisis This is what Joe Biden, not War Room saying that That individual right there, that's where Joe Biden spent his time Libby Emmons, before I get Alex back up here for his commentary and analysis What did we just say? We just saw a grown male kenkster who has influence in the Oval Office That's what we saw This is a man who previous to this was interviewing animals on TikTok And got hardly any views, went trans and made his career So just a lot of our audience, perhaps like in shock, have no idea what this is That is a man, correct? This is a man, he is in his 20th Prior to this, he identified as gay Then he decided that he was non-binary After that he decided that he was actually a woman, started taking estrogen and documenting What he called his girlhood on TikTok He posted a video every day about being a bimbo One was about the bulge in his short He called women's genitals Barbie pocket or pouches I think Barbie pouches is what he said He gets a canopy bed, it's all very exciting to be a girl in your mid 20s He's gone out there, he gets all kinds of awards now He gets special access to the president, I'll be taking drugs He said he's going to post an interview he had with Joe Biden The President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of our Armed Forces On Sunday, he was in the Oval Office and had an interview Yeah, press can't get an interview and press can't get questions No, but this poser of womanhood can go into the Oval Office and have full access to the presidency We've seen with this whole administration, they lean into social media influencers Because they think the American people are stupid and that we just all listen to what the TikTokers say It's egregiously horrifying because this is what's going on And the executive office of the United States Yeah, let me hang on for a second, I want to hold you there and we're going to get back to you Alex Jones, given, and you're one of the best thinkers, you've written this great book on the great reset In the War for the World, geopolitically you've got as much insight or knowledge and judgment Anybody put this in perspective, what is the Biden administration doing here? Well, just like they're dissolving our borders and destroying our value of our currency Everything they do cutting off our pipelines is to de-industrialize and bring the American people under cloud and pivot strategy To our needs, a wealthy successful middle-class population cannot be controlled And the Tabas-Tok Institute and the 60s develop this whole transgender plan It is all part of a program to break down the family and to reward men if they don't act like men And to be going to try to train women to quote replace men That's the simple plan, there was a video that I can't even hear on my show, it's so horrible You guys probably saw it and it's been criminally investigated by the Attorney General in Texas Just last week, last Monday in Texas at a drag-queen story time with children of juniors two, three, and four A man spread his legs at one of these events that mothers brought children to and said Things I can't say on air and said I want to have sex with you, have sex with me, F me in my blah blah blah And pointed at his genitals with women celebrating this So this is all about sexualizing children, it's about training us to accept the most insane garbage And training us to suspend logic to demoralize us Everything is $2.7 trillion request and just all of this is meant to break our will and make us give up But it's not going to work A lot of folks think, well, they're just being cynical when you be trending That's part of it because they're left as followers But the fish has been to just bombard us and sear our minds And basically blacken our minds and hearts, even if we don't support it, we just become accustomed to it Until we basically tune out and give up, they're trying to put us into a psychological spiritual fetal position Instead of charging up the hill like you, Stephen, so many others in this great audience are doing So we need to let the public understand that all of us being pushed by Disney and the corporate media is weaponized Culture, just like the fentanyl, just like all the pedophilia being promoted That's all this is, they're coming for a children, there's an example of a big report out The federal government is blocking the development in the US of huge goat farms that produce some of the very best milk They've known for thousands of years, they can replace human milk when women are having trouble Or there's a regular formula shortage And so they're allowing the importation of goat milk into the United States out of Europe But Biden is blocking farmers producing goat milk and then turning it into powder here, a major industry we could have So everything they do is about shutting us down on record, that's their plan, period Okay, so how do we, there's no substitute for victory So give me a minute or two on the Alex Jones, what is the plan here to win and to turn this thing around and set things right, sir? Well we have to understand that it is a Bill Gates, Plaschwab, WEF, CCP power alliance on record China teaches manhood and family and stoicism are such a teacher to be weak and stupid, TikTok all of it It's run by the CCP, it's all completely weaponized, they're on record, Braggiums will be aware of the propaganda, and others will be aware of the propaganda and the opposite of whatever Their propaganda says, China is crumbling, that's why it's organizing and to appear to totalitarian dictators, She'll be beyond what it was, the Democratic Party openly works for the WEF, Chiacom Alliance And this is all meant to again sabotage its culture economically so that China can continue to take over the world They could Congress militarily, so they're targeting us and capturing us morally with again the stages of demoralization But the good news is America is waking up fast and projecting this, everybody needs to go knock on doors now Everybody needs to call your family now, everybody needs to tell their employees and their bosses now To vote Republican and vote Patriot coming up in just a few weeks like your lives depend on it because it does The great reset in the war for the world is a must read, it gives you the kind of overall framework In which a lot of these different elements drop into, Alex, before we let you go, how do people continue to get to your show? How do they get to the content and to the voice of Alex Jones? Steve, they find the remote broadcast at UnitfoWars.com It's huge, it's not as big as it was before we got the platform but it's almost back to that level We were just supposed to give up, I think we were defeated, but because the listeners and supporters like you didn't give up on us We are exploding in size right now, people are sharing the link, infoWars.com, look for SharingWarRoom.org And Steve, I promise my younger daughter, I'd taken her fishing for a couple days, months ago, I'm back in a few days But I would love for you to host an hour of my show this week I would enjoy her sitting in, but I would love to have the great Steve Bannon, host an hour of you, love, if you'd like to do it, we'd love to have you And I really appreciate you Steve, for all you're doing for America and God bless you Be honored, Alex, don't know if I can handle the desk there, but be honored, thank you very much, appreciate it One more time, the book is the great reset in the war for the world You'll understand, you'll understand about what's happening in Italy, you'll understand what's happening in China These big events over the weekend, Alex Jones, honored to have you on here, thank you very much, sir Thank you Steve Libby, we've got a minute here for a good break, I want you to break, Matthew Tearmann is going to join us, but I want you to stick around Libby, is Alex Jones right? I mean, is the purpose here to demoralize people and try to break the spirit of the American family? What is going on? How with all these crises going on? How can Biden, the President's time is so precious? How can they spend time doing this? Ma'am? Yeah, it's a pretty shocking thing to see that this is what's going on. I do think that a lot of this is about who moralizing us I think a lot of it is about destroying the American family Once the family is destroyed and the government is our partner in life and our parent and our lover and whatever else They can do what they please with us, we won't have anybody to trust or rely on, we won't have any independent units to be part of or community The government just wants to control all of that. We've seen it in their advertising for years with Obama and now and we see this going on Where the government says that children aren't yours? They are actually everybody's and it's important to make sure that they can be fully indoctrinated And to gender identity ideology and critical race theory, children are being taught to hate America, to hate themselves, to hate their God, to not believe in God This is just so pervasive and telling children that they cannot trust the reality of their own bodies Should be a criminal thing that is happening. I mean, there should be nobody who is standing for that Libby, just hang on, short break, Matthew, Tirmont, Libby, Emmons, next Damn, all of that, we're just... Pick him up, my client, rest in the name of sex, dreams, like you won't be half the speech if you left Wayne Hey, he won't write like matters, took a cannon, so I'm saying he's so obedient Okay, welcome back 2.75 trillion dollars against Alex Jones, Libby Evans' weathers, can I have a call for the next clip, let's play that, keep my mic open, we'll watch it And then I'll break Libby in, can we go ahead and play that? He's 76 of being a girl, and these are my favorite songs of girlhood so far 2 girls, they wanna have fun, it's a classic Well, I've been afraid of changing, cause I've been The reason we play this, I just wanna make sure he represented that Joe Biden has seen this film or seen this series of videos, he said Joe Biden has seen it, and he had an interview in the Oval Office, and it's supposed to come up on Sunday night Libby, is this a parody, is this real, do you actually believe he was in the Oval Office, meaning with the President during a financial crisis, economic crisis, Associated Press is reporting, the Associated Press, Nightgate Way Punnett, Associated Press is reporting that Americans now, and they're doing interviews with people Making a choice between putting food on the table or heating their house for the winter, American citizens Lois, a housing rate, what in 20 years, highest mortgage rates, inflation out of control, invasion of the Southern border, Daily Mail has got 2.75 million illegal aliens And blown through here just during the term of the Biden administration, that does not include the God of Ways, Todd Benson will be here Monday to talk about that You have crisis after crisis after crisis are created, and Joe Biden spending his time at giving an interview in the Oval Office with this, do you believe this Libby? Yeah, I do believe it, I believe that this is what the President thinks is important, the President came out in April and told American parents that they should affirm your kids, telling them that they were so brave for pushing their kids toward child theft changes, pushing them to not go through natural puberty, pushing them on to cross sex hormones and surgeries, and you should see some of these groups on Facebook where parents talk about the ways that they're going to go about doing this, and this is what the President is affirming to the American public Boys are not boys, girls are not girls, you can toss it up, do whatever you want, just take magic surgeries and drugs, and suddenly that's secure for adolescents, you don't have to grow up anymore This is what the President thinks is important, this is what he spends his time doing, I would not be surprised if he was watching this 100 days of girlhood TikTok series, because each clip is barely a minute long, and that's about as much attention span as the President currently has to deal with anything They want to rule us by creating crises that we can't get out of, telling us what the crises are, they tell us that race is a crisis and climate is a crisis, and we have to do all of these things and bow to their wishes and change our entire lifestyles and our society in order to match the vision that they have for us It's total trash, and I think that Americans should be sick of it, I'm sick of it, you know, when I talk to my son about if it's going on at his school, it is going on at his school, and it's going on at every school in the country, it's trendy, the kids want to be trans because it gets them popularity, it gets you clicks on TikTok And this individual who was in the White House had no career a year ago, he was doing interviews with animals on TikTok, hoping to get views, and the next thing you know, he decides he's trans and he's on all of these shows and awards and getting invited everywhere, getting invited to the White House Career move for this guy, I don't know if he means it or not, or if it's just that he was a failed performer before and now he's just taking to this to try and get some attention, it's certainly working, shouting about how oppressed you are while accepting awards is a brilliant career move And we see it all over the place, I don't think that there's any real trans oppression in this country, I think it's fully celebrated, this is how you get popular, you tell everyone that your body is not really the right one, take a bunch of drugs, you get some surgeries, and you go on TikTok and yell that that's what being a girl is We all know it's trash, Camp Hacks gave him a sponsorship, he spoke at the Forbes Women's Summit Yeah, there is no substitute for victory, that's your mantra, people come to me and saying, hey, you know, praying for you, I appreciate it, here's what we do Pray for our enemies in victory in November, just write that down and blazing that on your memory, that's the only thing that matters, you can't turn this around until you win, victory in November, shatter the Democratic Party from school boards Election County officials all the way up to the House and the Senate, everything's going our way, Libby, how do people get to you and find your reporting on Post Millennial Man? We are at thepostmillennial.com, you can follow us there, we're reporting on stuff like this and broader issues as well every day, and I'm at Libby Emmons on Twitter, you can find me there Libby, thank you very much, after that I need a drink Wow, ridble, I swore off those things, Matthew, I've got a bunch of clips, I got to ask you first there sir, because I respect your judgment, Matthew Tearmon, not just understands economy, venture capital, capital markets, it also has a unique understanding of the world, particularly the populist nationalist movement. Is this a good use of the presidents of the illegitimate Joe Biden's time, given that he does occupy 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, given the crises that surround this nation, sir? Well, remember Nero fiddled as broken, burned, personally, I don't think he has any say in his schedule on the public commentary, he's a puppet vegetable, and the strings are being pulled by people from Clinton world, Obama world, obviously we all know that he's doing an excellent job as puppet master, he's got a bunch of other standards, look at the people who have quote unquote high power and authority, whether it's his vice president, he's not too far away from vegetable status either, you know there's great mashup a few weeks ago of the they will dump him quicker than you can, you know, blink twice at. So is this a good use time course not there, there, you know, doing, you know, look over here while they're doing everything over here. Okay, hang on for one second, let's play do we have the Georgia Milani, a clip, let's do Georgia Milani historic day in Italy, let's go and play it. Okay, let's bring back Matthew Tirmont, Matthew historic day, talked us about how important what happened in Italy earlier today, yes, sir. We've had moves to the right across Europe, starting in Poland and Hungary and the San Juanucian European countries that ascended to the EU in 2004, because they saw the direction of the EU and they have a recent distinct memory of what far off Mandarin, telling them how to live and reaching their sovereignty looked like with their experience under the Soviet Union and behind the Iron Curtain. This is the first continental European ship, the right, of course we had Brexit, but this Italy is a B7 country. It is one of the big five in Europe, economically industrially in size of population. It is on the southern border of the EU that was on the front line, the migration crisis, which really made the sovereign brief is palpable and tangible for the Italian people, whether it was political or not. And then there are some other areas where the American army was saying, yeah, you're going to take these migrants coming across the Mediterranean and flotillas funded by people like Soros and other transnational globalists who were pushing, you know, how to come across and enter Europe and the Italians are set after Brexit, I think five years with you and when I was writing for Breitbart that after the UK, Italy, Italy would be the next two to drop and a lot of its economics, the Italians were hurt the most by the economic shift, the the exchange rate mechanism in 2000 from Lira to Europe. You remember the when you go to Italy and there were 10,000 no their currency was very appreciated. So when they switched the euro overnight, the cost of bread, milk, egg, everything went up in real purchasing party terms more than any other country in Western Europe. And you talk to cab drivers in Rome, they're still but heard about it. They remember it. They remember the pain of this. And then the EU comes in, Brussels, Strasbourg and says, we're going to fill your cities up the same way Berlin has in Germany and Paris, France, and they don't like it. And so Maloney has a strong mandate in hand. She's done a masterful political job in creating coalition with Delvini and League, as well as Silbio Berlusconi will be a thorn in her side and hopefully he will be subsumed by these more sort of conventional in the modern sense right winged Roberts parties. And I think this is going to continue across the club med economy. This is yeah, this is same by the way, as Brexit was to 2016, both Italy and a Swedish Democrats. And of course, what's happened in Brazil and get that in a second. Tell me about like the cavalry coming to save the homesteaders Boris Johnson on a plane from the Caribbean flies in the Gatwick airport. A certain people are freaking out other people are not where do we stand the United Kingdom, Matthew Terman? Well, we are going to see the conservative party. And by the way, the Tories do not represent sort of a populist mass of right center, right in the UK anymore. They're like if Romney was running the Republican Party or Taney or Hinsinger, the country club Republicans of Dore, Charlie Baker. They are very divorced from the concerns. Most of them were anti-Brexit. It was all the strength of Nigel, you pick, Greg, the party and the face coming together in contravention of what the Tories wanted. But what they've telegraphed is that they will have like Mar to say two candidates for the conservative party membership to vote on. And it may come down to Rishi, soon. I think it was had a fan piece of a phone. He had legitimate candles. I think it's going to be Rishi soon act moments and bankers of the world rejoice. There are companies who move large shop fixing portfolios around the globe and especially around Europe will be rejoiced. We'll be rejoicing. He is a globalist economic player. He's a neoliberal Neocan globalist, horrible for the populist movement over there. Real quickly, you're holding Brazil for the next. But tell me right now, Swedish Democrats, we got a minute. What are the Swedish Democrats doing to forming your government? They're feeling pretty good. I know you and I talked offline about some nervousness from our folks in Sweden and who are Swedish watchers. But I think what they did in staying out of the government to keep the liberals and the moderates. They get along quite well with the Swedish Democrats. There's a lot of folks left there. But the liberals and the moderates, the more of the squishes, they'll be running the government. But with a very, very tight throw, they will not have a lot of room to hang themselves going backwards. Social Democrats left policy. So many points of the memorandum of understanding are already tightening up on immigration crime, economics and unemployment benefits. The Swedish Dems are perfectly positioned to keep them on a tight leash with their 20% of parliamentary votes, 70 seats give or take. If the moderate led coalition, the deficit of fines, they can threaten the government to fall. They can get a shot at the NPM and running the government themselves. Or even better, they can hold new elections and get 25% and lead the next government. Matthew, hang on. We're going to talk a CCP, Beijing, 20th party Congress, Brazil, how it's going to impact the 2022 midterms next in the room. We're forward. The new social media taking on big tech, protecting free speech, and canceling cancel culture. Join the marketplace of ideas. The platform for independent thought has arrived. Superior technology. No more selling your personal data. No more censorship. No more cancel culture. Enough. Getter has arrived. It's time to say what you want, the way you want. Download now. All the polling is shifting rapidly to Republican candidates, to MAGA candidates throughout the country. This is on fire right now. Everybody's deployed all over. We need you to go sign up to volunteer. We'll get a lot more of that in the second. Christine Karama is going to join us from Michigan. We've got a couple of three other surprises. Big rally with President Trump today. Texas will be going live there. Matthew, there's also some rumblings in France. What's going on? A couple of days ago, a 12-year-old girl named Lola was killed, murdered, and grossly viciously brutally murdered in the north part of Paris. Some sort of an eddy, gritty, working-class suburb. They appear to have caught the alleged miscreant who did this. One of them was had already been ordered last time upon entry into France to leave France deportation. You know what that means? The media won't say it directly, but that means not a French citizen. This is a foreign migrant who came in with hostile third-world values to our western sort of canonical values, and murdered an innocent French 12-year-old girl. The media is covering it as the right is up in arms and spreading their nasty racism and horrible fact policy. But she's becoming quickly a symbol of everything that's gone wrong. And when you look at global media, they say things like, the right is rebelling against the pragmatic centrism of Macron. And you saw this in the vote when the pen came closer than ever. Cycle over cycle. Getting closer in lefty, EU-leading brand. And I actually think you see all the right-wing commentators are essentially saying, remember Lola. There's sort of memorials to her outside her apartment. We'll see what the prosecution looked like around the two who were caught. But I think this has potential to be a remember the Alamo moment because people are getting more and more angry at not only that this happened, but the response of the establishment is, oh, now the right is going to be up in arms about it. A 12-year-old girl was viciously murdered by non-citizens of France who came in under these weak-dovish policies. And all the media is doing is covering for Macron and calling him a centrist when he's a Eurocentric leftist. So I think this could percolate and turn into a movement. Our eye on France on this. No, we've been watching this. Let's go then to Brazil because the evangelical vote down there, this is a dead heat, maybe even Bolsonars up, the whole left, including Macron and all the Europeans are backing Lola. Tell us, give us your, because you know the numbers down there, I think, as well as anybody. Where are we? We're one week in a day away from this monumental election. What's going to happen? A week from tomorrow is the second round, as we call the first round, was coped a second three weeks ago, and Lola somehow came in first, quite all the down balance. That's the Bolsonars. Hand-picked governor and senator candidate, Paul Snar did historically, unprecedentedly well for the right in Brazil in the chamber of deputies, the lower house and the Senate. And so he's now leading in the polls. The brushed Lola in the debate called him out effectively about the corruption with Operation Car Wash. And so now what we've seen play out this week is the Supreme Court led by Alexander Marais in their city report, the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, has now banned calling Lola corrupt or criminal because it might miss speed, mislead the voters. Meanwhile, everybody in the country knows it. This wasn't really up for debate. Even the hard left Communist acknowledged that there was quite a high level of botanery with Dilma and Lola selling Brazilian assets to Chinese CCP. What's interesting is Jack Niekis, who we talked about, who's the New York Times for Film Co. Bill Court's Bonnet, wrote a follow-up piece to his other excellent piece about the Supreme Court from a few weeks ago yesterday about basically entitled, One Man Who Stylants Online Descent, about Marais. Even the New York Times is saying, you know what? Democracy is being abrogated by this out of control judiciary in Brazil. And so what is this judiciary doing? They're tightening their reigns on free speech and online communications. They're blocking documentaries, sympathetic footballs. Now, they're blocking media. They've said that if you do not take down the content, they deem anti-democratic, i.e. hostile to Lula in the left, then they will force your non-operational status within two hours. If you do not take down the court's directive within two hours, your platform pieces to exist in Brazil, and they will do it by armed force. They have their own law enforcement wing, you know, with guns, do raids, who go in a rest journalist, and even Boston-Arrow's Congressman, who's under house arrest. So it's pretty obscene. And by the way, one other really interesting data point. The EWZ is the large cap Brazil ETF in the stock market, and it is rallying. It is ripping into this PBR petro-brost, the largest company traded internationally, the Brazilian oil, state oil company, the one that Dilma and Lula was stealing from. That has made three-year highs yesterday. I always believe the market knows first that the market is the sum total wisdom of all participation in all participants. Same thing we saw in the UK with a list of trusted, ass-backwards economic policy and how it's destroying the value of the pound. The market did that because they knew what she was doing with the incredibly ex-domically damaging. Well, I think the converse is happening in Brazil, and the markets are suggesting that Boston-Arrow's strengthening and strengthening and strengthening into this final round. And just to see PBR, which would do horribly under Lula, he'd be sending Brazilian oil to Cuba for free. He would reduce the prices, not make them competitive with the international market, because he's a communist. He doesn't believe in capital market signals at pre-entry. But he's also totally sold out to the CCP. We'll get to that more in the next segment. Maria Luisa is going to join us here. Matthew, real quickly, as you sit here right now, give me a call shot. Is it a Bolsonaro by a half a point? Is it Lula? Will the apparatus down there allow Bolsonaro to win? I believe that based on a lot of it, some paracal and anecdotal, but to be honest, a paracal and anecdotal is better quality polling than actual fresh polling, as we call it. The reflectivity they try and call it from polling. With him serving as he is, I believe that in an honest plebiscite, with no molestation from the stream for it in the media with fake polls, Bolsonaro would be up by at least 5-10 points. It would be a very strong mandate. The question is, how many ballots will they dump in? Smartmatic, Venezuelan machine, population system, no paper ballots, no audible ballot. Any suggestion that there might be fraud is enough to get you arrested by the court in Brazil that's flawless. So we'll see. I can't handle that. Yeah. I'm Matthew. How do people follow you over the weekend? At Matthew Terreman, M-A-T-H-W-T-Y-R-M-A-N-D, Gennard, Twitter.
