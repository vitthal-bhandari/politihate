    "text": " there is not an efficient way to determine one's human capital. The only thing we can do is try to hire someone sometime. Listen, I wish more people would know, seriously, I wish more people would. And then tell me that you've got a better system for that. We don't. You know, there are so many jobs that I would be terrible at. On my own staff, okay, that I would interview very well for and not be good at. Now, if I came in with my like nice fancy degree and my, my, my way of talking, that is communicates a certain socio economic credential. Yes. Maybe you would hire me to do that job. I would like for a job. Hello and welcome to why is this happening with me, your host, Chris Hays. Okay. So indulge me for a minute, put, put a minute on the clock, maybe to, to be champion, just a little rant mini rant about the state of the discourse, capital T H, he capital D is discourse. Good. It's not on the fly. Okay. Here's, here's the thing about the world we live in and the information we consume. There is at this moment because of the way technology works, the way that my industry and cable news works. There is this just like insane competition war for people's attention. And between Twitter, which is particularly bad in this way and the way the internet functions and the way social media functions, all content, all information is in these little packages that are small and are designed to grab your attention and then have you share them and move them along. And they're all constrained in these tiny little worlds, like a tweet. I have found that my ability to think deeply about things or with context or with complexity or with nuance is constantly being assaulted by the fact of the way that information moves through our conversation nationally. That's really, really true of Twitter, where it's literally about a length limit where it's like, you can only have an idea that can be articulated in these 280 characters. That's it. That's as big as the idea you can have. And if you really want to be told story, you can thread a whole bunch together and go super deep. Maybe you go 12 tweets deep. And then man, you're just, that's like, whoo, that's like your dissertation. And all of that, I understand the technological moment we're in and the market incentives that have produced that way, the discourse works. But what is lost is space for depth and complexity. And particularly when we're talking about complicated things, we're talking about complicated political topics. We're talking about complicated questions of identity or the lived reality of people that might be different than us. What you need is what something that, that, that sociologist called thick description. Thick description is the opposite of the flatness of a tweet. A tweet, a headline that tries to get you to click the front page of a magazine, the thing that is trying to grab your attention. That's flat. It's flat. It's, it's two dimensional. It's trying to grab you thick description, which is a term sociologist use is to really inhabit the life world of a culture, of a group of people, of an institution and to mine all the complexity, all of the internal contradictions, all of the manifestations of that life world. That's what really good sociologist do. It's what really good ethnographers do anthropologists. And it's a really necessary skill in this moment precisely because the flatness of the discourse and because the thing that we're constantly talking about, this show talks about that our politics are all around, are people from different backgrounds trying to communicate to each other about what their identity is, where they're coming from. And so what we have is this crazy mismatch of a politics that demands that we're interacting and listening to folks that are coming from different backgrounds and a medium of communicating that is as flat as humanly possible. And so I'm very excited to have a discussion with a sociologist whose name is Tressi McMillan-Cottum. She is a teacher at Virginia Commonwealth University and she has just written this phenomenal book of essays, which is called thick, thick, both as a descriptor of a female body, thick as a description of the kinds of sociology she does, which is thick description. And it's a book of essays that really makes you work to think through the complexity of the life world that she's experienced as a black woman, who is in academia, who is taking her perspective and applying it to her research program. She wrote this incredible book before this book of essays about basically private colleges called lower ed, but she's got a way of doing this thing that we used to call troubling a concept when I was back in college, which like sounds like a sort of annoying and academic turn, but it's just the process of taking a concept or a contention or premise or a truth that you think you know, and shaking it and poking it and prodding it and turning it upside down. It is a really difficult thing to guide a person through the thinking of that, to guide a person using your words through thinking about society or institutions or human life in that way. And in this book of essays, Tracey does that extremely well. She's got an incredible life story. She's sitting at the intersection of a whole bunch of interesting forces in American life at this moment, but more than anything, she has a way of getting to the deepest part of a topic. And most urgently, she got a way of combining of the way of thinking about society and politics, and she gets from her training as a sociologist with the urgency of talking in the language with which we all communicate every day. I learned a lot from her book. I learned a lot from this conversation. I think you will too. Your mom had you up here in Harlem, right? That's right. Yeah. She was part of that wave. Our family is from North Carolina. We are actually fortunate in a way that many black people learn. I mean, we've been in North Carolina for as many generations as we can count, but we did the whole great migration to Harlem, as most people did in North Carolina. That was the typical path and we took it. She had gone to college in North Carolina, married and had me in Harlem. Lasted a couple of years, her story is there was apparently, was it Sam, the serial killer? Yeah. Right. Son of Sam. Son of Sam. One summer is she decides that we can't live here. We move that to the North Carolina. Right. That's her story. That is, I mean, it's fun. That's a pretty good, that's a pretty good Spike Lee film, right? Yes. There's a Spike Lee film about that. That's the one when he was trying to go legit for the Academy and it didn't work. That, but that's an interesting movie. It sort of embodies like a kind of New York rock bottom situation. So that was she was going back home. Yeah. And so then you and you went back with her and you were raised in North Carolina. That's right. So for me, North Carolina is home. And you know, we were all from North Carolina. Even Harlem felt like North Carolina to us. I mean, we were there with a million other black people from North Carolina. But I grew up, yes, all around the state, but mostly in Charlotte, North Carolina. And I still like, consider homeless where most of my family now is. How did you become an academic? How do you? The heck knows. It wasn't even part of the lexicon for me. It wasn't that we weren't educated. Clearly, you know, my parents went to college, but like, which is itself, we should know. Like among a certain strata of folks in which a college education is taken for granted, there is a tremendous overestimation of the percentage of Americans that get a college education. You go one generation back. That's right. And it's even smaller. It's the same thing of like how many people took a flight this past year. Correct. It's like half of Americans do not take a flight in the air. That's right. For those of us who fly all the time, right? It seems pretty strange. Exactly. Yeah. So your mom went to college. Yeah, my mother and my father, both were products of historically black colleges, which is probably part of the story of why we didn't think of academia as a career path. We're like immigrants in the sense that we had four jobs you could do. You can be a teacher, a lawyer, a doctor, a preacher. And we think this is a job, by the way, right? So, and you know, I'm a little girl who can talk and write and that always been my thing. So I was supposed to be a lawyer. I didn't even know about other jobs. And were you kind of plucked early as like, this is a good student. This is a this is a. Yes. Yeah. I was that annoying. Yes. That was absolutely. Hand raised kind of situation. Nobody ever offered me drugs in school. I watched all of those dare programs and I kept waiting and waiting. Nobody offered it. It was clear apparently that I had the inclination to be a narc. That was me. I I did what the teachers wanted me to do. I was happy to do. I got passes to go to the library. OK, right. And then you went to an HBCU as well. Yeah, almost really didn't even know any other choice, right? Like I was recruited by other places, but that's what we've done. So I went to North Carolina Central in Durham, North Carolina. I have a pretty normal sort of experience there of Black College life. Is this ancillary wonderful and solar bubble that I think really figures pretty prominently, actually, in my intellectual development. I have to say, I, you know, historically, Black colleges and universities are not a world that I grew up knowing at all. Even though I was in the Bronx in the 1980s and I was in an extremely racially diverse heterogeneous world. Yeah. I knew nothing about it. Then I went to this very elite public magnet school in New York. And it's amazing to meet in my adult life in the careers of people that I follow, that I'm fans of, that I like how central is how central. I mean, even listening to Kamala Harris talk about it, there's something sort of striking to me about just how profoundly important those institutions are. They still, I mean, for everything that, you know, one of my bailiwicks is that I'm constantly promoting the value of historically Black colleges and universities. But just to our community still, despite, you know, years of being chronically underfunded and politically marginalized, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera, they still overwhelmingly produce our Black middle class, upper middle class, professional classes, Black doctors, Black lawyers, Black educators, still very much the point of access remains historically Black colleges. And you had a really good time there. Yes, I probably had too much fun. And I stayed there longer than my scholarship of last. Let's just say it was a checkered path to completion. But I had a great time. And then why do you want to be a sociologist? You know, I didn't even really know what sociology is when you go to a Black school, we have sociology, but it's not a discipline. And one of the things I've come to realize is that's because everything at a HBCU, a sociology, right? We're learning Black literature in our biology classes because our professors overwhelmingly came from Black colleges too. And they tend to be there, very mission oriented, right? And so every class you took had an element of what sociology does, which is the study of structures and systems, if only because we were trying to understand racism, right? And almost all of your courses. Right. So that's so pervasive. You can't, like the frame of analysis always has to be that at some level. That's right. So for me, sociology was just like this thing we had checked out. Like there was no robust sort of sociology department. You kind of didn't need it. It would be like having an African American literature class at a HBCU, right? Right. Like every English course was African American literature. So it was not until I'd started to do, I'd gone off and worked after undergrad, like I was not, I was going to go to law school, but I wanted to work a few years first. Life got in the way. I got married, all this other stuff. When I decided to go back to school, I was still thinking about law school. So I said, well, I'll take a couple courses and went back to my, I'll monitor, I'll take a couple courses to prepare for the LSAT. While I was there, there was this program that said, well, listen, we'll pay for these courses for you and we will give you a check and housing. Here's the thing. You just got to consider getting a PhD instead of a lot of degree. Well, you know, economic incentives being what they are that worked on me. And that's wild. Who set that up? Duke University set up mostly by like the African American faculty on that campus and consortium with our university and with the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. And it was to, you know, yeah, try to get more African American students and PhD programs. And so that was the way they did it. They said, look, if you're that and they were recruiting from the base of LSAT figures, that's pretty smart. Yeah. Because they, again, they know like everybody else in our community would know that we're probably there waiting to go to law school because that's what we know. You got a business degree, a law degree, or a medical degree, right? And so they said, well, yeah, sure, you know, but you got to promise us you're going to take the GRE instead and think about a PhD. And I get there and I go, I ended up being almost immediately good at research. You work with a senior researcher at Duke and I worked with one of the best. I worked with Sandy Darity still now at Duke University as an economist. And I worked truly just one of the best social thinkers alive today. And I ended up being really good at it. And he keeps saying to me, you're a sociologist. And I was like, I don't even really know what that is. Uh, it's like, no, you think about the world this way. And as it turned out, he was right. Right. I did this project and got into, you know, all the sociology programs I applied to. And as it turned out, I was a sociologist. You've got a really interesting career because you, you write academic, you have a book that I think grew out of your dissertation work. You got this new essay collection out, but you've also just been writing publicly. I mean, was that from the beginning that you were doing kind of public writing? You talk about the sort of experience of having pieces really take off and go viral. I think I first encountered your writing. The great piece you wrote about the kind of psychology of poor people buying expensive things, which is an incredible piece. And that was the first time I sort of encountered your byline and then started searching about like, how did that start? I think a couple of things again, I'm a sociologist. Right. So I got to think there's a structural explanation. And so there are a couple of things. I've not always been in internet cultures, right? I was a live journal early HTML programming kind of girl. I was on black planet. I've done all of that. Black planet. I'm telling you, black planet is like, plus black planet accounts for 90% probably the black famous people you know, and I'm not even kidding. Not even not a joke. No, planet. How do you think I know rock thing? Yeah. People think like we meant is no, we knew each other from black planet. But then everyone I mean is like, yes, it was black planet. That's where I found my voice. Well, that's like black Twitter. I mean, Twitter owes this existence. That is right. That's how we knew how to work that platform. We gave Twitter meaning because of what we had once built. At black planet. What was black planet? Black planets were black people went to get on the internet. So way back in the day before you had like Google, these interfaces, right? The internet, I just remember it being strange. Like you knew it was a thing because everybody was writing about it. You were all of a sudden getting email addresses. People were giving them to you. And I just remember being a relative. That's like 16 to 17 is about to go off to college. And all of us understood the internet was a thing, but nobody knew how to really get on it and what to do once you were there. And at the time, the solution to that were the AOL chat rooms, right? And so you could have an interest. You were supposed to organize around interest, gardening, et cetera, et cetera. Right. Right. The largest, almost immediately group that takes off is one called black planet and took on all this life of its own. Oh, it starts as an AOL chat group. It's every black person who was on the internet. We didn't know what else to do. What else is like subdivided into like gardening, right? Exactly. Black, black, black is like the UPN of its time. Right. It was just, wasn't that a more good? It's just, it's what we had. Right. So everybody was on black plan. I mean, I know family comes black planet.com, right? Which is like a message board. That's right. And so we start there. We learn our basic sort of coding. I remember you had to learn. This was again, before everything was sort of plug and play internet interfaces. And so you had to do a lot of sort of on the go programming. This was our early introduction to how the internet would work. So that's happening at the same time that I've always been a writer. But what else am I going to do in a group to represent myself in this text based environment? Totally. Totally. That carries over to live journal, which was about shaping a longer form writing community. The group there that was very influential was called black folk. And every black person I knew on live journal was in a group called black folk about quarter of those people now, people you would probably know. And it's, it is fascinating because we're a bit like, Hey, we never mentioned it publicly. That no, it's true. It's wild that, and it's also so much of internet culture. I mean, this, I am the one thousandth person to note this. So much of internet culture starts in black internet subculture and then kind of moves out from there. Yeah. Whether it's words, phrases, names, things originate very much in, you know, people shorthand at black Twitter. And so there's this like that history of it actually makes that coherent, makes sense. That's right. In a way. Yeah. And you're right. That history is not told. So it's like, Oh, look at this. Look at you. We just magically. That's right. You remember the articles from like back in 2008? Why are the black people are good at? They're so good at me. It's so fascinating. It's true. We've been working on this for 20 years. We're shopping in the lab. Yes. It's just you. What is it they always say about the ban? I liked them before they were right. They were hot. Yeah. We liked internet before. So you were so that's how you start. Yes. That's your kind of public facing your writing. And that's from the beginning of being out the world. Yeah. That predates my understanding. So it really made no sense to me when I enter academia for me to not do that. For me, that would be like giving up one's hobby, right? That they didn't own my whole life. So I kept writing. But that's a fraught thing. Yes, it is. I mean, you got to you tell a story in here about having an older colleague. Yes. Basically come up to you and be like, cut it out. That's right. There's a lot of censoring about what the profession and look, every profession is undergoing that, right? Like, what's the right way to be a journalist? Right? Oh, you're just one of those internet journalists, right? Right. Everybody is wrestling. Or you tweet too much, which is the thing that I've heard. Are you kidding me? That's pretty much a whole byline of my life. Like, if you weren't tweeting so much, you could do it. Same. And I'm like, I already do it. Same. I mean, this is what we're saying. It took forever to come to politics. That's really all anybody is now dealing with with the new freshman class, right? It's this resistance. It's the exact same thing. Oh my God. They're on Instagram, right? No, that's exactly like AOC is getting the message from her elder colleagues that you got at that conference. You tell the story of a woman coming up and being like, stop it. I'm so deeply basically that was my clear McCaskill, right? Seriously. It comes up to me and just out the blue and it's like, but was saying the thing that that was clearly being said about me behind those doors. She just has a two-minute rep. Exactly. Part of that being, frankly, if you were not born in that culture, they really could not imagine that I was doing both of those things simultaneously, that I was doing the deep academic work at the same time that I was doing the other stuff. Because there's a real status coding in academic environs about what is for public consumption, what's not, and what if you're talking too much to the public, it almost lowers your stock and status. Because then you're not expert enough. It is a reverse celebrity culture. Right. We have celebrities, but it works inversely proportional to why celebrity works or at large, which is we actually want you to be a micro celebrity, extremely well known with a small group of people, as opposed to popularly well known among the popular masses. But yeah. I want to talk about one of the sort of themes in this essay collection, which I think sort of tracks through your work, both sort of public and academic, which you've got this incredible essay here about competence, which is an essay about, well, first is an essay that centers on an incredibly chromatic experience that you had and how when you were pregnant and got to a hospital, how you were understood as having competence or not having. Right. Yeah. So the point of entry is I have these really weird things that I'll say I'm talking to my editor about the possibility of this essay. That's a, it was really supposed to be about how our technology makes us all incompetent in these ways that we can't solve. And I said, well, my way of thinking about this is I'm probably going to talk about this thing, that of all the things I've ever written about it, never written about it, had no intention of ever writing about it. But I had this draft that it just always sort of been in my files. And the fact that the essay exists in this book is really a reflection of how much I had grown to trust my editor and how much more comfortable I think I just was sort of with my voice. This was not a story I would have wanted to write an academic voice, for example, it was not a story that I would have been willing to write without the status to defend myself, right, that I now have as opposed to maybe a few years ago. Um, but it is an example of how oddly I come to topics because I actually didn't think that was the heart of the essay. I thought I'm going to tell this story about technological change, making us incompetent in the political economy won't allow us the competence to an act agency. But the way I was going to tell that was the way I had experienced it, perhaps most dramatically, which was the loss of my daughter and in an almost dying myself in childbirth. I'm a healthy young adult woman, married and educated and employed and I'm pregnant. And this should be the most in the United States of America, right? This should be the most sort of typical pregnancy known to man. And it was just not in the way that I understood it to be typical. By the time it was over, I understood it was actually very typical experience for black women and that experience involved at every step of the medical process, which is really just a stand in for how all of our organizations structure who is the acceptable, typical person that they'll work with, right? We have to make assumptions in an organization about who this organization is for. And then all of the processes are built out for that. You have to be English speaking because the forms are in English. You have to be this tall because that's why all the equipment is, right? You have to be this size for the gowns to fit. But that we don't think nearly as much about race and gender and how you need to present for the medical system to take you seriously. And being taken seriously, I argue, is the precondition for getting the actual healthcare to get actual healthcare from a healthcare organization. The healthcare organization has to assume that you're a competent subject on your own behalf, that when I say I'm in pain, it is actual pain. That when I say I am in labor and I'm having a contraction, I am having a contraction, right? It has to assume that I can actually speak to those things competently. And at every step of the process of my medical experience, every medical professional, this is really important, I think, for people to take away from that story. I'm not talking about one bad doctor, right? Or one bad nurse. I mean, when you're in the hospital for three and a half, four days, which I was, yeah, this is a constant rotation of people. Everyone is making this assumption about me. And I think one of the, for me personally, anyway, one of the points of reflection for me once I was able to, many years of reflecting on the experience was how I was actually kind of angry with myself that I had ever expected better, right? That I had clearly had bought into the idea more than I was comfortable with, that I had somehow earned a little bit more extension of grace from an organization. And I had not. And you also say in the essay, you go to this hospital, you said you'd chosen it because it is a frequented and used by affluent white women. That's right. It's like, where should I go? Well, that this is the place with a community that has a lot of social capital. That's right. Goes you go in and you say you're having pain at four, four and a half months, right? And you get sent home, you come back again, end up miscarrying. And at every step, they just don't take you seriously enough to do what they should do medically. There's a moment when I'm sitting in the waiting room of my obstetrics office and I'm literally bleeding all over the chair and I can't get them to take me to the back room, right? Until it becomes a problem for the other people in the waiting room because that's who medical care was for, the other people in the medical room. Those were the healthy, attractive, metal and upper class white women, right? Again, I chosen it with the same logic that we choose schools, that we choose neighborhoods, that we choose which grocery store and which TJ Maxx will go to. The one on the quote, unquote, good side of town. That's right. That was, that was the rough sort of cultural geography I knew to use. And everyone uses that shortcut. That's right. All of a student, that's like, how deeply ashamed I was when I realized I had done all of those things, right? Knowing what I knew about how such things work and then had the nerve to sort of be surprised that it had not worked for me. When, of course, it was never designed to work for me. One of the takeaways of that essay is just, you know, it's a very, it's extremely profound and moving story I have to say as someone who does not have access to it subjectively for a variety of reasons. You talk about Serena Williams too afterwards, which that story just blew my mind in half. And I know, again, I shouldn't be surprised when I get that. But that story literally blew my mind. Like the Serena Williams had to Serena Williams had to get up in a hospital and be like, I am the person in the world who is literally most in touch with her own body of any human on the planet. And I am telling you as that person that there is something going wrong here that you need to deal with. And she had to fight for it too. That's correct. And I think she even says in one of the, one of the interviews she was in touch, like she had to pull on her husband's, you know, Boniface is saying it right. Like, can you imagine your Serena Williams and you, you've kind of got to have your husband and proxy to sort of add to your legitimacy for saying that you're in pain. It's one of those ways that we can talk about how race works because here's the thing that is as true for black men, probably in different ways of this for black women. But I bet we have a hard time imagining them doing that to LeBron James. And arguably Serena and LeBron are the greatest athletes in the, in the world at this point in time. And I have find it very hard to believe that LeBron would have to turn to his wife to get her to mediate the conversation with his medical doctors, right? The idea that celebrity, the greatest escape out of all social norms and our culture, that's right. You can get right as super seats. Every social norm we have that if black women achieving that level of celebrity cannot get a system of healthcare to work for them, there is absolutely no hope for the rest of us. How do you think about the category of black women? Like here's the reason I asked that. I feel like they're, we're having this moment, you have a very funny essay called Black People Are Over Here. And you mentioned this about the trust black women. Yes. Which I both think is like both good advice, but always ruse me a little the wrong way because it feels like it's this over corrected reductive category that ends up being invoked. I understand. It sounds like it's asking you to turn off your critical thinking faculties. That, but also there's a trope. There's a trope and you write about this trope. There's like a certain kind of like wise black women. That is a trope in Hollywood. There's a trope in storytelling. I was like, everything is so wise. That's right. No, yeah. Listen, it comes in to tell the white people who are like bumbling around and not finding their true love, like how to get it together. I love my people. Here's the thing about the internet. So first of all, you know, the great joke that, you know, nobody knows your dog on the internet. For all I know, some of the people who are masquerading as black women are not even black. But let's just say the sort of just just I was on Black Planet for like seven years. Yeah, I figured that was you. I probably know which one was you. Cookie Monster, seventy three for me. That was me. You know, so that's the first thing. But there is, you know, there's an economics to the digital culture, which is you have to get people to give you money. Right. And one of the ways you do that, actually, the primary way is through attention, you know, this attention economy we have. The trick for everyone is converting the attention into actual money. Right. So we come up with these slogans that I think, you know, are supposed to drive people to people's cash app. Right. And I listen, I. OK, we're all in that vortex. Like you're 100% correct. That is that is the PEM game is the PEM game. And just let's just learn the rules. Let's just be honest about it. Right. That to me is a whole other thing that has absolutely nothing to do with black women, except that some of the things that we talk about are very useful as discursive tools to get people to do that. The real substantive conversation, I think about, you know, trust black women, believe black women. My understanding of that is not to say to trust everything black women say as being an unchallengeable fact, but to trust them as authorities on their ability to say it. Now that's quite different. That is about the fact that in all of my work to date, and I'm just going to go ahead and say it, I think I am one of the most cited, most discussed sociologists, public sociologists working in my profession today. And I can count on one hand, the number of my colleagues who have taken my work critically, seriously. Right. Yeah, they take me seriously. They don't mind critiquing me, the person, but to trust black women would be to assume that you could take off the table that I needed to justify my ability to do my work. And instead to take my work seriously, that's what we mean about trusting black women. And that's where, you know, it's so interesting to bring that point out, because you write about this a little bit about the ways in which being a black woman writing, there's a push to write about being a black woman, because like, that's the consumable content about your life. As opposed to like, here's my very rigorous work on lower education. Yeah. And again, that's because there's a lot of attention available to people who want to participate that. And there are lots of people willing to do that. That's the way the internet works. Part of it is, you know, there's an old Simpsons episode where like Homer Simpsons is watching a stand up routine and it's a black Santa con and he's like, white guys drive like this and black drive like this. And he's like, it's so true. We're so lame. And there's a little bit of the racial discourse, even in like the woke left racial discourse online gets very white people dance like this, black people like this sometimes in a way, I just feel like so effing reductive. And that's just the medium. I think you're right. Like, what's troubling me is the attentional impulses of the medium as opposed to what's under it. But I do worry that like the complexity with which say that you write about it here, people are not getting that. Well, yeah, I mean, I mean, well, that's the whole point. Take away version of stuff and not the discourse, which, listen, my friends get on me all the time about asking too much of people. Well, these are stuff in here that the essay about in the name of beauty is a challenging essay. It's a great essay. I take that as a compliment. Yeah. I read it twice and it's like, I was like, man, I haven't worked this. I haven't worked this hard in a while. Because it's really it's dense and it's thick and it's thick. Yeah, there you go. I thought if we do this right, we've done enough thin, right? Right. We've got we've got thin slices of media, thin slices of politics, thin slices of philosophy, thin slices. I feel like the idea of intellectualism had accelerated towards you sort of very thin margins. You really only operate push at the margins of thinking so much before I think you lose all of the explanatory power of everything that you're saying. The point for me was to say, yeah, but we've got this really rich tradition of actually being really complex and nuanced about how the world works. That's deeply embedded in black feminist philosophy that I think is really useful for very thin time. The collection of slogans that supplant politics, the collection of sort of sound bites that I think supplant public discourse. So we've got this going in just all the arenas of public life and political life. Listen, this is a minor shot across the bow. Those just to say we can push back. And I think that if I can get people to take seriously a dense essay on something that is not about themselves, because people do dense when they are the subject. People love actually to go fake deep when they're all about themselves. That's a good point. Yeah, we love that. Give me more of that stuff. But yeah, if I can get people to do that, right, to remember one that we're capable of doing it, we have the capacity to do it. That is not nearly as terrifying as I think the slow beneering of our life has made us believe that it is. That is absolutely possible to not have the right answer to something and still do something pretty good with it. Yeah, that's a great way of saying it. I mean, I like what's great about this collection and what I think, yeah, what it's pushing at is just like pushing a complexity, pushing at difficulty, like all these things that we that I learned in school at a college a little bit troubling concepts and stuff like that. That is part of the academic tradition that you're that you come out of. A lot of that discourse has been channeled to the public. Yes. But it's been channeled in a very flat way. And that's partly out of necessity. But the way that we're getting these very thick concepts and complicated, difficult ones that come out of a sort of discourse of critiquing the hierarchies that exist in social life, get shaved out into these slogans. And I think seeing peeing around, I'm like, no, that I mean, they may pour Kimberly Crenshaw come out and tell people to stop saying intersectionality. Right. I mean, like a woman with my name, her business. That's what we do. By the way, Kimberly Crenshaw, who is the black woman, law professor, academic, who sort of, I think coined the term. Yeah, maybe not the idea. Existed term before, but the idea is that had coined the term of intersectionality. Yeah. And she and she. Yeah. So she writes this piece of the, you're like, I think it was about a year ago or something. She was like, okay, y'all, y'all got to chill. Right. Like, it's kind of a words and Kimberly's mouth. But she was kind of just like, y'all, chill. I appreciate it. Right. Like I appreciate the name drops in the citations, but I don't recognize what you guys are talking about at all. That's a perfect example of a phenomenon I'm talking about. Exactly. Sort of specifies it. You, your academic work, I think your first book is fantastic. I read it. Thank you. Really changed the way I think about or, or, or enlighten me in how thinking about education, it's called lower ed. And I think there's a real relationship between where you're coming from and the kind of work you're doing. Tell me about what your academic work is about and how you decided that was going to be your, your work. There's this article about 2008, the article comes out and it lists all of the schools, which is a list, annual list they've done for decades, the schools that produce the most African American students with bachelor's degrees that year. Right. And it's a holdover from the 1960s, 70s jet era where, you know, you published all the black notable facts. No week. And so it's, it's classic. It's awesome. That's right. It's just awesome list. It's just such a throwback. And this list this year listed the number one producer of black people with a bachelor's degree was not the HBC as we talked about, right? That have produced all these notable black people that we were talking about. But it was the University of Phoenix, which was a for profit college. And I knew immediately what the University of Phoenix was. But at the time this happened, I'm sitting in Duke University in a coffee shop with my mentor and we're talking about a research project and the list is sitting there and he kind of goes, University of Phoenix, like, where is that? Is that in like Tempe? Right. He hates the story now. Cause now he's like, I know, I know what it is now. I was like, I know, but the moment. And I thought, here was the moment, right? I'm sitting in Duke University. If the professor of economic inequality and stratification, sitting in Duke University has been studying racial inequality his entire life, hadn't, you know, didn't have purchase on this thing that was producing more black people. But that was the reason any other historically black college that year, something had happened and it happened fast. And why did I know what it was? And he didn't. Well, this is the question of class, right? I had not been born of the world that sends one to Duke or Harvard or Yale, Princeton, et cetera. I had been born of one that while we had gone to college, we were also still very approximate to working class. If we weren't, then certainly people in our family were. And so I knew what for-profit colleges were because I knew people who had attended them. I knew that they were structurally different, even if I didn't understand how or why. And so when I tell them what it is, he goes, you know what this is. He was like, well, this should be your work. And I'm thinking surely someone has done this, right? This phenomenon has taken in two, three billion dollars a year, federal student aid money, enrolling two and a half million students. That's in the news all the time. Surely someone way more important than me had figured out what was going on. And I go and do the thing we're trying to do, which is you go find all the literature about your subject and there isn't any. And I thought, well, I'm clearly doing it wrong. So I try again and again and again for about a year, honestly, seriously, I couldn't fathom that someone had not taken seriously the millions of students in these institutions seriously enough to find out what the hell was going on and why so many of them were black and why so many of them were women. Well, of course, the question was its answer. Nobody had bothered because so many of them were black and so many of them were women, right? By and large, we study ourselves, right? Some aspect of ourselves. It's the great truism of academia. We are all studying ourselves. And because people like that had not made it into a research community, no one had bothered to ask, not really seriously, and not in any sustained way. And certainly not in the social sciences, economists or sociologists. And so as is often the case when it comes to my work, I was a little pissed off. And I thought, well, how are we going to resolve that? Well, you resolve that, but trying to get at the heart of why you think no one's asking the question. And that's really where the book starts because there wasn't anyone like me capable and able and trained to do that kind of work. The world that you end up writing about is massive. Yes. And fascinating and infuriating. I think all three of those things. What, what did you find? So I found, you know, the short answer is this theme that we could probably say, just maybe the theme of the 21st century, but we had not thought about higher education had just been thought of as the sort of untouchable engine for upward mobility and equality. The truism had become so powerful. The myth had become so powerful that even people who were sort of critiquing the edges of higher education weren't critiquing its core, right? Whether or not that was still true. Most of that myth had been built on the mid 20th century colleges and universities. But this was this new thing. These were these colleges owned by and large by shareholder companies or private families, private corporations that were not part of the higher education universe. And the story is this is that as the world of work had changed and we help people responsible for their own individual economic security when the government and social policy isn't willing to make you secure. Employers are no longer willing to make you secure because that's globalization. When you're on your own, the only thing we had given workers to make themselves more economically viable was we told them to go to school, train yourself, get more skills and capital. That's all cost. We had to succeed in the 20th, 21st century. The jobs of the future. Remember all of those? Yes. Nobody knew what the jobs were. We just knew they were of the future. And we needed to get them ready. That's correct. Right. But you got to be standing there. And you don't you can't do that. So we told millions of people to take on the individual opportunity costs, sit out the labor market, et cetera, do what you got to do. And the individual economic costs pay the tuition to go well, and we will subsidize it and we will subsidize the heck out of it. That's an important part of the story. This only becomes profitable and interesting to the private sector because of the public investment, right? The public investment in securing much like the mortgage crisis. These are secured by the federal government. So the for profit colleges themselves are mainly off the hook. I T T doesn't care that it went out of business. It had made 10, $15 trillion by that time. Everybody was happy to walk away when these schools closed. The only people who couldn't walk away were the students. And these were students who were disproportionately already impacted by all those other things that were happening in the economy. They were more likely to be working in jobs that were undergoing structural change, meaning shift from salary work to hourly work. They were the people more likely to be sort of stuck in jobs where the job mobility or the ability for it to be promoted within the same company had flattened over time. They were more likely to be women who were bearing the cost of childcare. This is a huge part of the story. 70% of the students enrolled in for profit colleges were women right now. I think it's about 66%, but it's almost always about three quarters. So when we're talking about this problem, this was a gendered problem. This was about women who couldn't afford childcare. So they couldn't go to the evening classes down the street at the community college because we don't provide some of that. I was daycare in this country. What they did was they got the loans and they paid for it as to be a full stock time student because that was the way they can make it. The only way you can't change any other part of your life. You can't stop being a mom. You can't stop going to work. You can't stop paying the rent. Can't stop taking care of your husband. But we have told you that the only way for you to be better at any of those things is to go to college. You know, there's this debate, an interesting debate about when you talk about mobility and the higher earning potential say college graduates, people with four year college. Right. So there's this question to oversimplify. So two theories, right? One is that those people have better wages because they acquire human capital in the four year college that better suits them for the job skills of the 21st century. And then they go out to the market and that is the market price for their skills. The other is that it's essentially just playing a credentialing function and not a human capital function. And so that incomes this world that it that kind of tests the thesis. That's it. And it is. Right. If you take out the human element, it was one of the most elegant natural experiment set of experimental conditions that we had seen in the higher education space. That's exactly what it was. Because because now we're going to see, OK, what happens if you get rid of the credentialing aspect of it because people don't know what University of Phoenix is, but that's what they're selling in some ways. Yep. And then what does happen? That's right. So this is what happens. This is what we now know, which is what people had argued for quite some time, but we now have the most convincing evidence of the labor market pays as much for signaling or the credential as it does for human capital. Right. Right. And that is true up and down the class hierarchy. That's for lower income as well as upper income and with race and all that attached to it. So that's true, whether you're working in an elite financial service sector, or you're working in the call center, you know, at the bank. Partly that happens because there is not an efficient way to determine one's human capital. The only thing we can do is try to hire someone sometime. Listen, I wish more people would know, seriously, I wish more people would. And then tell me that you've got a better system for that. We don't, you know, there are so many jobs that I would be terrible at. On my own staff. OK. That I would interview very well for and not be good at. That makes your Japanese job. I would be bad at I would be terrible at Tiffany's job. Tiffany keeps the show on time every night. She sort of manages this incredibly sophisticated. It's like our version of air traffic control. Right. I would not be good. You do not want me doing that job. Now, if I came in with my like nice fancy degree and my like my love you, my way of talking that is communicates a certain that's a socioeconomic credential. Yes. Maybe you would hire me to do that job. And I would like to do a good job. Empirically, we would hire the hell out of you. Yes. Right. Oh, you're exactly who we would hire. Do not do not do that. Don't I'm not. Yeah. No, I'm the same. I tell people the same thing. I am perfectly suited for the work that I have. Right. That's right. And none of the 49 other jobs I had before I got it. And figuring that out is tough. Right. So right. So because that's because there's something mysterious and now chemical about that. Right. What's happening here in labor markets is that the credential is standing in for some rough approximation of that because we don't actually have a very good way of doing this capital part of it. That's right. It's closest proxy is to sustain in for social class. Right. And what happens is that employers on the other side became increasingly sophisticated assessing if you are now suddenly getting more people with those credentials, which is what a university of Phoenix like system does. It just produces more people with the credential. Right. It floods the mark with the credential. That is right. The system becomes all right. How can we become more efficient than at sorting those credentials? And what you do is you rely on those same four or five institutions that have all weight that we've always relied on the value accrued to the elite institutions. Because those were the only ones that we had mutual sort of mass agreement were the ones that were worth the investment. Everybody else gets swept up in this sort of mushy middle and lower end. And yet what's so messed up about it is that the thing that they're selling to these people who are doing the thing that they are told to do. These are people that are poor people working class folks who are being told to uproot your life, take out a lot of debt. Do this very difficult thing because the way this society works is you need to do it and put it in yourself and they're like, that's right. I'm all in doing it. I'm in. I'm going to take the responsibility. I'm going to go to school even though it's the last thing in the world that my household could deal with right now and they come out of it and it's like, screw you, why didn't you go to a better school? That's literally what our social policy said to people. They came out on the other side and we said, screw you, why didn't you go to a better school? Yeah. What do you do? What's the university? We gave you an online tool. You were supposed to plug in your information and figure out the right one. This is literally the types of solutions we come up with, by the way, which is why we don't deserve to exist anymore. But so the solution to this mass problem was to build a website where people would go and plug in their information and what tell them the school that would be worth their student loan investment. I mean, really, I mean, it is so ridiculous, right? The assessment, it is still assuming that the student could ever figure out the complexities of the labor market. The labor market hasn't figured out the complexities of the labor market, but that's what happens when social policy doesn't feel the void. And social policy doesn't feel the void and you voucherize people, which is what we do. We subsidize, we voucherize them. The private sector will just make it a profit extraction. And that's what it will happen. Well, and then there's real sort of, there's a sort of spectrum of legitimate, entirely predatory of the outfits. Some of them are just essentially like a Glengarry Glen Ross kind of situation of getting people up and getting the suit loan and then like you're out in your ass. Right. Yeah. I call it a timeshare model. Yeah. Which is actually very much what the enrollment process of for-profit colleges is like is that timeshare instant rapport. That's right. Close, close, close that day, et cetera. It runs. All of them have that process, but the quality or at least the investment in the credential ranges from that to something to be quite honest. I don't know that there is much of a difference between getting a masters in education from the University of Phoenix and getting one down the street at your local state flagship. Your state flagship is not happy about that truth, but we don't have any empirical evidence. Those really aren't quite that different. Right. So this is where the story gets complicated because it's not like it wasn't like the classes weren't real. Right. And some of the education was perfectly good. Yes. Part of the problem here is that it turned out that the labor market wanted to eventually- Want it was not that. That is correct. And the problem of what we were asking them to do, this is a part where I say they have an arguments, a fair argument is just not made in good faith on their part. Those four-profit schools will say, listen, we're doing a better job than, you know, such and such nonprofit college down the street. And I go, yeah, but you also know it doesn't matter how good a job you do. The fact in the matter is a place like a University of Phoenix is never going to do the sort of transformation of your social capital that you need. If you are a poor brown woman with a baby strap to your back, it could never do that for you, no matter how good your human capital development was, because the reality is not what we're doing. And their argument always is we are attending to and actually investing in the human capital of this underserved population. So why are you mad at us? You're just reifying the status hierarchy. That's right. This is the way they would defend themselves. That's right. And then what, I mean, the whole thing kind of blew up, right? At a certain point, the Obama administration comes in, changes the policy for student loans, which is very controversial. They lobby against it. They're still fighting. They're still fighting. How is this shaken out now? So as much as I think oversight mattered, and it did, absolutely. Actually, because the Obama staff or people will call me when I don't say that strongly enough. So I want to go on the record. It mattered. OK, it did not ultimately matter nearly as much as changes in the labor market. So what really happens is you always have this, the cycle when the labor market is bad. People go back to school because you got to do something to sit it out. And a lot of that just about you have to demonstrate the people that you were doing something during your downtime. It really is a moral. That's right. It really is just a moral credential out of the stigma of being unemployed. That's what people are doing, are paying for. And this happened like law schools, all these places enrollment went through. That's right. So some of that was always a bubble, right? So the bubble burst, but the four private college sector overstate, the bubble didn't burst. And now they're all out of business. The bubble burst and it sort of flatlined back to where it has historically kind of been. It's share of the overall pie is roughly now about what it was in 93ish before. Oh, right. So we lost some of the big chains, ITT, the Corinthian college ones, which were the ones with the worst sort of commercials and aggressive advertising, right? Yeah, they. I missed those commercials because they always made my case so beautiful. And I would do these presentations. I mean, those weren't just some of the most obvious egregious actors and have left behind the ones that were a little bit more financially stable, didn't overreach quite as much in aggressive marketing and taking on a student loan debt and default. But what those schools also have in common is that they never doubled down quite so much on serving women and poor people and people of color. Those students at a place like Australia is something more likely to be male and right. Interesting. And so what it means is that it was about that larger issue of social inequality that you honestly just can't build a good faith institution built on this foundation of inequality. Is the end then? Okay. So then what are we left with there from a policy standpoint? Is there a way to produce in, I mean, HBCUs, I guess, for an example, right? There are institutions that manage to combine both in that they do function as engines of social mobility because they lend whatever they're doing in the human capital side and education tied. They're taking folks from backgrounds that wouldn't necessarily catapult them towards a credential and they are doing that. That is correct. I think our lesson here, and it's a lesson that we knew is just that it's not a convenient policy lesson, right? Policymakers know this. It is just more expensive to do that work than we want it to be. Period. That's all. It's not that we don't know how to do this. This is our takeaway from like what? We're at like 80 years now, sociology of education and some of people in my subfield like to joke like there are no new answers. We have known sort of the answer for a very long time, which is it can surely be done. It takes longer and it takes more money than we are generally willing to spend to do it. What needs to happen is human capital development and social capital development is the social capital part. That's a tough part because that usually means a host of wraparound services. Because social capital is what we give from our families, our communities, the cultural norms and signals that we learn. And basically a lot of what a place like historically black college was about was about giving you that, right? Giving you this new shared base of that is right. So there are now people that you can go intern for that you did not have those connections before and now you do have that is right. Yeah. And that more than almost anything is what people who come from backgrounds that are not already born going to Ivy League institution need the most. And that's the thing that we are. That's the hardest sale to make to policy people because it's hard to count. Right. It's not an economic equation, but it's the thing that we know works. What are you working on now? Sleep. But no, I keep thinking about as you can probably tell, like I'm really obsessed with finding right now. I don't know what the answer is because I'm still working on the good question. But the question I'm leading to right now is absolutely something about technology. I want to ask a question of that that has not quite yet been asked. And I think it's somewhere in the way I approach most of my questions is if I start with the community that has not yet been centered in the analysis, I usually come up with a really good question. That's how Laura Ed happens. Oh, I'm just going to talk about the women. And look, when I do that, this whole thing opens up, right? The essays are about, oh, I'm going to talk about black women. And when I do that, this whole world opens up. I think we have centered the conversation about technology, whether that's digital technologies or surveillance, the policy, cultural change, the economic models have centered a lot on white boys in Silicon Valley. And the way I'm pitching it right now is I want to tell the story about technology that doesn't talk about them at all. And let's see what happens. But yeah, I'm still working on that. I thought I'm the thing you said, I thought really efficiently about attention and how that works is something I'm personally obsessed with because I'm living it all the time. And it's the thing I worry most about. Same here. Tressy McMillan Cotton is a sociology professor of the Virginia Commonwealth University. Her newest collection of essays is called Thick. It's really excellent. It's a great read, challenging in all the best kind of ways. Her first book is called Lower Ed. It was great, great to have you here. Same here. Thanks for finally making this happen. I've only I've only been hounding you on Twitter for you. But we'll let that part slide. And seriously, thank you. Thank you. Thanks. Once again, my thanks to Dr. Tressy McMillan Cotton, two books that she discusses in that conversation. The first is Lower Ed, which is about her research, which is really mind-blowing and is really the only kind of study of its kind of this entire world of higher education in the US. And the second is her latest essay collection, which is thick, which really challenged me like they were some tough reads. I had to get out the pen and underline and work at it. And it was extremely rewarding work. So I really recommend you go out and you cop that. All right. We love to hear from you. You can tweet us hashtag with pod email with pod at gmail.com. We got great feedback on our little experiment on the New York City subway, which I worried was going to be too provincial. I did have someone on Twitter being like, what about the rest of us? And only New York City. I was like, that's a fair point. But a lot of people who don't live in New York City, people who don't take the subway who are set foot in the subway really liked it. There was someone who tweeted at me and I can't remember their handle. There's a there's a moment in the conversation where I say, I try to set up why if you're driving to work in Iowa City, Iowa, you should care about this. And someone tweeted saying like, I listened this episode from Iowa City, Iowa. So mission accomplished, I think it was great to have Aaron Gordon on the show. He wrote a follow up piece to go along with that conversation. You can find it at NBC news.com slash wise is happening. Another important thing, tickets to the live with pod February 24th with the one and only Stacey Abrams, the tickets have gone very fast, uh, faster than I think any well, Tiffany champion, who's got a sort of just inner chillness and confidence about her. She was not stressing that we were going to sell the tickets. I was maybe stressing them a little bit. I was, yes, yes, I was stressing a little bit. Well, I didn't know how, wha, whatever. We sold them and we sold them very fast, um, too fast in some ways, because I think people felt like they got there right at the time we said they would be available and weren't able to buy them. We're learning our lesson. Like I said, we're scaling this up next time. We're doing a 10,000 seat venue. We're just oscillate wildly from like, from too small to way too big. Um, no. So here's the thing at Tiffany and my direction, we have set aside a few, a few tickets to give away to with pod devoted, with pod listeners who were not able to get tickets, but would like to come see the show. We're trying to figure out the mechanism that we're going to do to give that, to do that, like some little contest or something. Like, can you do a podcast call and show like them, like the old Mr. Showskit? Um, I don't know how we will do it, but we will come up with some means of giving away these, this small group of tickets we have to devoted listeners and we will, we will announce that in next week's episode. So stay tuned for that. And like I said, this is the first of many. If you're not in New York, if you love the show, if you want to come watch, uh, me talk to someone live, we will really do everything we can over the next year, uh, to, to make that happen, uh, as much as we can. So why is this happening is presented by MSNBC and NBC news produced by the all in team and featured music by Eddie Cooper? Like I mentioned before, you can find a lot of great stuff for the podcast by going to NBC news.com slash wisest happening."
