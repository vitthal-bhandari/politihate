    "text": " Welcome back to another episode of your ROM with Molly Emmingway and David Harsani. Molly, I think you're on the road this week. I am I'm on my laptop. I don't have a proper microphone. I am staying in a college dorm because I'm chaperoning my church's youth group to the higher things Lutheran youth conference. There's like a weed wacker outside my dorm window right now. I don't even know if you can hear me, but here I am. We can. Okay, we do things low-fi sometimes, but we're high-brow. Today, today as we speak, Molly, Hunter Biden, the son of the president is in a courtroom accepting a plea deal for I think two misdemeanors on tax evasion charges, which I think will be if he, you know, goes through probation without any problems won't even be on his permanent record in the long run. So much is going on with the Biden, Hunter Biden case, which I always called a Hunter Biden case, but really it's a Joe Biden case, right? We keep it's not really for me at least. It's not Hunter Biden. That's the problem. I don't really care what Hunter Biden does. I mean, to some extent, it is, but it's a Joe Biden problem. It's in the Biden family's interest. If you think of it as a Hunter Biden problem instead of a Biden family business problem or even an FBI Department of Justice problem because Hunter Biden, I feel like his whole life maybe has been the scapegoat for his family. I'm not saying he's not responsible for his own awful behavior, but it seems like he's the bag man. He goes out and gets the money that is given for reasons I truly do not understand unless it's to affect policy decisions by the United States government. Thanks to Joe Biden's prominent role in the Senate, Vice President presidency. He gets the money. He's the primary money maker, money taker, but there are like eight family members that take the money. And they're all taking the money, not because the Biden family is world renowned for their expertise in energy exploration or anything. They get the money because of Joe Biden. So it's not a Hunter Biden thing, even though he's born the brunt of it. It's a Joe Biden thing. And then it's a Joe Biden thing in two ways, his family business, but also his Department of Justice working to help him cover that up while also going after his foremost political enemy. I would say that Hunter Biden and the Biden family knows as much about energy exploration and investment opportunities or have as much talent in that department as he as Hunter Biden does in painting, right? And yet he benefits, he gets millions of dollars, 17 million we saw when having to do with Romania, Ukraine, China, and and his art sold for 1.3 his one painting, I believe, so for 1.3 million to a democratic activist who has given over $200,000 to Joe Biden himself, basically, no one in the media care. So they said all you would not even if you were just reading the New York Times, Washington Post, watching the major networks, MSNBC, you would not know anything. Anything was going on, which is just insane. So I do want to say, I think that story about the money laundering with the painting and the Democrat donors to finance Hunter Biden. I think that was actually broken by what's called business insider or something like that, which is not. Yeah, I mean, I don't know exactly what it is. Yeah, like a left left leaning a little bit lefty. Yeah. So credit to them for breaking that. That's a kind of explosive story that could take down any other president. And I'm not even sure the New York Times has covered it. I think New York Times readers are the most misinformed and uninformed people on planet Earth. They just don't get any news about what's going on. It's like this, the, that newspaper exists to tell people if they have to worry about anything. And they're saying, at this point, no worries. Don't, we're not even going to cover it. We're not going to take these stories. Like, I know it's, I know, I know we keep doing this, but like, we had years of hysteria without any of this, you know, there would be like an unsourced rumor from nobody that was completely invented. And it would run the news cycle for months. And here you have actual evidence of this type of money laundering. I mean, I don't think anyone in the world, I could be wrong, but I don't even think. I don't think Hunter Biden's own family members think his art is worth anything. And if it were worth anything, it might be more in the hundreds or thousands at best, certainly not in the tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. So like nobody, nobody thinks this is legit. And yet it's just like not even the biggest scandal of the week for the Biden's. And it's not even one that's getting covered by corporate leftist media propaganda. It's kind of amazing because everyone knows, if you read about money laundering, that the best way to launder money is to find something that doesn't have an objective value, completely subjective art is a subjective thing and you can pay whatever you want for it. So it is like the number one way, like people launder, or one of the big ways people launder money. And here you are. And it is not even a story. I don't even know what you prosecute him. I mean, what, what would this, it's just a scandal of corruption. There's no legality in it or anything. I think there would be some, I mean, I'm thinking about how the Trump family was known for decades as having a global real estate empire. That's the opposite of intangible. That's quite tangible, quite, you know, you can compare things. The Washington Post had teams of reporters trying to figure out like how Trump was profiting off of the presidency. And of course, like the really weird story at the every president goes in at some income level and comes out like a gazillionaire, like Barack Obama has the houses of kings in multiple locations across the country. He, you know, from Hawaii to Martha's vineyard. He travels globally at the nicest places. And I don't think he's ever really done anything. I could be wrong. I don't, has he done anything like with his, I mean, I know he's president. I'm not saying he hasn't had jobs, but has he done anything to to get money? You mean anything tangible? Like has he produced something? No, he's, you know, but listen, I guess. I get that next president is going to make a lot of money on publishing, on appearances on things. I guess I get that. OK, yeah, I just point is he went in at some income level. He came out wealthier than, you know, ancient kings. And nobody cares. Donald Trump, who went in as a billionaire with a, like real business, came out poorer, poorer. And the media are like trying to find scandal there. And here you have, you know, the Biden family business, which nobody has bothered to explain. Like I'm literally like, OK, OK, so it's not corrupt that all these foreign oligarchs and Chinese affiliated people are giving you millions of dollars. OK, why are they giving you the money? What are they getting for it? And nobody even bothers to explain the media. Don't ask. But anyway, my point is being all the legitimate business concerns of the Trump's, which I'm sure I say legitimate, not like to praise their business model or anything like that. But I'm just saying they were known as a brand in global real estate. That was all scrutinized beyond belief and nobody's scrutinizing this. And they still tried to go after him for all sorts of ethics issues related to when he was president, blah, blah. I just I don't I just don't think that someone who has money for for almost their for their whole life. I mean, Trump was born into into money is really motivated that much by money. Those people are usually motivated because they want power or prestige or, you know, things like that. And that's what Trump was about is clearly not a money-making operation. It's been his business has been devastated. Right. People are taking Trump signs off their, you know, business and stuff like that. So I just don't think he did it for money, but they're always I always get people saying, what about Ivana? Evon, wait, which is the daughter Ivanka? Ivanka and Jared and Jared. What about them? Well, Jared's family, I believe, is richer than Trump. They have a massive business going on. There is nothing illegal about what they're doing. I have yet to see anyone show me that he was trading in government access or favors to make money. Hold on. Yeah. Looks, I mean, I think there actually might be something there, meaning clearly Jared spent his entire time as a White House advisor working for peace in the Middle East specifically between Israel and all these different countries and, you know, including Saudi Arabia, right? They definitely repositioned American foreign policy. You know, for reasons that I like, I don't make any money off of this, but I actually do think we should be more. I think everyone in that region might be a bad actor, but I'd rather work with the Saudis than Iran, just for, we can go into that later. But there's no question that Jared did move or helped move our posture away from Iran and toward Saudi Arabia and brokering all of these peace agreements. And peace gets you a lot of money and know a lot of people in DC like to do it through war, but peace is another way to make a lot of money. And there were all these great agreements and clearly the Saudis benefited mightily from it. And I do think they rewarded Jared and Ivanka or they just found them to be good partners to work with. I don't know. I don't have a problem with people looking into it, but I also think like, OK, so let's let's just say it's bad what Jared and Ivanka did or that they got money money from the Saudis in exchange. The US got peace in the Middle East. Hunter and Joe got us a war in Ukraine that puts us on the brink of like a third world war. If people are working in their self interest, I'd rather they work for peace agreements that benefit the world rather than like, oh, and by the way, we might have a nuclear apocalypse, but we got wealthy in the meantime. Yeah, I mean, I don't I agree that peace is far more beneficial for for people to make more people rich than than war. I think the Gulf States, especially Saudi Arabia has always been an American ally. So it wasn't any kind of new. You know, I mean, they benefit very slightly. I mean, I think they were just a rich country because of oil and it wouldn't change much. But I don't listen, I don't even care. Put everyone in jail. I'm fine. Put it all the Trump administration in jail. That's fine. That none of that detracts from the fact that we have a $17 million business run by the president's son, where we now have we have here's my take on this just quickly, even if and I wrote about this, but even if in the best case scenario, if you put the best light on what happened, right? It is still incredibly corrupt. We now have so we I just want to go through it quickly. We have Hunter by talking about how his dad was involved in the business. Why would he lie about it? He even never knew those emails were going to be made public, right? Then we have Hunter's former business partner saying it. We have Hunter's best ex best friend saying it. 200 other incidents possibly of contact, you know, that we know about an FBI informant saying that he was, you know, strong arming or, you know, places for money and we have an IRS whistleblower who says he was at a meeting. So all those people who have nothing to do with each other before they ever knew he was going to be president in some cases, all came up with the same story at the same time. That's implausible to me. So let's say he knew. So he knew and let's say he had the best intentions when he was firing the Ukrainian prosecutor alert looking into Versailles. How you pronounce it? Oh, he's messed it up. I, he knew that his son was in business with them. He knew that they were being investigated. Even if he had good intentions, that is a complete corrupt conflict of interest. And he did nothing. Right. I mean, that's the best case scenario. And it's still corrupt. And there's a lot of worse scenarios. Yeah. All of these people, the business officials, the government officials, they have something that nobody in the Russia collusion hoax had, which is names and identities that match up. You know, for you, willing to go on the record and go in front of Congress under oath, you can actually like identify them and talk to them. What we had for years with the Russia collusion hoax was Jake Tapper and his buddies being like, I talked to two people who said this thing. And it would turn out that that thing wasn't true and the people never had names. You could never go, Oh, well, you should never listen to those people again. Those very same people would then leak another thing and Jake Tapper and his buddies would be like, well, I have two people who say this other thing that's also not true, but we're not going to tell you that ever. And you know, these are people like Tony Bob Alinsky went on the record before the 2020 election. And he's not, you know, he's not a cook in any way. Like he's a legitimate business person who was willing to put his name out there. Do you remember? Do you remember that he, you know, he went public and the FBI brought him in and then like never did anything with it at all. Yeah. That's another insane. The Watchtower on Wall Street podcast with Chris Markowski. Every day, Chris helps unpack the connection between politics and the economy and how it affects your wallet. Your wages rising Twitter stepped into correct one of Biden's twig's claiming wages are higher as food prices continue to soar. Could this be why Biden's approval ratings on the economy are in the low 30s? Where should you turn to get real info on the power of your dollar? Whether it's happening in DC or down on Wall Street, it's affecting you financially. Be informed. Check out the Watchtower on Wall Street podcast with Chris Markowski on Apple Spotify or wherever you get your podcast. So outside of that, the whole story and the possible and the corruption and the possible corruption, there is now another issue. I think it's important that there was a government cover up or, you know, people slow off clearly the IRS investigation. If anything, these whistle blowers say is true, slow walked and undermined an investigation, then there's a sweetheart deal. And then now we know that, for instance, the FBI knew that the laptop was real, but yet basically participated in this operation to pretend that it wasn't real. I mean, these are legitimate, you know, corrupt actions by our institution. So I think that that's even now its own giant problem for Biden, but also a big part of this story. So you. Oh, my gosh, it's just, it's so overwhelming. Like I don't understand what to do about it because of the corruption of our media. So yes, we have evidence that the FBI, we have multiple rounds of evidence, actually, the FBI understood that the Hunter laptop was real, that it did detail real things about the Biden family business and his corruption, that they knew that we have evidence that they knew that in real time, not only had they gotten it in means in a way that pretty much legitimized it right away, but they had legitimized it for a year that they knew it to be legitimate for like a year before it leaked. And it all checked out. Everything was pretty easy to check out and it all checked out. And they are on the record as knowing that when the Hunter Biden laptop dropped. And then they set about with this information off, which is where they will say, well, we just intimated that it was a Russian profit information off. We didn't say like we were 100% sure. We just sort of let everybody to believe it. We spent months preparing them that something like, oh, I don't know, a laptop might be released and then it might be Russian disinformation. And then when it was released, we told them, hey, remember that we talked about how there might be disinformation. Like they did it in this very cagey way where they're trying to pretend like they didn't run an information off. And one of the little side notes on this were literally in a proxy. Well, I don't want to say literally in proxy, but we are in a proxy war with Russia right now. Russia knows that our commander in chief and our media are willing to falsely claim that Russia was behind that laptop rather than admit that the president and his son were involved in this. That's a huge amount of leverage they have over us. The kind that we've heard about all the time in the fake Russia collusion hoax. And it also gives them this like air of moral authority that I would rather not have when we're in a war with someone. I would rather not that I would rather they not have when we're in war with them. Like they know we were willing to lie even with like global conflict consequences. That's bad. They know how they know how corrupted our administration is. Our media is not a situation you want to be in when you're in an actual war proxy or otherwise with another country. And that's just like one of the side issues with this. But the other thing is the FBI has been meddling in every election for a very long time, but in a really dramatic way in the most recent elections, this type of thing they're doing where they're falsely claiming that legitimate information about one of the candidates is a lie. That's a that's a way to meddle in the election. I saw that we were. Oh, dang it. I can't remember which country we just accused of having not had free and fair elections because they were saying the opposition party was being like unfairly targeted. Oh, so unfairly going after your opposition party is a way to not have a free and fair. Oh, no, they were saying that like one party was that felt like they weren't able to express themselves politically. And I'm like, oh, like the like the BLM riots where they went after all these cities and they clued it with big media, a big tech to suppress all sorts of conservative opinion, like stuff like that makes it so that you don't have a free and fair election. But if you say that in this country, you actually could like be prosecuted. You know, and I notice a word that pops up all the time in the media now when they do even touch on the story is unfounded. Senator Grassley released an unfounded accusation this and that that is not how they report anything else. Also, it's not true. OK, so all during the Russia collusion hoax, all of that truly was unfounded. And instead they said, here's why people are taking it seriously. Christopher Steele is basically James Bond. I mean, he's like the world's foremost expert in Russia. Never mind that he didn't speak Russian and he was like a paid agent through intermediaries of the Hillary Clinton campaign. That was treated as if it were totally legitimate, even though literally nothing in his dossier checked out other than like Russia is a real country. And here you have it's not true that it was unfounded. It was already we reported on it this week. Other people have also reported on this at the time that this information was sent to the supposed, you know, a guy in Delaware who was handling all this wise, it had already been corroborated in multiple parts. So it's just not true. What they're saying is not factually accurate. Yeah. And the problem is it feels like you're fighting off the ocean, right? There is just it just keeps coming in. You win waves. They won't report it. Let me give you some. Let me give you a quick example. cocaine was found in the White House or, you know, just take any of the stories that have happened and media is like, in the White House, you know, we can't track this stuff down. We don't know what happened and we're just going to have to move on today. I was on the I was you going to make fun of me about reading the Washington Post and the fact checker page. And guess what they tackle today. Tommy Tuberville said his dad was in a tank in Paris on victory day, you know, or the when, you know, we when the Americans took back Paris from the Nazis and that was not true. They tracked and they tracked down some historical evidence to chose that his dad could not have been there that day. This is listen, I'm not even against that story. Fine. Track it down. But can you imagine this is they don't. There's a hundred yesterday. The president of the United States said basically that he had cured cancer. Like maybe that needs a fact check. I don't know. Maybe that's more important than Tommy Tuberville's dad and some story that maybe was passed down to him that wasn't true by his dad or whatever. Right. It is. Ever much you hate the Washington Post and other propaganda outlets. It is nowhere near enough. So I was reading this New York Times puff piece on the Washington Post and it was about how Jeff Bezos is on track to lose a hundred million dollars with the Washington Post this year and how he wants to make money on it. But you know, people are skeptical because he's losing so much. But I do think it's something that non leftist people should think about because the left is really good at spending money to control corporate media. They are really good. Not only do you have billionaires like Jeff Bezos or Lorraine Powell jobs, we're willing to lose tens or even a hundred hundred million dollars a year on something. You also have all these like major corporations that just subsidize things through advertising. Like Rachel Maddow is a crazy person and she has Mercedes Benz ads on her show or used to. So investing, you know, even the Washington Post does not make money and it has everything at its disposal to make money. So people need to if they want to win an information war, they actually have to fight in the information war. You have to fund media outlets that are doing real journalism. And by that, I don't mean like hundreds or people who have opinions, but it takes a lot of time, energy and money to do investigative journalism of the kind that actually moves the ball, the kind that we have been doing with the Hunter Biden story. Mardo Cleveland has done excellent work really for years looking into the mismanagement of the Biden family probe and having real news that moves that story forward. But you have to be willing to invest. And the left is willing to invest hundreds of millions of doll I mean, much more than that, because they're just losing money handover fist. But they're able to shape our elections and control the direction of the country. And if the right wants to have, if the right wants to combat that complaining about how the left is willing to lose $100 million, the Washington Post is not sufficient. You actually have to compete and play. I would just like to add one thing to that. I don't disagree with any of that. I've been saying that for years, you know, all these, all the funding that candidates get if the fraction of that just was diverted to journalism, right wing journalism, the world would look like a very different place or, you know, and I love think tanks, but even the money that goes to think tanks. I will say though, that punditry is more important than that. I think punditry needs to be funded to because a good pundit will synthesize that information, make it, you know, something that that a normal person can can can understand or, you know, doesn't have time to wait through all the stuff. Now, obviously a lot of pundits aren't honest, but just because it's opinion journalism doesn't mean it's not real or that it's not important. And I'm not, I know you're not saying that about me. I bet you don't like this person as much as I do, but so much of what I learned as a young person about conservative intellectualism actually was first introduced to me by Rush Limbaugh. And, you know, he had this very popular, very, you know, almost lowbrow radio show, but he was reading all the papers from the academics. He was reading the books from the intellectuals and then he was translating it to a different audience. And that got me on in many ways on my journey to read the original authors and writers. And it's a very important thing. And I tried to do that myself, like, you know, whether it's with my books or with TV punditry or what I'm writing as federalist to take complicated, complex thoughts and make sure that people who don't have the time or inclination to. Or, you know, yeah, who aren't doing that so that they can benefit from some of that wisdom. The greatest pundits on earth, you know, have ever lived, have been able to take something really complicated and make like a quip of it to explain it to you. Right. So that is very important. As for Rush Limbaugh, I think the guy is one of the three most important conservatives that have ever, you know, in the modern post-war America just changed the whole change everything, especially in media. And he was a genius. I mean, the way that he could speak, you know, off the cover for hours. So no, I did like Rush Limbaugh. I don't know if I liked him as much as you, but I thought he was. I do want to also say that when President Trump gave him the presidential medal of freedom, that was so interesting and important to me in seeing that I realized that one of the ways, so a lot of times conservatives are treated like second-class citizens by the left and that, you know, you see that in the media and the cultural, you know, a lot of their political power. But even conservatives themselves sort of internalize this and allow themselves to be treated like their folk heroes don't deserve the same acclaim that leftist folk heroes get all the time from the powerful institutions, you know, the Kennedy Center is giving out awards always like to leftists. And when President Trump gave that to Rush Limbaugh, it was like, oh, that's like the most obvious award that he should have gotten, you know, two presidents prior, but they didn't have the courage to do that. They were always trying to like, we need to claim from the left by picking someone palatable to the left, which is never the way the left operates when they're handing out awards. Yeah, Rush Limbaugh was like a single-handedly basically took down the Clinton administration. He like, he was a big part of that conservative revolution in Congress. Like he people underestimate the way that he changed the whole landscape and the way people spoke and everything. I mean, I just think he was an immensely influential person. It was also just the fact that ideology aside, he was the best broadcaster in history. I mean, even lefty radio people will admit that, will acknowledge that. Actually, they'll happily acknowledge that that there was just no one like him in the radio industry. I take a super weird turn here and just connect what you just said about how conservatives aren't, you know, treated like second-class citizens. And I think that you can see that in something that's going on right now, which the it was just the Oppenheimer movie. I just want to say we're the story of Oppenheimer. I haven't seen the movie yet. So you have to explain. Nor have I, but I'm just going to tell you this. He has always been a hero of the left because basically he was a, you know, someone who, you know, the creator of the atomic bomb who turned piece Nick and who wanted world peace and wanted to share that information with everyone and be because he was the martyr of, you know, McCarthyism and this kind of like unreasonable Cold War effort. And on the other hand, you had another guy, Edward Teller, who was a from Hungary, he was actually Hungarian Jew, invented the hydrogen bomb. And he was always treated like some kind of nut, you know, in Dr. Strange Love, he's, you know, the character with the arm who's always making the Nazi solutes was based on him. You know, just a warmonger because he was anti-communist and Oppenheimer was a communist. He admitted he was a communist. There was a nest of spies under him. The Soviets have the, had the bomb way earlier than they would have because of him. And he himself was maybe a spy. A lot of people thought he was, who were not McCarthyist types, but people who worked with him thought he was a spy. But yet he is celebrated as some kind of hero. And this is what we do with history. This is what we do with Russian bomb. This is what we're going to do with people today. We're going to celebrate people who don't deserve it. You see it in presidential lists. It's always like FDR Wilson. These are the greatest presidents ever, but good presidents like Coolidge are wet on the bottom. Like so you see it in history and you know, Rush Limbaugh is always going to be treated like a coop by the left, even those who admit he was talented. And even at the time, Clint used to, you know, he blamed the Oklahoma city bombing on Rush Limbaugh. You know, I mean, this has been going on for a long time. So I don't know if that makes sense as a segue, but I just wanted to talk about that bit. So do you know anything about how the movie treats this issue? Do they make Oppenheimer? I mean, we had a piece by Kylie on Oppenheimer and how it was sort of ambiguous about who the good guys and the bad guys were in that film. I don't know. I have not seen the movie issue. I said that. He did Oppenheimer as a complicated individual. And I mean, you know, he tried to kill someone when he was young. He was a weirdo who glorified rape when he was young. I mean, these are things people don't really talk about. He was a weird dude. Now listen, I think a lot of geniuses are very weird, right? So you have to give them some space to be weird. I think the atomic bomb was necessary. It was it was an incredible project, the Manhattan Project. And it was necessary. And we needed to get the bomb first and all that. But I'm not sure that he would have done that if it was a war against the Soviets. And that's just the truth. I mean, he wanted to stop Hitler. I don't even think he really wanted to drop it on the Japanese. I mean, it's complicated. But my point only is, and maybe the movie does a good job, but the book, it's based on American Prometheus. I mean, one of those writers is from, you know, wrote for the nation. I mean, you know, I think it's a great book in many ways, but it obviously is. It gives you a certain type of history. All I'm saying is that these things are complicated, but right, wingers are always true. And my big beef, historical beef, as you know, is that war and Harding is always like last list of, you know, of good presidents. Meanwhile, he was one of our best presidents. He was a, he was a patriot. He did everything that a president should do and acted in the way a president should. But the left doesn't value someone who's not like a busy body, who's not creating new giant programs, who's not getting involved, spending tons of money and involved in your life. So I just think that this happens on all levels. And you're never going to see a movie celebrating Edward Teller or even about Edward Teller. I bet you know, and even knows who Edward Teller is, you know, probably like five percent of Americans maybe, you know, and the guy was an anti-communist and an anti-fascist. He was a more accomplished person than, than Oppenheimer. You know, he was the father of the idea of Star Wars, you know, the Reagan star, SDI stuff. I mean, he was an incredible man, but no one even knows who he is. And I don't know. These are just my inventing. These are my historic. These are beefs I have with historians. See the Nolan film. Yeah, I'll go see it. I was going to see it with my kids, but I heard there's like a sexy and which is like the first time in a Nolan movie, there's a sexy, which is weird. We wanted to take the kids to see Oppenheimer, but the parents review showed, yeah, there's like sort of gratuitous nudity and sex and like prolonged, very difficult to quickly move past. Yeah. So we took the. Sorry. I just want to say, Kelly, Kelly and Murphy is that he pronounced his name? I'm not sure. I think just a fantastic actor. I loved him in Piki blinders and I've seen him in other movies. Just amazing. I like Christopher Nolan in general. We talked about this. His last movie didn't make any sense, but overall, I think he does a good job. So I'll yell, see it. OK. Yeah. So we took the kids to see Barbie sort of knowingly, like I read and seen some of the conservative critique of it, but felt like it would be a good idea to do it with the kids. We could kind of talk through some of it. And it did turn out exactly as I hoped. My kids came out of that really understanding that feminism is a joy sucking belief system that is to be avoided at all costs. I do think it might have gone a little too far with them in that I heard one of them say that her favorite part of the movie was when Ryan Gosling, said his name, yeah, discovers the patriarchy and drags it back to Barbie land. And she thought that was like the highlight of the film. So I think it might have we might have gotten a little too far in the how it affected them. But I don't know. I we've published a lot of credit. They dragged back the patriarchy to Barbie land. Is that the spoiler alert? OK. And then they start accomplishing great things in Barbie land finally. No, no, and that's actually what I guess for me. And I did not I enjoyed the film in parts. It is really clumsy and is handling of the patriarch. It's like stupid. And I also feel like feminism is not a belief system for intelligent people. So that kind of comes through to it's a feminist film, even while it's trying to kind of poke at the problems of feminism. But it just didn't really hold up. Like to show how awful the patriarchy is, they were showing like pictures of Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan and John Wayne and horses. And also all the pictures were from like the 80s and 90s, which was just objectively a better era. So there were no recent examples. And then like there's a line in the movie about how once the women triumph over the patriarchy in Barbie land, then they're not going to let men be on the Supreme Court until women are in the Supreme Court in the real world. I mean, we currently have four female Supreme Court justices and I was like, this is just stupid. Like you're you're you're it's like being nostalgic for a period of time when women didn't have these positions and that has like it's like 30 to 40 years old. So it just didn't work. And also like a big part of the theory is that men run everything in the real world, which is just clearly, you know, might be good if it were true, but it's not true. And it just kind of lacked truth in those areas. Wait, what did you say that it would if it was true would be good? What did you say? If men ran things in the real world, it might better than what we have now. So like when I'm being a little provocative there, but when Ken drags the patriarchy back to Barbie land, he takes over the dream house. So like the dream house when it's centered around a young girl's vision of what a dream would be, it's like, you know, very open and pink and airy and you do get a different outfit all the time and everything's just sort of like her, you know, you have little things to play with food and very income, whatever. And when Ken drags the patriarchy back and takes over the dream house, it's got a lot of pictures of horses. He basically is really into horses. And what was I thinking about it though? Oh, he calls it the mojo dojo Casa house. Instead of a dream house, it's Ken's mojo dojo Casa house. And we walked out of there and my husband said it more like mojo dojo Casa long house. Am I right? You know, the theory about the long house being how women control everything in our society and just talk everything to death. I thought that was funny, but he was pretty miserable the whole time. I was less miserable because I thought it really captured what it's like when you're a little girl and you don't understand the real world. And so you're doing things that like even this is such a silly little thing. But when you're playing with Barbies or dolls, when you're a little girl, and you know that there's supposed to be romance between the Ken doll and the Barbie doll, but you don't actually really understand what that means. You just kind of kind of put their mouths like near each other, but it doesn't really do anything. You don't even understand what you're doing. It really captured that like confusion and innocence of a little girl thinking about what it's going to be like to be grown up and in a way that I thought was very tender and loving. So I can also understand why Mark would be like that was the weirdest thing ever. This reminds me, did you see? I don't know if you get all these emails. Someone said that they really like our podcast and they really like how much I clearly love my husband and my marriage. But they wanted to know why I always refer to my husband Mark as Mark Hemmingway. Mark Hemmingway. Well, I think because he, Mark Hemmingway on is a very, you know, he's a well-known writer in his own right. So you want to, is it a sign of respect or so that people will know that? I don't even know why I do it. So I know he and I used to call each other by last names or their variations. Like I used to call him, Wemming Hey, which is, you know, reworking his last name Hemmingway. But then when we got married and I became, and he called me Ziegler. But then when we got married, we were both Hemmingway's and so it just didn't totally work. And Mark is a very common name. So I don't want to just say Mark and have people not know who I'm talking about. I don't know. Anyway, it just, it really cracked me up that note. Also what cracked me up was the note from the reader who was like saying she really enjoyed our podcast. And she was really curious about you. So she looked you up and didn't realize how devastatingly handsome you are. Thanks for bringing that up. So all the pictures of me online are from like 20 years ago. You know how that happens where you take these pictures and they're just out there forever on the Internet. And I don't take pictures. So she should know that's not, it's not that same anymore. Yeah, unfortunately, like I don't want to, I don't want to marry you. You look much better now than you did 20 years ago. So like she should just imagine. Oh, so this silver-haired fox. Anyway, I love our reader, our listeners. I think for the best. You know what was funny about that email that it had a million emojis in it. From the lady. Yeah, the lady. Anyway, thank you for listening. Any other cultural stuff for you? Before we. No, we're doing this higher things Lutheran youth conference. So I'm just like surrounded by Lutherans and managing a gaggle of children and we are having a blast. And I'm just very thankful to have stuff like this to do and go to. So last time, I'm really mad about something cultural. So they remade. They remake it. There's a sequel to, did you watch Justified? Oh, yeah. Love Justified. This is amazing storyteller. Yeah, so one of my favorite shows. So there's a new one out like a sequel kind of thing. It's called Justified City Primeval something like, I think that's what it's called. So it's like a seven episode thing where it is one of the, it sucked all the joy and all the fun and all the charm and all the, you know, interesting characters and the, the, the southern kind of, or the, you know, the sensibilities of where he's from and stuff like. I am so, I'm just so mad about it. I'm going to have to write a column. I haven't been this mad since the last James Bond movie. So I'm going to write a column about that. The only other thing I've watched. So I'm going to save that. Maybe we'll talk about it later because only three episodes in and it really upsets me how people first of all. So that show ended perfectly. It was one of the few shows that just wrapped everything up perfectly. You know, it was uneven sometimes over the seasons, but I just loved it so much. But anyway, I also watched an old movie called Zulu. Have you ever seen that with Michael Kane? I love that. I mean, I know what it is. And I don't think I've ever seen it. Yeah. It's Michael Kane's first movie. It's fantastic. There was a sequel, which is actually a pretty cool, I guess, historically called Zulu Don with Peter O'Toole. That came out in the 70s, which I was not as good, but I also enjoyed. That's on Amazon. So I recommend it. Oh, I did watch something else. Okay. First off, we did a basement renovation. And so we moved into back into our basement, which means that we could have the TV up and watch a movie on a sofa. It was really exciting for us. And we watched Starman. From, well, don't say anything. What's the dude guy who was in it, right? And Karen Allen. Yes. And I realized that I really like Karen Allen. Like as a little girl, I loved her character and Raiders of the Lost Ark. She was great. Yeah. What's that guy's name? No, he won. Jeff Bridges. Jeff Bridges was nominated for an Academy Award for it. And it was done by that horror film. John Carpenter. Yeah. I thought it was a really well done movie. It's about a guy who is an alien who is invited to this country. Do you remember how, like in the 80s, we would send up, you know, cassette tapes or laser discs with like invitations to aliens. Come visit us. So he responds to one of them and comes down, but then is immediately targeted by the deep state and how he just tries to like get back home. But there was a, it is basically a remake of E.T. with a human being, right? It has the same storyline. So apparently it was optioned first before E.T. I learned all this from my husband. He was telling me that it was option before E.T. and it was, I think even done by the same Spielberg, you know, Luke. Wait, no, imagine or whatever it was at the time. Anyway, then the original director drops out because of it being just like E.T. And so John Carpenter reworks it reworks it fles out a little bit more, makes it a little more unique and yeah, but they all kind of came out around the same time. I mean, that in decades. So I'll probably give it a shot. I'm a Jeff Bridges fan. I am too. My youngest daughter thought he was too robotic in his. Yeah, I remember he sort of emotionless, maybe is the right word or he acts sort of like a robot in a little bit or something. Is that right? So yeah, all right. Well, the character is that he's brilliant, like much more advanced than a human, but also it's all new to him. So to balance that naivete with the brilliance, I think is somewhat challenging and I thought he did a really good job with it and can. He's also in Tron. Oh, I'm sorry. Go just thinking about the 80s. Do you think do you like Karen Allen? I mean, I don't she was an animal house as well. I don't know if you remember, but so I mean, I, you know, when I was a kid, I had a crush on when I was a young kid at my first crush was on Deborah winger. Which is a weird crush, right? Because I saw I had HBO and I watched. I remember I watched what's that Richard gear movie? I'll start a gentleman. Yeah, I watch all and then I watched it was like a double feature. I watched urban cowboy with John Travolta, which is just sound alive in Houston, basically. And you know, with country music and said disco, I'm not even joking. It's basically the same plot. But, and I just, she was my first crush. I don't know why I brought that up. She's sort of like Karen Allen, the little, right? I think she's probably a better actress. Yeah. Well, one thing I liked about Karen Allen. So, you know, a couple of weeks ago, we were on a movie kick this summer with the kids. So a couple of weeks ago, we'd seen Mission Impossible and there are a lot of female characters in it. They're all the strongest women known to mankind. Like they're all able to beat up multiple men with ease. And one thing I like about Karen Allen is she's tough without ever losing. She always plays these parts that are tough without ever losing their femininity. Like they're the toughest version of a female, but she's still a female. And I always just feel like it's weird to teach girls that they can beat up men. Like it does not, it does not work as a plan of action for my own daughters. Like I want them to understand. I told them recently about the women's soccer team, the US women's soccer team getting beaten by a group of 14 year old boys. And they didn't believe me. 15 year old, but yeah, and Dallas, I think. Yeah. But I want them to understand like you can be a really tough, awesome chick. And you just have biological differences with men that mean that they are very powerful. So I don't, if my daughters think that if they get in a bad situation with a guy that they can just like easily beat him up, this could lead to them being poor, you know, very hurt or dead. The same conversation. Yeah. Yeah. I understand that they actually have different powers and different strengths to sort of avoid getting in bad situations. I mean, you have these women who look like they're with a way, 90 pounds, right? And they'll just kick this muscular man in the shin and he'll like fall down or they like flip over him and flip him. And I don't care if you're a black belt. That's not happening. The guy's going to grab you and hurt you. And now every movie basically has women acting like they're men in fights. Even the men can't do this by the way, the men that you see doing this in movies cannot and a 5, 2, you know, women is not going to do it. Anyway, in the Barbie film, there is a character who's the dad of is like a husband and a dad. He's barely there. And he's sort of an incompetent fool, but like a lovable, incompetent fool. He's just clueless about what's going on in the way. As men are in movies all the time, clueless, you know, dads. And commercials. That actually annoyed me a great deal. But I did want to also mention that there's this speech that the left is very excited about that America, Ferreira gives about how impossible it is to be a woman. And it's not even that there aren't aspects of this that are true in the speech about how women have to do things are sort of like diametrically opposed about competence and tenderness and things like that. But the thing that really bothered me is my oldest actually already kind of understands some of this stuff and does not do it as like a horrific thing. But I thought it actually introduced to young girls a self hatred or negativity about being female. But I just really wish had not been introduced. There's even a line in it where this teenage girl says about, I don't remember what it says. She says men hate women and women hate women. It's the only thing they agree on. And I'm like, am I just in a different world because in my world, men love women and women love women. And I know that there are angry men and angry women who are otherwise, but like I was raised by people who loved women and men and I'm surrounded by people who love women and men. And I think that's just, I think it has a lot to do with why I'm so happy to be a woman. And I want my children to be, I want my daughters to be happy that they are women. And I hate how feminism introduces a negativity about being female that just sort of to me seems designed to tear down, decrease self confidence and make people dislike each other more. Yeah, I never got it. I mean, I hate people of all, you know, women and men. I'm just saying, like, you know, these are immutable characteristics people have. It's the same thing with the race obsession. Like you have to think a certain way if you're a man or you have to hate another race. It just doesn't make sense to me. Women and men are different. They lead different lives. They have different concerns. And maybe it is harder to be a woman. I wouldn't know. But that doesn't mean that I hate women or women should hate men. First of all, it's biology's fault or God's fault, not a man's fault that you have to deal with certain things that men don't. Right. So, you know, I don't know. It's like displacing anger. You can view the fact that women just ate babies as an awful thing or you can view it as a wonderful blessing or a wonderful thing that's probably very difficult that a man doesn't have to go through. It is difficult. And men have their own things that are extremely difficult responsibilities that are placed on them that women don't have. But difficulty does not mean bad and difficulty does not mean the impossibility and viewing all of these things as beautiful gifts from God rather than this horrible thing that needs to be complained about. It really can affect your lifelong success and happiness. You just hit on something. I don't want to get too deeply into this. But I think in the modern world, anything that's difficult is viewed as something terrible. Like, oh my God, it's going to be hard for me to do this. And then, you know, the world's so terrible because how, you know, I have to work really hard to get to this level or that I have to be ought to work on time. So I was watching this TikTok, this girl's crying that, you know, she's bound by these hours of work and there's 40 of them a week, you know, which means you're not really doing a good job if you're only working 40 hours a week. Just say, I dream of a video. Yeah. So it's weird how everything like everything's supposed to be easy and no one's supposed to suffer. No one's supposed to pay back alone. They took out because it's too hard to pay back, even though you knew what you were doing, whatever. I don't know. I haven't fully formed this, you know, formed this idea, but I just think it's weird how people treat difficulty as something negative rather than something that makes your life better once you overcome it or gives you more confidence when you overcome it, et cetera. So that is an interesting aspect to that. I probably will never go see this Barbie movie. It's just to pink for me. I'm a man. And I think there are differences between men and women and pink is not my color. I do like all the actors in it, I think. Like I like both of them pretty much. Yeah. That's she's hot. What's her name? I forget her name, but they were calling her mid on the Internet the other day. Oh, so Sam, the intern told me something after church on Sunday that he thinks that when people were calling her, Margot Robbie there. He thinks that when men were calling Margot Robbie mid, it was a total joke and that they were wanting people to ask them follow up questions. And then they could say, I mean, compared to my girlfriend. Okay. Really terrible way to look at the calling Margot Robbie mid. But yeah, Ryan Gosling absolutely steals the entire show. He is definitely the hero of the of the movie. My kids keep on being like concerned about his characters while being because they feel very badly about how things end with him. So he's legitimately a funny guy. I don't know if you've ever seen him in interviews. He is legitimately funny. And I think he I've seen him in movies. I don't remember the names right now where I'm like, wow, he's really talented. Like he can play the bad guy. He could play the funny guy. You can do it. You know, all that stuff. Also singer dancer. And he's married to that other hot chick. The other. He's very super hot chick, right? Even long. I mean, that. That's not even one. What is it? I get all people confused. I just put it into I just put in his name. Eva Mendez. Yeah, I put I put his name in there. I'm going to go on. Sorry. So she was a TV actress. Yeah. No, she's very pretty as well. There he is. Oh, yeah. You get all the Barbie stuff. I think sparkly things on Google. That's annoying. By the way, also people I get confused. All the actors named Ryan. I think I like them all. And they're like three of them. And they're all in front of them. Cool. You know, aren't there a bunch of Ryan's. Anyway, I just quickly want to say that I'm resentful that I even knew that there was something going on about people calling Margot Robbie bid because these are the things that flow into my feed on Twitter or X as it's now called. Ryan Reynolds. Great. Who's the guy? I think he was actually the most boomer conversation. We never know the names of the actors. I don't know. I know. You like you like even just gave me like a little clue about a movie from 1984 and I'm like, boom, star man. But I don't know the name of like the actor in the most popular movie and like, you know, Ryan. Oh, that guy hasn't been a really around for a long time. But he was married to Reese Witherspoon and he was in some interesting stuff. So he has an E at the end of his name, right? He's in the French. Yeah. I don't know. I get legitimately blonde ladies confused. Like they all look the same to me. I get very excited when I see a blonde lady, but I can't distinguish them from each other. Like I know why women go blonde. Like if you're a young person, you're in the bar, that really draws your attention. But then I can't tell them apart. Like it's taken me years with some of my people I work with at other places like, okay, that's that blonde one and that's that blonde one. Some other places. There are a lot of blonde people in some of the places you work. I am not a huge fan of Ryan Reynolds and let me put it actually this way. I think he's a very likable guy being Ryan Reynolds and he's always basically playing Ryan Reynolds in movies, but I don't think he's got any kind of like, I thought Deadpool was funny and all that. But it doesn't seem to have a ton of range as an actor. You're right, but I really like him. I think he's a likable person. And you know what? He seems like a good person to me. These people usually at this point, they are actors. You realize they all come off as likable when really they're probably all monsters, but I know. I don't know. It was the come off the worst or the most real and nice. I'm such an old old man now that if someone's married for a long time to the same person like an actor, I'm like, that's a good man. Like, you know, which is like the lowest, like in the real world. Like it's like when someone talks about a drug addict, they're like, you know, they're like clapping when he's just does a normal thing. You know, like being married is not for to one woman is not some huge thing that you've done. And I think that's a good thing. I think that's a good thing. It's just should be the norm. But like when I think about like a mad Damon or, you know, Mark Wahlberg, he seems like a good guy or he is a good guy. I know I know people who know him well and he's he is that person. Like he's a loving, giving generous person religious person. And he goes to church every day. Yeah. Yeah, which is weird. Have those things always seem to correlate, but not always. That's a lie, but often. But it's very with me on my bad, my bad audio, but I'll be back. It's it was completely worth it. I'm sure everyone will agree in their emails to us at radio at thefederalist.com. Segue. And until then, until we speak again, Belovers of Freedom and anxious for the Freddy."
