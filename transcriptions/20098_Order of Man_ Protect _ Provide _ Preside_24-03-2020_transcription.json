    "text": " Most of you are familiar with Tucker Maxx and regardless of what you think about him, there is no fence sitting. You either love the guy or hate him. But that's part of the reason I wanted to have a conversation with him to find out what makes him so polarizing and how he feels about it. That said, the biggest reason I wanted to talk with him is to learn about his ability to redefine himself from college frat boy to successful entrepreneur, husband, and father. I think we can all relate to messing up some things along the way and many of us have or are working on our own redemption story. Today, Tucker and I talk about speaking the truth, overcoming judgment, the reality of the zero F's mentality and ultimately how to redefine yourself. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. You embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day. And after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Mikler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast and the movement that is Order of Man. I want to welcome you here. I want to welcome you back. Obviously, we are in unprecedented times right now uncharted territory. And it's been a little interesting around here in the Order of Man podcast studio and offices, but we're getting a lot done. We're trying to put a lot of content out and make it available to you as a leader, a father, a husband, a business owner, again, a leader in your community, whatever facet of life you're showing up as. So make sure you subscribe and make sure you share this with other men. There's other men who need to hear what we are sharing now more than ever because they've got time on their hands and there's a lot of doubt and variables and uncertainty and hopefully we're bringing to light and some ideas and insights on how to be a more effective father and husband and again, every other facet of life that you're showing up as. We've got some great interviews lined up coming up down the road and also in the past. We've had guys like Jocka Willink and Grant Cardone and John Eldridge and Andy Fresilla and Tim Kennedy and our lineup of men who have banded with us is absolutely incredible. And I'm working on some even more incredible guests as we move down the line. So again, make sure you subscribe whether you do it here and listening to the podcast or on YouTube at youtube.com slash order of men. So you can see the podcast as well, including this conversation with with Tucker. So yeah, I'm going to get into the conversation here in just a minute. I do want to make a very quick mention of my friends and show sponsors, Originmain. If you're following me on Instagram, you've probably seen I've highlighted them over the past several days because they are halting a lot of their traditional apparel making, their denim, their boots, their geese, rash guards, all that kind of stuff. And they've made this mask that they're going to start offering and making available to those on the front lines and those who want to protect themselves to some degree. So it's pretty, it's pretty amazing. And a lot of you have asked why I talk about Origin so much. This is part of the reason they're making great products, but they're also fixing things and solving problems. And if you're interested in seeing these masks, go check out their Instagram page, go to their website and you'll see what it is they're doing. I think they're calling it the defender mask, but pretty cool to see these guys step up in a time of need and a time of crisis and solve a problem where most people just see most people see the problems. They don't see the solutions. These guys are actually providing and building and making the solutions here 100% made in America. So go check it out, originmain.com. Originmain.com. All right, guys, let me get into the conversation today. Again, it's with Tucker Max. A lot of you know him. And if you're like me, you ran across one of his New York Times bestselling books in an airport or a bookstore somewhere. And it's likely that's the case because he's sold over four and a half million copies of these books. He's been credited with starting the literary genre of frat tire where he details and documents his college day exploits. And although that's what made him famous, his ability to redefine himself from those days to who he is today is what really had me interested in talking with him. He's now the founder of scribe media and is helping other people tell their own stories in their own unique way and giving a voice to those who need it and for those who need to hear it. So I hope you enjoy the podcast. I would love to hear your feedback after you have a chance to listen to the show. Tucker, what's up, man? Thanks for joining me on the podcast. Thanks for having me, Ryan. Yeah, you bet. I've been looking forward to the conversation because you're a man who seems to be pretty polarizing and somebody that from afar from a distance, somebody who's really seemed to have turned their life around and changed a lot of ways. I'm looking forward to talking with you about that. Thanks, man. Me too. Would you agree that that's a pretty good assessment? Obviously, a very quick and overview of your life, but is that a good assessment that you've changed and really pivoted your life? How would you describe it? I mean, I've definitely changed. There's no doubt, man. The only people who don't change are dead people. Yeah, that's true. Well, let me ask you this. It's a matter of if you change for the worse or better, right? Well, dude, I mean, listen, if I had changed for the worse, then I would re-change. I definitely think I've chosen my change. I've chosen my path. Clearly, I'm doing it, at least for what I think is the better. Yeah. Yeah. What caused a lot of the evolution and growth in your life? Is it just a level of maturity? Is it revisiting past experiences? How do you begin to change in your own life? The reason I bring this up is because I know there's a lot of guys who are listening who feel like maybe they can't get past experiences or mistakes they've had and they're fixing themselves, and yet they don't know quite how to do it. Yeah. So it's funny you say that. I got an email today, literally, from a guy who's older and he's like, I've got no skills. I feel like I'm useless. Like I can't do anything. I'll work for free. No one will hire me. And I'm just like, yeah. Honestly, man, the way I started changing is the first thing that had to happen was I had to get sick of my bullshit, right? Like, I forget who said it, but you basically change doesn't start until the pain of change becomes less than the pain of staying the same. And so for me, for a long time, the pain of staying the same was not that painful. And so it was like, all right, well, I'll keep doing this. I mean, that's, I think Bill Gates definitely said, he said this, it's success only teaches you how to keep going. And which is fine. Like, if you're being successful and you like your life and things are going great, then you can keep going. And there's nothing wrong with that, I guess. But what I realized multiple times in my life is that the life I had and the life I wanted or the life I had was not the life I wanted. And so then, and then of course, like you go through the normal cycle, at least I did, of fixing everything, everything externally, money, power, women, muscles, whatever it is, you're going to define yourself by. And then you realize, or at least I realized, the external didn't matter that it didn't matter how rich or powerful or in shape I was or how many women wanted me. It didn't change the underlying emotions. And so I decided, all right, I've got to go address those. Like I've got to go fix what's inside or deal with what's inside because that's where it all begins. And if I don't do that, then the rest of the stuff is just bullshit. It's just a distraction. So that's how I started, man. That's how at least for me. Yeah, it's funny because a lot of guys will say, well, you know, money doesn't solve the problems or whatever else these external factors and these guys will say, well, that's easy for you to say you have it, right? But it's funny is like I didn't, I think I had less problems when I had less money actually. Seriously, they were just a couple of big problems, but I didn't have many problems. I was just poor. That's it. Yeah. Yeah. I think there's been studies too that have shown, you know, if you were to ask three or four or a hundred people how much money you need to make and we'll just isolate that, how much money you need to make to be happy, it's always going to be 10 to 20% more than you're currently making, right? Of course. Like regardless of what level of wealth you're at. And so it's not the money. I mean, yeah, we've got to make a living and we've got to find some ways to put food on the table and have some experiences, but I agree it goes so much deeper than just those external sources of happiness, if you will. Yeah. No, I mean, look, I think the definitive study on this showed that about somewhere between 70 and $80,000, depending on where you live, like the, just call it the average place in America, like Tulsa, Oklahoma, if you're somewhere north of 70 or 80,000, then adding money has almost no impact on your happiness below that. Then adding some money because somewhere around 70, 80 for the average American gives you stability. Sure. At that point, money doesn't matter. It's internal life. Right. You said you had to get sick of your own bullshit. How would you describe that for you? Like in what ways did that show and manifest itself? Oh, man. Well, I'm not really the best model for that, man. Like, I, so the first, the first major time it happened was it was right after law, it was in law school, but over the summer, I was working in a law firm called Fenwick and West and I realized like a week into being a summer associate, but it's basically like a trial run for a lawyer. I realized I absolutely hated being a lawyer and that it was the worst soul sucking job I could ever imagine and that I would rather put a bullet in my brain than do that. But I did not in any way, shape, or form have the courage to recognize that to myself at all because all I could see was, well, you know, I went to good schools, being a lawyer is respected. I'm going to make a ton of money. You have a bunch of power. I'm supposed to want this and I hated it. And so the only way I could find to deal with that, man, was to like get drunk and act like an asshole. Because when you hate your life, that's a good way to deal with it. It's an effective way when you're young, especially to deal with your emotions is drink a lot, act like an idiot, sleep with a bunch of girls, pick fights, whatever, all that whole thing. And so I got fired two and a half weeks into that job because it's impossible to get fired as a summer associate and I did it. I found a way and two and a half weeks no less. That whole story is in, I hope this would be in hell. And it's a really funny story if you weren't me. Anyway, so like that. And then so I blew up my life, man. Like I just straight up blew up my life instead of really sitting down feeling what I was feeling and being realizing, okay, I made a wrong decision, but I can like fix it in a smart way. I couldn't do it. Another big way I can think of where I had to get sick of my shit was it's hard to pinpoint the exact moment, but I think it started when the movie based on my first book didn't do very well. It did look like a couple of million at the theaters, but it was nowhere near what I wanted to do. It was like, it was dude, it was so crushing for me, which of course is the most ridiculous white rich white person problem that exists, right? There was a movie made about my life before I was 35 and it didn't do quite a million at the box office. And so I'm like, I'm just emotionally crushed, right? It's hilarious to think about, but dude, it's like God's honest truth. I really was man. It was like really hard for me to deal with. And that would kind of started a cascade of things where like all of this negative emotion, sadness, anxiety, depression started coming up. And it wasn't just about the movie. It was like the movie failing unlocked all that stuff that was already in me, right? But I was using all the success to hide it, to cover it over. And that was like the first failure, the first real failure I had. And it was like, oh shit. And so it took about another year of me kind of wallowing in my bullshit until I just got sick of it. And then I called a therapist and I went to, I took me out of 20 therapists to find a good one. And then I started kind of my therapeutic journey, which I'm still on, a lot of different modalities and I've tried, et cetera. But like in my experience, man, I've always known man, you know, like, you know, if you're at all connected to yourself, you know, when you're full of shit and you know when you're lying to yourself, it's just sitting down and admitting it. You know, I should say as I get older, I've done that, you know? Yeah. I mean, I think it comes with just a level of maturity, but I imagine the therapy and other things that you've gone through help as well. Did you? So when you were doing the internship, is that when the blog and the book writing and all that came along? That was before. That was before that. Yeah. How did you begin to pivot and switch when you realize, okay, I'm miserable, but I don't have the balls to get out of this industry or this road I'm going down. Like what did you do to start pivoting? Yeah. So, like, you know, some entrepreneurs have amazing stories of like, oh, I did this and I figured this out. Mine is like the opposite, right? So I actually don't believe a lot of those stories though. Because like these guys paint these perfect stories of like, this one thing happened and I formulated this perfect plan. I'm like, that is not my world. And it sounds like it's not yours either. Not mine either. No, so I sabotaged my career. Unconsciously sabotaged my career, got fired two and a half years in or turned off weeks into being a lawyer. So I went back, finished my last year at Duke. So I did graduate. And then I went to work for my dad who owns some restaurants in South Florida. My dad fired me from the family business six months in. So like, dude, I mean, like, I got a lot of money. I got fired from an unfirerable job twice. Look who gets fired from the family business? Yeah. I did. And so good for your dad though. I mean, it was a great, it was the best thing that happened. Both of those things are the best thing. God forbid, man, if I was a lawyer, oh, God, I can't think of a horrible my life would be. So after that, my friends from law school, like I was sending them emails telling them, I lived in South Florida, which is, you know, the armpit of America. And like I was talking about how much I hated my life and writing funny emails because I was still going out getting drunk, hooking up with girls. I just hated it, like, but I didn't know what else to do. And so I was writing emails to my friends about it. And they're like, dude, you're real bad at business and law, but this writing thing, you're good at it. And I'm like, what kind of bitch becomes a writer? Like, yeah, I had it here, right? And they're like, okay, well, what else are you going to do? Right? Yeah. Like sleeping with skanks. South Florida skanks is not a job unless you're a drug dealer. I'm like, I'm not going to do that. So I was like, all right. So I started, I sent my emails. Like, it took like the five, six funniest ones, sent them to every, this is 2002, mind you. Okay. So like this is like before Facebook or MySpace or blogs existed or anything, I sent them to every single publisher and every single agent in the country. And there were a lot then not like now, like a huge book full of addresses, probably a thousand query letters. Every single one rejected me. Like most of them just ignored it, right? Right. And you didn't have anything back. Right. I maybe got 30 form rejections. I actually got like three or four serious like customized personalized rejections about how horrible I was and how everything was terrible. I should never even write an email again. But at this point, I ignored them because at this point, I've been getting my emails forwarded back to me from like other people and other social circles. Like my friends, I only would send my emails to like my eight friends in law school. It wasn't like an email. I didn't have an email list. Those things didn't exist then. Right. It wasn't like no clickbodies. You're like, right? Like, like what people do in group chats now, you had to do over email. And so like, I started getting those forwarded back to me from like guys I knew from high school and they'd be like, Oh dude, if you read this story, it's so hilarious. And I'm like, assholes, remember email forward, you're old enough to remember. I'm like, hold on to the header. Like look at that. That's really. Like, oh man, I didn't see that. I knew it sounded like you. And so like then I knew publishers were wrong. So like, when people are 40 me, my own stuff without knowing it's me, they're wrong. And so I put myself up on the internet for free because I didn't know what else to do. And I had to use like geo cities, right? And it blew up. It did like amazing. And then MTV came and filmed me because this back when it was weird to meet people off the internet where it was like real creepy and like goals were like hanging out with me because of my site. And so like they filmed me about that. And then it kind of blew up and then publishers came back like, we want to do a book with you. And I'm like, yeah, thanks assholes. That was when I was new to entertainment. I didn't know what a bullshit farset all was. And so then I did my first book, helped his air beer and all came out in 2006 and hit the best hour list and then kind of took off from there. Yeah. And so do you think that these publishers didn't originally connect with you because it was a risk to take on what you were doing or you didn't have any sort of notoriety or weren't known? Like what was it that they were rejecting? The ones that did, I guess, the ones that didn't know are you? Right. There's a couple things. So the obvious thing is if you work in public, everyone who works in book publishing wanted to be a writer and failed. And so like all they know how to do is replicate what other people are already doing. They can't see anything new, right? Because by definition, if they could, they would go write it. They would have done it. Exactly. Right. And so you have people picking winners who don't know what winners are except in the past. You know, I mean, that's why every great writer has a million rejection stories. Harry fucking Potter for Christ sake, JK Rowling was rejected from like 27 publishers, right? Classic like four times before they finally took her. And so like, like that's the comical thing about this. And that was back before, you know, like there were gatekeepers now there's none. It's different, right? But the other thing I didn't understand at the time, which was a big thing is publishing is dominated by women. I mean, for better or worse, it's just like it's like 80, I think it was 70% then now it's probably 80 or 90% women. Interesting. And like my stuff is even though half my fans are women, the type of women who love my books don't tend to work in book publishing, right? They tend like those tend to be like, I can imagine that's true. The girls who like my books were the party girls who were out drinking. They're not reading all day. And so like, like no one who likes my books worked in those companies so they couldn't conceive of anyone liking this because they only like what they. It's why they're really good at doing books for people who go to snobby cocktail parties on the Upper West side because that's what they do. They're bad at publishing books for the rest of America. Yeah, which is interesting because obviously you're leaving out a huge portion of people who would be very, very interested in what you have to say. Obviously that's true for you, right? Is this a big reason why you started to scribe media? I know that's been big. In fact, I told you before we hit record that you and I talked years ago, maybe for 15 minutes or so about writing a book, but is this the catalyst for the media company now? As part of it. It was more honestly, it was more that like everyone wants to write a book and everyone kept as soon as I'm sure you wrote a book. So I'm sure you know. First question to get what's about. Second question, how do I write my book? You know, like tell me how you had to do it, right? Everyone wants to do it and no one wants to actually put in the work. And so I was like long, long story short, this entrepreneurial woman basically like asked me how to write a book without writing it. And I totally called her out and made fun of her and I gave her all the snobby, elitist, writer things, you know, everyone wants to be a star, don't want to put in the work. And she's like, if you're an entrepreneur, you would actually help me solve my problem and not lecture me about hard work. And I was like, so then I like, I kind of like thought, okay, how do you get a book out of someone's head without ghostwriting? Were you just write a book and then they pay you to put their name on it? It's got to be all their ideas, their words, their voice. I was like, oh man, scribes have been doing this for 2000 years. Like, you know, Plato wrote down everything Socrates said. And so I kind of came up with a process. We tested it. It worked amazing for her book. And then she started referring people and it kind of just took off, man. There's a huge demand for this. And yeah, I'll tell you what I've seen even now. We're five years in and we mainly worked on entrepreneurial or sort of business books or personal development or people like own businesses like because, you know, they can pay the most money. So we started at the high end. But what we've noticed, man, the big thing I'm working on now, I think the bigger market is for, I want to say memoir, but that's not really right because people think memoir and they think, oh, I'm just going to brag about myself or they think it's arrogant or I haven't done anything. I think both of those are bullshit because no one wants to read. You're right. No one wants to read about a braggy, like Jack Welch, Jackass memoir, where he just talks about himself all the time. Oh, I did this deal. It's like no one cares, dude. But everyone wants to tell their story and everyone wants to speak their truth. And as much media as there is in the world right now, it's still very rare to find anyone who actually speaks their truth, honestly. And so that's like we've come up with a whole workshop where we kind of help people tell their story and speak their truth in a really direct, honest way that any normal person can do. We just like we haven't even really even launched yet. Still in beta. I think that's going to be huge, man. That's the thing that like we're opening up to that as a world. That's the thing I'm most excited about right now with a company. Do you think, I agree with you when it comes to truth that everybody wants to talk about their realistic version of reality, right? What they see and how they see the world and not filtered through what it should be, right? What everybody tells you what it should be and if it's PC and all this kind of stuff. It seems to me that a lot of people are afraid of that because of the risk of being canceled or called out or ridiculed or mocked. Like how does somebody overcome that? Because obviously you're a polarizing figure and that's something that you've managed to do very well in spite of criticism from a lot of different sources. Yeah. So I'll just tell you, people who are, it's not about opinion, right? So like you're right. If you want to talk about Trump or you want to talk about Bernie Sanders or whatever, then it's like there's the other, the anti-tribe of that tribe you like that hates you or whatever. That silences some people, but that's a pin. No one's truth is I'm for Bernie Sanders or I'm against Bernie Sanders. That's no one's personal truth. That's just a tribe you're affiliated with. I'm talking about like, what are the things you really honestly think and feel and believe about your life that you want to talk about? Trump is not anyone's life, but Trump, right? So that's not, no one's personal Trump is unless Trump did something specifically to you, your truth does not involve. It doesn't involve him, sure. Right, exactly. And so like what we really more work on is like what's your personal truth, but people are extremely afraid of that. It's less cancel culture, it's more judgment. And so like, which is cancel culture is a form of judgment, no doubt, but it's like kind of broad judgment of people you don't know. What most people are afraid of, what's my family going to think? What are my friends going to think? You know, what if I'm wrong? All that kind of shit, man. People are absolutely just wrapped up afraid of that. And I get it, man, because everyone's living in such a deep fear of judgment. I'll tell you, man, the way I dealt with it is the way I deal, continue to deal with it is I, first I do my work, right? When I was young, I was like, fuck those people. I don't care what they think, they're irrelevant. That works well if you're going to be a gadfly in media, which I was, right? You're going to play that role, like the Joker role or whatever it is and it worked well. But emotionally for a person, it doesn't really work well. And it kind of depends how you do it. But I'll tell you individually, like if you're not a public figure, and the way that you deal with it, the way I deal with it is I understand that everything everyone else thinks about me is not actually about me. It's about them. They're projecting all of their own stuff onto me. Now I'm saying, again, assuming like, you know, if I rob somebody, then they're not projecting what they think of me, right? That really happened. Right. Exactly. But like, you know, if some, I say something to someone and they're like, you know, would you said was mean? And I'm like, hold on a minute. Like, are you sure it was me or are you taking it that way, right? And obviously we negotiate reality between two people. But in my experience, the vast majority of people don't see you as you are. They see you as they are. Yeah, that makes sense. I actually like this approach better than that whole zero F's mentality. You know, you hear that a lot on social media and everywhere else. Like, I don't care about anything. It's like anything. Like there's nothing and nobody's opinion that you care about. And usually when you have to tell people something, it's usually because you're trying to convince yourself of something that isn't necessarily true. Right. So we're trying to convince yourself. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's fun. I want to go back to a term that you use that I actually don't like. You said my truth. I will say that I like how you described it because you're not saying it as absolute truth, which I think some people conflate the two terms. This is objective truth versus this is just the reality, my perception of a series of events. Oh, dude, those are two totally different things. Right. Anyone who thinks that they know objective truth is about to scam you or steal from you. Good point. No, seriously. Like there's anyone who's that foolish and that myopic, you can only be like a Marxist or a murderer. Well, I think this, it's kind of funny to say that because I think this plays out quite often in politics from politicians who want to steal from you. And from those who get wrapped up overly wrapped up in politics, believing that their side is objectively right, always 100% of the time. Oh, of course. That's what politics is. It's just tribal warfare is all I mean, come on, like, how can you watch the last three years in America? If it took you that long to figure out, okay, fine. But like, how can you live in America the last three years and not realize politics is literally nothing but tribal warfare that's made to look fancy and appropriate? That's it. It's all it is. Right. I think it's okay and a healthy quantity as long as you realize it for what it is, right? And you take it for what it is and you don't get overly wrapped up in it and you still focus on the things that actually pertain to your life, not some random information that will never actually apply to you. Yeah. I don't know what quantity useless tribal warfare is important though. I mean, like I pay attention to none of it, man. Like it like, or as little as I can get away with. Like I don't even know who's running for the Democratic primary, no care. Like, right, it doesn't matter. It literally doesn't matter. It's a bunch of apes jockeying for status, the position on status hierarchy that I'm not on. Do you think that, well, you know, I don't know if you're, it's not that you're not on it. I think we're all in it. What do we realize it or not? If you choose to be in it, you're in it. I don't want you to understand this. You're impacted by it. Do you agree with that? Um, I mean, it, I'd be foolish to say there's no way I'm impacted by it. Of course, like I live in the country, but, uh, so like, of course there's ways for it to impact me. I think it's far less impactful than most people think. Yeah, there's some people who would screw up a bunch more stuff and blah, blah, blah. I'm sure. Okay. All that's true. Like, uh, so I'm not going to be like, no, I'm not, I don't live on an island by myself. Absolutely not. I live in America. It's not just taxes. Like, of course I'm impacted by it. I just, I don't think the president is really all that impactful, um, to most people's day to day lives. I think the, I think the media does a good job getting people spun up about it when it's not nearly as pertinent or relevant as they would make it out to be. But if you understand the motive, that's a business model. That's what I'm saying. Like, you know, and sometimes business models align. Like if, uh, you know, a clothing company, for example, or a car manufacturer wants to hype up their car and it aligns with the fact that I need a vehicle, then okay, as long as I understand that motive, that it's their job to paint their vehicle in the best light possible. And I take that into consideration and I can make, uh, an effective purchase. Yeah. I mean, whatever, like I get it. The, the older I get, the more emotional work I do, the more I check out of consideration, the sooner I'm in school, the sooner I'm in school, the more I focus on the people I love and care about and the work I do that matters to them. I think that's a great place to, uh, place your time and emphasis and energy because that stuff is finite and we only have so much of it. So I think it's better spent there for sure. At times, the only thing we can replace, right? That's right. Hey, so when it comes to therapy, you know, you talked about doing this for a long time and you've done a lot of different modes and practices of therapy. What have you found to be the most useful for yourself? So for me, um, uh, talk therapy was really good, but, uh, plant medicine therapy has just blown the lid off for me, man. Like, so I started with MDMA therapy, uh, about a year and a half ago and I did, uh, like six or seven sessions of that and it was, man, it was just game changing for me. It's so many ways. And, uh, like I never felt loved that deep. I had never felt safety that deep. I had all kinds of stuff that I had buried, came up, dealt with it. I was able to let it go. It was so amazing. Um, and then I also have done, uh, a few sessions of psilocybin therapy, like mushrooms, which has been amazing. Uh, it's, oh man, it's literally rewired my brain in certain ways and like a lot of negative patterns. I was able to let go of really easily because I just made that easier. Um, and then recently I moved up to or onto a LSD therapy, which has been like pretty amazing too, um, in a very different way. Like LSD just tears the facade off of reality and you see real clearly everything. It's like, oh wow. And you're self starting with yourself, but then everything else too. And it's, it's pretty shocking, man. It's pretty breathtaking, but those modalities have, I probably done more work over the last 18 months. I've made more progress over the last 18 months because, um, I, I, I introduced those modalities to my, my therapeutic practice. And it's just been, I mean, I don't want to say I'm a different person, but I am like, I'm the best version of myself I've ever been and I keep getting better. Man, let me hit the pause button on the conversation real quick. You've likely heard about the iron council by now, uh, before, but what I wanted to share with you today is something that we are working on starting next week. We call it the 12 week battle plan and it's a system that we've developed over the past five years to help you accomplish more in a 90 day span than you potentially have in an entire year. Uh, in fact, when I wrote my book sovereignty, I completed it using the battle planning cycle and the same system that the members of the iron council are currently using. Obviously life has taken a very strange turn for most of you in 2020, uh, but using the battle plan and the accountability found inside of the iron council will help ensure that you get back out ahead of things, uh, and make the most of a very, uh, very strange situation. We'll call it. Uh, if you want to learn more and band with us, head to order a man.com slash iron council to learn more and to lock in your spot at the table. Again, order a man.com slash iron council. You can do that after the show for now. I'll finish things up with Tucker. Yeah. How do you, how do you measure that, that progress? Like what is it that you're quantifying when you say, man, I've made more progress over the past year than I ever have. Like what does that actually look like? So for me, I think about how well am I connecting with my kids emotionally, right? So like little things like, um, it used to be my, I've got little kids. They're like five, three and eight months, right? So they lie, but only about like treats or things like they're not, right. They're even manipulative yet, right? Or, or if they are manipulative, it's really transparent. I'm going to say they're actually like super manipulative, but it's not usually like really transparent. It's like they haven't been able to think of model my mind yet, you know, for sure. And so, um, so like I'll give you a really good example. So I used to get up early. My deal with my wife is when we have, you know, like kids under a year, she breastfeeds and then, uh, they sleep in our bed, they co-sleep, right? With her. And then I go, I don't have to wake up. Like she deals with the kid all night, but then in the morning I get up with the kids and she can sleep in and I kind of do breakfast and whatever. It's like a perfect deal. She gets to sleep in. I don't have to wake up at night. And so I'm a big fan of divisional labor, man. And so, uh, so anyway, so she, um, uh, I noticed this like after my second MDMA session, my kid, we always hang out together in the living room, either watch TV or do something. They were all climbing on top of me and sitting on me. Like whereas before, they, they weren't scared of me or anything, but they, I don't know, they just weren't like drawn to me physically on top of me. Now it's almost a little annoying, man. Like I can't sit anywhere without them climbing all over me, which half of me loves because they're like little monkeys and all of playing with them. The other half is like, okay, at some point you've got to play with something else in our huge house. Like you can't all only just be me. But it's like, uh, like that's just one of those small things, right? Or the way my wife and I interact, the way we have sex, like it's always been great physically, but there's an emotional element that's, we already had one, but it's just that there's depths of that that like never had before the way my company has grown man so much of what's happened here. I'm not the CEO, but so much of the growth here. Like it's both me coaching certain people and helping them being in a space to do that, but then also me getting out of the way, man. Like the more medicine work you do, the more you kind of separate from your ego and drop all the bullshit. And it's like, I didn't realize how many incredibly talented people I had and how little I had to do for this company to actually grow faster, you know, like those sorts of things. All real direct impacts in my life, pretty much all of them do in part to medicine doesn't do the work for you, man, the plant medicine. It just opens up a space. It's a tool like a, uh, that opens up a space and you got to kind of make realizations about yourself and apply them to your life and they're hard realizations, dude. And it brings up hard emotions. So like people have this, some people have this idea in their heads like, Oh yeah, it'll be like doing an L C to concert. It's like, no, it's not like that at all. It's hellish at times. Like one, I did one, uh, session white combined LSD and MDMA, which is a really good combination. And it was seriously like doing two or three years of therapy in one day. But that's not like, that's not easy, man. That's exhausting. Like that is like, it's, I felt the next day like I'd been in a fight. It was terrible. But I felt the means like as I integrated it, like I felt incredible, you know, so it's been a big change, man. Yeah, I imagine I'm not familiar with it. I mean, I'm familiar with it, but not personally familiar. I haven't had any experiences that way. Um, it seems to me from the outside looking in with limited information that it tears down self imposed and maybe even societally imposed barriers and limitations that we're not aware of. Yes. That's a big, big part of it. So Terrence McKinnon, who's probably one of the best thinkers about psychedelics wrote about that all the time. That's huge. The, that I don't know if that's the biggest thing. The biggest thing for me was, man, I didn't realize how much trauma I had stored in my body, how much unfelt feelings I had and how, how they drove the whole ship for me and, and, and, and psychedelics and plant medicines opened a space where they could come up and I could feel them and then let them go. That was really important. Yeah. LSD, especially though, is where it tears down. It's like, Oh, you think this is reality? Wrong. Like, you know, like you think this wrong. Like it, it kind of show, it doesn't even show you reality necessarily. It just breaks down what you think is actually true. But you know, it's like, Oh man, I knew that a lot of it stuff you actually already know or it's like, doesn't necessarily give you answers. It just shows you different angles on things. A lot of people have used LSD for creative work. I get it now, man, because it really strips away a definite that one of the first things I saw on LSD and I knew this. I knew this intellectually. It was a different experience was how essentially we create our own reality, right? Not saying that there isn't some subjective reality. I mean, where like, it's not like you're a figment of my imagination or vice versa, but that like pretty much like we use words and concepts and ideas and stories to create our reality and it was shodered to me in a way I just had never seen or thought about like an in depth of it. I was like, Oh my God, man. Like I'm totally right. I had been locked in by a bunch of calcified ideas of other people that just weren't true. Hmm. Interesting. Is this when you do these therapy sessions, are they done under like medical supervision or do you work with somebody? Like how does this how does this actually work? Yeah. So I use different facilitators for different medicines because you know, different people are like kind of experts. But basically, I mean, look, this stuff's all legal right now, right? So breaking the law, right? MDMA is scheduled to be legalized in 2021 or 2022. I think it's in state tree clinical trials. It's close and then civil side means right behind it. And it's already gotten breakthrough treatment designation from the FDA. So they're like, it's on the path to be legalized, right? I'm just impatient. So I was like, fucking, I'm going to do it myself. But there are a lot of underground facilitator, not a lot. There are a number of underground facilitators who've been the kind of pioneers who've been doing this for decades, you know, and walking people through it. There's a whole world I had no idea about. Yeah. Yeah. recreational. Right. People do. I'm thinking like, you know, it's not like hippies doing their thing. Yeah, I get it. I get it. It's none of that, man. Like I've never still never done any of this recreationally ever. I can't, I don't know how people do this stuff recreationally, man. Like, is it? It is mind melting. Like, like, one of my facilitators has this massive house or massive, massive kind of land that they live on in their house there. It's like I go out there and it's like a huge, and I mean, like even going outside on one of these sessions a little bit is mind bending to me. I have no idea how people do this. The concerts are function on it. Yeah. But no, I have facilitators I work with and they're very experienced. Some have medical backgrounds, some don't, but they all really know what they're doing and they help me, you know, integration before and after and going into the medicine, working with it, moving the energy, whatever it is they do, all that stuff. Yeah. I guess that's good because, you know, I think about it again from the outside looking in and not a whole lot of perspective on this is, you know, playing with a loaded gun, right? If it's that powerful to impact positive change in you, it also means just as powerful to impact negative and destructive change in you as well. Yeah. I would not recommend just being like, oh, I heard Tucker on a podcast. I'm gonna go buy LSD from a drug dealer and just see what it's like. I would highly recommend you don't do this. I'd sad that you need to say that, but, you know, there's a lot of people who, you know, take what you might say or I might say or any number of guests that we might have on and think, oh, well, because this guy did it, I guess I'll go do it. It's like, well, think about what he's saying. Think about the context and the nuance and then be smart. How would it apply to your life? I'm saying. Just be smart. And it's sad that you needed to say that, but man, we're in a situation. It seems like where, man, not a lot of people are anymore. You know, I read something. I was preparing for our conversation and I read something. I can't remember exactly where I came across it, but you had talked about maybe in an interview that you kind of resented your past reputation and getting into this whole, you know, like red pills, slash in cell, manosphere movement. Can you talk me through that a little bit in your thoughts about those types of movements and causes? Yeah. So I don't know. I'm not sure exactly what you read. My guess is like I don't like being associated with things and ideas that aren't mine, right? So like in cells, not me, red pills, not me, menospheres, not me. Like those are other people's things and ideas and tribes and I don't really care. Like they can have their own thing, whatever, right? Has nothing to do with me. And so it's a trick that the media plays. I'm sure you know, is like they'll take, if it's someone that they're talking about, whether they want to raise or lower their status, they'll associate them with something that's conceing as positive or negative, right? Sure. So like some media person who doesn't like me, they'll be like, you know, Tucker Max, who commonly associated with manosphere, movement or whatever, whatever is like in or out at the moment, right? And I just always hate being associated with things. I don't like being associated with things that aren't mine. Like I'll carry my baggage. I'm not carrying anyone else's. Is the problem that you don't have, I like that perspective. I'm wondering if the reason you do it is because you don't have control over the narrative and there's so much outside of your control that you might get lumped into something that is not representative of you or your thought process. Oh, of course. That's 100% why. That's why. That's the reason. That's the whole thing. Yeah, that makes sense. I was wondering if there was something that you saw inside of those movements because I know there's a lot of guys listening that, you know, they, and I agree in that I don't want to be associated with that either. I'm just wondering if there's something inside of those movements that is a turn off for you or is something that you see as not being healthy for men. Yeah, so it depends on the movement and it depends on the part of the movement, right? I don't think there's a way to talk about the red pill movement consistently, right? Sure. Yeah. Almost any idea you would say that or if I said, well, I don't like X about the red pill movement, I think you could plausibly say, hold on, I'm not sure that's part of it, right? Right. Right. Maybe incels are a little more tightly defined, but I mean, do we really have to talk about why I'm not a fan of dudes or in the idea of involuntary celibacy? You've already told your own story. That's just nonsense, right? Right. Sure. No doubts. I mean, look, bless your heart, man, but you've told yourself this story and this is who you're going to be. So like you paid like, don't get mad if you wrecked your car when you drove into a pole on purpose, right? Yeah. And then, but look, if there is a thread in the manosphere movement that I always chafed against or didn't like, it seemed like there was a deep thread of resentment and anger towards women, right? And like not all dudes in that movement and not all people, I'm not whatever, but it seemed like there were especially like some of the bigger voices, like they hate women. And everything they talk about is about just so toxic and destructive, man. And it's like, oh, and I see these younger guys like, oh, well, this person has an audience and he says that I should do this. I'm like, that person says sociopath and he hates himself. Following him maybe isn't the right path. But if you want to try, go try, right? I mean, like you'll figure it out, man. You'll end up lonely and sad and like, okay, maybe I need to try something else, right? And so like, like that, that was always the thread that like, I mean, there's positive threads of it too, but I just, it just always, like, cause what annoyed me about being associated with that is like, I'm like everything I ever did in my books and my life was about getting women to like me so they would sleep with me, which is its own issue. You can intrigue that and I get it. Like I know, I know the critiques of that better than anybody, right? But like you've heard them all, I'm sure. Right. Of course. And I know what the real ones are. Like I get what's wrong with that mindset very well. It's part of what I've had to kind of deal with. But that's not hating women. That's about like, I want this, I'm going to go have fun and do it. There was a positive sort of side to it, or at least a joyous side where so much of the red pill stuff was just so toxically negative and hateful. And I'm like, this is, I just didn't want to be associated with it. That's really it. Yeah. No, I wanted to talk about it because it was something that I saw and got brought up and it's actually something that we deal with as well, you know, is we can get lumped into that. What I'm doing here into that category pretty quickly. I agree. I think the underlying threat of a lot of these movements is victimhood. Right. It's that we are victims. And so therefore we need to fight back or we need to rebel or it almost in a way moves towards becoming the masculine version of third way feminism. It 100% is. It's not almost. It is exactly what it is. Oh, yeah. No, 100%. Oh, no, I like, I've made that point. And this a few years ago or some point like that. And I mean, dude, all the manosphere pansies got their panties in a wad and freaked out. And I'm like, all right, well, then that your reaction should tell you that it's exactly right. It is. We're victims. The other side is the enemy. We're right about everything. They're wrong about everything. I'm like, all right. There you go. Like, what do you want? Yeah. Yeah. I think this comes back down to what you were talking about earlier with the with the tribalism and it's us versus them. But in all reality, you know, I look at a man's relationship, men's relationship in general with women is that of cooperation, not necessarily a competition, right? Like we need to cooperate cooperate with women. Women need to cooperate with us, whether it's raising a family or running an organization or just operating like functional human beings in society. We need to cooperate and work together to make things happen. 100%. There's enough hardship on on earth. We don't need to be fighting. Men and women don't need to be fighting. Like we can have our interests were aligned for thousands of years. They can still be aligned if we want. It's a choice. Like, yeah. Yeah. Well, what's next for you, man? What's obviously you've got scribe and I imagine you have interest in other businesses as well. But what are some some plans that you have moving moving into the future? So honestly, the big thing is what I talked about earlier is the memoir workshop. We call it one last book. Because the idea is if you were to write one last book, what would you say? And it kind of is a prompt to get people to really think, okay, I got to put my whole truth in here. And that's that's this whole year for me is really focused on that. I feel like we haven't hit the peak of the tribalism phase. I think it's going to peak in like probably with a general election in November, like that'll be the way and then it's going to get interesting. Hopefully, it will be so awful that everyone with a brain is like, okay, that's terrible. Let's never do that again and go the other way. And I think people are going to really start to you talk about localism. I'm a big fan of that. I think it's really that that movement is coming. And I also think a movement of a way from I'm a woman and man or bad or I'm a Democrat Republicans are bad. And who am I? Why am I angry? Why am I sad? Because it probably has nothing to do with a political party or a gender. It probably has a lot to do with my own life and how I was raised, what I got, what I didn't get, how I'm acting, what my life is like. And it's not the only way to take responsibility and accountability for your life. But I think a really good place for a lot of people to start is by actually writing out, thinking about and uncovering what their truths are and what their life has been and writing that out so they can see, okay, this is who I actually am. And then that's a good place for a lot of people. Not everyone, but a lot of people to start. I agree with that. When I wrote my book, which was a couple of years ago, last month, it was two years ago, I thought I had a pretty good idea of the experiences I had and what they culminated into and what I believed. And that book writing process was actually very therapeutic for me because I was able to crystallize some thoughts and reevaluate some thoughts as well. I actually don't know if I believe that or where did I learn that? Because I don't think that's serving me. And going through the process myself was very, very powerful to help me shore up what it is I was all about and what I wanted to create. It was a good process for me. There's very, I actually like writing better than just therapy because it's so easy to talk yourself in circles and therapy. But if you're sitting down and willing to be honest with yourself, writing about your life, especially with a few key prompts and a few key questions, you'll unlock a lot more than you will in therapy, especially therapy alone. That's a good thought too is that those prompts, right? I can't tell you even when it comes to journaling, for example, how many guys will say, well, I don't know how to journal. I'm like, I don't know, just write things, you know? But having those prompts is actually really just powerful. I know I hope you do it in the right way. No, it is. Dude, I mean, I'll tell you, it's so funny. We have a, the workshop is three days for one last book. And I'm not joking when I tell you it might be an hour and a half, two hours max spread over three days of actual writing instruction because it's so simple. Like I'll tell you that literally the algorithm we use for writing your one last book, it's three questions. What happened? How did you feel about it? What did you do or learn as a result? And just repeated over and over again. Over and over and over. Now, the devil of this is in the details because like the reason it's three days is because once you start asking deeper questions about your life, why you're writing the book, what you're hoping to get out of it, all this emotional, if you're in the space where you want to do it, right? If you don't want to write the book, then it doesn't make sense. But if you're in that space, then all this emotional stuff comes out. And so we kind of help you navigate through that, right? What's coming up, why is it coming up, how to write about it, all that kind of stuff. But the actual instructions are dead simple. What happened? How did I feel? What did I learn? Yeah, I could see this being like some sort of, I don't know, like an exercise clinic. You know, it's like people go to these clinics. It's like, well, you know, you need to just lift heavy weights. But there's some nuance there. There's some ways to do it that won't get you hurt. And I imagine that's what you're filling in there. Basically, pretty much. So with all due respect to what you're doing, I'm really curious, do you think with the rise of self publishing and how many people have a desire to write a book and now it's becoming easier and easier to do with self publishing and your options like yours and Amazon that it, I don't know, cheapens is the right word, but just saturates the market so much that it becomes ineffective or unimportant? No, that's a scarcity mindset. I actually think it's the other way around. I think there is a never ending supply for honest, authentic, meaningful stories. That's all we consume as humans, right? I mean, like the information is a tiny bit of it. All the rest is context and story. And I think what we're trying to do is teach people how to really uncover their story and tell their story because you've got to uncover it first. Most people don't know. Like you said, you sat down to write and you realize all this stuff about your life and you seem like a pretty observant and dialed in and self-aware guy, right? Far more than most people. Well, imagine what most people are like. Yeah. You know? And so it's like, okay, how do you actually do that? We don't, I mean, I know you know this, but like think about the most important things. Relationships love self-awareness. We don't teach any of this in our culture, right? And so like if we can teach people how to, just how to understand their own story and tell it to others, that by itself, I think there's an endless demand. I know I would much rather read amazingly heartfelt memoirs than watch another stupid zombie show on Netflix, right? Yeah. But if there's no good heart, I mean, I've read all the good memoirs I feel like, you know, there aren't that many more. Well, what's interesting is everybody's got a story and somebody needs to hear your story because they would be impacted positively by it. And what I hear a lot of guys, whether they say it or not, what they're, what they're telling themselves is learning how to communicate effectively isn't really all that important because we know how to do it because we do it every day. It's like, well, no, like the reason that you need to learn how to get good at it is because somebody can be served and that somebody could be your son or your wife or the little kid who's on your baseball team or a coworker or an employee. Like somebody will be impacted positively by you learning how to communicate, whether it's spoken or written word. Mm hmm. You just wrote my marketing copy. I was a little tired. I was taking notes. I'm not even kidding, man. If you heard a typing sound, that's what that was. That's funny. Well, good. Good. Glad I could help. Hey, Tucker, man, I've appreciated this conversation. I was really looking forward to it and I actually kind of curious about how this would go down, but I am pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed our conversation together, man. Me too, man. Thank you, brother. Hey, let me ask you a couple additional questions. The first one is what does it mean to be a man? Yeah. That's such a hard question because I don't, I hate all of the. Tribal answers, men, you know, smell like gas, men do hard work, men this, men that, it's like, like throw all that shit away. The thing that's always resonated with me is that men are responsible and accountable for safety and protection and provisions, right? And I don't think I have words, meth that exactly, right? Or thought about it deep enough, but like, because look, the hard biological reality is that women are the basis of biology, right? Like, like beings, the gender that reproduces is the basis of biology. And the only reason sex exists is because essentially parasitic competition, right? So we had to, men had to be created. I don't mean human men, I mean males and females in a, in a biologic sense, because just women reproducing, right? Like, you know, like a nonsexual reproduction, which is Alan Manders, it's pretty, you all cells do, it is eventually gets destroyed by parasitic competition, right? And so if you understand that, then you understand like women are kind of the center biologically and our job is, we got to provide sperm, of course, but like our, our purpose is to then provide everything around that reproduction, right? Safety is number one, physical, safe, we live in a world now where it's not as paramount, but it's still more real than you think. Most people, physical safety, emotional safety, all of that sort of stuff. And like, you know, environmental safety, shelter, food, all these, that's safety, right? We, you know, we provide that, the, the mother provides life and sustenance to life, right? And again, I'm not speaking like women have to stay home. I'm talking about on a high level metaphorical basis. So to me, what I have to do, you know what, what it boils down to, I got to earn my place. Every man has got to earn his place. And what manhood means to me is earning your place. Women don't have, and I don't mean this as an insult. You don't have, biologically, you don't have to earn your place. Like you just have a period and then you can have kids. Of course you have to earn things in life. You know, there's no welfare line for women. I'm not saying that. But I'm saying that you don't, they, they are the essence of life. We are in addition to it, right? And so we've got to earn our place. And I don't approach that from a level of insecurity. The other way around, I think it's awesome. It's our chance to be a hero. That's the whole hero's journey for us is they're already going to provide life. We get to go be heroes, but we have to earn it, right? And so I see so many dudes now who are like, are afraid of that. And it's heartbreaking because it's like, that's the whole reason you're here, is to go be some level of a hero for someone. I like him, man. It's powerful. I like the way that you frame that. We talk a lot about some of those concepts you talked about, but the way you framed is very interesting. So I appreciate you sharing. All right, man. How do we connect with you? More about scribe or anything else that you have going on? Where do we go? scribewriting.com is my site. And then I'm all over social media. Tucker Max, easy to find. Right on, brother. We'll sync it all up. Again, I really appreciate you coming on. I'm inspired by your transformation and evolution over the past decade or so that I've been familiar with your work. I think I first came across you, I don't know, probably in some bookstore and an airport or something like that, I'm sure where I saw your books first. So it's cool to be able to talk with you and see how you've changed and transformed your life. I'll check that about you. Thanks, man. Appreciate it. Gentlemen, there you go, my conversation with the one and only Tucker Max. I hope you enjoyed that one. And I hope also that you saw a different light or a different side of Tucker than maybe you've seen in the past or that you're familiar with. We'd love to hear what you think about the show. Hit him up on the socials, hit me up on the socials. Let me know. Let's continue the conversation there. And that's what this is about. It's about having conversation with people who are doing great things, people who have interesting stories to share and then extracting some of their knowledge and wisdom and then implementing in our own lives. And that's the most important thing guys is implementation. We're just listening to the podcast and we're not applying or implementing any of the things that we're learning about. We're wasting time. So make sure that you're applying this stuff and that it is in fact serving you by putting it into action. So we'll wrap things up today. We're going to be back again for the Ask Me Anything tomorrow. I've got a couple of surprise guests that I'm going to bring on here in the next several weeks because we need to talk about some of this coronavolt virus fallout and everything else that's going on. So stay tuned for that. Make sure you subscribe to the podcast. If you would also just leave me a rating review. All right, it goes a long way, just a very long way in promoting the visibility of the show and what we're doing and getting this message of reclaiming and restoring masculinity out to the masses, which is exactly where it needs to be. So make sure you subscribe. Make sure you share it. Leave a rating review and continue to tune in. We'll be back tomorrow and then also Friday for our Friday field notes. Let me and Tucker know what you thought about the show and the conversation and we'll continue this over on the socials, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, wherever you're doing it. All right, guys, we'll be back tomorrow. Until then, go out there, take action and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life. To be more of the man you were meant to be, we invite you to join the order at quarterofman.com."
