    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. This is the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show guest hosting today from the Pacific Northwest Radio and podcast host and digital media strategist, Todd Herman. Thank you for having me on this. The day the Lord has made these the times through which God has decided we will live. There is an energy to talking with you in live radio that simply doesn't exist in podcasting as much as I like being able to dig deep into topics. I can't tell you how much it means to be able to feel the audience there to interact with the team such an honor. And we're looking, at least I am, for the definitive phone call to make the case so whether or not President Trump is making a mistake in continuing to tout these injections. And look for the definitive call to make that case or the reverse that no, he's absolutely right doing that. And how does Ron the Santa's figure into this? I'm curious about this genuinely from a perspective of electoral politics, but also for morality in terms of what these injections are apparently doing. So phones are open on that and anything else you want to talk about at 800-282-282. There is a dynamic that began to talk about as virtuous racism. And of course it's an oxymoronic phrase, but we live in times almost completely defined by oxymoronia. I like that oxymoronia. What is virtuous racism? Virtuous racism starts with pity of the other because they cannot do on their own. It starts with that core belief. The secondary belief in virtuous racism is you yourself, having observed the pitious other, are the single human being or single group of human beings who can in fact rescue the pitious other from themselves. Now part of this sounds like big government, but it extends beyond that because it requires also a removal. Virtuous racism can never be practiced in person. It can never be practiced in giving in person. It can be charity at a far such as stroking a check or creating policy, but it is never hand in hand helping another human being, looking at other human being in the eye. Virtuous racism has to be done a step removed from physical contact with these people because after all they're the pitious other. You are the great and mighty and so you don't want to mingle, but you want to help or you want to be seen to help. This is how virtuous racism is set up. It also requires this belief that people who are the pitious other simply cannot possibly be expected to live within the constraints that other people live within because again they're the pitious other. And sometimes it sneaks out of people's mouths and they don't even know that they're saying it. And I'll get into some specifics about this as it's working in our society. I will tell you where this belief came from and how it began to form this belief of the virtuous racism and being practiced largely by the left. It is from hearing things like this. Hearing a woman look me in the are seeing a woman, rich woman, really rich woman, look me in the eye and say I would love to help poor people. I just don't know where to find them. She said those words to me in the San Jose Museum of Technology, which is about a 15 minute walk from some of the poorest sections of San Jose. And she said it out of great caring. She just didn't know where to find poor people. Though that night she was being served dinner by people who in fact probably were working for minimum wage plus tips, but she didn't know where to find them. Now I'm not saying that she's a racist. I don't know, but that sense has been transmitted and transmuted into environments in school like this. Virtuous racism says if BIPOC, which by the way is a virtuous racism phrase because BIPOC means nothing. It means everything and it means nothing. Virtuous racism is displayed in schools by saying not enough BIPOC kids are winning awards. Consequently, we need to scrap the awards so as to not make them feel bad because again, they can't be expected to study. Their parents can't be expected to buy books or to make the biggest difference in a kid's life academically. You know what it is? Reading to kids. In fact, the presence of books in homes are one of the biggest and most common determinants of where kids end up academically and in life as the presence of books in homes because it starts the process of learning, but we can't do that. That's a virtuous racism example. Another. When there are rules at school that are being consistently broken by BIPOC kids, it is not enough to go and say, Hey, what's going on in homes? What has gone on in these communities? How can we reach into these communities and help? It is no. Those rules cannot apply and this is real. This is being done in separate countries like Seattle and Portland, where there are quite literally different rules for kids who are quote BIPOC kids. They are quote BIPOC. Then there are for kids who are white. They are less stringent. That's virtuous racism. And it extends even further extends into the job field. And now is when it becomes not just self perpetuating, but self poisoning. Here's how there are this does this is not an occasional thing. This happens consistently in the separate country of Seattle where governments organizations hold meetings for staff. But they are organized completely by race. That if you are BIPOC, you certainly cannot be safe hearing the opinions of white people. So you must be encased in a meeting that is only for so called black and brown people. And the virtuous racism here, here's where it's self poisons. It creates a mental and psychological dynamic where you are saying to people through your actions, you are not safe even hearing the words of white people. So virtuous racism then is also the creation of the pittiest other, the virtuous self, and then the dangerous third. Who are the dangerous third? The dangerous third are people who will not play the virtuous racism game from the perspective of the virtuous other. This comes across in things like you watch the banning of any, any school named after a world famous brain surgeon. Who happened to serve in the Trump administration who is now absolutely persona non grout. He can't have schools named after himself anymore. I'm not even allowed to say his name. If I want to play the virtuous racism game. It works like that or works like this. When black people achieve. It is not because of hard work. It is not because of political or correctness. It's not because they were placed in a job, although that's sometimes the case. In fact, it's expressly the case in a Supreme Court justice who doesn't know that she's a woman, but though she's black. She was expressly put into the job because of that, but that in and of itself isn't, isn't enough anti racism. Virtuous racism has a hunger for racism that exceeds the supply and as you'll hear in this clip. When the demand for real racism exceeds the supply, we get garbage phrases like glass cliffs as we hear from MSNBC about two black women at the very top of their careers. You've obviously heard of the glass ceiling. Well, this is a little bit like a glass cliff. The idea that women get a better chance of breaking through that ceiling only when someone is needed to clean up an intractable mess. The danger, of course, is that in cleaning up the mess, you run the risk of falling off the cliff. White women and women of color and men of color as well tend to be appointed CEO or head coach to losing teams or organizations in crisis. What we further find is that they're often blamed for the crisis that was not up there making, that predated their leadership trajectory and held to account for the crisis. So again, this feels like a really vicious feedback loop where women are essentially set up to fail. And when they do fail, critics say, see, should have never had a woman. That's affirmative action at work. We know this phenomenon in real life. We have a sitting member of the Supreme Court, Katanji Brown Jackson, who herself faces a kind of glass cliff situation. She's the first woman of color, the first black woman, rather, to serve on the high court. But she comes onto the court just as a conservative super majority is chipping away at civil rights. What is her glass cliff? How does she grapple with this navigate this in this lifetime appointment? The irony that she's joined the court in the wake of jobs during the arguments for the affirmative action cases, the cases before the court on voting on LGBTQ equality and more. She's sort of a singular voice around blackness on the court right now. It is a burden that no human can bear. So when virtuous racism is employed, you take illogic like, well, when are new coaches hired? When a team is doing poorly? Wait, we want more black coaches, right? We want more black coaches, but only when teams are doing well. So wait, fire the white coach whose team is doing well so that you can hire a black coach at the height of this, right? Virtuous racism sets up the pittiest other in a point where even when they rise to the highest possible level, like they were talking there about the Harvard president and a Supreme Court justice, you rise to the highest possible level. It's still racism. And virtuous racism extends itself into the most bizarre things. We don't know how some black people are fighting racism and this will show them. This will show them. They're taking mushrooms. No, they're taking psychedelic mushrooms as an effort to fight racism. This is from vice.com that is celebrating more black people getting into the psychedelic scene because that's a way to fight racism because when you're the pittiest other, what else do you have? But taking brains, you know, taking mushrooms that turn your brain into a mix between a Disney theme park and a Halloween horror movie. Well, if you take the wrong ones, that's what I'm told. We come back. We're looking for the definitive arguments is President Trump making a mistake continuing to back the injections, the M R and A injections should he back off of that. That is wrong. The Santa's figure into this plus what is it that inclusion gets you when you have hate to say it, murdered your family. Do you get a reward for inclusion? Yeah, I'll tell you about that. It's taught herman and for clay Travis and Buck Sexton. I've got something you don't have free checking from your big bank. Yeah, no charge. You're right. I have Epic premium checking from CBC credit union. Just $10 a month. Yeah, but see, Epic premium checking comes with identity theft and self-um protection. Yeah, I pay separately for that. Roadside assistance. That too. But you get discounts on gas like I do with Epic premium checking. No. Extended warranties when you use your debit card. How about a quarter percent increase on CBC term share certificate rate? Seriously. Think of all the things you could stop paying for plus all the added benefits you get with Epic premium checking. Then we'd have the same thing. Yeah, we would. Sometimes free means nothing. But at CBC credit union, Epic premium checking means you get more than $90 in monthly benefits for just $10 a month. Like identity theft and cell phone protection, discounts on gas and local eateries and more. If you're hearing this radio ad, you too can get Epic premium checking. Just call 805-888-EPC or go to cbcfcu.org or visit a local branch and become a member. It's fast and simple. Federally insured by NCUA. Are you familiar with the prohibition in Stalinist Russia that it was reporting a crime was a crime? Did you know that? Well, because communism and solved crime, what I bring that up, I'm going to tell you as we do a segment coming up, extending the idea of virtuous discrimination. We just talked about virtuous racism and asking a question of is there a reward after you got it? You did. You killed your parents and a sibling. Do you get a reward for that if there's virtuous discrimination involved? We've also been hunting for it, but frankly out of my curiosity as to people if they can make the definitive cases, whether or not President Trump is making a mistake by continuing to tout the M.R.A. injections. I beg the President to reconsider. He was lied to. He could go. Sorry. I just a picturing President Trump going on offense against Pfizer and Madderda and Fauci. Oh my goodness. Rhetorically would torch them and burn them down. Let's talk to Katie in Florida. Katie, you were on the Clay Travis Buck section. She was taught her in filling and glad you called Katie. Welcome. Hey, Todd. I'm sure glad to hear you again because I haven't heard you since rush past. And that is so kind. Well, I missed you. It's so kind of you to say, hope you'll try their podcast. It's easy to do. The Todd Herman Show.com. I will check it out. I will. Thank you. I'm a transplant from Texas in Florida. And I think that our governor is phenomenal as a governor. And we just elected him, reelected him by 19 points. I think he needs to remain governor for the full four years. I don't think he's ready to be president. I think our president, America's president, will be reelected in 24 if they don't manage to steal the election from us like they did in 20 and 22. But my opinion on the shot is that Trump should back off from it. Robert Malone has even come out with a book now, Lies My Government Told Me. And he's the one that came up with the mRNA formula in the first place. I think that Donald Trump was lied to. And I think that he is strong enough and his supporters believe enough in him that he can step back from this and not have it do him any damage and hopefully help the people who are still getting the jab and being injured. I am one of those people. I received the jab in 21 because my son thinks Fauci walks on water and he wouldn't let me come and see my new granddaughter until I had the shot. Oh Lord God. And since the day after I got the second shot, I have had an occipital headache and a cough that will not go away. I've been to six different doctors. I won't go into all of that. But nobody will admit that it's from the shot. And yet I never had either of these before. And the day after I had the second shot, I woke up and they have never gone away. Now I had the virus in 22 in August. I was treated by Dr. Emmanuel, one of the American Frontline doctors with Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and I made a full recovery and I had hoped because the headache was horrific during the virus and the cough became different. I thought maybe they would go away after having had the virus because also I had an antibody test after having the shot. I had no antibodies. Yeah. I am connected to this organization. So full disclosure, there is an organization in North Idaho and others that are helping people with vaccine injuries. Instead, you know, it's hard of hope health, but you live in Florida. Please get to the Frontline doctor's website. There's a whole series of people who help folks with vaccine injuries or injection injuries from the mRNA. Great comments Kate. So kind of you to remember me. Thank you so much for calling claim bucks show. Paul in Massachusetts, we got about a minute together my friends. Can you be quick here, Paul, in the minutes? Um, can almost go ahead. Almost apparent with the last woman said Trump's being ill-advised if he's, you know, promoting the vaccine. He, he, I mean, Dr. Malone put out three public letters saying that you should vaccinate max vaccinations. They were only to be used for those people that were in impacted communities and should say, yeah, invent the vaccine. Yeah. Good. Yeah. I agree with you. I think the president has to step back from this. Sorry, it was a short call. Paul, I appreciate you being on hold. Uh, I beg, I beg Team Trump, listen, you got lied to people hate being lied to and your supporters are going to be with you if you can come out and talk about the fact that you relied to and the evidence is there. It's all over the place. We'll continue to discuss now virtuous discrimination on the claim bucks show. What an unbelievably nice surprise to be asked in to fill in for Clay Travis and Buck Sexton. And just thanks to the guys for the opportunity and to the team for support. There is something remarkable about live radio. I think it's because my thoughts go to you and it's instantaneous and also a platform of this size. It's, it's something that if you've, and most people have never done it, it's hard to describe the feeling of knowing that you're interacting with so many people who are in many ways of the same mind in, in many, many ways. And I think God just built this connection in us, right? That we can sense these things. Uh, we'll get back to discussion about Trump, um, President Trump, whether he should withdraw his support for the injections. People are telling me, uh, via email that he should team up with Robert Malone and the other doctors who told the truth about the injections and go out and attack Pfizer at attack Moderna. And I totally agree with that. So we'll get back to that. We talked about virtuous racism and virtuous racism is to appoint yourself, the savior of the pittiest other and then to through policy, never through touching, never through face to face interaction, never through the charity of, of human supports in an emotional sense, but through policy and force and confiscation that you demonstrate to the pittiest other that you simply can't do it on your own. Uh, and that we know that. And so you need us. We know that we have a white savior syndrome, but it becomes much, much more. And it crosses from race lines into other societal lines. The biggest one of these is the, the transgender lie. And this is a vital and horrible example. One of them is one of them is funny and it is sort of anti math. If you're familiar with the idea of antimatter, the theory of antimatter, well, there's matter and then there's the opposite of matter. The two meet that they disappear, they cancel each other out. This is actually an anti math statement. It cancels math out and it comes from the GLSEN website, which is sort of a, you know, an ally of people who are same sex attracted and confused about their gender. This is the headline. How do we make math class more inclusive of so-called trans and non binary identities? How would you do that? Here's what you would do is no number means anything. This is how you would do this is you would say, go to the clock, go to the chalkboard. What is 10 plus 10? Well, it depends on how you identify 10. I identify 10 is nine. So in my form of thinking, 10 plus 10 is 18 and I'm right because I identify 10s as dimes. That's how you would do that. It's anti math. When you invest yourself in showing such tolerance that you become completely tolerant of absurdity, it cannot be fed. It cannot be satiated. It's a hunger that can never be met. It's a desire that can never be quenched, a first that can never be taken care of because you can never do it enough. Why? Because there's no payoff. There's no fruits. It's a dishonest labor. Therefore, there is no fruit. It is a lie. Therefore, it cannot have long lasting fruit. So you keep going. You keep pedaling. You're looking for the insulin high or the heroin high of this of, hey, aren't I virtuous and it never gets there. So you end up in circumstances like this. You end up with a biological male, incidentally, silly phrase. There's no such thing and there's no, there's sort of male. You're either male or you're not male. So there is a guy who, and this is tough language. It's not tough language, but it's tough. It's tough in terms of the story. So if there's little ones listening, be cautious. A man murdered his family because they didn't want to pretend that he was a woman. And this guy went on a murder spree. And he went and he murdered his family, his mom on Halloween night, murdered his dad, murdered his brother, did kill the family pet that spared his brother. And I will spare you the details on how he murdered his family because they are chilling because of virtuous discrimination. This man has been labeled a woman for the sake of prison. So here's where virtuous discrimination, virtuous racism gets you is you can't even say in a staff meeting, are we sure that we want to have a man who is stronger, has more muscle mass, higher bone density than any of the women in these prisons? Are we sure? And he murdered people. Are we sure it's a good idea to put women in enclosed spaces with him? Are we sure? Because the virtue can never be quenched. The desire for for being seen as virtuous can never be quenched. If you ground yourself instead, if you're grounding yourself in seeking approval of man, there you land, there is your reward. And sometimes it breaks into the world of just good old fashioned politics. We are the most, well, I don't want to say most advanced, but we are one of the largest countries on earth. We have some of the most diverse needs in terms of infrastructure and transportation. We have our rural areas. We have our urban areas. They all have different forms of transportation. We have air travel, both private and public, large and small trains, et cetera. So who do you appoint to run this? Well, you go to virtuous discrimination. You look at the resumes of 330 million Americans, people who've run logistics for the United States Army or Navy, people who've run it for UPS. People who've run it for FedEx or what other big logistics companies, trucking companies, railroads, you skip them, you skip past them. You say, no, no. In this, the world of this virtuous discrimination, we need to have someone whose resume begins and stops at same sex attracted with the advantage also of having been a mediocre small town mayor. And we, the American people are asked to look at a statement like this for Mayor Pete and say, oh, okay, it's all going to be okay in the country of transportation. So again, boiling it down. One of the biggest nations on earth, we've got a complex transportation system. And as you listen here, this Mayor Pete, he is nothing more than a small town mayor as you're going to hear in this clip. This is an unacceptable situation. You look at the number of passengers who are stranded. You look at how hard it is even to get somebody on the phone to address it. From what I can tell, Southwest is unable to locate even where their own crews are, let alone their own passengers, let alone baggage. So I conveyed to the CEO our expectation that they are going to go above and beyond to take care of passengers and to address this. They indicated a number of issues that they're having with systems, legacy systems for managing their schedule and where their crews are. But the bottom line is the rest of the aviation system has been on the road to recovery since the worst days of the storm going into Friday of last week. As of today, as I'm looking at the different airlines, most of them are in the low single digits in terms of cancellation rates, averaging about 5% for all of the other airlines. For Southwest right now, we appear to be north of 70%. So their system really has completely melted down and I've made clear that our department will be holding them accountable for their responsibilities to customers, both to get them through this situation and to make sure that this can't happen again. So what has he done? He's done that anybody who's watched 5 minutes of the news can say. He's repeated the talking points that are served to him, but here's what he doesn't say. Oh, by the way, they had to fire a bunch of people for not getting injected. Oh, by the way, there's all sorts of union rules that tie up our airports. Oh, by the way, once a plane is late, the federal government has incentivized keeping it late rather than trying to bring it back as you get double late charges. He can't say any of that because his resume stops and begins and stops at same-sex attracted man and nominal small-town mayor because of virtuous discrimination. We'll come back and re-entered the discussion about whether President Trump is making a mistake by not backing off his support for the injections and what should he do? Should he come out and say I was lied to? It's Todd Herman in for Clay Travis at Buck Sexton. I've got something you don't have. What's that? Free checking. From your big bank. Yeah, no charge. You're right. I have Epic Premium checking from CBC Credit Union. Run your what? Just $10 a month. Yeah, but see, Epic Premium checking comes with identity theft and cell phone protection. Yeah, I pay separately for that. So outside assistance? That too. But you get discounts on gas like I do with Epic Premium checking. No. Extended warranties when you use your debit card? No. How about a quarter percent increase on CBC term share certificate rate? Seriously? Think of all the things you could stop paying for plus all the added benefits you get with Epic Premium checking. Then we'd have the same thing. Yeah, we would. Sometimes free means nothing. But at CBC Credit Union, Epic Premium checking means you get more than $90 in monthly benefits for just $10 a month. Like identity theft and cell phone protection, discounts on gas and local eateries and more. If you're hearing this radio ad, you too can get Epic Premium checking. Just call 805-888-EPC or go to cbcfcu.org or visit a local branch and become a member. It's fast and simple. Federally insured by NCUA. Todd Herman in for Clay Travis and Buck Sexton. I appreciate you being there. Can't wait for the guys to get back. I'm sure. Jerry in Washington. You are on Clay and Buck's show as Todd Herman in for the right time. I see it as he was flying to. I think he needs to quit backing it. I do believe that he needs to team up with Dr. Robert Malone and some of the others. Honestly, the fact that they changed the definition of what a vaccine is. The injection was available so that they could call it a vaccine is ridiculous. I agree totally. Donald Trump Jr. as I recollect, he came to North Idaho and he did an event where if I'm not mistaken, I know that a lot of the truth telling frontline doctors were there and I think Dr. Malone was there. So as I recall was Dr. Ryan Cole. The Trump family is next to this. To me, I almost feel like this could be, well, the president's calling was very clear. God used the president in such amazing ways. I think he's using Elon Musk in amazing ways. But if President Trump were to accept the challenge of taking on the Pfizer and Moderna, I don't know that there's anyone else who could dismantle them the same way that in the same way that he could. Only he could take the wrecking ball to them in the way that must be done. And for that matter, the, you know, the biomedical states and I don't, I love the Santis. I don't know that the Santis can do that. He's doing it from policy. He's doing it through the, you know, through the grand jury. But I don't know that he has that same energy. So you're all in on Trump still. He absolutely, he, you know, if anybody that's ever been president, and that's just including Ronald Reagan, I'm old enough to remember Ronnie, but for President Trump to be able to accomplish all the things that he did with everybody against him. You know, it's absolutely incredible. Now the other part to what I told the screener was Mitch McConnell basically has screwed over the Republican party from what I can tell with this on the bus deal. Oh, there's no doubt. Yeah. You know, every one of those stupid Republicans that voted for that in the Senate need to be ousted. And you know, I'm all in favor of, of even though I'm a very conservative Republican, I'm almost tempted to vote Democrat for every one of those people to get them to help out of this in it. I understand the temptation. I do. And I think what McConnell's doing is he is trying to show us the inevitability of the establishment. We're not going to change. We're going to hold power. And on that topic, it reminds me of something I'm getting a lot of emails on this. And so I want to make sure that I mentioned this. Yeah, I appreciate the phone call from the separate country of Washington state. Thank you, brother. I got an email here that I think speaks for a lot of us. And maybe something that needs to be said is this is from Marty. I thought I'm listening to Kline Buck right now. It's good to hear you again. I want to thank you for the way you hosted Russia show. God rest him in those awful weeks after his passing. I was in mourning as if I'd lost my older brother. As for so many others. It became readily apparent that you felt the same way and you handled those broadcasts in a manner that so on and rushes memory and also provided no small measure of comfort to us by just relating to us as another member of the grieving family. You often speak about God having chosen us to live during these times and I desperately hold on to that passage from Esther four as the times become more and more tumultuous. It's not getting any easier. And I still miss the voice of my brother rush. He unique way of keeping optimism in the face of growing insanity. Thanks again, Todd. God bless. I appreciate this note and on this topic. We've covered a lot in the past two days. We've talked about virtuous racism. We've talked about the injections. We've talked about the FBI meddling in our elections and censoring Americans. But yet the heart of all this I want us to reflect upon something. The most powerful agencies on earth have it in for us. They don't want our opinions heard. They don't want our ideas to spread. They want our kids turned into angry drug addicted, racist little sex bots. They had been doing this in secret. It is no longer a secret. And God tells us all that is hidden will be revealed. He doesn't give a timeline on that. He just says, ultimately, it will be so much has been revealed even as they attempted to shut it down has been revealed, even as they're attempting to show us the inevitability of the establishment. We are talking and seeing actions like governor to Santis in the state of Florida recognizing election integrity as key to national integrity, like Kerry Lake. And you can like her or dislike her refusing to simply accept the results of what was a clown show at best in Maricopa County, but instead fighting back. There is a group of young people animated in a way that young people have never been before been animated. They have watched the government steal their childhood. They have watched the government steal their friendships. They have watched the government tell them your body is our body. They have watched as their favorite small businesses are shut down. They have watched lies add up and they will grow up in a generation of people who understand very, very clearly what though and the government tells you something your best bet is to assume it's untrue. In other words, to not trust and then go try to verify they will have grown up in a shadow, but it's not a shadow about which we weren't born and they're not alone. And God is a God who sees despite all the efforts to shut down talk radio that didn't happen. And they tried it with the fairness doctrine and rush Limbaugh defeated that God rest him and now there's the claim bucks show and it continues the tradition this time of the opinions of two Americans being shared on a daily basis on one of the largest if not the largest radio platforms in the world. They can't shut down our voice for a reason. And this is my personal belief. Chock it up to that if you like. God is pro free speech. Oh, he's pro accountability. You better believe it. There is no greater establishment of credit or of accountability than he, but he's pro free speech because our speech is a bridge to him. Our conscience is the only bridge to him. It's in addition to worship. It's the words we form because he gave us the ability to form it in his image. They can't shut us down. They can't shut down the passion. They can't shut down the ideas. They can try to silence him, but they've utterly failed and they've failed because of an audience like this and a network like this and host to refuse to be shut up and refuse to keep telling the truth."
