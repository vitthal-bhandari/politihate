There is no good reason why the opinions and proclamations of the World Professional Association for Transgender Health or WPath should matter at all to anyone. The organization was founded in the late 1970s, not by a medical doctor, but by a social psychologist named Paul Allen Walker. Walker worked with John Money, who as you know, if you heard on this show, is the depraved quack who performed sexual experiments on young boys causing two of his test subjects to kill themselves. Walker, for his part, who was openly gay, lived in the Castro District in San Francisco, set up his practice in the same city where he helped facilitate sex change surgeries back like in the 60s and 70s. He also had a treatment center quote unquote, for sex offenders, but Walker never met someone who wouldn't be diagnosed with gender dysphoria according to him. I mean, he would just diagnose anyone. For example, Walt Heyer, who's a man who d-transitioned back in the early 90s and has been speaking out against the gender ideology industry ever since, he tells the story of his initial consultations with Walker in 1981. Now Heyer was abused by his grandmother as a very young boy. If you've heard his story before, you're familiar with it, but he was just to summarize very briefly, he was forced to dress in girl clothing as like a four year old child by his grandmother. And to use the current phrase, in other words, he was sort of socially transitioned into a girl against his will just because his grandmother was an abusive psychopath. Now in his 40s, Heyer became a patient of Walker and explained this history of childhood abuse and trauma to him, but he was immediately diagnosed with gender dysphoria anyway and recommended for hormones and surgery. So to be clear, Walker's recommendation was that Heyer should use drugs and surgery to affirm the false identity that his insane abusive grandmother created for him when he was four years old. That's the kind of mental health professional that Walker, the founder of WPath was. Eventually he died of AIDS and the leadership of WPath was passed on to somebody else, which brings us to today. Today the president of the organization is a man named Walter Pierre Bowman, who is a sexologist and quote unquote trans health specialist. He's on his way out though apparently and the president elect of the organization is Marcy Bowers, who's the trans sex change surgeon featured in my film What is a Woman. The organization's treasurer is a guy named Lauren Schechter who's a plastic surgeon from Chicago and who also performs gender transitions on adults and children. In fact, all the way down the line from president on down in this organization, you find people who are not only totally ideologically invested in the trans agenda and therefore untrustworthy sources of information, but even worse, they are financially invested. Bowers, Schechter, many of the rest in leadership and on the board all have made millions of dollars from the gender affirmation business. So now they're in charge of WPath and the more that WPath relaxes their recommendations and guidelines and sort of opens things up the more of the population that they can include as potential patients and as potential candidates for gender affirmation procedures, quote unquote, the more money they personally make. This is a conflict of interest to say the least. And yet it has not stopped WPath from becoming the leading authority on trans health in the world. Not according to me anyway, but according to all the major medical institutions and organizations. It shouldn't matter what they say or what they recommend, but it does. Because whatever they declare is uncritically adopted by every other major medical organization in the Western world, which is what makes their highly anticipated set of new guidelines just released this week, unfortunately relevant. Christina Buttons, who's our new and quite fearless reporter at the Daily Wire, reports this, quote, the leading transgender health association has released its much anticipated new guidelines. One aspect noticeably different from previous editions is that the explicitly stated minimal age recommendations for minors to have to obtain puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and surgeries have been removed. Now to state the obvious here or to restate, that means that there is now no official minimum age recommendation for any gender transition procedure. So continuing. The new guidance also suggests that if parents do not affirm their child's newly chosen identity, the state may be enabled to intervene in order to assist with the child's transition. WPath published its Standards of Care 8th edition in the International Journal Transgender Health on September 6th, 2022. A correction was published in the same journal on September 15th, which removed sections pertaining to, quote, minimal ages for gender affirming medical and surgical treatments for adolescents. A confidential draft of the 8th edition was released for public review in December 2021 that lowered the recommended minimum age for minors to obtain cross-sex hormones, which caused permanent changes to the body from 16 to 14. And then also irreversible chest face and general surgeries to 15, 16 and 17 respectively. Little has changed from the early draft, and while WPath no longer provides explicit minimum age recommendations in their latest official guidelines, a close reading of the text finds that age suggestions are woven into the text. So, before we read a little bit more of this, there are basically two ways to potentially interpret WPath's decision to remove the explicit minimum age recommendations from the text. One is that they don't want there to be any minimum age. They want to open the door for any procedure at any age. We heard from a gender surgeon in a clip last week that he doesn't recognize any minimum age at all for any form of medical intervention. We heard that explicitly. Or you might theorize that WPath removed some of these minimum age guidelines, or at least made them harder to find in the text, made them a little bit less clear because they don't want people to know that these things are being done to kids as young as 14. I mean, they've been talking openly about doing these things to kids for many years, but now some of us are paying attention and drawing attention to it, and they don't want that. Which is the same reason why children's hospitals and other clinics around the country have been frantically removing this information from their website. Any mention of performing any sort of procedures on kids that are removing the website, not because they don't do it anymore, but because they don't want us to notice it. They don't want to give us something really simple that we can point to and say, oh, you see, they're trying to make it harder for critics to expose what's going on, rather than laying it all out plainly in a document that we can again just point to and say, well, there it is. Now, I tend to think that out of these two possible explanations, maybe there's truth to both. Reading on, chapter six on adolescents in the new guidelines suggests that cross-sex hormones may be administered to children as young as 14. Quoting from the document, it says, more recent guidelines suggest there may be compelling reasons to initiate gender affirming hormone therapy prior to the age of 16, although there are limited studies on youth who have initiated hormones prior to 14 years of age. In the same chapter, so you see how they have the ages there, they make it a little bit more obscure what they're actually saying, a little bit more. In the same chapter, guidance is issued for chest masculinization surgery, otherwise known as a double mastectomy, which is the removal of healthy breasts. Quoting again from the document, it says, chest masculinization surgery can be considered in minors when clinically and developmentally appropriate as determined by a multidisciplinary team experienced in adolescent and gender development. Though no precise age is indicated, most pediatric gender clinics will perform double mastectomy surgeries on 15-year-olds. Guidance on vaginoplasty is the creation of a pseudo-vigina using existing genital tissue, indicates that they may be obtained as a minor as well. Quoting again from the document, while the sample sizes are small, these studies suggest, there may be a benefit for some adolescents to having these procedures performed before the age of 18. Reads the guidelines. Now, keep in mind again, that younger children undergoing gender transition means millions of more dollars in the pockets of the very people who are making these recommendations. Now, we should know that WPath does at least have one form of genital mutilation, which it does not yet recommend for kids. Quote, the only genital surgery it seems that WPath is comfortable setting and age recommendation for is phaloplasty, which creates a penis-like phallus from skin grafts taken elsewhere in the body. The document says, given the complexity of phaloplasty and current high rates of complications in comparison to other gender affirming surgical treatments, it is not recommended that this surgery be considered in youth under 18 at this time. The at this time qualifier is rather glaring and conspicuous. And so is this part. Reading from the document. We recommend when gender affirming medical or surgical treatments are indicated for adolescents, healthcare professionals working with transgender and gender diverse adolescents involve parents or guardians in the assessment and treatment process. Unless their involvement is determined to be harmful to the adolescent or not feasible. Helping youth and parents slash caregivers work together on important gender care decisions is a primary goal. However, in some cases, parents and caregivers may be too rejecting of their adolescent child and their child's gender needs to be part of the clinical evaluation process. In these situations, youth may require the engagement of larger systems of advocacy and support to move forward with the necessary support and care. Now, this statement from WPath will be and has been reported as WPath recommending parental consent. Other being responsible, they're saying that there should be parental consent. But they're actually doing the opposite, which is quite obvious when you read it. What they're saying is that parental consent matters if the parent says yes. If the parent says no, their opinion doesn't matter. So you only get consent if there is consent. Consent only matters if you say yes. Which is to say that your consent doesn't matter. Your opinion doesn't matter at all in either case. The medical establishment is saying to the parents here, we're gonna do what we want to your kids and we'll get the state involved if we have to. And you can give us your approval and we'll do it. Or you can disapprove and we'll still do it. What this means is that the approval is irrelevant and symbolic at best. The parents are cut out of the equation and consent is deferred not to the child who cannot actually consent, but to the very surgeons and doctors who are financially invested in transitioning as many people as they can, as young as they can, and as fast as they can. That's what so much of this is about. Now, we know that they are rabid ideologues that are in the gender transition industry and they're at WPath. And they're, as I said, ideologically invested in this. They're religious fanatics and they want to induct as many people as they can into their cult. And that's what's driving a lot of it. But we can't overlook the fact that they're also just scam artists trying to make a buck or two or two billion. That's what much of this traces back to. Let's get to our five headlines.

That's epic will calm promo code Walsh This is one of my favorite stories of the year potentially of all time We've heard about Republican governors sending busloads of e-legal to Chicago and New York and other places Well, Ron DeSantis I think tops them all with this as you've probably heard daily wire the the far left melted down Wednesday night in response to governor Ron DeSantis sending two plainfolds of illegal immigrants to Martha's Vineyard a Massachusetts Island that is home to wealthy progressives like President Barack Obama The office to hit Santa's office said in a statement Yes, Florida can confirm the two planes with illegal immigrants that arrived in Martha's Vineyard today were part of the state's relocation program to transport illegal immigrants to sanctuary Destination states like Massachusetts New York and California will better facilitate the care of these individuals who they have invited into our country by incentivizing illegal immigration through their designation as sanctuary states and support for the Biden administration's open border policies you know, this is a This is something that you think the left would support especially if they declared themselves sanctuary states and also They would be the first to say that I mean Ron DeSantis is He's he's a fascist. He's Hitler and Carnot. In fact, they do say that we'll get that in a second But and and and Florida's a you know a hellhole. You don't want to live there There's no it's it's they don't say gay you can't even say the word gay when you're walking down the street or a drone will come by and incinerate you That's how bad it is there Texas is even worse? So you think they would be quite excited about these illegal immigrants being relocated from those terrible terrible states and Brought to places that have declared themselves to be sanctuaries I mean they say we are a sanctuary come to us and then it as it turns out when The Republicans governors take them up on that and say okay. Well, here you go. Here's here. Here's some people for your sanctuary Well, it's a notice not well. We didn't mean we meant you know spiritually. We're spiritual We're here from moral support from a distance You know, we'll give a thumbs up from a dude. That's what we wanted to do. That's what we meant by sanctuary state Left is proceeded to erupt with anger that DeSantis would send the illegal immigrants to the island with many falsely accusing him of human trafficking or being a literal Nazi former CNN reporter Jackie Shekner says the Nazis had a relocation program the Santis's communications director actually uses the word the state's relocation program. Oh Well, the Nazis relocated people and this is also being called relocation Yeah, I mean, you know when I when when the daily wire moved to Tennessee from from Los Angeles, I was living in Pennsylvania at the time and They wanted me to relocate Here to Nashville, you know, and so I am also you know, I am essentially the victim of The Holocaust now because of that because it's relocation Well, no, obviously see when the Nazis relocated people they were relocating Jews to ghettos and Then eventually they are being relocated quote unquote the concentration camps where they were slaughtered in This case we have illegal immigrants being put on a nice jet and brought to the wealthiest and nicest neighborhood in the country Um where again, they have been told that we're a sanctuary This Nazi comparison has come up more than once not surprisingly. Here's a conversation with the documentarian Ken Burns who's just make it a kind of a it's a Making a bad bad name for all the rest of us documentarians in the documentarian Uh community, but anywhere he here he is talking about this connection between ronda Santis and Hitler This is history all of your documentaries are about history But all of them also make you think About where we are exactly now and we woke up to the news this morning that governor ronda Santis of florida sent two plain loads Of migrants uh to martha's vineyard off the coast of massachusetts including kids and whatnot And i'm not saying this is not a one-for-one. This is not a parallel here in any way But it does address some of the same themes that are part of this documentary What if the abstraction of human life? It's basically saying that you can use a human life that is as valuable as yours or mine or lens And to put it in a position of becoming a political pawn in somebody's authoritarian game This is the coming straight out of the authoritarian playbook. This is what's so Uh disturbing about the santis is to use human beings to weaponize human beings for a political purpose It's like when somebody disagrees with him in florida like the wall disney company He punishes them. This is not the actions of a person participating in a democratic process in which there's an exchange of ideas This is about punishing political enemies putting on uh shows political shows political theater And in this case this is with the lives of human beings and what's so ironic is these are venous Orwellian refugees which disantas should be supporting because they're trying to flee The the corruption of a left-wing government and all of the pain there And so this the the level of cynicism is beyond that and and what we find in all our films is that the themes that we engage in the past Are present. Shut up Ken. We got it Um Where'd he even begin? Okay, even if it was true that rondis antis is using the illegal immigrants as quote political pawns Which to accuse him of that is to admit that the whole sanctuary state thing was was was you know a mirage It was not serious And this is there only political pawns if there's if the sanctuary state because that's that's he Sentin them to sanctuary state. So what they're saying is that yeah, he's he is calling Um, you know the the bluff of uh, you know, massachusetts, New York That's what these republican governors doing. They're they're calling the bluff of these other states who claim to be sanctuary states Um But they're not admitting that explicitly But even if that's true, you're using it political pawns is that what that that's what the holocaust was That's what the holocaust was all about was using what Jews as political pawns. That's it No, I think the issue with the holocaust was the mass murder Okay, so it's it's something quite beyond being used as a political pawn Mass mass slaughter was the issue there They also mentions the abstraction of human life, which is a good phrase actually is a useful phrase Uh, and that is happening in our culture But who's doing that exactly? The abstraction of human life. What does that mean? I guess it means making human life abstract Um kind of obscuring it making it this kind of abstract concept Well, where is that going on? I mean, that's that's going on with in the womb That's the pro abortion side. That's the left as always as always when they accuse someone of doing something It's because they themselves are doing it every single time it's like 100 percent of the time. That's the case certainly the case here That's exactly what they're doing here. They're the ones who say well, I don't know Windows human life beginner. Nobody knows we can't even define it You know, we know we can stump them with what is a woman? You could also stump them. I'm asking what is human life They can't define they want to find it. So who is who's engaging in the abstraction here? We're not making human life abstract. We we can give you a definition. We tell you exactly what it is and when it starts The White House also was uh on the scene to denounce This unethical move by ron DeSantis. Let's listen to that On what you call this political stunt with the asylum seekers Less specifically get into the look the locations mock this venue The naval observatory can you talk to the issue of you said boston It's an island that they sent Yes, I will see this too an island that um is known to be In some instances of democratic haven Forming presidents form a democratic presidents vacation there Own homes etc. Could you speak to that as well as the naval observatory? What I could say and I've been very clear. Uh, it is a political stunt That's what we're seeing from governor governors republican governors in in particular and um It is a cool inhumane way of treating people who are fleeing communism uh people who are who are uh, and we're not just talking about people we're talking about children We're talking about families uh who are promised a home promised a job put on a bus And uh, you know driven to a place that they do not know And it is a cruel thing to do According to local reports governor ron DeSantis sent a hired videographer on the plane to massachusetts Uh to order to capture footage of them being dropped off Remember there were children on this plane. So I cannot speak to Anything outside of what we're seeing right which is I You know, I'll I'll take that inhumane treatment a free private jet ride to martha's vineyard. You know, I'll take that Um Being used as a political pawn. She says that oh they're being put on buses and shipped to a place They don't know. Yeah, what does that remind you of? I mean it reminds you of the of the illegal immigration epidemic that's been going ongoing for decades That's exactly the problem. That's what these these uh governors You know in border states and governors down south have been saying what conservatives in general i've been saying for years Is that when you open up the border and you invite people in and you start talking about how you're a sanctuary city a sanctuary state whatever This is what you end up with So once again accusing people of doing exactly what they're doing they're the ones who have for decades been using illegal immigrants as political pawns Um Inviting them in to these red states. They don't want to deal with them themselves when invite them into the red states What they're what they're actually having a problem with what they're really saying is well, how dare you Use illegal immigrants as political pawns only we're supposed to do that. We're the ones that are that that's our thing not yours It's like a form of plagiarism essentially is what they're accusing ron santhesof But really it's the reaction from some of the local leaders themselves. That's really telling here's the um homeless shelter coordinator In martha's vineyard and here's what she had to say about this So what are the most difficult challenges right now the difficult challenges are Uh, we have at some point in time and they have to move Somewhere else right we we cannot we don't have the services to take care of 50 immigrants And we we certainly don't have housing we're not housing prices as we are on this island and so We don't we can't house everyone here that lives here and works here. We don't have housing for 50 more people Eventually we have to pick them up and move them somewhere else. We can't take care of them here We don't have a housing it's a crisis. So so uh 50 illegal immigrants from martha's vineyard is a crisis a humanitarian crisis what's what they've been calling it a humanitarian crisis Well, what is thousands of illegal immigrants every single day being funneled into these border towns and border states? What do you call that? um Well, we should see again the left left likes diversity in theory But they certainly don't want to have to actually confront it in reality and this also goes to show That the most compassionate and humane border policy Is one that deters people from coming here to begin with Because once you have the flood of illegal immigrants coming into the country There are no good answers when they're here. There's no good answers And when you have this unchecked tide coming in every single day, there are no good answers um There are right answers, but there aren't any like it matter every answer is difficult and The only way to stop that is to deter people from coming here in the first place Yeah, it's not shipping them off it'd be better if if uh ronnesantists didn't have to do that it'd be better if greg abbot didn't have to ship illegals up to sanctuary Cities and sanctuary states that'd be better But they're here because the border's not secure So why can't we all agree that that actually the best thing is for them not to come to begin with? And how do you stop them from coming? Well, you secure the border out border obviously But it also means that you again you have to have a policy that deters people from coming which means when they come You know you have to be very strict And even seemingly unkind Like you come here you shut the border down people come doesn't matter how far they've been traveling you turn them around and say you can't come in here go away It seems really upsetting to people and it does seem unkind and uncharitable But that is actually the most charitable and compassionate thing If you want to avoid this humanitarian crisis In martha's vineyard Which is the only place the left cares about if it's a martha's vineyard they care about it They don't care about the humanitarian crisis that's been ongoing for decades in texas You really want to avoid it a humanitarian crisis then that's what you do you shut the border down and you are strict about it and unwavering And you're not allowed to come here illegally if you come here we will send you away and that's it All right, don lemon Has been demoted essentially. No, not essentially. I mean he's been we know that um I'd see an end they're kind of scrambling and trying to figure out what's wrong with their ratings I mean what's wrong with the ratings is nobody wants to watch cnn so Um, they got we know they got rid of brian stelter. They got rid of uh Chris quomo a while ago and they're revamping their prime time lineup They're taking don lemon and they're kicking him down to the morning show and they're demoting him They take him out of prime time putting him somewhere that's not prime time but um, this is kind of embarrassing for him he uh Rather than just kind of going quietly on his show last night He's defending himself And we just talked about the problem of like getting defensive. He's defending himself against the claim that he was demoted And uh, here's how that went I was presented with an opportunity that I can't pass up at this network and we have a new boss who um Is a morning show impresario And he wants a morning show that will kick off the editorial direction Of the network every single day and I am honored that he asked me to do it And for all of those are out there saying oh, he moved me and without my He asked me and I said yes, I could have said no, this is my show I have a contract for this show I decided that I would take him up on that and take this journey with him So this is not someone moving me and by the way, this is not someone saying you must move to the right don lemon and you must not be so Um, give so much of your perspective. None of that has happened All of that is fodder for twitter, which is not real so stop it. I was not demoted none of that This is an opportunity. This is a promotion. This is this is An opportunity for me to create something around me and I get to work with two great ladies who you know Poppy harlow who I've known for more than a decade. I went to her wedding in slovina I know her children. I know her husband and katelyn collins uh same thing We've been friends since katelyn has been at the networks This I was not demoted. I wasn't Uh, I love the phrase there. I I decided to take this journey with him So your boss calls you in and says, uh, yeah, we're kicking you down a few notches here. You're not you're not performing well You know, we're gonna give you a pay cut of the motion Okay, I'll take this journey with you Let's go hand-in-hand on this journey Um, first of all, nobody volunteers for to do the morning show You're especially not from prime time Like you're gonna you really you want to get up at 3 30 in the morning And do and do a show. It's what you really want instead of being in prime time. I doubt it But you also notice he his his near admission of bias not that we need him to admit it. We already know but he almost admits it He says, um He says, oh, no, it's it's they didn't come to me and say move to the right stop being And then he stops himself You know stop giving my perspective. So he almost said they didn't tell me move to the right stopping so liberal And then he stopped himself Again, not that we needed his admission, but even so All right, maybe uh, let's play one other clip. This is the uh, treasury secretary jennett yellen Waxing poetically about the irs Today I want to spend some time discussing how the new irs funding in the inflation reduction act Will make these types of investments possible as well as its impact on the american economy But first I want to begin by speaking about the irs itself as our nation's revenue collection agency The irs is a foundation of our government and our society The irs collects 96 of the revenue that funds the federal government That supports our priorities from national security to infrastructure to social security It's also one of the very few parts of the federal government that touches Nearly every american household irs employees are known for their extraordinary dedication to public service They have always served with distinction But over the past couple of years the employees of the irs have been called to Further to serve the american people Serve the american people with audits. So we're getting served with By the way, I don't mean this in a bad way. I really don't I don't mean this as an insult, but um Ever twice the jennett yellen doesn't she look a little bit like the albino who works in the torture chamber in the princess bride Uh, we could put up a split screen maybe of that. I don't know. I you know, again, it's not It's quite a handsome guy. So I'm not I mean that's an insult. I just I don't know if they found that it would make sense To find that person works at a torture chamber Um, what do they call that in the film the pit of despair? So we put that person runs pit of despair runs the irs. You know, there is a connection there. Anyway, um, the irs Is the foundation of the united states Uh, you you laugh at that, but it's actually it's just an outrageous Claim and it's another although it's an overused term. It's quite Orwellian this rewrite of history I mean america was founded On it on a on a riv on a tax revolt. I mean it was it was founded by people who revolted rebelled It would would start killing people because of taxes and so now The foundation of the country is that the revenue collection agency Which by the way didn't even exist Um for the first century plus of the of the of the country's existence And now it serves as our foundation Which there's a lot of truth to that from her perspective from the from the perspective of the powers that be here the regime That is how they see it The irs is is utterly foundational Which probably tells you everything you need to know let's get now to the comment section The rifle place We've become insane Here in the sweet baby game Uh, you know one of the great things about being a parent is that it provides you with many occasions to learn empathy And I need a lot of practice in that regard as you know So it's a good thing and um and the reason is that your children will get upset about the dumbest things all the time And this this this holds true at every age by the way every stage of childhood And your job is to try to understand where they're coming from it to not be dismissive because yeah, you don't want to Uh If they're if they're overreacting or something you don't want to encourage it But at the same time you can't always be dismissive and you have to try to sort of understand where they're coming from So last night I put the kids down for bed and I went upstairs about 30 minutes later. My son My five-year-old Is sitting in his bed sobbing uncontrollably and I go in and ask him What's wrong? He says that he's scared And I ask him why that he's scared and he says he's scared because his toys come to life at night While he's sleeping and he's worried about that Which admittedly I mean I would be worried about that too if that was happening, but I tried to explain to him. It's not happening Um toys don't actually come to life. That's just for the movies and tv shows. It's not real It's not physically possible But I made it worse because at one point he says well I know the toys when they come to life they can't touch humans. They can't attack humans But it's it's still scary. That's what he said to me My son by the way never uses the word person or people he only ever says humans for some reason So if we're in the mall or something and there's a lot of people there he'll say uh, there are a lot of humans in here Or did you see that human driving that car? And it makes sense. It's a perfectly valid way of saying it It just you never realized how weird some phrasing sounds until you hear it out loud. Anyway, so he says that the toys come to life But they don't touch humans And then I say Well, how do you know they can't touch you? And and he says wait, so so they can they can attack me and I say no, it's I didn't mean it like that I'm just wondering where you're getting the information. It's very specific information you have. I want to know where you got it from And uh, he has like this whole mythology that he's built up. I said did you get this one toy story? What are we talking about? Let me know so we can I can engage with you a little bit in this conversation And I guess he just came up with it in his head and was immediately convinced of its validity And at another point I'm still trying to convince him this went on for like a while this conversation about the toys coming to life and uh and And he goes and I say well, they know they don't keep trying to tell them they don't come to life And he says Well, have you ever seen toys? Not come to life when you're sleeping And I just stop and think about that for a second. Have I seen toys not come to life When i'm sleeping Uh I said no, I guess I haven't seen that Well, you see so you don't know Anyway, so maybe he's right. Maybe they do from the life. I guess I really don't know I just My whole concept of reality broke down All right. This is melony wild says I love it when the media takes your hilarious dry humor so literal Um, honestly, nobody could say conservatives aren't funny because man gets me rolling daily. Thanks man. I don't know what you're talking about what There was no joking on yesterday's show especially it was one of my most serious shows I don't even know what you're referring to um Cameron says this was hands down without a doubt the greatest opening monologue and admittedly the short history of podcasting why thank you for that Um, and I would also say probably one of the most important monologues if I do say so myself Uh j- jennedy says your rant about starbucks baristas made me hallow with laughter my ex best friend once y'all I was serious about that too. So what do you guys laugh about everything for? These is everything was serious especially the stuff about baristas My ex-press friend once yelled at me driving in the middle of chicago traffic telling me her job as a starbucks barista was a career That she plans to grow into This was a response to me trying to help her find a job with her college degree that she had received over a year ago A degree which was in uh, you guessed it photography needless to say our friendship didn't last much longer after that Well, I'm sure your friend was quite annoying. And so I wouldn't mourn the fact that she's gone, but I would say like I don't I wouldn't uh, begrudge anyone or just just wait or try to discourage anyone who is in a customer service job and says that they see it as a career It can be actually now like being a you know working the drives through at starbucks Is not in and itself a career. Hopefully you're not doing that for 20 years But if you see that as a stepping stone And you kind of want to stay in the customer service world and you want to work up to being a manager and that eventually you got your own You have your own location that you're running, you know, you work you work your way up that way. I think that's perfectly Adorable and noble and that's that's a career path that many people follow I guess that's great Um, but that means that's all the more reason why if you see it that way Then when you're there you're gonna be working as hard as you can putting in the extra effort You're not gonna be recording tick toks complaining about your job You're not gonna be focusing on all the things you hate so much of trying to avoid You know getting mad when people uh order complicated drinks that make you work harder because you're there And you see this as an opportunity So I actually I you know I encourage people to have that attitude actually Uh s s g emeritus says I saw a headline that read that you had a meltdown over the little mermaid I laughed so hard at you having a meltdown your excellent response was a classic responsible knowledgeable version of a matt wall sh meltdown Good for you. I did read there there've been many headlines like that actually because the media is still talking about this by the way And now people are sending me tick so tick tok has gotten in on the action Maybe we'll play some of those videos next week. I don't know as we continue the mermaid conversation into um It just indefinitely But so they're you know, there's more reporting on it and yeah that that has seemed to be the most common characterization Of our initial conversation about translucent mermaids is that this thing was a meltdown. I don't know meltdown about it Because yeah, everyone knows Uh, this is what I people know this about me. I that's my personality. I'm overly emotional. I get very excited easily Uh, overly enthusiastic. That's I admit that's one of my great greatest flaws Right now over at dailywire.com slash shop there running an inflation reduction event in response to the Biden ministration's feeble attempt to magically reduce inflation by spending more money Use code 40 at checkout for 40 off Anything in the inflation reduction collection including a lot of the sweet baby gangs greatest hits and even my beloved Magnum opus johnny the walrus is also there Uh, once you're done stuffing your car with sail items you can head over to my swag shack and get the perfect companion To my book, which is the official johnny the walrus plushie Uh, we're doing the walrus plug yet again. We are I thought they might actually do a shop read for something Mildly less traumatizing like a shirt and blazon with my bearded face on the body of an infant Or uh, you know what actually we should have a we do need some kind of Translucent mermaid shirt anyway, we'll talk about we don't have that yet. We'll talk about it. Um, I still don't have my own walrus That's the point, but you my sweet babies can so head over to daily wire dot com slash shop to get yours today Also recently daily wire was a c c'd on an email from a harry razors customer who was canceling their subscription and switching to jeremese This is what he wrote Quote dear harries. I have used and enjoyed your razors for five years now and even have a personalized harries handle However, I was disappointed to learn of the circumstances in which your company disassociated from the daily wire as such I am not giving any more of my money to you as I think jeremy jeremese racers dot com Could find more uses aligned with the values I hold dear I will add that I am a resident of the uk and jeremese does not currently ship outside of the usa Therefore, I'm arranging to have my jeremese subscription sent to my family in the usa Where will then be sent and an additional cost to me? This is a small price. I'm willing to pay to expressly support those who stand against woke bullying Signed king charles the third Uh, no, this email was not written by britain's new sovereign But the understandably frustrated citizen who did was certainly right about one thing jeremy can find more uses for your money aligned with values that you Hold dear and frankly razors are just the start we enjoy Receiving this email so much that we're encouraging you to do the same when you subscribe to jeremese razors CC us on your own breakup email with harries or jollette and maybe we'll read it on the show So just send it to reviews at jeremese razors dot com Stop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you give it to jeremy instead go to jeremese razors dot com today Now let's get to our daily cancellation Today we check in with the fat community over at tick tock a realm that we may call Thick tock that's actually my producer shawn's joke Uh now as the host of the show, it's my god-given right to steal the joke without credit I can steal any joke I hear around here because it's mine That's the way it goes, but I've decided to forego that privilege and give credit words to in this case So there it is thick tock Anyway, we'll start with one recent viral video from a fat activist and then perhaps we'll continue down the thick tock rabbit hole Uh and see what else we may find here it is I'm going to prove to you why why people are the reason i'm fact today If white people didn't go looking for spices then various zerouts to Indian subcontinent and africa and other places of the world would not get discovered And if they didn't get discovered then istindia company would never come to indian subcontinent And if they didn't come then the fertility of the land would not get destroyed because they forced us to cultivate tobacco and dyes in okiwi things like that and that destroyed the fertility of my country And then if that didn't happen and if they didn't exploit and extract resources until My ancestors were left with nothing to eat We wouldn't move to this grain heavy Very little nutritious diet that we have today Also if white people didn't come to the indian subcontinent then my ancestors would not go through 50 Small medium large famines in a period of 200 years That's a lot And in 1943 nearly 3 million people would not have died due to sub starvation and malnutrition And if that didn't happen then this entire place and the people of this place would not adapt to survive on lower calories Okay, I didn't realize I was a 45 minute clip Uh, but it's a fun game. I have to admit It's like it's like the self-victimizing version of seven degrees of kevin bacon Just take some negative aspect of yourself that you don't want to take responsibility for and then find a way to cast the blame As far away from yourself as possible. I can do this too, you know, for instance I tend to be impatient and at times ill-tempered. I admit it's not my fault though It can actually be traced directly back to Alexander the great's invasion of Persia in 334 BC I'll need to do some research on Wikipedia to connect all the dots, but I'm sure there's a way to do it Actually in this woman's case you might compare it more to a sort of um, it's sort of like a butterfly effect But for fatness so a butterfly flaps its wings 700 miles away sets off a chain of causation That eventually ends with this girl eating a cheeseburger Although here in a rather extraordinary feat of deflection she has punted responsibility actually out of this century halfway across the previous millennium Imagine that the mental gymnastics required to be in the process of devouring Like a cinnabon while thinking to yourself. This is all Vasco de Gama's fault. Damn you Vasco Meanwhile there is as always An obvious contradiction at work here on the one hand we're told that fat is beautiful fat is good fat is healthy fat is desirable On the other hand It's also very important for us to believe that fat people are fat through no fault of their own so it's like This is good But it's not my fault Well, if it's beautiful and good then why would you not want to take credit for it? In fact if white people made this girl fat Then shouldn't she be thanking us given that fat is beautiful. We made you beautiful you're welcome Which is it is my question you have to choose pickle lane Either it's bad and it's not my fault or it's good in which case the blame game makes no sense Let's watch the next one Fat-shaming and skinny-shaming are the same actually no they're not fat people are denied jobs proper medical care health insurance They don't have equal access to clothing travel many public spaces even the body mass index the way that it discriminates against women Especially women of color it was created for and based around white men like fat phobias literally rooted in anti-blackness It's rooted in racism and sexism skinny shaming is not how many times have you seen marketing campaigns that are labeled get fat quick Finally add those stubborn 30 pounds show me where all the weight gain industries are show me all the damaging messages that say that skinny equals Unworthy life or skinny equals ugly when it's the last time that you've been penalized financially when an aircraft seat had to be accommodated to your smaller body What is the last time you've walked into a doctor's office and after they weighed you? Stop listening to what you were actually there for and told you to just gain weight because it will fix everything Fat people endure all of that and more skinny people do not face employment discrimination or medical discrimination The world was designed for you. Peter burgers is not comparable to systemic abuse and oppression I mean she's absolutely right, you know fat shaming and skinny shaming are not the same Because if you're shaming somebody for being skinny Then you're shaming them for a healthy physique provided that they are you know rail thin If you're shaming them for being fat you're shaming them for being in an unhealthy and destructive physical state You really shouldn't be walking up to people and shaming them for their appearance in either case But it is without question worse to shame a good thing than it is to shame a bad thing But my favorite part of this clip is her list of oppressions and persecutions that fat people face She says fat people don't have equal access to clothing Which is an interesting way of putting it So if I gorge myself during Thanksgiving and put on five pounds in one weekend I can then complain but I don't have equal access to my own pants anymore yet Contrary to the way she phrases it there is no law preventing fat people from wearing clothing I mean incidentally This I was this actually news that someone should probably share with lizzo's like you know you can you're allowed to wear clothes just so you know by the way the reason There aren't advertisements telling people how to add pounds she says well, I was already average there's no ads to i'll do it I'll put on pounds Well, the reason for that is that number one you don't want to add pounds, right? It's unhealthy But also nobody needs help doing that Putting on weight is easy and fun and often delicious. You just make a tray of brownies. That's all it takes There's no further assistance required That's why you don't find that Let's check out one more I'm gonna be real with y'all. I am really sick and tired of skinny Is coming on this app and trying to compare fat phobia to getting called a door once That's called body shaming and it literally happens to every single person on the planet at least once It's not a systemic issue Girl, I went to my doctor when I got diagnosed with severe depression and she dead-ass Lipped at me and said lose some weight and break up with your boyfriend I was in school today thinking about where I wanted to go for off-campus lunch And I started looking up restaurant menus and realized that I didn't want to linger on the tab too long in case somebody looked over the fat girls laptop Seeing where she wanted to go for lunch and judging me for it I can't walk into a 7-Eleven and order a slurpee and some Skittles because I'm afraid that when I put them down on the counter like a skinny person could do with no problem Somebody's gonna judge me for it I have applied to a job at a restaurant and heard somebody say how they're not gonna hire me because they think I'm fat enough to eat all the food I'm terrified to be seen eating in my car eating alone Y'all got insulted once and ran with it This is what the youth are spending their energy on this is what they're arguing These are the subjects they're discussing what's worse fat shaming or skinny shaming? Oh my god Okay, let's go through a few things here. I would absolutely Absolutely judge you If you were buying a slurpee and skittles at the same time I mean fat or skinny if I see someone washing down skittles with a slurpee. Yes, I'm gonna make some judgments about that person That's disgusting and you would deserve to be judged for it. Absolutely. You deserve judgment In fact, if someone walked up to you to your face and made fun of you for buying slurpees and skill at the same time You would deserve that it would be good. It'd be a wake-up call for you. That's like an intervention Guess what? You don't get to be free of the world's judgment. Here's news flash for everybody watching right now You don't get to be free of the world's judgment. You don't nobody does You are being judged all the time all the time people look at us and observe our behavior and make judgments That's sometimes the judgments are bad. Sometimes they're good. Sometimes they're neutral This is just what it means to live in a society among other rational creatures You can accept that and move on with your life or you can sit around crying about I'm being judged. I'm being judged Yes, you are. Okay. We've established that live your life now Or just stay huddled in the corner in the fetal position. Stop judging me Well, you've chosen the ladder, I suppose And now you're on tick-tock like I can't I can't even free base pixie sticks behind the dumpster at 7-11 without being judged Of course you can Nor should such behavior be free of judgment Also You most certainly Were not turned down for a job at a restaurant because the interviewer said you'd eat all the food. Okay, that That just didn't happen. It absolutely 100% did not happen Um, however Did a doctor actually tell you that the cure for depression is to break up with your loser boyfriend and shed a few pounds? I hope so because that's actually fantastic advice I wish more doctors would help their patients adjust their lifestyles before writing prescriptions Yet a good doctor who cared about your health, which is why I assume you never went back to him again all in all If these experiences as you describe them actually all happened And we're upsetting to you. There is a solution. It's a solution totally within your power. You can lose weight It won't be easy, but you can do it. It is possible I know from experience that there is a correlation between diet lifestyle and weight We all know this from experience This is the point the fat activist the fat to this seemed to always miss You can't lie to the rest of us about this issue You can't pretend that you have nothing to do with your own waistline All of us have experienced putting on weight Because we ate too much and didn't get enough exercise. All of us in the modern world have experienced that We know that's how it works We also know that it's difficult. It takes self-control to practice dietary discipline And we know that's why you don't want to do it Not because you're oppressed or the victim of white supremacy. It's just it's hard and you don't want to do something That's hard. We've all been there to one degree or another Which is why You would actually have our sympathy if you just said I know I can get healthy, but it's really hard and so I'm struggling You could just say that that's a statement I totally sympathize with Because whether it's weight or something else We all have things about ourselves that we don't like or we want to improve You know, but we have trouble improving those things because it's hard It's hard to improve something about yourself. It doesn't matter what it is And we all have flaws And so if you're flaws that you tend to overeat and you don't get enough exercise and so you put on weight That's a flaw. It is a flaw. You're not the only one in the world of flaws We all have them and you could rightly point out that we all have flaws. That's true But when you make your flaw into a cause right into a Banner that you march under into and you want to you try to convince the world that your flaw is actually a virtue Well, now you've made it an issue. We have to talk about And that's on you If you would just admit that it's a flaw that you do have control over then then it's a holy it's it's an entirely different situation You know and and all the further rest of us with our flaws we have them not because And we have trouble solving them not because we can't solve them or it's impossible Or because it's all the fault of spice traders in the 1500s We can control ourselves, but it's difficult and we have trouble doing difficult things everyone does. That's why we call them difficult That's something that we can all its humans relate to and sympathize with and we can commiserate with each other about that We can also support each other and help each other But you can't really have anyone's support or anyone's help or even sympathy if you refuse to be accountable for your own choices As long as you insist on blaming everything and everyone but yourself you'll never get over the hurdle You'll be stuck with the burden forever while trying to convince yourself that you're happy with it, but you know better you're not And that is why These fat activists on tiktok Are today? Unfortunately, I must say canceled on this flat flannel Friday Which by the way, I can't believe what the whole show without saying happy flannel Friday Well, there it is Hope you're wearing your own flannels as we move into the members block Hope to see you there if not talk to you on uh monday godspeed"
