At the time, there was a 13-point gap in the proportion of bachelor's degrees going to men compared to women. In 2019, the gender gap in bachelor's degrees was 15 points, even wider than in 1972. But now, and it might surprise you to hear this, it's men who are being left behind. In fact, over the last several years, there's been a growing concern about the struggles of boys and men in primary education, college, the workforce, the impact they have on our politics and culture. And we have to break free from zero-sum thinking if we're going to address the problems facing boys and men and still work to solve the problems facing women and girls. So today we're going to dive into all of this with Richard Reeves, who is the author of an excellent new book of Boys and Men, Why the Modern Mail is Struggling, Why it Matters, and What to Do About It. Richard is a senior fellow in economic studies and the John C. and Nancy D. Whitehead Chair at the Brookings Institution. He's the Director of the Future of the Middle Class Initiative and the Co-Director of the Center on Children and Families at Brookings. He's a contributor to the Atlantic, National Affairs, Democracy Journal, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times. Richard is the former Director of DMOAS, the London-based Political Think Tank, and holds a PhD from the University of Warwick. In addition to Boys and Men, his research focuses on inequality and social mobility. Richard, it's a pleasure to welcome you to the Political College. Great. Thank you so much for having me on. So before we begin, perhaps you can share a bit more of your potted bio and any salient pieces of your background I might have neglected to mention. So our listeners have a better sense of your approach vector for this topic. Sure. So I've basically bounced around between the think tank world, the world of journalism and the world of government. So my most recent government role in the UK, I moved to the US in 2012. I have an American wife, those who are wondering what brought me here. And before that, I had actually worked as Director of Strategy to the Deputy Prime Minister in the Coalition Government. So that was Nick Clegg, which was fascinating. Actually, the coalition was an interesting kind of experience of government at the time. Before that, as you mentioned, I'd been at Demos and various other similar roles, but the through line has always been looking at the barriers to flourishing mobility autonomy. You have, you want to define it, that might lie in front of people by virtue of their class position, what race they are or gender and so on. And so underpinning all of it has been this desire to sort of identify what are the impediments to flourishing and then see what public policy can do to make sure that they're not. And so I think that's what we can do to try and reduce those impediments, especially when they're falling disproportionately on one group of people. So my work has historically been mostly focused around class and intergenerational mobility since moving to the US, much more on race as well, because race interacts with mobility in a very different way in the US. But then that led me, as well as being a father of three boys who I've raised now to their 20s, that led me to this sort of unexpected place, which is just these sharp data points, one of which you mentioned in the intro. But there are a number which just show that we have to think about gender gaps in a wholly new way now because so many of them are running the opposite way to the way we historically think about it. Yeah, that's terrific segue. I want to dive into the specifics as we go along because the book is full of details and really excellent research. But from a 30,000 foot view, can you give us a sense of what the challenges facing boys and men are. Yeah, so I'll actually start in some ways at the end, and it's a tragic end, which is the way in which men are particularly like to be victims of what have been called deaths of despair. That's a phrase popularized by Angus Deet and Ann Case in their work, and that includes opioid deaths, which are about three quarters accounted for by men. And includes alcohol related illnesses and it includes suicide and suicide deaths by suicide are four times higher for men than they are for women or for boys than for girls have risen by about 25% in the last couple of decades for men in the US. And they rose very rapidly actually between 2020 and 2021 for men but not for for women. And one of the things that struck me looking at that data of this, and that's pretty true, that's true levels differ but the ratios similar kind of pretty much everywhere in the world. I came across some work by an Australian researcher Fiona Shand who looked at the words that men use to describe themselves before suicide and the two most commonly used words of self description by these men were useless and worthless. And for me that's a sort of stop in the tracks moment of like of course that's a, you know, a tragically selected sample but, but it was just it really made me think hard about how even beyond these statistics we're going to talk about. I think underlying all of this the male malaise, actually as a deeper one and is about purpose and meaning and identity and belonging and need it. To be unneeded or feel unneeded is a is a kind of unpersoning in a way, sort of like, and so that's sort of the end and then you've mentioned the education numbers, those reflect what happens much earlier on education so of the people getting the highest GPA is out of US high schools two thirds of them are girls. The ones getting the lowest two thirds of them are boys most American men are less today than they did in 1979. That's quite an extraordinary fact when you think about it for a moment just at the median and below wages have actually gone down a little bit for men. And then we've seen a dramatic change in family life, a move away from marriages the default huge change in the economic relationships between men and women, which I think has been a wonderful change. And since one of the consequences of that has been to leave a lot of fathers essentially benched. They don't really know what their role is the law hasn't caught up and so again one of these facts that you don't just trip over or stumble but run into hard with your shin leaving a big brews was the one that I discovered within six years of the parents separating the third of American kids never see their father again. And I just, you can't I think take all of these statistics in and not be affected by them that the British philosopher Bertrand Russell said the mark of the civilized person was the ability to week over a column of numbers. And some of these numbers when you think about the lives and the stories behind them they actually should make us weak. Yeah. You know, I, this is a political podcast, of course, but I actually want to save the politics of this issue to the end of our conversation. But before we start digging into some more of the details, what's the risk here if mainstream culture doesn't reckon with these challenges. The risk is that some of these trends continue. And I think they've been around long enough now when you look at things like labor force participation rates of suicide educational trends there. This is not new. This has been this has been building now for at least a couple of decades. And I don't see they're not fixing themselves. So there may have been a sense for a while. Okay, so there's an adjustment problem for men and boys but but once we're through that adjustment it'll be okay. I just don't see the lines getting better so I think they'll get worse. And the and this does bring us a little bit to politics but perhaps more towards culture. I fear that if we don't act relatively soon to arrest some of these trends, just for your growing growing, growing proportion of men and boys who feel lost. And that's dangerous for our society, but ultimately I think for our politics too. Yeah, you recently wrote about how the rise in male suicide has gotten reported by the CDC, which puzzled me. It's been widely underreported in the media. I think you discussed this with Ezra Klein on his podcast also boys and men are four times more likely to commit suicide. Yes, being male is the biggest risk factor in in committing suicide but when the CDC reports on groups who are at greater risk, there is no mention of men and boys. So why is that if we know and what's the broader impact of at best missing or at worst ignoring problems that are hitting boys and men hardest. So the first point is that it's absolutely true that it's just it's not it is it to be clear it is reported by the CDC these but in the tables that you have to work quite hard to get to but it's not recognized as a disparity in suicide. So when the CDC does work on disparities in suicide, there are many other categories that they mentioned including veterans LGBTQ rural versus urban. They talk about Native American indigenous peoples. And but they just don't talk about this one as to why I don't know the best I've been able to do from the people I've spoken to is just honestly a sense of this is a political decision but there's a fear from some folks at the CDC at least that making those decisions that simply acknowledging the problems of boys and men is to somehow diminish the ongoing concerns for women and girls it is exactly the problem you identified at the top of the conversation which is the zero something can go on here and they falsely believe that acknowledging the problem somehow give more fuel to the people who are talking about this from a irresponsible perspective and I think that's completely the opposite of the truth I think that failing to mention it gives fuel to the people who say they don't care about boys and men it's really hard to counter that claim. So that's really I think that the implication of this is there's a straightforward risk which is if policymakers don't know that the single biggest risk factor for suicide is being male, right, if school administrators don't know that if psychologists don't know that if people deploying dollars to suicide prevention programs don't know that there's a danger of just a really bad misallocation of resources in terms of where the actual risk is but there's a deeper challenge which I'm sure will get to which is the way that this fuels a sense among the people who are they're listening to which is the they they being the establishment don't care about us as being boys and men and that's a very dangerous thought to take hold. You know you go out of your way very early in the book in fact on the first page of the preface you highlight that there's a false dichotomy between talking about the challenges that boys and men face and the challenges that women and girls are facing. Can you explain why these aren't actually opposed to each other because I can imagine our listeners are conditioned to thinking about women and girls as being as being particularly disadvantaged and where all of our focus ought to be. Can you explain why why these are opposed to each other. Well in most of the things we're talking about they're not they're not zero some they you would just we don't need boys to sort of struggle educationally for girls to do better we don't need male wages to go down in order for female wages to go up by and by and large these are not zero some. It's important to recognize where they are which is typically at the apex of society where for example if we want to do better than 25% of our members of congress being women. Which by God we should. That will mean for men right if you have more women and cabinet that doesn't mean for men so I think it's important to acknowledge that in those situations it is zero some and in those situations it's perfectly appropriate to really pushing for much much greater representation. Of women and girls and at the top of society there is still quite a lot to do especially in political life. And I've written about this for Brookings as well and to increase what do we do to increase the shockingly low share of women in US politics compared to other countries you know where I just come back from the UK and that's where I'm from but it's. The UK Parliament is now a third female up from 5% when Thatcher became Prime Minister so there from and actually only one political party in the UK is now majority male which is the conservative. I mean just the change just in the space of few decades has been great and the US is not doing so well on that. But generally speaking, not only are they not opposed to each other for women men's economic or social prospects but they they go together. I mean you don't have to go to a middle class woman and ask her if she wants her husband to do better and her sons to flourish and she'll say sure and them not them struggling is not good for her it's not good for the family finances it's not good for her concerns about boys at school and so in the real world people don't see as a zero some game at all. They absolutely recognize that we rise together. Yeah, which makes a lot of sense. One of the more striking statistics in the book is that the gap in college degree attainment is higher now than it was before Title IX was passed but now it's the other way around is now it's in favor of women can you lay out the gap in educational outcomes between boys and girls in K12 education and higher ed. Yeah so it's all the way through so if you look at just right at the beginning, the, again the sink the variable has most impact on whether you'll be quite school ready on a on the series of measures is is your sex is whether your male or female controlling for other factors but it's bigger than race it's bigger than income it's bigger than whether you went to preschool and so it's just as huge about 12 to 14% of my gap in school readiness and then that goes all the way through school certainly middle school we see a huge gap opening up in the typical school district in the US now girls are almost a grade level ahead in English and it's dead even in math in the poorest school districts are they English gap to that wider and girls are about third between a quarter and the third of a grade level head in math. Across OECD countries you get the same stories this is not just a US phenomenon which is important I think to pointing to the fact that something structural going on here and then by the end of high school you really do see these quite big gaps open up in GPA not in standardized tests so if you if you rank high school GPA is from lowest to highest into deciles into 10 10 percentage point slices of the population two thirds of the top 10% of girls and two thirds of the bottom 10% of the boys with a pretty linear relationship in between them there isn't really a gap on SAT or ACT anymore girls are ahead in math in terms of GPA and one of the results of that by the way is that if colleges go test optional this is a bit one key but many people probably interested in this when colleges decide well we don't need you to put in your test results the main effect of that is to significantly increase the share of female students by about 4% 4% points very little effect on any other demographic but if a college goes test optional it's about a 4% point jump now of course it's already predominantly female or up to almost 60% women but going test optional has that has that very big effect on widening the gender gap still further which makes perfect sense when girls are just handing it to boys and then they're going to be able to do that. So in terms of GPA the only area of education my boys are holding their own is in standardized tests. I was really struck by the differences and outcomes for men and women in programs designed to increase higher education completion rates and to characterize them broadly speaking these programs seem like they're between somewhat and very effective at helping women achieve degrees but not really at all helpful for men and so I wonder what was even you know like how do we figure out why they're not helping men. We don't really we don't seem to really know why they aren't working for men so what do you how are we supposed to go about that. No, well I think the first thing to say is good to know that they don't and one of the things I was struck by I mean one of the first ones was the Kalamazoo Promise which is a free college program for kids to graduate from Kalamazoo High Schools and it's a massive effect on female college completion like over 50% increase and zero effect on male college completion it's one of the most generous free college programs in the US and the only one that's been decently evaluated by the way. And it had this huge effect so I started looking at that and then I started looking around and finding a whole bunch of other programs where there was a similar story. And then I started talking to the scholars did the work and I kept coming across this sentence this well known effect that of agenda gap in the intervention so I said well I didn't know how well known was it really and it turns out they mean among the seven people that do this research I could literally walk around to my colleagues did you know no did you know no did you know no okay fine so when you say well known what they mean is literally in that tiny group of scholars, but it is it turns out like a mentoring program in community college, even actually in the labor market I kept stumbling across these studies that just found this bigger effect for women and for men and one that couldn't be explained away statistically there was nothing in the data that allowed you to say well okay the guys just weren't as ready the GPA is well even when you control for a lot. And so it turns out something much deeper than that something cultural it's something about motivation or aspiration or planfulness future orientation it's just something else it's not it's not reducible to the observable characteristics it's something unobservable going on but I think that means it's even more interesting and arguably even more important to understand that. Yeah are you are you aware of any studies or efforts or experiments designed to try and get to the bottom of that. Well the people who did the evaluation of the Kalamazoo Promise led by the Upjean Institute are now digging quite deeply into it and they're seeing interesting differences by backgrounds so they are seeing better results for example black boys and men than for some other groups so there's a racial there might be a racial element to it too but they're now doing qualitative work they're actually now just doing what I did which is go to Kalamazoo and talk to the guys and say what's going on and to try and understand it and I don't think there are any results in yet but what I'm hearing from them and from other people who are thoughtful about this is that it does seem to be a motivation gap. And even like if you've got one group that are just more motivated than another group and then you add this intervention which is designed to help them. Well the group who already motivated sees that additional help and it's useful but if they're not very motivated in the first place because typically these are voluntary programs after all so. Right. And then and that seems to be borne out by other data too which is just a much higher rate of a much higher motivation level among young women when it comes to education. And then we'll talk about the work domain. Can you talk about how the changes in the economy have impacted men in the workforce. So a simple story here is just that a series of trends in the economy have disproportionately hit men and especially working class men and these this is not exactly breaking news but the industrialization especially caused by more trade. And by interest in the China shock joining WTO and automation they've just hit men's jobs traditionally male jobs more than women's jobs. And so there's been this series of external effects if you like that have just hit male employment harder. At the same time, your women have been doing much better. Big increase in women's employment rates and in women's wages. And then for both of them, both men and women are really big increase in wage inequality. And so I think a big part of the untold story here is that even as we've narrowed the gender gap in pay quite significantly and an employment we've widened the class gap very, very significantly. And so what we're seeing is that kind of women at the top doing really well. Men at the top doing really pretty well as to and then they're forming households together. Women in the middle doing better men in the middle not doing very well and women and men at the bottom not doing great. And so when you compound all that into sort of households and communities what we're seeing is really this kind of huge class fracturing. And again, I think that's part of the problem that people perhaps those especially in elite circles have with this conversation because if they're only looking around at the top. Well, I don't see men, you know, in huge trouble and I still see places where we need more women because they're just looking at the top of society. We're talking about the top of corporations right. Yeah, but also I think at the top of the labor market. I mean, it's like the only the only men who's who are better off today than men were in 79 other ones in say the top third of the distribution. We're better off. We're better off than men were at the men at the top of the distribution were 40 years ago. But all the other men are worse off than men were. And if you entered the labor market in the 1980s, you're going to earn quite a lot as a man. A lot less at the median than a man who entered in the 1960s. So this is really specific in the economy. It's really a very specifically kind of median and below problem where they're kind of bottom 60% where we're seeing these kind of very troubling trends. And so we're seeing a lot of people who are either earning less and all working less in a, you know, I would say a bit of a vicious circle. Can you talk about the family front a bit? I didn't want to spend a ton of time here, but it does occur to me, especially as we characterize men as having lost quite a lot or the last couple of decades. One of the things they've lost is that is that is the traditional role in the family. There are a lot of factors, I think, that contribute to that. But do you want to see explain how you see that problem? Yes, I mean, just just anecdotally on my, you know, my parents, I'm in my mid 50s. My parents are in their late 70s. And when, you know, they had a very clear division of labor. My father knew that he was going to be the breadwinner when he was made unemployed. His job was, as he told me, still got a job to get another job. There wasn't any question. They would sort of juggle it between them. My mom did work part time as an earth, but they knew they had a clear division of labor. And my father had a very clear role, which was to be the provider, economic provider. And back in those days, the gap, the gender gap in economic resources was so huge. That was built, absolutely built into the economic relationships between men and women. And one consequence of the economic rise of women has been to put this big question mark next to the role of men. So in 1979, this is US data now in 1979, 13% of women earned more than the median man. The typical man of the middle 13% today, 40% of women earn more than the median man. Now, 40% is not 50%, which is what you would get under conditions of absolute, but 40% is a lot more than 13%. I mean, that 40% and breadwinners are women now, a third of wives earn more than their husbands. A few decades ago. So we have fundamentally changed the economic relationship between men and women and therefore between mothers and fathers. Great. But the conservatives were right to say, well, wait, hold on. What about the men? What does that mean for the role of fathers? What does it mean for the role of provider? And that the conservative said, social conservative said, if women get economic independent, we're going to be in big trouble because the men won't have anything to do and they'll become rewarding, mad max style, antisocial creatures. It will be very bad for society, very bad for crime, et cetera. None of that's happened in the same way, by the way. Actually, the men have retreated. They're checking out rather than acting out, I think. But nonetheless, this question of what about the men then is a perfectly good question, right? Just because it's a great social change that women don't need men anymore. Doesn't mean that we shouldn't ask ourselves, well, wait, what's going to happen to a world where women don't need men? Earlier on, you talked about the racial element of this story. So I want to talk about this term intersectionality, which is getting thrown around around a lot recently. And it's a topic that you cover in the book. Can you lay out what that term means and how you use it? Because I think there's a lot of confusion about it. And how gender and race and class all impact outcomes in schools and prospects in the job market, et cetera. The way I understand intersectionality, it's Kimberly Crenshaw's work, is that in order to understand the barriers that people might face towards their own advancement or towards opportunities, we have to understand the multiple identities that they might have and how those intersect with each other. So for example, you might be black or white, woman, male, gay, straight, poor, rich, et cetera. And to look at how those intersections affect you. And I think that is true and very useful actually, very useful way to look at how these, because they will interact and intersect in different ways in different places. And so it's a more dynamic way, I think, of looking at inequality than just a static model. The problem is that the proponents of intersectionality, I think, misapply their own theory, including Kimberly Crenshaw, because what they will do is they'll say, it's going to, you know, it becomes an empirical question. As to how these things intersect, but what they actually then do is insist that there's a fixed hierarchy. And essentially it's kind of just, you just stack it up. It's a stacking game. And I think that's wrong. I think what, so it's always white above black, male, male, male, and female. Straight above gay, et cetera. And that's just obviously not true historically, or in kind of different countries. But what it means is that you miss something like the thing I turn a whole chapter on, which is that black men and boys are worse off on most measures than black women and black women. And not despite being men, but in many cases, because they're male. So masculine being male is a disadvantage, if you're black. It's not if you're white, but it is if you're black. And that to me is intersectionality properly applied, because it's saying that we're going to look at how those different identities intersect. That is not to say for the avoidance of any doubt or potential emails that I think game mission accomplished for black girls and women, obviously there's huge work still to do. But it is to say that if we're going to take that approach seriously, then it requires us to look at the data and the data are pretty clear for me that on pretty much every measure, black boys and men face unique intersections of disadvantage. Yeah, I think you characterize it as a double disadvantage or something to that effect. Yeah, which is intersect, which is what intersectionality means. Right. Right. Black women, there are actually slightly more young black women now with a postgraduate degree than there are young white men, which is obviously a wonderful thing in many ways, but but but there are twice as many black women with college degrees as black men with college degrees. All these gaps we're talking about. My rule of thumb now is they're probably twice as big when it comes to the gender gap between black men and black women. So you use the metaphor of dandelions and orchids to talk about how, generally speaking boys and girls are able to grow in different environments. Can you walk us through those differences. That's a term from psychology to try and get at this idea of resilience so an orchid requires quite a lot of care watering and light and all that I'm not a gardener so that's probably I'll just stop there. I neither know or really care about how you care for orchids but I do know that it takes a lot of work, whereas dandelions will grow pretty much anywhere right between the cracks in the sidewalk or whatever so the point is simply that some people are more dandelions some people are more orchid which means that the same circumstances will differentially affect that. Right. So lack of water will kind of kill the orchid but it won't the dandelion. And then it turns out that if you apply that dichotomy to the influence of disadvantage on boys and girls and particularly decision childhood really but boys are more orchid and girls are more dandelion boys are more sensitive to pretty much every measure of disadvantage we can find in terms of how it affects their own outcomes so poverty. Neighborhood poverty, poor school quality, family instability, etc. All of those things even for even foster care. Disproportionately affect boys they hurt boys more than they hurt girls of course they hurt both but they seem to hurt boys more. Interesting. So that creates an interesting dynamic because it's then it becomes intergenerational and again it's a little bit counter maybe some of the stereotypes we have about gender right you know that boys will be fine. Exactly. It's the girls that need nurturing and you know caring for it so it turns out that to the extent there's a difference it runs exactly the other way which means by the way that if you are a conservative you claims to care about boys and men you should be really worried about poverty and inequality. But if you're a liberal who claims to care about inequality and poverty you should really worry about boys and men. Yeah. Yeah. You see you're dropping all these breadcrumbs toward a political conversation that I really want to have and we'll get to that piece but I'm resisting the years to dig into my safe space at the moment so I'm happy to stay here. Well this leads me to sort of systems versus individuals and you write about how even among people on the political left who are generally more likely to see inequality based on social structures right and the issues that boys and men are facing are seen as individual. And I wonder how does recognizing structural issues change the way we can think about these problems and who is responsible for contributing to solutions. And what do you make of the the that sort of dissonance in the in the way they are seen one as one as being responsible social structures being responsible and the other it's all down to the individual. This is actually quite a big motivation for my work in this space. One of the things I noticed was that the tendency of those on the on the left especially to look towards structural problems could be structural racism structural sexism but essentially to look for structures in society that account for differences in outcome. And obviously historically those on the on the political right have tended to focus more on the individual and say it's more about individual responsibility. And that's a perfectly good and robust and useful disagreement in my view. Because I think the both of those perspectives are useful. And that debate is often very fruitful. If it's having good faith absolutely. Obviously going to be some sort of some combination of the two in different in different ways and for different people and so looking at kind of the where's the way of both is actually very helpful and I. But I think it's a useful instinct to to look for structural causes of group based differences in outcome. And so when I look at some of the some of the statistics we just talked about around education for example I think it's useful to say not what's wrong with the boys. But they're doing so badly at school but say what's wrong with schools. The so many boys are doing so badly in them. Now it might turn out that the answer is nothing right but the very least that's not what I think the answer is by the way I think it's quite a lot wrong with schools that means they don't work well for boys but at the very least you should ask the question. But they don't the folks on the layer don't actually apply that to boys and men. They take an individualistic approach and so the problems with boys and then typically a friend has problems of boys and so it's, you know, we have to solve this problem one individual at a time. And I have to tell you just as just on a personal level one of things I've been really struck by is how many parents and young men and boys have been in contact with me. Just saying thank you for making me realize I'm not the only one or we're not alone. You know there's not something wrong with us or with me right there could be something else going on here because the message has just been like what's wrong with me and in the case of the left it could be that you're too toxic or you're too aggressive or you're just to let you to lazy don't try hard enough etc. Whatever whatever you want to take on the right the problem has been framed as you're not masculine enough you need to be kind of more manly and so I the way I characterize this is left to telling boys and men to be more like that. And the right is telling boys and men to be more like their father and neither of those are very useful invocations in the world we are in right now. And so they end up sort of a bit lost but but I just I mean comes back to some of these other issues around health care and even COVID deaths or whatever thing you want to choose is that I think it's very useful to look for structural causes and not stop there of course but at least start with that question. Right. Can we talk about biology for a moment. A nice and controversial topic. Nice and controversial I mean it's a perfect segue because you highlight that voices from the left and from the right way biological differences in males and females incorrectly. Can you lay out what those biological differences are why they're important and how they should be properly weighted in your view. Yeah, I want to make one important distinction which is between the way the timing of development of boys and girls and the end result and so the biggest difference that I think has consequences for education policy in particular is that boys develop later than girls boys brains grow later than girls brains, especially in particular ways which we might get into better on the prefrontal cortex the bit of your brain that helps you have future orientation etc. That develops about a year or two later in boys, especially in puberty then girls and so 15 year old boy is not the neurological equivalent of a 15 year old girl. She's way ahead of him and again it's like a well a well done. Everybody has got it. Or it's been a kid or been at school or been a team right. Everybody who's ever been through that. Anybody that's ever gone into a ninth grade class and asked everyone to open up their book bags. That's what I'm talking about and so this is not that bit and it's completely uncontroversial that bit by the way. What's more controversial is the differences between men and women, the endure and that actually might explain things like occupational choices or preferences towards caring for children appetite for risk, etc. What happens is that in most of the for most of those differences what we have as a bimodal distribution right you have a you have a nice wonky audience. I can talk about overlap and distributions, which means that they're different but they overlap. And once we get that in our head the question becomes well how much do they overlap and does it matter for anything. Right but but there's such a fear of this on the left that there's a tendency to say all of these differences are socialized. Right between boys and girls and men and women and that is that shit crazy to be technical about it. I mean that's just obviously not true. It's not all socialized. There are some differences between us that are not so this is the this is nature versus nurture and how do we weigh them both. Yeah and so so the left will kind of say it's all basic. I'm character in a little bit there what they usually they're thoughtful enough to say of course nature plays some role. But it's tiny and now I'm only going to talk about nurture and what those on the right will do is they'll say of course nurture plays some role but it's mostly nature. So I'm only going to talk about nature rather than talking about the ways that they balance each other out and co-evolve but it is clearly true that there are some differences. Can you maybe briefly explain the consequences of on the one hand the left underweighting those biological differences and then on the other the right overweighting them. Sure so let me take a reasonably safe example, which is occupational segregation occupational choice. So what the left will say is that there are no differences between men and women that could explain why women will be less likely to be engineers and men would be more likely to be nurses say or fighter pilots or whatever you want to. And so we have to get to 5050 in everything. Anything less short of 5050 can only be the result of nurture of culture of sexism in one kind or another. And that's not true. But the right will then say of course women can't be engineers their brains don't work that way. But the truth is something much more boring, which is under conditions under which and here I'm actually just citing the work of a couple of psychologists wrong Sue and James rounds who take the differences between men and women on average in their interests in what this called by psychologist the people things dimension men are a bit more into things women are a bit more into people. That's true. But what it would mean is that if that was being expressed pretty freely in the labor market about 30% of engineers would be women and about 30% of nurses would be men. Now, that's not 50%. So sorry left, sorry, everything socialization left but like and actually interestingly in the Scandinavian countries there are fewer women going into STEM now. And so the more which turns out the closer you get to gender equality the fewer that you see a dropping off of the women going into STEM, which is really hard to explain I think other than it. That's actually a choice right I don't you know I don't think it can be it can't be that Sweden still suck in the grip of sorry, the teacher arc in the women feel they can't be engineers. But it's also a lot more than so it's 30% twice but twice twice what we are at now. Right. And so it's not as if you can explain the current level of female representation in engineering or male in nursing by biology. And there's a lot of people on the right who would say that if anything even that's too high right I've heard people like Jordan Peterson who's obviously in this space and there's a brilliant intellect them and other things but he's justified the fact that only 5% of engineers or women is out of date on that by using the people things dimension by saying well women's brains work differently and say well they do but not 5% right. And so it's like can we so we're in other words we're a long way from from recognizing from saying that we're at equality but say something like mathematics as a profession we're at about 40% female representation and it looks like that's about where it's going to level out just in terms of the differences and interest and that's okay we need to be okay with that. Yeah this is this is fascinating and a much much bigger discussion but I think it's important you do cover this in the book and I think it's important that you know if you take anything away from this part of the conversation nature and nurture yes and right it's really it's both. It's what everybody thinks it's what everyone thinks except ideologues basically.
