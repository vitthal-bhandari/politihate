    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Thursday, everybody it's time for the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. Our buddy Clay, giving us the updates from Italy, having a great time on vacation with the family. Be back with us next week so you're rocking out with me today tomorrow solo and we have oh so much to discuss. I'm excited about it. Um, come a bit not particularly good news but it's news and stuff you need to know. And then there's a whole lot of politics, national security analysis that we will be getting into. Some wokeness, much much to discuss here. All right, let's start with where we're heading. First Republic, bank shares plunged 35% today as Goldman Sachs, the massive investment bank, perhaps the most powerful investment bank in the world says, a recession warning should be flashing for everybody right now. Yeah, not a shock. That was something that I wanted to just bring to your attention because the banks you got yelling, you got people going out there saying, just don't panic. You got to keep your composure. And I don't know how many of these banks got on the wrong side of the interest rate issue and got into other mortgages that were that they bought as investments or even treasury bonds. We'll be looking at that, my friends. You also have Ron DeSantis announcing that we in the state of Florida are going to be enacting constitutional carry points on the board, my friends. This is really what you're going to see playing out in this Republican primary. Ron DeSantis, assuming he runs, and we are all assuming at this point that he's going to run, is going to be the I get stuff done that I say I'm going to get done, and it benefits you candidate. You can evaluate that as you will, but he's making a pretty strong case for it down here in the state of Florida. That's for sure. Montana's lieutenant governor on sex changes for minors said, well, basically, when the kids tell you what they want, you have to listen to them to be a good parent. You'll hear that sound bite a little bit later. I am not yet apparent, but I do think it's pretty clear from all the good parents that I know that doing whatever your kid says is not a good idea. And affirming whatever they tell you is actually not how you parent well. Biden, by the way, is demanding that TikTok be sold or will be banned. So that is, I'm sorry. I said Montana, I'm at Minnesota. Whoops, the lieutenant governor of Minnesota. Right. There we go. And also we have a sunny hosten here telling us that she hasn't been to a grocery store in three years because of COVID. Oh, and a guy on a plane, a wealthy fellow on a plane, a tech tycoon offered a woman $100,000, $100,000 to just take her mask off for the duration of the flight. This has gone viral. Not all heroes wear capes. They certainly don't wear masks. This guy is is pretty funny. We'll talk about that in just a little bit. I wanted to start though with an update on the drone situation from from yesterday. It is remarkable how quickly first first, let me tell you what the news is of this. And then we can get into a bit more of the what does this matter? Where is this taking all of us? So you had the Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin while we were on air yesterday. And I brought you a little bit of the commentary that or the statement that he made. And also Chairman Millie talking about what happened with this drone. It turns out our our pilot caller yesterday, we had a fighter pilot call in and say, you know, you probably could a drone is quite fragile. And you probably could clip it with a Russian Sukhoi fighter aircraft and bring it down. It looks like that is, as of now, at least what happened. There's actually video of it. It's pretty remarkable. It makes sense though, right? There's a drone. So the drone has surveillance cameras. The whole point of the drone is to see stuff and pick up measurements, right? It's a surveillance drone. So there's video and the plane basically looks like it slams right into or near enough the drone that it brought it down. So that's that's the update on it. It was interesting though, because yesterday you had you had Joint Chiefs Chairman Mark Millie when he was asked about whether this downing of the drone was an act of war, he did not want to give any definitive statement on a plate clip eight. I can tell you with certainty though that we have absolute evidence of the contact me at the steps, except her and it's very aggressive. He's you've heard about the dumping of fuel and everything else. We have video evidence and all that. So there's there's no question that that part of its intention. As far as an act of war goes, I'm not gonna I'm not gonna go there. Incidents happen and clearly we do not seek armed conflict with with Russia. And I believe that at this point we should investigate this incident and move on from there. I thought that was interesting. He says he's not gonna go there. And then he kind of goes there. It's like, I'm not gonna get into this. Look, we are in a situation where the I want to I want to step back from just this moment to remind everybody how we got here in the first place. 2016, the entire Democrat apparatus is completely convinced that Hillary Clinton has about a 100% chance of becoming the next president of the United States. As we know, that did not happen. And they came up with this crazy and it really was crazy story about Trump working with Russia and you know, the Russians, maybe they hacked voting machines or the Russians, you know, engaged in some disinformation campaign. They spent some money on Facebook. There are some bots, whatever that Russia helped Trump steal the election. And so then it became mandatory for Democrats who wanted to be in good standing to view all things Russia as the most monstrous and horrible of any country in the world. You know, if you had asked a Democrat who had voted for Hillary Clinton, who was going on MSNBC or whatever, first of all, they clearly thought it was a bigger threat than China, which is, which is crazy. But if you had even said, you know, who's a bigger threat to international stability Russia or North Korea, what a bit of Russia? Right. So they created a mass hysteria within the Democrat party about Russia. And that has dramatically impacted the relationship and the perception of the relationship that certainly Democrats and a lot of Republicans have about the US and Russia and pushed it in a in an irrationally negative direction. And so we no longer have the kind of relationship with Russia where, yeah, of course, Putin's a thug. All this stuff is true. A lot she is at the she meaning Xi Jinping is is a thug. I mean, a lot of a lot of these governments that we have to do. What do we think of the Saudi regime? Not exactly democratically elected, is it? Right. There are plenty of authoritarians we have to do business with that we have to work with. And we do so because it is ultimately in the interests of the American people. Because that is what we care about. I don't know. You could even say it is an America first perspective. Isn't it fascinating that Donald Trump was able to turn around the phrase America first was a was a pejorative. You know, it was America first you take it all the way back and people will talk about Charles Lindbergh and it but but even to use the phrase America first isolationist and worse than that isolationist and worse. But hold on. That's the most succinct way to put the mentality that we should have in this country when we're looking at American foreign policy and interest, which is what is to the benefit of the American people that step one. Sure. There are other considerations. We want to be, you know, a kind and just and good people and good stewards of the environment and good neighbors to the rest of the world. All that. Yes, of course. But priority number one. But what's fascinating is that Democrats in part because of the Russia collusion delusion and their irrational hatred of Russia that they no longer can see the ups and downs of this. It's just Russia is the bad guy. We have to do anything we can to crush Putin and the Kremlin. And that is our first priority. And we use it. You sit there you say, well, hold on a second. How did we get to that point? I keep talking to conservatives about this issue, including a lot of veterans. And one thing that we we all seem to agree on is of the Ukrainian people, they were invaded. It's wrong. What Russia's done is awful. We're rooting for Ukraine to be able to to fight. But we also want to at least be able to have a conversation about one, how much of this is supposed to be US funded and backed. Hey, we might be heading into a recession, folks, not just according to me, according to Goldman Sachs, and pretty much everybody who's paying attention. And you may be struggling to pay your bills. Biden wants to raise your taxes. We all know this. Oh, it'll just be for the fat cats. When has that ever been true? It's never true. Biden wants to make it so that you have less money to spend because he knows how to spend your money better. And that includes spending $100 billion a year on the war in Ukraine. You might start to think, hold on a second, is that really in the primary interest? Well, what matters more to the American people that you can pay your rent or that we are sending enough javelin missiles to Ukraine? I think that's a fair conversation. I have people say, Oh, we can walk and chew gum at the same time. $100 billion is a lot of money. Actually, $100 billion matters, even in US budgetary terms, a year, keep in mind there is no chance of this conflict ending anytime soon. The people who keep saying Russia is almost defeated have said it every three months, maybe every two months since the beginning of this war, basically, ever since Russia didn't take Kiev or Kiev, as we're now all supposed to call it. So they've been wrong over and over again. Russia is not about to be exhausted or defeated. That is a fantasy. So can we have a fourth right and honest discussion about what are really the interests that we have and how far are we willing to go? Well, the answer is no, they want to just like we saw with COVID and so many other things. They want to silence you. They want to shut you down. You are Russian stooge. You are Russian stooge. If you question the extent that American tax dollars should go to fund a war thousands of miles away. And when they when they're asked how this is in the American interest, you have Lloyd Austin, the secretary of defense saying something that's very similar to what we've heard from others, Biden, Kamala Harris. It's this very vague stuff that sounds like what you'd hear from somebody in a high school model UN conference about the international rules-based order, place seven. In terms of the importance of Ukraine, first of all, we've seen bipartisan support for providing security assistance to Ukraine throughout up to this point. I expect that we will continue to see that going forward. We've heard some senior leaders on both sides of the fence say that this is about the rules-based international order. It's about one country's ability to to wake up one day and change the borders of its neighbor and annex its neighbors sovereign territory. And as we've seen countries around the world don't think that's a good idea. This is about the rules-based international order. Okay. Interesting. So what when he says that that's the justification, first of all, the fact that has bipartisan support, that's not an answer. And I don't care. When we're asking a question, when someone's saying why is this a every time I ask or I hear someone try to answer the why is this a key US national security interest? The response is not compelling. They say, oh, they'll go into NATO countries afterwards. They'll invade Poland afterwards. That is crazy. Look at the trouble they're having just with US financial and material backing in Ukraine. So they're not just going to take on Poland. They're going to take on all of NATO next. That is lunacy. But people say it. People who think they're really smart say it. Oh, yeah, the Poland is next. Whew. Okay. But then they say something about the international rules-based order or something that sounds like it comes from a boilerplate UN conference. And I sit here and I say, okay, if that's so true, if we should have done all this, why was it that under the Obama administration, under the Obama administration, there was a fear of sending javelin anti-tech missiles and drag it off sniper rifles to the Ukrainian military because it would have been considered provocative to Russia and contrary to American interests after Russia had already effectively invaded a part of Eastern Ukraine after Russia had taken Crimea. How much worse I ask you this, how much did it matter to your life that Crimea became a part of the Russian Federation years ago? I think we all know the answer to that. How much did it affect your life, your safety, your financial security, your future when Eastern Ukraine fell under the dominion of the Russian Federation in all but official name and the fighting continued on for seven years. The answer is, it didn't matter to you. Ah, but now it's supposed to be all or nothing. You see, no one's rooting for Russia here. No one is blind to the realities of the Russian aggression and the thuggishness of Vladimir Putin. We're trying to look at what first of all was the bipartisan consensus on this even under the Obama administration. Interesting. The Trump administration has got real quiet for a while. But anyway, under the Obama administration, you know, sees Crimea and do all this stuff. Okay. And at the end of the Bush administration, by the way, you can talk about what happened in South Ossetia and Abkhazia and in Georgia effectively, little pieces of that taken off. But now we're supposed to believe this is a key national security issue for us instead of saying, because this is what I offer in response, we need a negotiated settlement and Ukraine is going to lose some territory in it. How about that? How many lives could be saved there? And how many hundreds of billions of dollars could be saved of the taxpayer? If we took that approach, does it feel good? No. Is it justice? Not really. But saving lives in order to exchange territory. That is basically the history of all warfare and humanity stretching back for quite a long time. Right. You end wars through negotiation and settlement. And often that includes an exchange of territory. We can't even talk about that right now. You know, the world's in turmoil, that's for sure. The failures in the banking system are teaching people lessons right now about unforeseen consequences. And the federal government looks like, well, what are they going to do? Remember, the lines outside supermarkets just three years ago during COVID, they could start again. Yeah, we had to stand six feet apart. That's stupidity.

I can't say that I have left my heart in San Francisco. I've only been there a couple of times. I think once, twice, twice maybe. It is a beautiful city. It was physically geographically a beautiful city. It has some problems though. It has some issues. Right now, you've probably seen the videos and it is a Democrat enclave. It is really the distillation of lifestyle coastal liberalism in one city in one place. In some sense, the the purest Democrat urban ecosystem you could find of the lifestyle liberal variety. So Nancy Pelosi is a rain supreme supreme in San Francisco. And we see what's happened. It's gone from being a place where we many of us think of full house. Remember the show full I grew up watching that show. Really enjoyed it. I watched full house for many years. And you know, this beautiful house, which I think now, well, I don't know what it is now. But at one point, that was like a $4 million house. They were living in, you know, Danny Tanner and John Stamos and Dave Coolier, whatever. They were all living in together. Anyway, San Francisco was a very safe city, culturally vibrant, beautiful, a lot of good things about it. Right. A lot of great things about it. And not anymore. Right. It's unfortunately gone in a direction where people are leaving as fast as they reasonably can. The city of San Francisco now faces a budget deficit of $728 million. That's a big budget. You know, San Francisco is not that big as a city. That's a big problem. And the bigger problem in a sense isn't just the deficit is that there's no sign of this getting better. It relies largely on property taxes to fund services. And you can play this similar scenario out in a lot of Democrat run cities across the country. But the downtown offices are at about a 30% vacancy. 29% is the actual data that I have in front of me here. So almost a, you know, call it a third of the downtown offices empty in San Francisco. So they've got a lot of problems. They've got a lot of issues right now. And they're still going to keep spending a whole lot of money. And they don't want to change their redistributive mechanisms in place. The lifestyle liberalism slash Marxism. That is, that is the, you know, animating ideology of San Francisco. So I give you all of this background because I think it makes this even more fascinating and tells you more about the Democrat mindset in the left wing strongholds. I think San Francisco is for a city of over a half a million people. I think it is the most Democrat city in the entire country with the exception. It might be DC now, which think about that. I mean, DC are our nation's capital is as a city entirely Democrat dominated, which is why you see things like the recent crime bill that the city council passed. Think about this. They have a increase, a massive increase in carjackings in DC, which is a form of armed robbery that threatened someone's life for their car. They have card, not car theft, carjacking, you know, get out of the car or I'm going to stab you or shoot you. That's what a carjacking is. The DC city council was like, we're punishing carjackers too harshly. That's real. That was in their most recent crime bill that even Joe Biden had to go along with the Republicans in blockings. He's like, you guys are ready to your minds. Okay. In San Francisco, I just told you they're approaching a billion dollar budget hole for this year. And it's going to be, that's their projection. It's going to be worse because why, what business in its right mind, I didn't care what its politics are. It's going to move into downtown San Francisco right now. Can you think of one? No, they're all breaking their leases and getting out of there as soon as they possibly can. And that's not going to change because it wasn't just about COVID, obviously, it was about all these other factors as well. It is with that backdrop that I tell you that the reparations committee that has been hired by the city of San Francisco is now advising a five million dollar a person lump sum payment to every eligible black resident of San Francisco. A guaranteed income of $97,000 per year for 250 years. Elimination of personal debt and tax burdens and homes for $1. I am reading that to you. Okay. That is, that is the actual reporting year. I don't know what the best part of this is. I mean, $5 million in a lump sum, that's nice. That, that helps a lot. Obviously, like I would love a $5 million lump sum. Sign me up for that. The elimination of any personal debt and any need to pay any taxes and a home for a dollar. This is in a city that is facing the biggest budget crisis in my lifetime, certainly. They're spending money to have people tell them that the city residents need to give $5 million to every black resident of the city of San Francisco who I'm trying to find the there are some, there's some specifications here. You have to be, let me see. By the way, only about 6% of San Francisco's population is black. So it's less than 50,000 residents. That, okay, they have to prove that they migrated to San Francisco between 1940 and 1996, prove residency for at least 13 years, have claimed to have been black on government documents for at least 10 years and either be a descendant of someone enslaved before 1865 or, this was really interesting too, a direct descendant of someone jailed in the failed war on drugs. So by my, my, my understanding here, let's say your family migrated from Africa in like the 1980s and somewhat in your, you know, and you have a father who went to prison for, I don't know, drug trafficking of some kind, that means that you would qualify under this, under these provisions. So I'm just, I'm just here to say, and I want to be very clear on this. I think what San Francisco's reparations committee is, is offering up is really racist. It is not nearly enough money, $5 million a person. It should be $500 million a person. It should be 11. No. So clearly we should go bankrupt, not just, not just San Francisco, which is going to head toward bankruptcy. If it does anything, even approaching this, and it already is heading in that direction without any of this, we should be willing to go bankrupt designation in order to do this. Right. I mean, isn't that the mentality? I would want to ask the members of this reparations committee. And this has been passed by the San Francisco board of supervisors, by the way, they have embraced all of these recommendations. So it has gone beyond the committee paid to study reparations to the San Francisco board of supervisors. And they're the ones who were saying, you know, we're going to have to look at this officially in June in terms of what they adopt. Look, they're obviously not going to do all. I mean, I shouldn't say obviously, but they're not going to do all of this. But at some level, I do think is a, what, what would we call the Mott and Bailey argument? It's making outrageous, make all these outrageous claims. So that then when the council gathers together and they say, you know, we're going to give, we're going to give $200,000 to every black resident. Okay, how about that? There might be this moment of, oh, well, that's, I mean, it's not $5 million. So that seems reasonable in comparison, right? That's $200,000 a person. City can't afford that either. But maybe that's somewhat doable. You see how that you see how that works as a classic bad faith argumentation tactic that people use or people people use their negotiations to negotiations, you'll generally it's a little different. There's another tactic called anchoring. Right. So if I if I'm going to buy a watch from somebody, I can say to them. And I've, you know, bought and sold watches on the on the fly before it's an interesting process in New York. I could say to them, hey, that's a really nice, you know, $3,000 watch. Well, they want, you know, they want six for it. And I just said, it's a nice $3,000 watch. I have anchored them. Like that's the purpose of that and negotiate those. If you were in sales, you got you guys and gals know all this backwards and forwards. But modern Bailey argumentation is a little bit different. It's when you take this a much more expansive position in order to actually advance and protect a by comparison reasonable position. Right. So this is why I say, oh, we should give $5 million per black resident in reparations. And the, you know, 90, what was it? 90 something thousand dollars a year for 250 years. I don't even, you know, human beings really only live to 100. So there's a lot of stuff. But the point being, after all that, then the committee can maybe say, all right, so we're just going to do maybe we'll do universal basic income for every black resident of, you know, $10,000 a month. Right. Oh, wait a second. That sounds so reasonable in comparison. So I wouldn't dismiss all of this as just bluster from the San Francisco Council and, and, and this reparations committee. I think there's the possibility that they do try something here. But I'm, I'm just, I'm just going to keep pointing out $5 million a resident. That's those are those are low numbers. We need to get those, we need to get those numbers up. I'm 50 million San Francisco. Why don't you take this problem seriously? 50 million dollars per black resident sounds far more social justice worthy. I think 50 million, it should be the number right. That's, that's the way we should go. It's just as crazy as their number folks. So what difference does it make? You know what I mean? And, and the fact that in, in cities where there are real problems, and this is the, the honest to God part of the whole thing that drives me crazy, there are real things that can be done for all of the residents, the black residents, and all of the residents of San Francisco that would help that clean up those streets, keep them safer, enforce the law, make it a place people want to live, make it a place where people can go to good schools. You know, there's a lot of stuff that could be done that's real. No, instead, because you know, liberalism for so many in this country is their religion replacement, you know, there's no real attachment to God or anything beyond themselves. It's a religion of narcissism and virtue signaling, right? Oh, it's all about me and feeling good about my positions. So for the San Francisco residents and the area residents who have so much money and, although I don't know, SVB banks, some of them are probably lost some money. This is an opportunity to feel good about themselves without actually doing any good. And this is something you see continuously with Democrats in places like San Francisco and, you know, like Los Angeles, New York City, D.C., Chicago, you name it, they want to do things that make them feel good about themselves that do no actual good and in fact, will do harm to other people. And they don't care. And they don't care because it is a credo of narcissism and self advancement that they, that they espouse and pretend that it's about other people pretend that it's about historic injustice, social injustice, whatever it is that they're saying today.

Some states have taken action to end the practice of transgender surgery for minors, adolescents, teenagers, some cases even pre adolescents. Some states, Oklahoma, for example, we had Governor Kevin Stitt on the show to talk about it. Florida, Tennessee, they're taking actions to say you're just not going to do this under the guise of medicine. It is ideology masquerading as medicine. Everybody who sits around and thinks about it and is in brainwash knows that or you can think that all of a sudden there's been a 3000% rise in transgender kids because that's actually just been reality for all of human history until now and not that adults have decided because of the emptiness of their own lives and their own susceptibility to brainwashing by the left wing apparatus in this country that adults are pushing this belief on children because it is fashionable. It is fashionable, not just in their minds for the children, but actually for the adults themselves. Oh, look at me. I'm so progressive. By the way, how many, you know, how many like right wing dads who go to church every Sunday and have calluses on their hands from their job or, you know, their weekend activities end up having a, you know, a seven year old that they decide is, you know, not actually a boy, but a girl. And then how many it's such a coincidence. Isn't it remember coincidences? The Wuhan Institute of Virology, COVID pops up right next to it. It's a big world. Oh, that's a coincidence. Sure it is. Another coincidence. Blue haired nose ringed left wing activist shrieking on TikTok about, you know, how Trump is Hitler and how climate change is going to destroy the planet. Happens to seem to be the profile of parent of child who was actually transgender. How is that? What a coincidence. Hmm. I wonder why is it that the obvious left wing loon tends to be much more likely to be the parent of a transgender child. That's so it's so interesting, isn't it? Certainly much more likely to be the parent of a transgender child who is being pushed toward surgery, puberty blockers, any of the rest of it. But then this brings me to other states. I we're seeing this now states. One thing that COVID showed us was how important your state government actually is, how tyrannical and idiotic it can be, or how sane and rational and, and of course, then prosperous as a result of those decisions that can be, you know, see Florida, Texas, Tennessee, and some others. But the state of Minnesota, the state of Minnesota now has become, thanks to its Democrat governor, Waltz, a transgender surgery for youth haven, or a sanctuary state for transgender surgeries and puberty blockers. They keep calling it gender affirming care. Why don't they call it gender transitioning care? You ever thought about that? That's what it used to be called? Why did they change it? Because they want you to use language that concedes the argument before the argument is even made. They want you to say effectively, you're right before you've even gotten into what they're right about. You're affirming the gender with this care. Wait, no, you're changing a gender. Well, notice even in that simple, that simple lie, that straightforward reality, you can see what's really going on here. So Waltz signed this executive order. And even when I read the, when I read the way the media talks with the Sowys, you know, oh, but these things are the gender affirming care, which is generally puberty blockers and hormone therapy. And it's mostly or partially reversible. And like, maybe sometimes there's surgery, but you know, like, let's not talk about that. I mean, we want to make sure that people do that. Kids, little kids, we want to make sure that Democrats want to be certain in Minnesota that a 14 year old girl, when she enters puberty can have a double mastectomy. They want to be certain of that. But they also want to downplay the realities of what happens of what the long term implications of this are. And if you want to get into the mindset here, so Minnesota as a state, I used to go camping in Minnesota with my dad over the summers in the boundary waters. So those who are Minnesota folks, or maybe some others who travel that are, you know, it's beautiful. I always tell people Minnesota were so nice. And I think that holds up. And I just don't know how it's been turned into such a left wing, blue Democrat, Looney Bin. But it is, it is. Here you have the Lieutenant Governor of Minnesota, Peggy Flanagan, who is a, who is a Native American, which you'll hear about a lot because that's, you know, identity politics super important. What is, what does she stand for? What are her leadership capabilities? What is she? No, no, no. Let's just first celebrate. We're told that you have a the first Native American woman at this level of politics in the state of Minnesota, or maybe it's, I think she actually might be the second, but whatever. But she's a community activist. She's very left wing in her thoughts and beliefs. And I want you to hear, especially for the parents out there, what is now these are, these are people with a lot of power, governors, Lieutenant governors, they're signing legislation that is going to, by the way, this is going to be turned against parents who are not crazy at some point, because what you're going to have is a doctor. Just wait. Remember that I've said this to you. You will have a case at the national level. It will become a big issue where you have the system, activist, therapist, some, you know, doctor who seems like a loon, but has an MD who's like, yeah, we need to do gender transitions for the 14 year olds. And then a parent who steps in and says, I don't want this for my child. And the system says, if you don't allow this, it's child abuse to not allow the gender mutilation of your child, this child abuse, just give it time. This will happen. If it hasn't, it might have already happened in the state. I just haven't seen it or can't remember it right now. But that will happen. Here is Lieutenant governor of Minnesota Flanagan on some parenting advice that I think all the parents in this audience. Oh boy, here you go. Play clip three. Let's be clear. This is life affirming and life saving health care. When our children tell us who they are, it is our job as grownups to listen and to believe them. That's what it means to be a good parent. Oh, there you go. That's what it means to be a good parent. So remember, they talk about trans babies. The left don't let them don't let them try to pretend that they talk about trans babies. Men can get periods. Men can get pregnant. There are transgender babies. I mean, they've gone all out with all this stuff now. And now the fight is, should we actually allow these these quack doctors, these lunatic medical practitioners to like remove the breasts of a healthy teenage girl because she's decided she's a man before she's 18. I'm not even talking about adults are not even a part of this conversation right now, putting that aside entirely. But for children, oh, they say it's reversible, really? Oh, yeah, I'm sure puberty puberty blocking drugs block your your your gender transition for a few years with the same drugs in some cases that they actually give to, you know, sex offenders to sterilize them to sterilizing drug block block someone's puberty and then tell them they're just going to turn it back on everything we find in normal. That's crazy. It's not true. The long term effects of this, they they're lying to you but the same way they lied about COVID and everything else, they're lying to you about what the data really says. But I thought this was fascinating. So if a child, if your six year old comes up to you and says on one day, I'm a stegosaurus, which I'm sure some of you the parents out there would say, yeah, my kids have said some weird stuff when they're, you know, five, six years old. I'm a stegosaurus. I identify with triceratops. I feel like I'm a triceratops. You are supposed to say to that, well, I don't know what would what would Lieutenant Governor Flanagan want you to say. I assume it would be no, no, no, you're not actually an extinct dinosaur species. That was that would be really hard. But at the same child at the same age were to say, I'm a I want to be called a girl's name and have long hair and dress in princess costumes. And I'm a girl. All it's time to have all their classmates and the school and everybody treat them like a girl. And and forget about the fact that so much of this is drawn by kids being one confused, too impressionable, three wanting attention. Minnesota, a a state that is now standing up and saying come to us if you want gender transition surgery for kids. It's a shame what they've done to that state.

Rhonda Santis weighed in recently with his foreign policy view of the situation in Ukraine I thought it was nuanced sensible and showed a grasp of all the uh all the different things to consider you know equities in DC speak right we call everything equities now but Kamala Harris disagrees with the approach of Rhonda Santis and I think just to remind everybody of the kinds of people who are in charge remember Joe Biden was brought on to the Obama ticket to be the brilliant mind of foreign policy let that sink in for a second true story Joe Biden was the foreign policy guy in the body oh and of course that mattered too because when he was vice president what was part of his portfolio in the Obama administration oh Ukraine which is why there's that video of him saying that he demanded the firing of a special prosecutor in Ukraine or else a billion dollar loan guarantee yeah that Joe Biden just coincidentally the same country that was paying his uh crack addict boa and tighty white he's clad son um 80 thousand dollars a month right just that is a quick the same way that the Wuhan Institute of Virology being right next to the first place that the covid virus pops up it's a coincidence just like the only country that Joe Biden seemed so very fixated on it that phase of the Obama presidency that was in his portfolio happened to be paying happened to be uh paying his son 80 thousand dollars a month to do nothing okay right coincidence theorists it's fun isn't it but anyway Joe Biden was the foreign policy guy Kamala Harris is now Joe Biden's vice president i think it is fair to say that Kamala Harris even if she just stays in this vice presidential role based on health issues if Joe Biden were to get into a second term there's a very real chance that Kamala would be a vice president who would have to take the helm we all know that's just you know that's just the age reality of where Biden is in life we all know that um you know maybe he just decides he doesn't have the energy anymore and he really doesn't he finally admits what the reality is steps down Kamala takes over okay here she is weighing in on DeSantis's Ukraine war thoughts play four so as vice president i have now met with over a hundred world leaders presidents prime ministers chancellors and kings and when you have had the experience of meeting and and understanding the significance again of international rules and norms and the importance of the united states of america standing firm and clear about the significance of sovereignty and territorial integrity the significance of standing firm against any nation that would try to take by force oh it's about sovereignty that was the part of it that that jumped out to me we are a country that now has an ongoing invasion of illegal immigration to the tune of millions a year and tens of millions in total inside the country already and we're being lectured it is a joke to get into america right now but is that easy at the southern border and we just spoke to steven miller about this yesterday who is just he is a like a savant on on border issues he knows more than than anyone else you can think of at the policy level and we're we're talking about a wide open border what could be a more egregious violation of u.s. sovereignty short of a military invasion than that but that is not as important as what is the status of the don boss region this is what we're the don boss region which i honestly would be very curious to see let's let's ask this question i'll let could Kamala Harris if you gave a blank map of europe with none of the country names listed not even could she find the don boss do you think she could find you cray do you think joe biden could i leave that i leave that to your discretion biden maybe because that's where a lot of the family loot came from right but i think it's a quite an open question could you find the don boss region mmm probably not but i think it's interesting also that kamala felt the need to do this this preamble of when you're really important and you've met with really important people and you understand all the important rules about the important stuff in the world it's like okay yeah you're the vice president you got you got to do better than just tell us you've sat in a lot of meetings you've got to explain to us the international rules based order well what is that what what does that even really mean it's like people that say this is a violation of international law okay who's going to enforce it well as we know the democrats believe we should we're the ones that are supposed to as long as there is no critical u.s. interest involved in a conflict democrats get excited about spending us blood and treasure in this case so far in Ukraine just treasure but give it time we'll see anyway i thought it was remarkable um and then there's also uh this from the oh actually you know what i'll i'll get to the sunny hoston clip because first off there's this guy who was on a delta flight and and i because i've often said this to people what would it take what would it take to for the the people who are masking alone in cars and they exist because i see them still and there are a lot of people masking up in california certainly in los angeles area san francisco i saw it in l.a. recently i'm going back to new york uh soon spent some time in in my hometown i'm sure there are going to be a bunch of people there masked up too including alone and outside you ask yourself what would it take for them to stop doing this like what has to happen for them to finally say enough is enough and you've seen there are some efforts now to normalize through science doing this forever they're saying oh but maybe it also reduces like normal flu and cold or something it's like come on guys come on let let's let's not but they will they'll try something really pathetic this guy steve kirsch he is a tech uh super millionaire that guy's worth two hundred and thirty million dollars said that he was sitting next to a woman in first class i love this who by the by the did does anyone again what bet would you put that you know who this woman who was sitting in first class who was masking up between bites what what odds would you give that she's a democrat i mean i would i think that you couldn't even nobody would take the other side of the bet i don't think there are any odds you could give that she is that that you would actually get money to come in against you on this right ten to one a hundred to one she clearly is a biden voter and he started the bidding at a hundred dollars to get her to take off the mask this guy's worth two hundred thirty million dollars so for him a hundred k is couch cushion money it doesn't matter and he got all the way up to a hundred thousand dollars and she still wouldn't take the mask off even though he was explaining to her you realize that you're taking and that he tweeted about this too you keep bringing the mask down to eat for you know to drink to eat you know for fifteen minutes at a time twenty minutes at a time what what do you think you're pretty well the virus that you think is in the air which by the way on planes you're safer from viruses than you are and almost any other congregate setting as fauci would say but because of the happenfill trade-up between bites was so important that was always the airline policy it was never ever wear a mask the entire time you're on the plane even that wouldn't work but wear the mask partially in between bites at different periods on the flight if you believe that an aerosolized virus is something that you can't see that it's just swirling around in the air this was completely insane she wouldn't she wouldn't take him up on a hundred now of course what what are the lips saying oh they didn't think he'd actually pay well you know she could I'm sure the guys probably got a couple of grand in cash autumn probably could have said well I want you to pull out a Venmo at the end of this I'll get a witness I mean if someone told me pull first of all never find a photo of me with a mask on anywhere you won't it's like it all you know I'm not wearing a mask on a plane obviously but you know I would say if someone was going to pay me this kind of money I would at least get a witness to it and say this was a verbal contract and try to hold them to it but anyway it's not worth it to her it's not worth it I would let someone give me covid for a hundred grand I've had it twice hundred grand yeah have a sniffle for three days I'm not worried about it I would let it rip but anyway it's it's pretty amazing that this is where we are oh but sunny hoss and still won't go to a grocery store because of covid she's a millionaire from sitting on a tv set with people who are just constantly making the American people more ignorant with their commentary and she won't go to a grocery store she has other people she cares so much about covid that she has other people who don't have millions of dollars go do her grocery shopping for her because that's how you show how to stop the virus you know send send the poor people in there to
