    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock your host. Happy Monday. Oh, it's going to be an awesome week. It's going to end with a bang because we're going to be hosting roll call this Saturday here in Nashville, Tennessee. And so I'm so excited about this week. We're going to bring you a great week of shows. And then we're going to get to Friday and Saturday of roll call and really nail this thing and inspire you this entire week. I'm excited about this week. I hope that you are as excited as I am. It's going down this weekend in Nashville, Tennessee. And so I'm just going to try to be at my best all week. The team's going to try to be at its best all week and deliver you great shows. And so we'll start today off with a great topic. I'm going to go directly at Greg Popovich, the San Antonio Spurs coach who sets up an incredibly stupid and did his little rant and we're going to bring Royce White in to help me clown suit Greg Popovich. We're going to ignore John Hadley's insistence. We like the approval rating and bringing the audience in. We're not going to do it at the startup shows. We're going to do it at the end of shows. Not today though because I got this great topic with Popovich. It's going to take some time with Royce and then we're going to bring Steve Kim on to talk some sports and a little bit about Popovich and OBJ signing with the Baltimore Ravens and some other stuff. We got a action packed field show with me, Royce, Steve Kim and you and you. And so I'm so glad you're here and I'm so glad that I have a new sponsor to talk about. And I hate to even call this product a new sponsor because when they brought me this pure health, liver health formula, I was like, are you kidding me? I've been using this stuff for a year and a half. I've been and stuff. I hate to even call that but I've been using this product for a year and a half.

I don't know if all of our live reads are authentic but when you've been using a product for 18 months and then you get to just talk about it, I want to start, you know, just look, because the latest data from the American Heart Association, in the case that adults with fatty liver were three and a half times more likely to have heart failure than those without it.

You couldn't get a more authentic. This stuff is in my cabinets, has been for a solid 18 months. It's been a part of my journey to get healthier and it will remain a part of my journey. And now, you know, I get to pitch the product until they send it to me. I get the same little money as well. So liver health, thank you so much. And I give all of you out there. That you may not be as big as me. But if you're struggling to get the weight off, if you're struggling to cleanse your body. Liver health, health, it'll help you. All right, let's get to our, oh, I'm sorry, before I get to my fire starter and entertain you all and provoke thought. I need you to start slamming that like button right now. I'm telling you, this fire starter is worth 5,000 likes. I need you to get in the comments. I need you to hit the notification. So you're getting alerted when this show starts. If you're listening over Apple and guys, I got to tell you, it's like this Apple audience. I want to set a competition between the Apple audience and the YouTube audience and the Blaze TV audience or however you're consuming the show. But particularly Apple versus YouTube, I want a competition between you guys because the guys over at Apple, they're killing it. They're really helping me fight the algorithm. The people that are spamming us with one star reviews, you guys have stepped up to the plate and started spamming back with five star reviews that we deserve and earn. I need you to continue to do that. I just want to thank you all for those of you that have taken the five seconds it takes, the three seconds it takes to hit that five star review on Apple. Thank you. Please continue to do that. Please continue to write in your reviews. This really helps fight the algorithm. Those of you that enjoy the show over YouTube and always want to get a look at your boy, step up your game. Don't let the Apple guys outwork you and it's not a whole bunch of work we're asking. Just hit that like button. Let's get to 5,000 likes. Let's make that standard on every show so we can start talking about seven and 8,000 likes and let's hit the notifications. When you subscribe, make sure you're getting that notification that the show has started. Let's start building up our live concurrent viewers. Let's continue to do the work to spread this show and get it a bigger and bigger audience. That's your mission as a fearless soldier. My mission is to deliver you great fire starters, get the best out of these contributors and fearless soldiers that work with us. I'll do my job. You guys do yours. And by the way, last thing and I'm going to get to this fire starter. I apologize for it. But I do have to take care of this. I've given Hadley strict instructions. Tomorrow we are bringing on some audience members again to debate me about the approval app. I've told Hadley I believe the woman's name is Teneal. She watches over YouTube. I need to kneel on this show tomorrow Hadley disputing the slander. I think the woman's name was Lauren last week. They tried to say that Royce White and these other guys Delano and Steve Kim, all these guys are the eye candy of the show. We need I think Teneal and there's a Connie. There's a few others that will dispute this fact. I need them on the show for the approval rating after Marl Hadley or no oatmeal at breakfast tomorrow. All right. Let's let's start the show. Let's get the fire started. Sunday afternoon during a rambling eight minute pregame screen, San Antonio Spurs head coach Greg Popovich blasted Republican politicians for their reaction to the Nashville Covenant school massacre. Popovich claimed cowardice cowardice and selfishness explained Republicans resistance to so-called sensible gun control measures. Take a listen. You know, the greed of the gun lobbies and the manufacturers is obvious. We all know that money talks but the cowardice and the selfishness of the legislators who are so scared to death of being primary and losing their job, losing their power, losing their salary, you'd like to get each one of them in a room just one by one and say what's more important to you? If you can vote for some good gun safety laws most of the public agrees to. Would you do that if it saves one kid or is your job and your money so important to you that you would say screw the kid? What's what's in your mind? Popovich then ripped or earlier ripped Josh Holly, Jim Jordan and Lindsey Graham by name. The legendary NBA coach and Texas resident mocked statements from Tennessee Senator Marsha Blackburn and Tennessee Governor Bill Lee after the shooting. Take a listen for yourself. I'm sure that you know people like Josh Holly and the three people I mentioned here in Texas and who mentioned their names are mission positions or you know Lindsey Graham or Jim Jordan whoever of them have kids or nieces or nephews or grandkids. Can they imagine that happening to their or the incapable of knowing what that's like? I mean I mean I I couldn't believe it so I wrote to send out that Senator Marsha Blackburn or comment after the massacre. My office is in contact with federal state and local officials and we stand ready to assist. In what? They're dead. What are you going to assist with? Cleaning up their brains off the wall, wiping the blood off the school room floor. What are you going to assist with? And then there's Governor Lee. You know I'm sorry to go on and on. Bill Lee, I'm closely monitoring the tragic situation. Please join us in prayer. What are you monitoring? They're dead. Children. They're dead. Quite a performance pop put on. The assembled media swallowed his anti-gun, pop aganda without uttering a word of opposition. Popovich takes pride in smugly carrying himself as the smartest man inside any gymnasium. The media obliged. Pop isn't nearly as smart as he thinks. His illogical is just never challenged. He ducks intellectual competition. He's the schoolyard bully who always picks a fight with people half his size and skips school on the days he knows a legit challenger is looking to confront him. It's easy to sound smart and look tough when you know no one is going to swing back. Popovich called the second amendment and defenders of it a myth and a joke a game. He ridiculed Texas Senator Ted Cruz for wanting to double law enforcement personnel at schools. Take a listen. When I picked up my six and 11 year old grandkids at school, I'm here at home. On the way, it goes through my mind that I hope they're going to be okay. In most of you in this room, when we were in school, we worried if Nancy would dance with us on Friday after the football game or something. That was our anxiety. But they're going to cloak all this stuff, you know, the myth of the Second Amendment, the freedom. You know, it's just it's a myth. It's a joke. It's just a game they play. I mean, that's freedom. Is it freedom for kids to go to school and try to socialize and try to learn and be scared to death that they might die that day? With Ted Cruz's effects, because he's going to double the number of cops in the schools. That's what he wants. Well, that'll create a great environment. Is that freedom or is it freedom to have a congressman who can make a postcard with all his family holding rifles, including they are 15 or whatever? Is that cool? Is that like street cred for a Republican? That's freedom. That's more important than protecting the kids. I don't get it. Papa, let me help you out. Do you feel free when you step into an MBA arena to work? And there are as many as 50 law enforcement officers inside the building. Do you feel free? Does Pop feel free when he drives to the arena and passes the 20 to 30 officers working traffic and crowd control? How about the two to six armed security officers who travel with the Spurs everywhere they go? Pop of it doesn't find it strange that the MBA will dump millions upon millions of dollars into protecting basketball players with armed security, but he will balk at providing the same security to innocent children at schools. Is there ever been a mass shooting at an NBA NFL NHL or Major League Baseball game at any major sporting event? Could it be that heightened security prevents mass shootings? Could it be that heightened armed security creates a sense of safety and lessons anxiety? How many armed police officers protect Nick Saban and Bill Belichick after a football game? How many protect Pop of it? Great Pop of it is a joke. He's a great basketball coach, but he's a clown when it comes to discussing important social issues. He's a hypocrite. He claims that cowardice drives the behavior of politicians he disagrees with. Cowardice is what drives Pop of it to avoid respectfully engaging with anyone who disagrees with him. I'm quite confident Ted Cruz, Josh Holly, Marcia Blackburn would have no problem debating the second amendment with Greg Pop of it. I would love to interview Pop of it's about the issue. I'm no expert. I'm just a sports writer. Me and Pop would be equals. I would just be a sports writer interviewing a basketball coach and we can talk about the second amendment. I wouldn't call him names. I'd simply like to challenge him on his narrative about the myth of the second amendment. Why does Pop of his believe he's smarter than the founding fathers? Why are basketball players worthy of more armed security than school children? At one point Pop of it's claimed that people from all across the globe are laughing at America over our gun laws. Maybe that's true, but they're not laughing at the freedom our gun policies provide the average American citizen. Those second amendment backed freedoms are why people all across the globe desire to gain citizenship in America. History has proven that armed citizens will do far less violence and damage than a government that does not fear heavily armed citizens. School shootings are tragic. No one's denying that. Unopposed tyrannical governments slaughter millions including children. Governments always turn tyrannical when they have no fear of their citizens. Career politicians become know-it-alls. They're the smartest person in every room. Greg Popovich reminds me of Joe Biden, a political lifer. Biden is not a doctor or a scientist. He spent 50 plus years in politics. Overnight he became an expert on contagious diseases and COVID. He called COVID a pandemic of the unvaccinated. He predicted massive deaths for the unvaccinated. If American citizens were unarmed, Joe Biden would have sent armed police officers to our homes and forced all of us to take the experimental medical trials produced by big pharma. Is that freedom? That's what I'd love to ask Greg Popovich. I used to be anti-second amendment. I was naive. I didn't believe liberals were capable of imposing their views by force. The last decade has shaken me from that naivety. I've watched Democrats cheerlead Antifa and Black Lives Matter rioters as they burn, looted, and murdered across the country. I'm watching now as Democrats encourage the transgender crowd to impose their worldview by force. None of this is new. Shortly after the Civil War, Democrats launched the KKK to intimidate Republican voters. That's not me making up history. Go check it yourself. That's why the KKK was launched. It was a political strategy to impose Democrat policies on Republicans. Greg Popovich is a typical leftist. He's a bully. He's an elitist. He wants one set of rules for himself and other elites and an entirely different set for people he deems beneath him. He wants the government to take your guns because he's made enough money to pay men to carry his. It's cowardly. That's my fire starter. Greg Popaganda. Royce White, welcome back to the show. Please help me out here. Am I right or wrong about Greg Popovich being a bully and a know-it-all and someone who gets off on propagandizing without any opposition? I don't know if you've met Greg Popovich, know him at all, but I don't like the men. I respect him as a coach, but I don't like or respect him as a political pundit or whatever it is he's trying to do. Your thoughts? With all due respect to the show, Greg Popovich can go f*** himself. And I say that with all due respect because when I spoke out about mental health, there were two major basketball figures that spoke publicly in support of my advocacy for mental health. And in retrospect, in hindsight, their alliance to my position makes me question the entire weaponization of mental health as a topic. And the two were Steve Kerr, when he was an analyst, he wasn't a coach yet, and Greg Popovich. Now, we all know Steve Kerr came from under the stewardship of the coaching tree of Greg Popovich. So they're one and the same. The point is, is this, why will none of these bourgeoisie Negro say the word Uyghur? Why will none of these bourgeoisie Negro say the word China? Why will none of these woke white liberals say the word China? I don't even want to talk about this. Second Amendment argument is so, it's so ridiculous. It's so bogus. It's so illogical. I don't think I could say it any better than you did. I want to shift the real bait and switch that's going on here is why will none of these woke elitists, Metro-Palatin omnisexuals, say the word China? When has Greg Popovich ever been on the record saying the word China? Why is he not asking? Let me just dive into this shit today, because 32 years around the sun today, I'm kind of up to here with the nonsense, especially from people like this, who somehow magically just end up with the biggest platforms to off you skate and postulate about a bunch of bullshit, not by accident. Well, media industrial complex, you and I know it's true. Why is it that the ICC can issue a warrant for the arrest of Vladimir Putin for crimes against humanity and the same United Nations that brought you triple masks, the same United Nations that brought you vaccine mandates, the same United Nations that brought you lockdowns, the same United Nations that brought you all of the mainstream woo-woo that we're all supposed to buy into that's expertise is the same United Nations that said that the Uyghurs are being genocided and rounded up. Why are we so selective in what we choose to listen to even from the United Nations? These things are gaping holes in coherent, logical thought, gaping holes, like these people don't even live in reality. They're not even keeping their own lies in order. The United Nations, the World Health Organization, these are the governing bodies that the Greg Popovich's of the world want to rule your life, but for some reason, when it comes to certain pieces of information, they go totally silent and deaf on it. None of these NBA elites will say the word China, not one of them. Royce, I get your point and agree with you, but you do and I know you know this. Getting the guns away from us is the key to imposing the things that the globalists want to do. And so this is all connected. It's like Greg Popovich is playing his role to serve this larger agenda that you're talking about. He knows to stay away from China. I'll take you one step in further. Yeah, no, it's not only connected. This is the transition of power. This is the conditioning and manipulation through the mainstream media and dopamine and addiction and what do they call it? Living vicariously through the people that you worship and idol, this is the transfer of power from one nation to another in the global governance hegemony. Hope that's not too much for people to follow. The power is getting transferred from the globalist from America to China and everybody like Greg Popovich is in on it. They're okay with it. This is how they got power in China away from the people who put Mao and power in China. Who put the Communist in power in China? The Americans did. The Western European elites did. That's who put Mao in power. Where did where did communism come from? I mean, this stuff is getting to be so out there in the open that a conspiracy theorist dreams are now being answered. A conspiracy theorist dreams are now being being verified about some of these issues. These people are just linking the thing up like an old school van diagram. One, two, three, four. Greg Popovich is either a conscious Marxist or he's a Marxist by proxy and he knows it and he's all good with it. I don't know what he's up to. I don't know if he's got some middle-aged liberal white girlfriend who's who's on the weekends or what he's putting this scam on for. What does it benefit him? This is what I start to ask myself. How much self-doubt and radical guilt and resent and weird identity crisis do you have to have at 70 something years old to be pushing this bullshit narrative? Are they promising you money? Are you getting a pay? I mean, even if you're on the take like an around about way with the NBA, you don't have to go out of your way to shield the way he is. There's plenty of people in the NBA taking money from the NBA and China and the woke media establishment that don't go out of their way to push these narratives. What is this guy up to? Just Greg Popovich can't give himself the second amendment is a what? It's a scam. What? He would gladly send me you every black person. He pretends that he's worried about every kid. What about the two million, what about the million, weirder kids that they just rounded up for being Muslim? What about those kids? They don't matter because they're over in China, right? They don't matter because the CCP builds bridges and airports at a fast pace. They don't matter because white colonialists and Europeans have waged war, race war against people all across the world for hundreds of years. So now the weirder kids don't matter and we all supposed to believe that it has nothing to do with them being Muslim or believing in God. Who does this guy that you gave him too much credit? He gets to act smart in the NBA. This is why they kept people like me out because I couldn't have played on the San Antonio Spurs and allowed this mother to say that kind of shit and not rebutted, not refuted. If I played on the team, let alone another team or coached another team, this is how they've isolated the arena. This is how the anti-competitive ethos of the anti-Jewish elite have isolated the arena of media and allowed Greg Popovich to stand out like he's some type of leader. He's not a leader, he's a shill. He's a shill and he knows it. He hates himself and he hates this country. It's real simple and he doesn't have any care for those kids. That's the only act. That's the only myth. The myth is that these white liberals care about these kids. They don't give a shit about these kids. Did you know that when a news site puts Google ads on its articles, they're also giving Google the ability to suppress any article they don't like and make it virtually impossible for you to find. It's true. Virtually every news site in the country uses Google Ad Exchange, which gives the Big Tech giant incredible power to control what you see. At Blaze Media, we've had enough. We're doing something about it. People on the way that he can work in the state of Texas and say these things without any pushback. There's no one in the media in the state of Texas that's listening to him going, hey, Greg, hold up. It's just real simple because my mind immediately went to us like, hold on, Ted Cruz is an idiot for wanting security at schools, but Greg Popovich and all these coaches walk around with armed security guards circling them everywhere. They're all over the NBA arena. I talk to people that would know. I don't want to out anybody because, again, I know how scared people are of me, but people in the sports world still talk to me or whatever, but I talk to people who would know what standard operating procedure is inside of these arenas. Inside football stadiums and all that other stuff. Greg Pop, he's surrounded by armed police officers, but oh, kids, let's not provide it to them. I'm someone special. I think all of this comes from, and the Greg Popovich has always had it, and we've always tolerated this supreme arrogance and condescending. Literally, it stems from there's a group of people like Popovich who think everybody is stupid except for him and his little small handful of elite friends. That's how you get in the mindset of like, now get these guns away from these people. They don't know what they're doing. They're too stupid. Give us all the power, this handful of smart people. Again, I'm going to be like you and start going off on tangents, but this is why I couldn't stand W.E.B. Du Bois. Once I figured out this talented 10th thing and that there's these elite 10 percent, and for those of you that don't know, W.E.D. Du Bois is like, he was the Ta-Nehisi coach of the 1920s or 30s or whatever. Some Ivy League leaders that they propped up he's better than Booker T. Washington. He started the NAACP or he was the black or the half-American front face of the NAACP. The Jewish folks paid him money to pretend like they were starting a pro-black movement with the NAACP, and the guy talked about there's this little 10 percent of black America that will be the leaders forever. Once I figured out like, well, hold on, man, if I'm not part of that talented 10th. Nobody, I come from nothing. A father didn't graduate high school, factory working mama, a 2.3 GPA from Ball State University. I would never be part of the talented 10th, and so I got these Ivy League Negroes who are supposed to be my leaders, miss me with all of that. And so that's the mentality of all of these elites, and I hear from from Popovich, I hear from Biden, and these are the most dangerous people on the planet. Once you convince yourself, you're the smartest person in every room, you become a danger to everybody in the room, and that's what I see from Popovich. And let's go back to it. And people say, you know, not the political political, or you keep talking political. Well, let's be honest. Okay. Let's be a monolith. You want to talk black people aren't a monolith. Black women are a monolith. 98 percent of black women vote for Greg Popovich. 98 percent of black women vote for Steve Kerr. 98 percent of black women, they vote for Dave Portnoy and what you're the boy's name, O'Keefe Overman. 98 percent of black women voted for Joe Biden. Okay, we're voting for the that we bought into this. This is our modus operandi. And here's what's really scary about it. There's some truth in their position. And I told John and before the show that our side of the movement has to start to clarify our position around these issues, around where they are actually right. Because if we don't, then we stay in this constant back and forth where our position is undermined as well. There's some legitimacy to what there's some legitimacy to the overall spirit of what's coming from the left. There is. And that legitimacy is this, that the colonial European powers took the Lord's name in vain to march around the globe and engage in piracy, slavery and drugs. That's a fact. Nobody can deny that. It's not an indictment of Christ. It's not an indictment of God. It's not an indictment of America's founding documents. It's an indictment of a business model that came from a post a post Renaissance, a post Enlightenment European monarchical society, a monarchical society. It hadn't it's it's not an indictment of Christ. It's not an indictment of God. It's not an indictment of American citizenship. Now they're going to use that narrative, a bunch of globalists, European elites, are going to use that narrative to transfer power to China, an even better slave master. Do these Negroes think that they're going to have a special place in China? Even more importantly, do they do do our Jewish brothers there in Israel think that they're going to have a special place in China? See, we don't understand yet what's happening. This is why Macron in France in the last 48 hours says he's fine with China becoming the regional hegemony. We should all welcome that. We should we should hedge our best at the American dollar doesn't need to be the stabilizing economic force in the whole world. Macron, the French. Now what did I tell you in the beginning where the four heresies of the West, the scientific method, democracy, computer technology, and now artificial intelligence, who invented democracy? Dun, dun, dun, the French. The same democracy that all these Greg Popovich's and the Dit liberals are now hedging their whole political argument on. They're going to use democracy. They're going to use racism. They're going to use equality and environmentalism and justice to transfer power to one of the most tyrannical, godless, unjust, slave taking cultures and regimes and human history. Three million Uyghurs, three million ethnic minorities, Turkish Muslims, rounded up by facial recognition and faith carted off to a reeducation camp through facial recognition. Never saw a day in court. Never saw a day in court. They didn't see a judge. There's no habeas corpus in China. And I'm not being a China hog just for just for the sake of because me and banning our cooler or I support Donald Trump, I could not know them. I was talking about this before I met them. Three million Muslims and you got black men in America saying, yeah, well, there's just as many black men in prison in America. Are you people stupid? There's 1.2 million prisoners in the entire American country, 1.2 million prisoners in this whole country. 40% of them are black. You do the math. That's 400,000 black men in prison. They rounded up 3 million people in six years. And some of the black men who are in prison today actually did the crime. They didn't get sent to jail because they were praying. I mean, what kind of racket are we running on ourselves in this country today? I'm sick of this shit at 32 years old. I'm just sick of it, Jason. I apologize for going off today, but I'm just sick of it. What kind of racket are we running on ourselves? If you tune in tonight to my podcast at 9 p.m., please call me crazy. I go off for about two hours on this. And let me go back for one final thing, Jason, and explain to people what really took place here. Again, we were told the narrative. In 1908, we were told the narrative at the culmination of the Anglo-Russian Convention after Great Britain and the Great Russian Empire had fought wars for territory for hundreds of years. They came together and said, we'll split everything down to middle to bed, Afghanistan, the list goes on and on and on. That was a fight that was waged between the Russians and Great Britain. It's still going down today. And out of that 1908 Convention came to Houghord, John McKinder, the Eurasian world island theory. It's been the prevailing military and geopolitical theory of the last 100 years. And the Chinese learned it from us. Who taught them it? In the 70s, Kissinger, Nixon, and a bunch of other would-be conservatives went over to China and taught them the battle plan. This is the enemy within. We are on the brink of a societal collapse here in America from people who came from America. We have to divorce the crown, Jason. This is what I was saying about annexation versus secession. We have to divorce from these people. We can't let China walk around the world and gain sympathy and collaboration from all the nations that the European monarchy and crown colonized because they did do it. And they are Darwinists and they were racists. That's not our history. Our history is a nation of shop keepers fortified by the Second Amendment and the Right to Bear Arms, something that Popovich enjoys that he's willing to relinquish to go serve under President Xi. And he wants to talk to us about kids like we're stupid and all of his players are willing to play for them and all these NBA players are willing to sit there and buy into that and clap like seals. These people are sellouts and all you black folks out there who watch this show and you criticize Jason or me and say that we're cooling in because we criticize other black folks. If you want to trade your white master for your Chinese master, you are a slave. One of our white founding fathers who you say as racist had one of the most profound takes on citizenship. If you give up your freedom for security, you don't deserve either and you'll have neither. That's where we are now. We're at World with China. They're winning because they're using black people, black mothers and Jewish mothers to tell their sons never fight the status quo. You fight the status quo, you die. You fight the status quo, you get hung. You fight the status quo, you get carted off to a camp. And this is what Greg Popovich is using. And it offends me. Now I understand why when they were calling my agent, they wouldn't let me come to training camp because you can tip when you walk with that energy I got, you can smell it on somebody. He didn't want me anywhere around that team. Like my game, knew I moved a ball, knew I had all the skills, positionless basketball fit right in with San Antonio. He didn't want Negroes like me around. That's who Greg Popovich really is. I want to say a couple of things. There's a couple of different stats about how many people are incarcerated. A high number I see around 2 million. 2020, I'm looking at one study says it's 1.2 million just like he said. But your point remains true that this whole mass incarceration thing is exaggerated and blown out of proportion. And it's a talking point that everybody's picked up and run with. The other thing I think you can speak to as it relates to Popovich, as it relates to why the NBA seems to be the leader of the pro-China anti-America movement is because, and again a lot of people can't understand this because they haven't traveled to China or somebody. But basketball is such a big deal in China. And elite basketball players regardless of color get treated. There's a statue in China of Stefan Marbury. A statue in a major city in China. Statute, he's worshipped there. Stefan Marbury, who after playing in the NBA, went over to China and actually put together a better career in China and is far more revered in China. And so from the blonde James to James Harden to anybody, all these NBA players during the off season, during the summer, they go over to China and pick up a bag of money because they're worshiped, they're gods over there. They're more respected in China than they are in America. And that's why they actually think, yeah, what's the matter with China? When I'm over there, I'm treated as a god. I wish America treated me this way. And they're so selfish that they don't think, well, what about the 5'10\", 230 pound black dude? How's he treated in China? How's the average black person or person of color treated in China who's not a basketball player? And so I just think their minds are warped. Greg Popovich included. I'm sure he's taking some trips over to China with players or with NBA officials who were through David Stern and continued on through item silver, had this dream of landing this monster bag from the Chinese government. That's the carrot that keeps dangled in front of the NBA. One day we're going to give you our TV contract that will blow ESPN and ABC out of the water and blah, blah, blah. But I don't think people understand that Popovich and most of the NBA, they actually authentically believe China is superior to America because of the way they're treated as basketball players. They don't care anything about how a black construction worker, a black police officer, a black doctor won't get treated that way. They probably tell you not to go to a black doctor in China or they maybe wouldn't even allow it. But if you want to come over here and dribble the basketball, we're going to throw rose petals at your feet and as many virgin Chinese girls as you want. And that's why they love China. Absolutely. Yeah, they're taking bags of money. There's no doubt about her. They got a lot of money invested in China. It's a happy marriage. And look, it's a microcosm. That's what I'm saying. It's a microcosm. The Natal Alliance has been shrunk to the little corner of Europe that it sits on. Natal runs around, walks around, puffs his chest out like it's big and bad. Jason Whitlock and all of the working class, moms and dads underwrite the entire NATO defense. Ask Greg Pop. I want one journalist to ask Greg Popovich about the the implications of the Shanghai, the Shanghai cooperation organization. This is the anti-Natal Alliance. Understand this is the Shanghai corporation organization has about every country from Asia committed to it. If you look on a map, the only countries that are not in the cooperation are who? All the NATO countries. They've built an anti-Natal Alliance. And the way they built it was simple. They went to all the nations that the crown had previously colonized and said, would you rather be with the white man or us? And because of the history that did exist, that was never reconciled. They had an irresistible sales pitch. Not only are we not the white slave master you're used to, we'll help you build things. We'll help you be more prosperous in the material way than they ever cared to. And that was true. And America should have fortified Africa. You kill Mo Mar Gaddafi when he said, let's have the United States of Africa. But Africa was amenable to Islam and Christianity. We had brothers there that believed in God. And they seem to be a bit conservative, a bit more conservative than the European Fennokios and France. But they didn't want to fortify Africa. They wanted Africa to be poor. And I'm not some Pan-Africanist. Actually, I hate it when I hear people talk this Pan-African woo-woo. But let's talk strategy. We let Africa stay a poor nation because we were okay siphoning off the coins. And now, now all of a sudden, we want out of Africa. LeBron and everybody else, oh, we're out of Africa. We can't let the white man colonize our African ancestors anymore. But we got NBA Africa. We're going to go mine to talent. We're going to let the CCP take over our colonial spot in Africa. You know what's basic crazy, Jason? The Europeans don't even realize that they're being sold out by their elites, I don't think. The European elites and the American elites are selling out the American and European people to the Chinese based on a race narrative that they engaged in. I love when Mo Mar Gaddafi was at the UN. And I think I'm rambling now. But I love when Mo Mar Gaddafi was at the UN. And you know what he said in 2009? He said, you guys killed the Jews. You burned the Jews. We did it. Adolf Hitler wasn't of Africa or Arab. You making it seem like we hate the Jews. You guys hated the Jews. You killed them. We gave them safe haven. That's the type of stuff they don't want people. That's the stuff Greg Popovich won't even get his beak weight on. You talk Mo Mar. You bring Mo Margadofia to Greg Popovich in an NBA press conference watching shit himself. He won't even touch that type of talk, but he's woke, but he knows what, but he's a smart guy. He's a smart coach. I'll give him that. But outside of coach, he should shut the **** up. Royce, you've broken the fearless cursing record. I think it's a number that will never be topped. You and Will Chamberlain both have unbreakable records, 100 points in a game and 100 curses. On fearless. Thank you, Royce. Godspeed. We've got a bar of soap. We're going to wash Royce's mouth out with soap before his next visit. Royce fired up and I don't blame him for being fired up. Greg Popovich is that annoying and this topic hits Royce in a personal way. I'm not caping up for his curse and we beat most of it out, but fired up Royce White. We're going to be fired up this weekend at roll call. Can't wait for you guys to be here and the fellowship with us. Still time for you to sign up at fearlessarmyrollcall.com.

Still time for you to sign up. Can't wait to see you on Saturday or Friday if you come with a cookout. All right, Steve Kim next. APS, the secular world, the culture uses our imperfection, our sins to shut up. You can't stand on truth. And if all it was was imperfection that eliminated us from standing on truth, this would be a very quiet place. I'm trying to be as loud as I can and as transparent as I can to try to inspire other men. We know you're imperfect. You know you're imperfect. God's grace and mercy mercy gives you the right to stand on his truth and to speak that loudly into the culture. We have to do it. You can look around and say, these guys are taking over everything. They own the CDC, the NIH, they got the president, his transgender surgery for children, colleges today or nothing but leftist indoctrination centers working fully against the Bible. What's the alternative? So you're going to stop fighting today and you're going to let the government raise your kids and you're going to turn around and let them chop off your 12-year-old daughter's breasts and let them sterilize your son and tell them that he's a girl and you're going to let them make the Bible hate speech. You're the last line of defense here because nobody else is going to do it and God's going to walk with you. This is literally worth dying for. I'm telling you so it's like everybody, that's a nice little metaphor. This is it. If there's a hill to die on, this is it. The over the window has been moved right in front of our children's bedrooms and there are all types of people that are trying to climb up in the ladder and every good father should be on his post so that when they peek their head up over the window sill, you kick the ladder back down, let them know you move on to the other house because we're not playing that around here. Sometimes just standing up, just saying no, we're not going to do that. Not my marriage, not my kids, not my family, not my community, not my church, not my citizens. Just declaring that. That's victory enough in prepping his disciples. He tells Peter, he's like, listen, Satan desires to sift you as wheat, but I've prayed for you. We're going to face some ups and downs in life and we're not going to always get it together. But if we stay on the path, if we stay chasing after running after Jesus, running after his way, he's even praying for us. Now, I like it when you pray for me, Jason and TJ. I appreciate that, but to have Jesus pray for me, that makes me feel pretty good. When you make it through this sifting process, go back and strengthen your brothers. So we all have a responsibility as men. Once he's delivered me through this, I have a responsibility to go back and bring some other folk out. You do a roll call to just let people know you're not alone. Be confident in your positions and we're going to inspire you. We're going to eat fellowship. Listen to some music. It's going to be the first of many roll calls that we do. So we're looking for soldiers. We're going to put out our best recruiting pitches for soldiers. All right, before we roll out to us, the Kim, I got to tell you about some great news.

This will be the third one I think I've done. It's a great conversation. I get to say whatever I want without worrying about what YouTube thinks. So ask any question and I'll give you any answer. All right, let's roll out to Los Angeles bringing our guy Steve Kim to Korean Co-Sell. Steve, I know you're probably still on a high from succession last night. I don't. We're going to get there. Be patient. I want to talk about a few other things before we review an awesome episode of succession last night. And we'll start with Greg Popovich popping off for eight straight minutes to the media. No one's questioning a word that he says. The guy's a bully and he says all this stuff. He fires off all this popa ganda because he knows no one's ever going to push back. No one at ESPN. No, he's been getting away with it treating sideline reporters like dopes for 15 years. And so he treats everybody in a condescending fashion. Your thoughts on Greg Popa ganda. Well, pop has become the Keith Oberman of NBA coaches. Look, I get it. Everyone has political leanings. They're allowed to have their opinions. But here's the issue I have with pop. If you really care about this issue and those who are affected by gun violence, he plays in a league that travels to various cities like Chicago, Washington, DC, Memphis, Philadelphia, and LA, which are plagued by this. But it's funny when he's on those cities on road trips, he never brings it up. All of a sudden he just wants to talk basketball. It's all about the X's and Nodes, but he's not talking about gun violence then. Why do you think that is? Huh, it's interesting. But he wants to go out there and grandstand like he's the elder statesman. Look, I feel bad for the NBA beat reporters. And I'll tell you why. They're not even allowed to disagree. They're not everything is so much about access that even if they really did want to counter what he's saying with their own viewpoints, number one, their editors may say, no, no, you're not allowed to do that. Stick to the game or stick to the liberal agenda. Let's be honest about who owns these media companies. And the second thing is a lot of these guys. And again, I don't want to be insensitive here. A lot of them lack balls. They care if pop likes them knowing that he looks at you like a gum on his piece of gum on his shoe. Like I've never I long ago do not care if the people I cover like me or not. I get it. This like Larry Merchant once taught me. This is not a popularity contest. But these guys want to have it nice and easy. They don't want the conflict. They want to love those nice, easy softball questions. And maybe pop of it, you'll actually treat them like a human and pat them on the head. But they actually have a real discussion about a serious issue. They don't have the license. And some of them just don't have the guts. How do you think he would respond? If I were sitting there in the room and said, hey, Greg, there's every time you play an NBA game, there's 30 to 50 police officers inside the building. Your team travels with a security arm security team. Do you find that a contradiction to any? How do you think he would respond to a simple question like that? Well, this is the thing he looked at you and he's like, Oh, the black guy singing. Oh geez, I can't just play bully ball with wippy white guys. Shit. Then I don't know what do you do? If I call it 20 second time out, I mean, probably look over Tim Duncan. There's the other thing about pop. I don't really follow the NBA anymore, but it turns out Tim Duncan was kind of important to his success. They, I didn't know this bird were that bad post the big fundamental. I mean, honestly, they have fallen off a cliff. And I just think to me, Popovich at one point was an all time great coach. Now it turns out without number 21, he's like the Wizard of Oz. He's just a guy pulling levers behind a curtain. And I guess what players matter. But I do find it interesting that a lot of these figures in sports who say that they want to be activists, they want to be spokesman, you're right. But you make a great point in the sense that there's no two way discourse. It's that I get to be the orator. I get to make these proclamations, but there's never any real debate or pushback. That's where I find these things to be so completely inauthentic, because again, yes, there is a gun violence problem. But Greg Popovich is only telling about a sliver of the story within that much bigger picture. And he's only talking about one potential solution. Again, there's all kinds of issues contributing to gun violence, in particular, mental health issues. Won't talk about that. Won't talk about the destruction of family and how that contributes to violence. He's, I love the Keith Obermann analogy. I think it's terrific. Do you think any of this is just coaching strategy in terms of, hey, I'm a hard-a head coach that a lot of the younger black dudes may not like in the NBA? So let me pretend to be this radical, wannabe Malcolm X or wannabe Black Panther. Do you think any of it is just strategy and outreach to his woke players? Well, if it is judging by the last four or five years and the actions of Kawhi Leonard who couldn't get the hell out of there fast enough, Kawhi doesn't even want to remember the Alamo Dome, Alamo Dome or much less Popovich. So if that's the strategy, it's a failing one. It's been miserable. And again, I want to be realistic about this. Those guys on the NBA and the Spurs beat, I feel sorry for them because they're not allowed to counter punch. And then every time Popovich goes down this rabbit hole, I guarantee you that they must be rolling their eyes and going, Oh, God, not this again. They're coming to the point time where someone's going to have to ask them, Wait a minute, what have you done? And then I'd ask them, Well, what about what? What about when Jay Moran? So you're saying we should take away his guns? So that way or something, and we could put them on the spot. Well, actually, what about that kid from Alabama? So it's just about guns to take away his guns and see what he says, and be willing to take the blowback. Because I don't get this. Well, you know, I need Popovich to be nice to me and to explain the pick and roll that bro, he hates you anyway. So that's my view of it, but I'm different. I don't care anymore. I'm at that stage. I am a proud curmudgeon who looks really young with the help of hair dye. So I, but again, this thing is so much about access that I don't believe these guys are actually allowed to push back on Popovich. Let's move to the NFL. Odell Beckham Jr. set out all of last year. He signs a one-year deal with the Baltimore Ravens worth up to $18 million. I don't think Baltimore does this deal unless they think Lamar Jackson is coming back to Baltimore. Do you have that same read? Yeah, I look, I don't know if OBJ would go to Baltimore unless he had an inkling on who his quarterback is. I mean, think about it. This guy, look, I don't mean you differ on him a little bit, but he's had a very accomplished career. He's been a star. He might still have something left in the gas tank. And I would like to believe that he still cares about his legacy in terms of like, hey, I want to put together Hall of Fame run. Well, if you're Odell, you don't go to a team where you're thinking, okay, who's Mike quarterback? I would think, and I'm just, again, this is just an assumption that, hey, me and Lamar Jackson can be the hottest act in town. We can reinvent one another. And if they get that defense right, and traditionally Baltimore has been a pretty good defense, we can make a run. So again, the question is, would OBJ go to a team not knowing what his quarterback situation looked like or if he had an assumption about it? Steve, how many pro balls has OBJ qualified for? Probably one or two. I haven't made that many from what I know three. Okay. Three. Okay. I thought you were going to say like five or six. But again, so it's been since he hadn't been in a pro ball since 2016. Okay. So Jason, you're telling me though, there's probably a lot of receivers that have made more that you don't even remember. Say what you want for better or worse. We're talking about OBJ right now in the beginning of April. That speaks to the type of star he is. Does it not? Steve, how many times has he been first team all pro? How many times has OBJ been first team all pro? I'm with you on that. But he is a star and he has been productive. That hasn't been first team all pro since 2014, his rookie year. So I just, I don't, OBJ, I don't think had a lot of good options. I don't. The guy set out all of last year. He's now 30 or 31 years old. OBJ took the best deal on the table. I don't think it's about the quarterback because let's say OBJ is looking for at 30, 31 years old. Yeah, he's 30 years old. Let's say he's looking for his last big payday, last big score. Is Lamar Jackson the quarterback he wants to bet on that off? I get here to Baltimore and play with Lamar Jackson. I'm going to put up incredible numbers and get my next big contract. Or is he just looking for his fine? Does he look at this as his final payday look around? I was like, well, I'm damn near like Cam Newton. No one really wants me. No one really wants to pay me. I think this is some desperation on OBJ's. Jason, I actually think his best situation from a football perspective is going to a team that has other options. And he's the two or three, much like he was very effective in his role as the complimentary part to Cooper Cup. I know me and you disagree again. I believe he did a pretty good job for the Rams. He fit in well and he made some plays in the playoffs before blowing out his knee in that Super Bowl against Cincinnati. With that said, I just wonder, you know how much these guys love to be a slave to social media and that they love the perception and they love the street cred. Jason, do you think of any part of OBJ that says, you know what? If I came up with Lamar, people are going to love this from a marketing standpoint. We're going to have the buzz that this is going to be the collaboration that is going to be the talk of the talent for at least the first month. Do you think there's any chance that he thought of this, the whole marketing angle of me and Lamar? Yeah, I think he is thinking there could be some buzz. But if I were talking to him, I'd also say this could be a bust that this could end up being a laughing stock issue and a bad look for he and Lamar if it doesn't work. Because trust me, if they get to week seven, week eight, and OBJ is not putting up numbers. It's going to lead to his next big contract. OBJ is going to turn on Lamar. He's going to do things on the field that point a finger. I'm wide open. You know, when Lamar overthrows him, he's going to go through some Beatrix. You know what? This could be in 1995, the hottest free agent name, and again, situations not completely analogous. Guy with the name of Andre Badmoon Horizon was thought to be the missing piece in Cleveland. That thing was a bust and that roof was on fire and I'm not talking about left eye because within a year or two Cleveland said we're moving to Baltimore and you're getting the hell out of here. So yeah, you're right. This could be Andre Horizon 2.0. Steve, I know you hate talking women's basketball, but I'm sorry. Yeah. Oh my God. Caitlin Clark remains in the news. Cheryl Miller, let me see. I had this story called up earlier in the day. Cheryl Miller talked to USA Today yesterday, I believe, and said some things that just blew my mind as it relates to Caitlin Clark, the Iowa bat. Oh boy, it's my computer. The headline, Hall of Famer Cheryl Miller says, Caitlin Clark missed a moment against Angel Reese. And these quotes are, you talk about missing a moment. Her opponent got the best of her that night and all she had to do is acknowledge, all right, all right, you're working my nerves. You need to put it down now, but I see you. I see you. That would have been the end of it. Cheryl Miller has turned Caitlin Clark into the bad guy in this situation and basically say, Caitlin Clark needed to confront and acknowledge this. This racial idolatry that we have going on, to where every situation is not evaluated on the facts and what happened. It's like, oh, I'm team Black, so let me figure out a way to figure out how team White got this right or wrong or got this wrong. This is incredible to me that Cheryl Miller and the lack of self-awareness and I hate, I'm going to go this deep. I don't hate to go this deep, but I don't want to put you in a tub spot, but you're never in a tub spot. You got a Black woman, a Hall of Fame basketball player, someone that used to have a platform or whatever, she's basically arguing, you know what Caitlin Clark needs to do? She needs to handle this the way these young Black kids do. If someone disrespects you, you got to disrespect them back. And you know what, let's hope that it turns violent. Let's hope that we can escalate these situations rather than de-escalate. This is so mind-boggling stupid and so clear. It's like, this whole angel Reese is acting a fool and Cheryl Miller, oh, you missed a moment to act a fool right there with her. It's crazy, but this is the kind of advice we're giving young people. And it's being sold by USA Today and other media outlets that somehow someone else's behavior should determine your behavior and you missed a moment. Idiacy, it's dangerous idiocy, your thoughts. You know, I love Cheryl Miller. The best ball player ever out of Riverside. I'll do respect to Reggie Miller, but I mean, so what's that old phrase? Six and stones may break my bones. I'm going to beat your ass. I don't get this. So Caitlin Clark would have come right back in her face and they start throwing Chingasos and all of a sudden you got Kristi Martin against Layla Ali. You're telling me everyone would have praised it? I don't get it. I mean, look, the winner gets to talk. The loser has to kind of slink away because in an altercation would have happened. Caitlin Clark would not have been praised. But let's say she did something. You know what I've been hilarious? I've been thinking about this as you forced me to talk about this for the 84 show. So Caitlin Clark next year loses again to LSU and and Angel Reese comes over and does that thing. Again, you know what I would do? I start pulling on my hair saying, yeah, at least this is mine. There, there you go. Hey, there you go. Walk away. That's the way you're doing Caitlin. You can take that. It's all you Caitlin. It's all you. I don't get what you see it say. Again, though, the standards and expectations you have for somebody, that's what you think of them. It's it's amazing. You know, Saturday Night Live did a horrible spoof of Angel Reese. Did you see this for any reason? We don't have it. But did you see that they did a spoof on the weekend update of Angel Reese? Had her sad. Did something that wasn't funny? No. Well, that changes 30 years down, Trent. Good girl. No, I didn't. Not only was it not fun, not only was it not funny, but it made basically made Angel Reese sound like a buffoon and a clown. They, you know, if anything, it was ripping Angel Reese. I'm not even sure if they're aware of it, but they made her sound unintelligent, overly aggressive, and stupid. And, you know, maybe that's what they think of her. But I, anyway, somehow, she's the winner of this situation. I get that she won a basketball game. She scored 15 points. We're acting like she scored 40 and hit the game winner in overtime. It's it's a joke. But that's the upside world upside down world we're living in. Speaking of that, last topic, Steve, my new other new topic, Riley Gaines, the University of Kentucky swimmer. She gets a rest speaking at San Francisco State University or whatever. She she gets assaulted speaking at San Francisco State University. We played the video last week. There it is again. And somehow this Jamila Moore, she's some sort of diversity, equity, and inclusion or some some kind of official mid-level administrator at San Francisco State University, and comes out with a statement that basically praises the people who attacked Riley Gaines and criticized Riley not basically praised the other side and then turned around and Riley Gaines criticized the statement. And this Jamila Moore ends up blocking Riley Gaines over Twitter. This, I just don't know how you can see a young woman get assaulted, attacked by that many people, have to barricade herself inside a room for three hours. And then you put out a statement that praises the people that harassed her. This is absolutely incredible. Yeah, I think I got the statement here. Oh, here it is. I don't know if that ain't the right. That ain't the right. Oh, yeah, here it is. Oh, here it is. Yeah. Dear San Francisco State community. Today, San Francisco State finds itself again at the center of a national discussion regarding freedom of speech and expression. Let me begin by saying clearly, the trans community is welcome and belongs at San Francisco State University. Further, our community fiercely believes in unity, connection, care, and compassion. And we value different ideas even when they are not our own. SF State is regularly noted as one of the most diverse campuses in the United States. This is what makes us gators and this is what makes us great. Diversity promotes critical discussions, new understandings, and enriches the academic experience. What a word saddle this is. But we may also find ourselves exposed to divergent views and even views we find personally abhorrent. These encounters have sometimes led to discord, anger, confrontation, and fear. We must meet this moment and unite with a shared value of learning. Thank you to our students who participated peacefully in Thursday evening's event. It took tremendous bravery to stand in a challenging space. I'm proud of you. I'm proud of the moments where we listened and asked insightful questions. I'm also proud of the moments when our students demonstrated the value of free speech and the right to protest peacefully. These issues do not go away. These values are very much at our core. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. Vice President for Student Affairs and Enrollment Management. The world is upside down, Steve. Yeah, I mean, look, I have one bit of advice. If you're going to go to these places, you are entering enemy territory and they're going to be hostile. It's not a level playing field. I would insist or I would hire my own security detail and just say, if they can't come on campus with me, I'm not putting myself in harm's way. Bottom line, get yourself your version of Secret Service, whoever you need to get and protect yourself at all times as they say in boxing, because this is what you're going to get. I've seen too much of it. This is no longer, I would call an anomaly. I think that is expected behavior from that group. They actually don't want this course. I think the biggest problem we have in American society is that people actually don't want to hear others' ideas. They want to force their ideas down your throat. It's no longer just enough to be neutral because then they'll start using terms like your silence is violent. If you're not on our side, you're the enemy. So you theoretically cannot be Switzerland in any of these type of debates. But I think with Riley Games, I think what she's doing is very admirable, but you better be smarter, young lady. You are not safe. So if you want to go out there and be a soldier, you better bring an army. Maybe not a literal one, but at least a figurative one, because at this point, you know what you're facing. So if you get torn to shreds and you did nothing about your own security, I hate to be disguised, but then that's on you now. Harsh words from a harsh man, Steve Kim. Steve, now the moment is here. We have not shared thoughts. You know what I think of last night's episode. I have no idea what you think. Succession was unbelievable last night. Logan Roy is dead. And for much of the episode, I was like, is Logan pulling off a scam? Is he trying to smoke his kids out? And then it became like, oh my God, Logan, this is how Logan Roy is going to die. I thought the acting was superb. I thought the writing was superb. I don't know how the show is going to be without Logan Roy, the dad, the patriarch, the multi-billionaire, the Rupert Murdoch of the show. I don't know how the show is going to be now that he's dead. They kill him off in the third episode of the final season. I would imagine there's seven to ten more episodes left. Your thoughts on last night's episode of succession. Yeah, it's a sad day for the old Kimster. The greatest character in television has passed on. And it's you got him over Tony Soprano. Well, I'm saying currently, but I have a question for you. Has succession now entered the top 10? Is it now off the bubble of Jason Whitlock on the HBO pantheon? Yeah, I think it's I think it's sadly in the top 10. And now competing for a top five spot. We'll see how they pull how they pull this off. Now, as much as I'm disappointed that I'm not going to see the fine work of Brian Cox, so I just find to be a fascinating individual. I've been watching a lot of his interviews. And I'm really happy for him that at his age, he finally got this role that the general public knows because he had a great career going all the way back to his days in England, character, actor, theater. And now he finally has a role that he can hang his hat on. The American public can just look at him and say, F off. We love you. So here's the thing as as disappointed as I am that I'm not going to hear the great one liners and the gruffness of Darth Roy. Look at the title of the show. It's called succession. Now we're going to see who succeeds the father because that's what the basis of the show was. If you go back to season one, I don't know if it's the first episode, but Jason wasn't one of the first scenes where Logan Roy had a stroke and he's out there urinating in his office and it's clear he's kind of in flagging health. He may not be around long. So I actually respect the fact that in the final season that they said, you know what, we're going to do something very inconvenient because life is inconvenient. It's never off of a script. Let's kill off this character that so beloved in his own way and figure out the complicated stuff now that these kids are now fighting for the legacy in the company and control of that corporation. I actually find it to be very fascinating. I think it's fascinating. It's just I did everything centered around Logan. I mean, he was the energy that everyone bounced off of and all the great scenes had something to do with Logan or reacting to Logan. And now I'm sitting there asking who is my second favorite character, now favorite character on the show. And I got to admit it's either Tom or Roman. I can't decide, but that's who I'm kind of rooting for. Tom or Roman, Roman, some sort of sexual pervert with some issues or whatever, but he did love his dad and had a heart. Shev, I can't stand. Shev last night, this is like, should we have the plane circle in the air until we can figure out what we're going to do? Because he has this heart attack and dies on an airplane flying to Sweden. And she said they're thinking before and Roman's like, no, man, we got to get this dude on the ground as soon as possible, have a doctor look at him. And you know, because Roman wouldn't give up on the possibility he was still alive. Tom and Roman are my two favorite characters at this point who I'm rooting for the most. And maybe Greg, the goofball, he might be third. Well, Shev is everything that's wrong with modern day feminism and girl boss. I mean, honestly, yeah. So Tom, you lucked out, bro. Just move on. You can upgrade. I like Roman. I thought it was very interesting or ironic that Roman actually had the last live conversation with this father. And it the juxtaposition of, Hey, son, I love you, but you got to you got to off Jerry. You got to be a good son. And you saw the thing where like he didn't want to do it, but he wanted to be the doodle son. But he also kind of like had that thing with Jerry and Eddie, an uncomfortable series like Jerry, can we talk later? I just thought that was hilarious. But I thought here's what the interesting part is, you saw the human side that no matter how fractured the relationship was between the kids, which includes Connor, that as much as they hated him at times, as fractured as it was. And now incomplete it was, they still love the guy as a father for all his faults. But then it also swerve back as you delve further into the issue of wait a minute, but there's a business component. How do we handle the press release? Who takes over? What about the stock prices? So this melding of personal interest and business realities, I thought they handled that incredibly well. You made me, you just reminded me, I've forgotten all about Connor who went through with the wedding on the day that his father died. And that was kind of set up in the episode before when Connor's just having to go deal with, you know, hey, look, I've never had love. I've learned to live without it. And so here on my biggest day, my dad died. He didn't love me anyway. Let's go through with the wedding. I'm scared to death that this hot young girl that I've basically purchased is going to back out of this deal. It's, I don't know what I, I don't know what I think or feel about Connor. We'll have the rest of life. I'm not going to see you today. Okay. I'm going to leave right now. You might leave later, but I'll at least go through with the wedding at that that was incredibly honest because it really speaks upon what is the foundation of that relationship. I mean, when he asked her, are you just in this for the money? And I'm like, well, that's kind of a rhetorical question. Is it not? But I understand that that's a complicated relationship that maybe even will understand. Look, I'm getting into the danger zone here. Shout out to Kevin Sammles that, you know what, maybe this is my best option that there's still a lot of money. I have fun. I don't have to work a nine to five if I'm part of this family. You know, Connor for all his eccentricities actually really likes me. Sometimes in life, if there's no perfect situation, you have to settle for the best situation and maybe for Willa that is being married to Connor Roy. Who wins? Who do you think comes out on top? Who, who, who takes over way star or maybe no one does and they all end up broke? I don't know. No, I think, you know, I have no idea. I really don't. I think Tom just is looked upon as an outsider and looking at some of the previews. He's gonna get ripped to shreds because he'll look, he's now divorced from shit. So he's not really a part of the family and his protector, as he said, is gone. His power was his alliance with Logan Roy. That is no longer available now. Unfortunately for him, that individual died on an airplane. So I don't think it's gonna be him. I look at Kendall as just being ineffective. I actually kind of think Roman, the last couple of episodes, has shown certain facets of himself as an individual that for all his pecadillos, he's kind of more solid, well-rounded person than the other siblings. But again, he's a weirdo too. So, you know. I could see Roman being the next, but I think they're gonna, what businesses usually die in the hands of the people who inherit that business. When you, when you give your kid, business over to your kids, the failure rate is like astronomical. And again, failure for them looks a lot different than failure for the average person. But yeah, I'm not sure if any of them end up surviving this. And that's why I actually think Tom. Tom or Greg, the most unlikely person, is going to end up on top. But since it's HBO, there'll be, maybe it'll be Kate. Isn't that his girlfriend, his last girlfriend? Maybe she'll end up, since it's HBO. There'll be a woman, Kate. I hope. Now, look, I'm just enjoying the show. At the end of the day, I don't make predictions. I'm just an audience member. But Ryan Cox, I actually, after the show, started binging some of his interviews. And I have to tell you, he's a fascinating guy in real life. He really is. And he says something that resonates with me. And it's something that I believe in. He said as an actor, I don't understand these younger guys who only do one big feature a year and call it a day. He says, to work on your craft and to be better at it, you have to consistently do it. And he has said that there are no big roles or small roles. There's only roles that are longer than others. So this is a man that has perfected his craft. And I'm just looking at other clips of what he's done. And I'm like, man, we missed out on this guy being a star for years. And it comes to an end. It's actually a very sad moment for me as a television audience member. Who's your favorite? And I'll let you go. Who's your favorite all time TV character? Wow, you know, okay. So Logan Roy would be in the Mount Rushmore. I would say the father from the original wonder years played by Dan Loria. I thought he was an everyday father from the 60s that grew up in that era, Mr. Arnold. There's just so much character and substance to that man. And just this facial expression that he kind of like you just say like that must have been a lot of fathers in those days in this changing times of society that he didn't like what was going on, but he still loved his family. And the man had character when times were tough. There's something very admirable about that. And if you've ever had a father, you saw a lot of your own father in Mr. Arnold. So at the top of my head, I would say he's probably my favorite and another one. And I know you and I must agree on this. Coach Ken Reeves. Ken Reeves, I mean, the man blows out as me. His career with the Bulls comes to an end and his old teammate from Boston College. They Reeves, you know, washed up white guy. Come to this inner city. You'll be the only white guy. And all these young black kids are going to hate you, but they'll learn to love you. And the thing I liked about Coach Reeves or Ken Howard, the guy could actually really play basketball outside of Coolidge. No one else could outplay him on Carver. And he could actually bot. He actually bots as a young amateur. And there was that one episode where Salami was getting into smokers because he wasn't getting along with his dad. So Coach Reeves had to be his trainer and he starts hitting the heavy bag. And I'm like, wait a minute, Ken Reeves can actually fight. So that's a Renaissance man. So I would say right there, those three make three of my four Mount Rushmore characters. I gotta figure out the fourth. Holy cow. You don't mention Tony Soprano. You don't mention Omar from the wire or Jimmy McNulty is actually my favorite character from the wire. You don't mention did you ever see the shield Vic Mackie? I've seen some of the games again. You're right. Our characters will be based on the shows that we love. I like the wire. You're a wire fanatic. So you're going to have a different viewpoint that your favorite characters are. You know. All right. Thank you, Steve. Steve doesn't know what he's talking about. Thank you. You can't have a Mount Rushmore of all time to you without Tony Soprano. You can't. And Soprano. I'm being on a stringer bell too. The wire is tough. There was a lot of good Ken. Jimmy McNulty though, I saw myself in Jimmy McNulty. I screw up in a potster. Real police. Anyway, good show. Great show. We'll see you tomorrow. I just want. I want to be. I just want. I want to be. I just want. I want to be. I just want. I want free. I want free. I want free. I want free. I want free. I want free. I want free."
