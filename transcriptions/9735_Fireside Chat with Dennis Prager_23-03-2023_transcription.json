    "text": " Hi everyone, it is clear that Otto is no longer Interested, I mean he may return to interest But I you know what as he's getting older and he's old for a bulldog. I Think he's gets a little more ornery. That's a good term So Snoopy his brother and they really love each other unlike most brothers Is sitting in today snoop's you good doggy Snoop lives to be petted there is no limit to the amount of time he could enjoy it. I think I made a boo boo. I Really believe I made a mistake Or as the current English term goes my bad Should I've never used in my life actually, but anyway here we are Well, look there was a dog in there, and I feel I feel a little better Okay, so I have a very serious opening subject. I'm Dennis Prager. By the way. This is the fireside chat and it is a wonderful wonderful opportunity to just say what's on my mind and then take questions from you from Literally all over the world. I saw today. We have Japan, South Africa, Norway and Brazil That's that's it. That's pretty good I'd like to remind you that the only way Prager you operates is because people donate money and they donate a lot of money Thank God and that's why we have so so much of a reach aside from the quality of our content So this is fundraising month and I'd like you to know that this week Thanks to generous donors whatever you give is tripled Give a hundred dollars is three hundred dollars You give ten thousand dollars. It's thirty thousand dollars. You give five dollars. It's fifteen dollars Okay, we don't only think in terms of ten thousand dollar gifts. I promise you means a lot to us whatever people give It's a it's a statement that you want us to continue and everything we do is free and We're making a difference. So thank you very much. Go to Prager you calm and It's easy to make a donation there. Thank you so I Asked Jordan Peterson a question when we were together a few months ago which Preoccupies me because I think about good and evil moral and moral issues all the time and have it's built in and It's amazing to me how much is built in Just the way it is So I said to him do do do we ever really know somebody? until they're tested And he he didn't he didn't even think he just said no and I was I was really bouncing an idea off him and I wanted you to think about that Do you really know you? until you're tested That's a very interesting question So if we don't know others really until they're tested Then there's no reason to think we would know us until we're tested So here's a there's another question that came up in my Dennis and Julie podcast I I wondered is everybody tested Or does it just it happens? You know Charles Krauthammer who was no longer with us. He was a great American columnist writer commentator and When he was in medical school he had a diving accident He he was a real studly guy and he he dived into a pool at Harvard Medical School it was too shallow and And Crushed the upper part of his mind anyway, he became paralyzed largely from the neck down That's a test How do you react to that? You're a stud one day and then a minute later. You're a quadriplegic. That's a test and by the way he passed with flying colors He graduated with his class. He didn't even fall behind while in the hospital and unable to turn pages in a book So that's an obvious test so the question therefore is Are most of us are all of us? tested Most of us will not have an accident and have such a severe and severely terrible reaction But I I would argue that everyone is tested it may not be as dramatic as becoming a quadriplegic But I would argue that everyone is tested and not just once so Here's a test you all you It'll it'll bother some of you. I'm not saying it to bother any of you but I recognize that it might and And and so be it how you react to the following subject that Has divided American society and will probably divide others as well is a test Can a biological woman compete in women's sports? Because he says that He is a woman or even if you want to say she says she is a woman. It doesn't matter to me. It's a biological male The whole reason there is women's sports and men's sports is that men have a competitive edge if they didn't there wouldn't be two sports Women's tennis men's tennis women's weightlifting men's weightlifting women's basketball men's basketball everything We don't have women's medical exams and men's medical exams because intellectually they have equivalent brains but physically males have an advantage in any physical sport By physical sport. I think you know what I mean Chess, I don't think I wouldn't say it's a sport in any event, but obviously There I don't think that that is divided by men and women I believe that that is a test. What does it test your attitude? The it tests the following first Are you willing to go against the tide to swim against the tide to go against? a public opinion So it's there's no question. It's a test of courage. It takes no courage to say oh Give trans women their rights. Let them Let them swim with Other swimmers or with female swimmers and so on it doesn't take much courage certainly not at this time And certainly not in the United States of America So one test of it is that another test is common sense It violates common sense to argue that men and women should have different teams in Swimming but a for man says he's a woman He's allowed to cross over and compete against women And then as in the case of someone named Leah Thomas at the University of Pennsylvania swim team win all of these Championships and deprive biological women of the chance to be number one and get a scholarship perhaps Or or or something some other form of reward for being number one So it's a test of your Of your courage. It's a test of your common sense Those are two big tests And jk Rowling who's wrote these phenomenally successful author. I think the most Though I think the wealthiest author just from books and living She has taken the road of courage and common sense and she has lost a lot of a lot of support I'll give you an example that I learned again on the dentist and Julie podcast Julie and the last last year graduated from Harvard and She learned just learned from some friends who were still there That there was going to be a Harry Potter Halloween themed party And some of them said no we can't do that because jk Rowling is transphobic The transphobic your transphobe you're a hater of trans people If you simply say there are two sexes and that they're it's fixed She didn't say maltreat anybody, but it doesn't matter just denying that a man can become a woman Or a woman can become a man or even just saying that a trans A woman cannot compete against women in sports and that renders you Outside the circle of acceptability in our culture They actually dropped the halloween harry potter party And to the best of her knowledge. It was virtually unanimous To go against the group takes courage. That's a test And it's not deniable. It's not a test to go along with the majority It's a test to go against the majority by the way you might say yeah, but there are people who go against the majority and they're wrong That is entirely right that could happen But if you are not wrong It is a test To go against the majority Now if you are I mean if you advocate Some terrible thing and you're going against the majority, you know, I I advocate Mass murder and then name a group some ethnic religious or racial groups I That Admittedly you're going against the majority but you You have certainly failed the test of reason and the and the test of decency I only raised this issue to point out that there are tests Of everyone on a regular basis now sometimes Like the era in which we now live The tests are greater than at other times. That is true In easy times there are fewer tests Than in tough or or what I would call a dark time in in which we are living The the real Of the two courage and reason they're both necessary but courage Is the the absolute minimum To pass the tests of life And my I I know I've spoken here about courage I want to remind you of my theory about how you can become courageous It's like my theory on virtually everything else in life Just do it It sounds Counterintuitive If I'm if I'm not courageous I just act courageous. Yes, that's right Everything is how you behave in life. It is not how you feel Everybody thinks that they have good motives. Everybody thinks they have a good heart They're well-intentioned. So you can only judge people By their behavior and and certain behaviors Certainly do take more courage than others so again everyone is tested and in certain eras more than at others but It could be in the micro realm like Charles crown hammer's accident that rendered him quadriplegic Or it could be in the macro or social realm Going against the majority For what is right? Obviously. Okay. Let's go to your questions So I just want to repeat because I wanted to touch your life. I want you to think Are you passing the tests? And you can't deny that they exist if you deny they exist. You're not passing Okay, here we go Hello, mr. Burger. My name is Vintish. I'm 22 and I'm a breaker first member from Brazil Well, it's crystal clear that both in Brazil and the US and perhaps even our round the road one ideology Realizing the conversation holding all the important to impose its own ideas and every sense of them once they may differ So my question is how can the young conservatives who might be willing to pursue careers as their cesic industry For example get to enter those spaces and make their vars heard amongst that CR fin tolerance and censorship Thank you for answering mr. Burger All right, so since it wasn't fully clear because of the transmission and the accent so basically What he's asking is look there. There's all this censorship and the imposing of Of a monopoly ideology. How do you enter spaces of work? For example and make your voice heard amongst all that intolerance and censorship Well, I I look It's it's rare that I Don't know at all if my answer will be helpful I always drive for helpful answers and they usually are I believe Since I don't know the specifics of the case here and I assume it has to do with you I can only say that the answer like everything else it in my in my life And in in hearing all these questions about anything Is do it if the question is how There that is not the question It is whether it is if If you speak up So obviously speak up in social media you speak up in class or you speak up at a meeting That is that is how what did you want to just say how did you get your voice heard? Yes Your voice isn't heard if you don't use it That that's what people have to understand In the western world today far more than gays conservatives are in the closet That's the group most in the closet in the in the whole western world Because they're afraid of what will happen to them if they step out of the closet And I understand that it sometimes that fear is in fact quite valid But that's another example of a test isn't it All right Naomi 15 years old Bremerton Washington, USA Hello mr. Prager, how do you combat your lazy nature? Well, you're clearly a regular listener Because I have noted on the number of occasions that my father Well, I don't know if I noted about my father I just may have noted that I have a lazy nature but my father knew it and He regularly said to me that I'm lazy And I remember his rather difficult line to hear He would say Dennis will let's see walk If he if if he doesn't have to run Will stand if he doesn't have to walk Will sit if he doesn't have to stand and will lie down if he doesn't have to sit Which was a someone to meaning I will admit and I want to talk to you about that in a moment But I remember and this was a gift to my to me my nature has generally been a gift Whenever I was insulted And by the way, that is true to this day The insults didn't bother me as much as the question Is the insult accurate? By the way, that is a great attitude to have if you can do it instead of Getting crushed by the insult You can actually rise eventually By asking is there any merit to what was said Now that that takes a certain type of nature and but if you don't have that nature you could still do it Clearly we are in prisoners of our nature Where let's put it this way. We are in a room, but the door is not locked That's the way I would put human nature it puts you in a certain room But the door isn't locked So i'll tell you what I did to overcome my lazy nature I took upon myself from a very early age, but not high school I took upon myself project after project that I could not avoid I was either contractually bound to it or I was morally bound to it And that's that's it. So again like everything else How did I become unlazy by working hard and i'm still lazy But so what So what Now I I make sure I mean I still give in to that part of my nature Which is part of the reason I think I have so much energy Exactly the same amount today as I had when I was 25 And I know that because I I'm on me I know me at 25. There is no difference internally none In fact, I do much more today than I did at 25 I I will be going in in in in two months. I will be going to europe three times and back to los angeles three times in a month To poland let's see the first time will be It was the which is the for a han- but a hungry then Then germany then poland and back each time And it doesn't doesn't matter to me But anyway, I've taken on I've taken on all these writing assignments in my column every week in my talk show every day And the and this and the dennis and julie podcast. I mean I have a live a lot that I do But I also make sure to fool around so to speak every day and I have so many hobbies that take up my time and That really does give in to my sort of lazy nature by enabling me or forcing me To also take time off every day I think a daily vacation is more important than a two-week vacation once a year So it's a fun subject to to address one day about taking vacations Okay, next Austin in his 20s in austin texas really austin of austin That's cool I watched the father's day episode of prager you kids they went back in time to visit the great dads in history Who the heck picked abraham is one of the best fathers The dude was literally about to murder his own son in the bible His kid could get him a father's day mug that says best dad Except for that time you tried to stab me to death I don't think they thought that one through Okay, so for those of you not familiar and unfortunately plenty of people are not Abraham was about to sacrifice his son Isaac when an angel came from haven and told him not to So In my bible commentary in genesis where this is from I explain at length What is going on in a nutshell? The key to understanding the story is the first sentence of chapter 22 where this takes place and god tested Abraham Perfect theme huh? And that's the Hebrew the Hebrew is tested Perfect who would have known that it would it would be such a perfect thing So he says take take your son whom you love take Isaac and sacrifice him on you know Ahlei well, what is it then put him put him down for sacrifice or raise him for sacrifice so Why why would Abraham say yes And what was the test? So here was the test human sacrifice child sacrifice was almost universal virtually every society We have archaeological evidence for had child sacrifice the first book in history to ban child sacrifice to say that the god of that society was opposed to it was the Hebrew bible The god who said no child sacrifice. It's an abomination Is the god who tested Abraham would you sacrifice your son? Basically god was saying this These pagans with their false gods will sacrifice their child to that false god Would you sacrifice your child to the real god? But remember the first verse of the whole chapter is god tested Abraham God had no intention of his doing it and as far as Abraham was concerned that was completely normal That's what parents did It wasn't like what what are you asking me some weird thing? Because everybody around him did it it would it was like slavery Uh Aristotle one of the great moral thinkers in history thought slavery was completely normal Because in greek society and every other society that's that was the norm Some people were slaves some people were owners just like some people are taught tall and some people are short It was just a given So he didn't even know that what he was doing was wrong Especially since he did believe in the god of the of the world The god who spoke to him. He was the first monotheist That's all it is Are you prepared to sacrifice to the real god? Like the people who believe it was a test of his faith. It's true I want to know if you really know that I am god But as soon as he was ready to sacrifice isak By the way isak didn't complain or at least we have no record of it in in the biblical text He didn't say what what are you doing this for? Maybe I'm sure he wasn't happy but At the same time that was normal for him too And by the way, we're not in very very it's amazing how the whole thing is tying the concept of test And now the concept of of what is being done What's called gender care where where there's this girl that I was just reporting at 13 She had her breasts removed at the kizer permanent date the the american health the group and And they they the girl had mental problems obviously You're you you have mental problems if you think at 13 you're the other sex I mean to deny that Yeah, he's again to enter the realm of the absurd And it's not said as condemnation. It said as in fact as compassion And they they actually removed her breast she is suing kizer permanent day for taking her breasts off after 90 minutes of consultation 90 minutes What she should have had was was a whole group of adults saying look you're a bull you're you're a girl And you don't want to mutilate yourself. You're a girl. You're a girl. You have other issues going on in your life This is not your issue So she's now suing them and she's right to do so But we're not in a good position to condemn child sacrifice when we have all of what we are doing to children today with hormone blockers and and Genden genital castration in the case of boys saying they're girls and breast Removal in the case of healthy girls So it's a little perspective would be very helpful here Okay, anyway, I'm glad you asked it by the way Remember abraham the same abraham argued on behalf of the people of satum and gomorrah He thought it was not just to kill all these people if there were 10 good people there or 20 or 30 or 40 or 50 certainly But he didn't argue when god said to him take your child and sacrifice him because that was a moral norm Okay Boy is not funny. That's what the next question's about David 23 years old new town, kennedykett since 2021 There has been a growing number of states that are banning transgender medical treatment for children under 18 Do you think that's a good idea? Why or why not? And if you think it's a good idea, do you think 18 is the appropriate age? Thank you and god bless You It is amazing if you're 15 years old 16 17 years old you can't smoke a cigarette I don't think it could smoke till 21 right? You can't make the the choice to smoke a cigarette You can't make the choice to have a drink of alcohol You can't enter a bar and be served a a drink if you're under 18 and in some states under 21 But you can decide I I want my testicles cut off I I want my breasts cut off that you can decide I would much sooner have kids decide on drinking than on having their bodies permanently changed like that I'll have some hormone blockers, please, but of course I I can't I can't have a beer That's a sick society. That's all it is. It's sick and we are This is very distressing for me to say this about my beloved america It's sick You can't have a beer, but you could have a hormone blocker That's that's really something This is hilarious We've have one elderly person asking a question It's one line Byron 75 mccalaney, florida. Did you ever sing in a choir? Well, in fact, I did not God gave me a really fine speaking voice And he basically limited it to speaking I can sing. I mean I could I can carry a tune. I I I I sing on key But nobody has really ever asked me to join a choir The truth the truth is I'm not sure I would be a very good candidate aside from my voice I would horse around too much in my section I I would probably like tap a guy on a shoulder and he wouldn't know who tapped him And maybe looking around while he's supposed to be singing Do you ever do that that thing you we attacked the girls don't do that That's Did you do that? Yeah, you given me thumbs up her dad is here and and uh I had more fun doing that in high school than almost anything else Uh, what's our what's our timing? We're there. All right, so why don't we got Norway and South Africa and Kansas coming up Good Well, this was a very Lively and good one What number is this? 181 181 No, aren't we two something Oh my god See that was a test. That's right. That was a test And I almost flunked just for the record 181 that sounds a bit odd 281 is very different from 181 that's two years more 281 we should do something on the 300th Yes, I I think I should interview uh auto Yes, I think that would be far more maybe a maybe I'll have a cigar But they don't allow that but if what if I had hormone blockers Yeah Do you know folks I began I don't know the book the first 30 I smoked a cigar Yeah, and then and then youtube said we won't we won't have you facebook Yeah, we can't have you on this is this it's really sick They can't watch an adult smoke a cigar, but they can take hormone blockers Just remember my old rule You want to know who's telling the truth and who isn't the ones who censor are almost always the ones who aren't telling the truth The truth tellers allowed to send the lawyers don't it's an important little rule Okay, everyone have a wonderful week till the next time I'm Dennis Prager.
