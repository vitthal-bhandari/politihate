uh... also joe biden he does not appear to be well i feel like there's a new video every day that surfaces showing something is just not right and illanomar new allegations about her personal life and an affair a lot to come well welcome to the news and why it matters i am at seragon solace uh... joined today by mister supergear who is back from vacation yes thank you stay patient was really fun very exciting yeah very excited uh... and then that conservative commentator great stenchfield thank you for being here and here erin we've got you double duty and colon from the place dot com thank you for being here uh... before we get into the conversation i want to thank our sponsor american financing so uh... american financing i like to say i don't know why they haven't used this as their primary motto is that there to smart there's smart enough not to do business with supergear i don't know why it's not all over their marketing material yes i mean look it's a a lot of people do brag about not being friends with me and not interacted with me so it would be a good a good idea for them to do uh... but now they have to put the trigger on that one i did i did actually uh... do business with them uh... and they help me go through a bunch of loan options and has a really good ones uh... but they actually were some you know uh... they had enough integrity to be able to say hey you know what uh... you're more on for wanting to do this loan you do somebody else they didn't want to take my money for any reason uh... so i thought it was a good uh... a good way of like looking at it like they walked me through every little piece of it they said this is why we think this would be a better loan for you but you can go ahead and go with that one by the way i went with the they was already been sold to like three other companies i don't even know where i don't know what i'm paying anymore and they're probably right is probably what i would say i think uh... and they are salary based professionals they're not commission based so like stu said they're not in it for you know a kickback or for what's best for them they really are in it for you and they want to get you in the best position the best uh... the best deal possible for you and your family and your situation so you can go to american financing dot net you've got a refi you've got uh... new home to purchase whatever the case may be american financing dot net or you can call eight hundred nine zero six two four four zero uh... interesting at newsday gentleman there was a uh... the ninth circuit court of appeals ruled on friday that the state of ohio has to pay for a male to female gender reassignment surgery of an inmate who is in prison for sexually abusing a fifteen-year-old boy uh... the governor governor brad little has said taxpayer money cannot go uh... to pay for the surgery but it does pose an interesting question stew um... their reasoning was that to not do this would be cruel and unusual punishment and i getting that right i mean it's bizarre argument right i mean that when you go to prison you forfeit a lot of rights a lot of months of much more fundamental than being you know getting a gender reassignment surgery things like walking around and going out to dinner and all the things that you you abandoned because you've committed a crime like sexual assault uh... we act as if that has to be you know given to every inmate it doesn't right i mean we we were already locking them behind bars we do not have to give them every freedom that's one of the freedoms i would say you lose uh... as a you know look you can decide if you want to do this you have surgery on yourself that's fine uh... the crazy part about this is we have a country that has this idea that the government should be doing these things for for people in any circumstance there's never a circumstance in which the government should pay for gender assignment surgery remember it's not the government pay for me in the end of the government right it's it's all of us that are paying for it i really don't want to pay for a sex offender have gender reassignment surgery what about cruel and unusual punishment take about the fifteen-year-old boys actually assaulted that's cruel and unusual punishment i think one of the big things about it is that the doctors that have been evaluating this person said it's not medically necessary so the fact that they would pay twenty to thirty thousand dollars for something that's not medically necessary yet it's not not cruel and usual punishment to not give somebody a surgery that's not gonna save their life or something like that it's just and it's never medically necessary can we point that out it is never is is anyone surprised it comes out of the ninth circuit now right circus right coms to decisions it never is medically necessary but this day and age it is kind of surprising that they didn't find a doctor who would come in and say yes this this guy has to get this or else he just cannot live a normal life i'm sure they'll find someone gets a supreme court they'll dig that person up uh... sure they'll be somebody on msnbc tonight the kids you're probably right i i i i i think that the larger problem here beyond just the absurdity of this case is that when we have we are a country that is increasingly becoming a group of people who think when we have a problem that's difficult we better go to the government to sort it out for us uh... because they're the ones you know look they have to cover health care when that gets difficult we have to pay after cover that when we have housing difficulties well they have to cover that we know when it's when it's some it like they're always the end-decider we look at them as sort of a real almost like a religious leader uh... please tell us which direction we're supposed to go with all these difficult choices that's not the way it's supposed to be at least in america what about like tough on crime republicans get weak on crime we see this over and over again for some reason like afraid to be tough on crime now we have this coddle the criminal mentality what if you paid for your own gender reassignment surgery and you pay tens of thousands of dollars to get that done and then you find out that you could sexually assaulted some kid go to prison they'll pay for it for you and i mean come on right so that you're cutting a good deal for them yes crime it's like it's not the incentive that you were the punishment that's a great point and also if i if my money is going to be going to someone's plastic surgery it should be mine right i think i should be able to do that first does that open the door for that for somebody to make a claim like that based on some sort of diagnosis that's not very nailed down like gender dysphoria that's something that there's a lot of disagreement on so what else can somebody come into prison and say i've got this condition i've got this mental i identify with larger breasts you might have a legal case in the night and i want anchor man hair i mean it is it does bring up a an interesting point to that you touched on is that it's like we forget that the in the constitution um it doesn't say the right to life liberty the pursuit of happiness uh... taxpayers to pay for my abortions taxpayers to pay for my gender reassignment surgeries taxpayers to pay for all the things that i want this is the problem with government gets too big we wind up relying on it for everything right like the point here is that if you want to do these things to yourself you can do them to yourself we live in a country where that's available uh... but is your responsibility i mean there's never an elective surgery that should ever happen in prison right like that but even if the greatest surgery in the universe that we all love you know i mean that that just shouldn't be part of your prison experience right if there's a medical thing to keep you alive obviously we want to treat prisoners even though they may have done something horrible still treat them uh... humanely but the idea that you're getting the year essentially improving your body uh... in while you're in prison in your own eyes that is you're very much in your own eyes and probably not an anyone else's eyes uh... you know like that is although she looks beautiful i will say that's does he really are you sorry he looks beautiful and i can understand why he wants the surgery let's say that he doesn't look very good it's a going from male to female does not look very feminine currently looks like on the giant actually he thought i was a true people we play the clip of princess bride of under the giant this morning i was like that why that's in my head but i think you're right that's not not a bit moving on uh... joe biden he has just had missed up after a step after a step in this campaign uh... he was talking about his health care program that he wants to offer and i feel like we're getting to the point where it's actually it hurts to watch it's really tough uh... to watch him stumble let's take a look and so anybody who is in a position where they're on a uh... uh... on medicaid they automatically be enrolled no cost in addition to that we also have a met mica's in the control drug prices you know the it's not what we're no longer using chemical based things all this thing that it would be cancers and other issues related immune system or bi-oriented they're very expensive and we should set up a system aside proposed which we are will for if i'm elected president that allows the folks at h h and then the the folks that health and uh... the the health department in the united states h h s to be able to go out and bring a beginner outside experts and make a judgment when there's a patent being sought by a drug company what that patent what what what it's worth what what the range is set that number and then you're not able to raise that drug price unless beyond the cost of inflation and health care uh... at what point still do we stop calling these gaps and start being a little bit concerned yeah i mean joe biden as a candidate i think always been fun and never like this policies but he's been fun this is starting to feel sad like it doesn't you know there's a it we talked about this i think before on the show in that like brock obama's first debate with mit romney he came out rusty i would say like i mean he was never a great debater but like he would he did he felt like he just hadn't done it in such a long time needed to like stretches legs a little bit and then he was better in the second and third debates you wondered if that was the same thing with byden he comes out he has doesn't done this in a while is he gonna shake the rust off does not seem to be happening every day there's a new one of these clips and his style is not conducive to a guy who's losing it mentally he said you know rapid fire speaker he's off the cuff he tries to make it sound conno you know sort of conversational and i feel like he's a he there's just those little gaps and and what's what was you know whatever whatever's firing in the brain isn't connecting and now if you're a slow deliberate speaker you're maybe a person who does a lot of prompter you might be able to get away with that joe biden doesn't be a part of his ability is to be able to kind of fire off the off the cuff and sound conno conversational that seems to be going away and you know the biggest thing here is not necessarily what that means for his presidency it's not even what it means for his ability to beat uh... to to be other democrats uh... or policies it's about when this becomes a big enough issue that democrat voters say crap he's gonna lose to trump if we get him this nomination that that's when he tanks there's been one poll out that's kind of supported that that it might be happening only one poll it's you know there's been a couple of others on the side that of sort of supported this idea that he's falling right now uh... but when people see these things day after day after day you start to lose confidence that he is electable because his entire campaign is run off the idea that he's the most electable with all due respect to people over the age of eighty and i've got tons of friends that i played gin rummy with every weekend that are over the age of eighty but what do the democrats think when you offer up a host of candidates that are pushing eighty and above what do you think you're in a game to talk about the rusted you don't get the rest off of a m c eagle that's basically what joe biden is right now yeah and there's this myth i think when the campaign started before he really started getting out that he had the second win that was going to come after that first debate he was going to just rejuvenate is going to focus and you're going to see the old joe from twenty twelve and before who is you know vibrant he was fiery he had that energy and it's clear he just doesn't have it and you know i look at videos like the one we just saw you think they would kind of edit that to cover him or maybe say hey joe you want to run that again but it seems like it's people are not even able to protect him from the appearance that he's not competent and how long is he going to be able to last in the campaign like that it makes me wonder uh... you know his wife did was not very enthusiastic about people backing him and even said you know maybe there are better candidates in joe uh... i wonder if it yet i wonder if that was part of it is that she sees that this is this is not going to be good for him possible i mean i think you know in that clip he just looks tired and you know uh... sale you want about donald trump a lot of people criticize because he's not a young guy either forget he's what seventy six is he but donald trump always looks like he has energy donald trump always seems like he is the same person he doesn't seem like he's at like he's at like he i mean i will always always always impressed going back to even two thousand sixteen that i was running all over freaking aia we did that life for like one weekend and i want to kill myself it was like i mean just going around like i you know it a bus all over the state for hours and hours saying the same speech over and over again it's not fun uh... and he survived it well uh... we had a reporter who went to aia and and saw i think eleven of the candidates in three days uh... and saw joe biden three times three different speeches and he said to the times he came out he was completely fine he seemed totally normal one time he came out it looked like he was just gonna pass out he was so tired and this is you know it seems like life is taking its toll here so remember they kinda went through this with hillary clinton during her campaign the problem with that was she was the candidate now they have a choice to make they cannot make that mistake unless they go with the burning or is it with warren uh... personally as a trump guy i'd rather go against burning or is it with warren any day of the week then i would go against even a gas uh... makes me so scared it's just it's i understand your point is that donald trump would have theoretically have a better uh... chance of winning against them because they're so crazy but if they did pull it off or i'm terrified for the time is propagating i have great faith in the american people have always have some disappoint me but i cannot see america electing crazy burny sanders or polka hantas into the oval office and i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i i agree with you uh... that it they would be worse you know worse candidates go up against all trump i mean is with warren is like grown in a lab to lose to donald trump like the perfect candidate to lose the trump but like it is a high risk thing and if something out of it out of control of the president like something like the economy i mean look what happened to mccain essentially in 2008 right the the economy collapses in october two thousand eight there's no way i don't care how good of a candidate the republicans had that time they were gonna lose the same thing something or something similar happens in you know august or you know september of two thousand twenty it doesn't matter who donald trump is he's gonna lose if the economy tanks like that the american people are just based on that you know they're gonna pick whoever is on the other side and that's what makes me risk scared about someone like sanders you know you know because if they're there if it's a one-on-one battle anything can happen i'll make an admission to you i pulled out about fifty percent of our my stock holdings after watching two weeks of the news media absolutely go on an all-out barrage that we're going into a recession as a business owner with no signs of a recession whatsoever recession recession recession recession they control so much information they could push this country into a recession for the sole reason to what take out donald trump these reporters and anchors don't get a rat's ass about any of us they don't care about the economy they all all they want is a new president yeah all right back in a minute top and certainly really i mean i i agree um if the media's done before we jump back into the conversation i want to thank our sponsor relief factor so if you are one of the millions of americans who you just walk around all day in pain and you just think hey this is life now i'm just always going to be in constant pain what is it's too like sixty six percent of people who are in pain here yeah then never yeah that's the way it is and i'm never going to get rid of it so this is my life now so depressing yeah it is really depressing um and you know you don't it doesn't have to be that way i mean there are things you can try a lot of people have tried you know bits and pieces of little things maybe a medication or some eating regimen that didn't work out um you know why not try relief factor it's 1995 you get a couple weeks um what is it three weeks yeah three week quick start program and if it works for you great it works for i think 70 percent of people so why not give that a shot it works for me i had a car wreck and i had a bunch of pernated protruding discs in my spine yeah that's not fun it was really painful and i tried all these other solutions nothing worked even my other hippie methods like acupuncture that didn't work either just relief factor it's a hundred percent drug free uh and you can go to relief factor dot com get that three week quick start pack for 1995 or you can call 800 500 8384 while we're on the topic of the democratic presidential candidates Beto our good friend Robert Francis good friend of the show i know you watch every night i know hello Robert uh he um he had an interesting comment i guess it's not so interesting because it's kind of par for the course with democrats but he was asked if he would support late-term abortion and here's what he had to say i was born september 8 1989 and i want to know if you think on september 7th 1989 my life had no value of course i don't think that and of course i'm glad that you're here but you you um referenced my answer in in Ohio and it remains the same this is a decision that neither you nor i nor the united states government should be making that's a decision for the woman to make wait i mean of course i'm not saying that but yes that's what i'm saying i mean i guess you could theoretically make an argument that Beto shouldn't be making that decision or the government should be making that decision but he's the guy he's the guy you're talking about like he's either alive or dead based on this decision seems like decision maybe he should have some involvement and and while i know it's difficult to get uh you know the answer to a question from a baby uh it might be something that we put into the law that would protect their life liberty and pursuit of happiness or maybe air on the side of this baby probably would prefer to be alive yeah like the the democrats act as if they well we don't know we can't ask him so i think so we're gonna send them to kill yeah this makes me so upset yeah because when i try to talk to young people about pro-choice verse being anti-abortion which is where i stand because i believe that life begins a conception what i try to do is back them down okay well it's six months do you do you think it's like yes all right well it at three months do you think and then it starts to get a little shaky as you do earlier you get at least that's having an argument and discussion and i can move them to why i believe life begins a conception but nobody with common sense thinks that life doesn't begin until you're out of the womb and one day before the difference between a mother killing her child in a bathtub of postpartum depression or whatever it may be to one day earlier she's not a murderer compared to that she is it's incredible it's incredible the weird part about that question is it wasn't a medical context you know usually this conversation happens with well to save the life of the mother or because the baby needs to get out or is not viable we're talking about a viable fetus one day before birth and betto is saying well the woman can choose whether or not that baby lives or not i mean that that's crazy to me that seems like the the most extreme that's as extreme as it can get yeah i mean there is there is no policy no policy held by republicans that is as insane as an extreme as they are an abortion and and unpopular by the way i mean third term third term abortions are 87 to 13 or 84 to 13 as far as unpopularity uh the overwhelming majority of democrats disagree with the position that these candidates are staking out on this issue and you know to ask do you be able to say to someone who says it was my life worth anything on september 7 and you say well no of course it is but uh she should be able to kill you that's not a that's not a rational logic literally saying your life had value but your mother could have just chosen to but your but but if your your mother's convenience is more important right that's more of a right like value here mother's convenience your life here basically so four hours later after you're out of the womb and have been born i would like someone asked betto erork is it okay for then your mother to murder you then to suffocate you with a pillow to throw you in a dumpster is that okay and for some reason it's not to be no what they know exactly why would you say no why it's most shocking when you see people who have children and who have seen that process through to be able to hold a stance like that i mean just for me personally i can't imagine looking at somebody right up to the point of birth and saying that's not a life until it comes out i mean anybody who has had children kind of sees how the life develops through that time yeah well i mean and grant to your point it is it's it's like i wish we were having the conversation on whether or not life begins at conception and that was a conversation we were having but when the conversation is every single presidential candidate in the democrat party is advocating for late-term abortion you're talking about a fully formed viable fetus that could live outside the womb that's terrifying it's terrifying and i'll go back to studies that have shown at how many months into the pregnancy that a fetus can start to feel pain you talk about those things you can go at these arguments with a scientific approach to try to bring people in just to get them to at least see why we stand where we stand yeah but on this when you think and this shows how far apart conservatives and liberal socialists are when it comes to common sense that i would think that this would be the most simple form of common sense that you cannot murder a baby the day before it's born that somehow we don't see eye to eye on that shows you the divide here is crazy and i feel very very sorry for people that can't see it yeah that's your last word and when you go down and you do what you're talking about backing people into it because if you say what can we kill them a minute after birth everyone's going to say no to that and what about a minute before well most people are going to say no to that keep backing them up until you find that time at some point they're making a decision where one minute it's murder and the minute before it's completely fine in a human right that's obviously insane right like we all know that that's completely nuts and so i think when people actually spend the time to think about it they usually come out on the right side of it but it's hard to get people to think about it it's uncomfortable and it's one of those things we just rather just ignore and hope it goes away well it's not going to go away unless we deal with it yeah all right back in a minute they are the party of science so coming up in over time you're not going to want to miss this illa no mar is listed in the divorce filings as being a mistress so we're gonna have to i feel like we need glen here to do a chalkboard just to remind us of all of her personal history with the husband and then not the husband and then the husband again and it's crazy so if you do not have a blaze tv

subscribers not a subscriber start your free trial at blaze tv.com the New York Times of all places is a reporting along with several other outlets that Ilana Mar is involved in a little bit of a love triangle there were divorce filings that state that dr Beth jordan minut she says that her husband Tim minut told her in april that he is having an affair with Ilana Mar and that he loves her he made a shocking declaration of love and ditched his wife and she by the way she said okay people make mistakes that's fine we can work on our marriage and he was like no i don't want to do that i love my girl elan and then sticking with elan yeah peace out um now he is a democrat consultant and her campaign did pay him i think i read it's not in here but i think i read uh a hundred thousand dollars somewhere in that range um still she seems to not be able to keep her personal life just normal stunningly doesn't seem like a very stable individual yeah overall uh and no it's a real it's a real shocker i mean obviously i don't care about her personal life right like i don't think any of us do um you know i don't i can't imagine what would be like oh i can't wait to get with ilana mar like that does not i just don't get it somebody cut that so we can yeah i just that that one just seems like kind of a bizarre thing to me i mean who knows i will say like divorce you know people accuse people of all sorts of things and divorcing you know agreements you never know what's true who knows if this is true or not but it is like the tenth different story on this front we've heard in just the past few months and this is not the if i'm understanding is this is not the same guy that they just said she moved in with no when she left the old guy no which was not the guy not the first what guy but people was the first guy but not the second the faith marriage or the legal marriage right exactly i don't know let me i okay i have it somewhere that it it's how you have to we need a chalkboard yes we need a chalkboard so she married the one guy and had a kid right with the one guy and then divorced him to marry the guy who is allegedly her brother right look at me and any of the that for the green card then divorced her alleged brother and remarried the first guy and then she cheated on him with the other with the other guy that she moved in with and now she's with this consultant how do we know this is not just professional how do we know he just didn't want to commit his whole life to consulting for Elana Mar where i'm assuming that it's an affair i'm just giving the benefit of the doubt i'm just saying i don't know that's what you're saying i don't know i mean look i it is a there's not believe me i'm not playing it i mean i think there's always a chance when you have a large public figure and it's some random accusation but if they gave a hundred thousand dollars to this guy from the campaign there's obviously some relationship there so it's not completely uh to you know to be doubted as usually does he ever get hired again as a guy to give advice after having an affair with well he could say a long i don't want a bad decision i mean his advice would be don't have an affair with Elana he would have a great experience in this area well you know it's what's really interesting to me is that her religion and her religious values and where she comes from would really really really frown upon these actions yeah my understanding of is uh is islamic traditions would not allow for many of the things she does on a daily basis all the time completely disregarding it yeah it doesn't it's it's a very not many traditions do allow not much she does no it may be a great point that's a great point uh moving on to Stu's favorite musical artist taylor swift oh yes she is my favorite musical artist touch like new album was it okay i just can't wait to hear it for the first time um i am amazed but the funny thing about this is like she she seems to like be jumping into this political sphere i guess because she she did get criticism for a while for not doing it so now she's like jumping into it and i don't think she like just realizes how bad she is at it you know she seems like a person who you know this album i know i've heard i have heard bits and pieces of it and it does seem like she's like acquired all of the things people complained about on the liberal blogs in 2003 just to bring them into songs like they're these really innovative ideas like i think black people and white people should be allowed to date all right yeah we're we're kind of all there uh just so you're aware um it's very strange like she's like they're outdated weird claims and some of them are just so bizarre she has a song on the album that my wife came back she's like oh my god listen to this song is it a man yes taylor swift telling that she thinks she could get really far in life if she was just a man yeah like i do you realize you're like the most powerful person in the world like you're making like a million dollars a second how could you possibly have a better life than you have and she's all this this world is always crushing her and all these terrible things she has to deal with like you're like legitimately one of the most famous people in the world you have an unlimited supply of money like you you're basically fed yeah okay boy you got a giver that she's got a great ball she's definitely a talented entertainer i mean but i you know she i just don't get like this sort of again we've talked about how many times we talked about victim hood it's once again it's the same thing she's like embrace this idea that somehow even she is a victim like how can she possibly be affected don't you think she's probably getting good feedback on this from her side of the street and so that's why it seems so terrible to us but you read the articles coming from left-leaning sites and taylor swift is so brave taylor swift is advocating for equal rights and it's like well i can't wait to see how this album does compared to previous albums i will not see that ever well first i've listened to it i don't think it's as good anyway um trying not to be biased about her inserting her political opinion in every single song but i think that there are a lot of people myself included i mean i loved taylor swift and now i listen to this and i'm like this is garbage all it's never makes music better like nobody goes to their yeah she disappointed me when she left country yeah and that was it for me and taylor swift it's a very predictable progression from that moment though right i mean like you know it's like it goes from like i want to you know make some great music for the people at least down or down to earth people that i love to i want to be famous then like you know like she you know like she's on stage with Kanye way just like the whole thing spirals out of control very quickly it goes to something we've talked about before where if you say nothing and do nothing in the face of political issues you get pointed out like you're complicit in everything bad that's happened yeah i think that happened to her to where people said you've got to start speaking out about xyz even though she doesn't know probably much about any of it or care but she just put in that motion ask though for one of these artists to read an article about the thing they're talking about one just one it's two you know what it is it's two it's honestly like i know she's going to talk about pay equality can you at least learn the arguments about it you don't have to agree with a conservative one but at least know what it is and they don't even know what it is yeah she uh so she won a video music award last night who knew that the video music awards were still around still alive and kicking it and she she won it for what is it you need to calm down her single you need to calm down which is i think one of the lyrics was like it's okay to be gay like what year is it we know we know that we're on board uh and then those pilgrims are going to be upset you here's what she had to say during her acceptance speech at the end of this video there was a petition and there still is a petition for the equality act which basically just says we all deserve equal rights under the law and physically there's no new watch to physically because it now has half a million signatures which did i have a bit of a punch you know it's just five times the amount that it would need to warrant a response from the White House oh how powerful you're taking on Donald Trump i'll breathe basically says i mean how boring is this it's like the same thing you know again i love the idea that this uh the petition it's a great another example but we talked about right at the beginning it's like everyone now has to look to the government look at her she's the one out more most powerful people in in all of entertainment one of the most famous people in the world and here she is begging the president to respond to a bunch of words on a piece of paper a bunch of signatures she clearly didn't read anything but the title of the equal rights amendment that's why basically equal rights we're as far as it goes uh all right before we go joe wall uh donald trump's primary challenger joe wall she may be today regretting his decision to challenge donald trump um a lot of oh i don't know offensive tweets and um interviews being brought up now surfacing because he has announced his candidacy um he had an interesting take on i believe it was msnbc watch i wouldn't call myself a racist but i would say john i've said racist things on twitter there's no doubt about it um and an apology is not enough when i said barak obama was a muslim that was a horrible thing to say and i said it because i i was so disgusted with obama's policy toward israel that i went a bad ugly stuff again context i probably sent out 40 000 tweets in the last six years no excuse you and i could sit down and find two to three hundred that you'd say waltz what were you thinking and all i can do is own them and explain them and apologize as gents sincerely as i can for those that deserve an apology i'll just say i think you got a lot of work to do on trying to make a distinction between somehow convincing people i'm not a racist but i said a lot of racist stuff in public but but again that's not fair because we we have a short show you said i said the n-word in a tweet i did and i did to make a point because they wanted to change the name of the washington red skin so they said red skins is the new n-word that's bs the red skins doesn't equate with the n-word the n-word has a unique ugly history in this country to make that point i wrote down the n-word in a tweet to make the point that it's not nearly what the word red skins is uh he also went on to to say that everyone has a little bit of racism in us i will say his last point is completely legitimate about the red skins like i mean i i just say i mean you have to write down the word and make the point not a good idea uh to do that but i mean it is uh it is red skins is not the n-word i think it can be all be i have i have bias in me i will say this publicly and it's just stupidity i can't stand stupidity and joe wall is stupid for what he's doing and then the audacity to go on msnbc the enemy network of conservatives that that's where you're going to make your case to become president of the united states as a republican i don't think so how many times have we seen this people who take these sudden out of nowhere anti-trumstances where they go seeing in msnbc they're not worried about serving republicans they're worried about just getting on tv yeah i mean first of all was was he the most pro-trump guy in america during 2016 i mean he was a tweet that he wrote that said if trump i'm voting for trump and if trump doesn't win uh the day after the election i'm grabbing my musket are you in yeah like whoa this guy said the weirdest transition like it's like you know there's a decent amount of republicans back in 2015 and 2016 who are not excited about donald trump i was one of them um however like there's not a lot of people who went the other way he's gone like he went from like super pro trump to super anti-trump i mean i don't know if it's just a weird thing where he's going to you know he's looking for attention or i mean what he lost is his rationally syndicated radio show over this which would be automatic basically if you're running a presidential campaign they can't put a presidential candidate on with his own show i don't think you you know you have all sorts of with equal time exactly so i mean i i don't fully understand look maybe he really believes all the stuff and i mean i think it's easy to jump to you know we just think he has bad you know uh motivations maybe he has good ones but like again you're right like if you want to go and you want to be um a candid against trump maybe your path is i'm going to go after moderates right so you maybe you do go to mrs if you're john kasek maybe you do go to msmbc but joe wallish is sitting here saying he's a tea party republican and he's going on msmbc it makes none of it makes any sense it's all it feels almost like it's a parody like it's like a movie find a primary challenger who doesn't have 200 to 300 racist tweets it's a war in me we're out of the mess now we're gonna bag me down here to i know i love that he's like well but the if you got to go wrong ratio yeah out of 40 000 stuff like 10 percent of the time you got to give me a break is that is one of the weirdest transformations i mean like it's like i i don't i've never seen anything like it look at look at the mooch too like yes people just annoy me that they turn their back on president trump when it was beneficial for them to be on board with president trump didn't he write a book like last year that was pro trump yes i think there's no mooch yeah wow i mean the mooch was there for what a week he was ten days something like that yeah that that's completely the other side like it's what reason what is president trump done that makes you go completely the other side on all of that yeah i mean i've heard a little bit of wallish talking about his reasoning it seems to be like basically like well i don't like his character and it's like well if you were uncomfortable with his whole character he was like he's the same guy he was and he was running like you know i mean i i don't it doesn't make any sense to me but he just may be the first president to actually do an act as he said he would when he was running in the primary he's done everything that he said he would do anything exactly the way he said he did yeah yeah and you priced that in right like he's you know i can understand some people like a more like they want a more mit romney guy right like who's like buttoned up and and you might not like trump style but like if you don't like his style you made that decision like in 1989 right like like all the sudden joe was like you know what now that i got him elected i think he's a jerk it's like well it's Donald trump like this is the way he acts it's if you haven't priced that in by now you haven't been watching the guy for you know guy who's been in the public eye for decades you know he is who he is and they either like that or you don't i can understand if you don't like it i can understand if you love it but like i just don't understand if the switch right now or you accept it yeah and you're okay with the outcomes of his policies exactly right exactly right uh yesterday's poll question should trump new hurricanes to stop them from reaching american chorus two course for comfort no no 59 said no there's a lot of pro hurricane people in this audience new hurricanes i just think it's so ridiculous that it dominated the headlines for like a full 24 hours trump report trump says that wonders if we should use nukes for hurricanes i'm like there's nothing better to report on i know nothing and that's just this this is again mswc looking for a way that they can mock the president the green land thing was the same thing obviously there's been real strategic conversations over the years about greenland but like that's not why it was news it was news because Donald trump said some crazy thing like it's always that it always comes back to that it's again it's so boring and then they use it as an excuse to say well maybe he's unfit to be president meanwhile joe biden looks seriously unfit to be president yeah and they don't say anything about it uh today's poll do you think trump is doing enough to fight back china robbing the united i think it means say against china robbing the united states let us know what you think stu you're doing enough to what is it to fight back it's an interesting one yeah fight back against china robbing the united states i don't know tariffs yeah i mean i i don't know how you know how you know i'm not a big tariff guy i do think the one thing i and i you know i i don't trump i think what you know he loves he does believe tariffs are effective and i think he's doing it for reasons that are uh you know it he they're honorable right like he wants to legitimately have better deals and he wants to win this battle against china he is i think risking his presidency though at some level i mean you know he he is if the economy fails or has serious problems i think he does this is this is his biggest risk in losing and so for people who a lot of times kind of say well don't trump doesn't have an ideology there's no belief system well i don't know i mean like he's legit i think he's legitimately putting his presidency on red or black here and saying like look you know i think it's going to come up the right way it makes me nervous i don't like the policy as a whole and that's one of the you know things i think it's you know i think he said a lot of really good things and we've talked about them i think this is one of the ones i think he's wrong on but you know look he he ran on this he said he was going to do it and he's done it i've i've never been a tariff guy but the reality is you cannot have free trade without fair trade and it was not fair with the way we were trading with china and china was manipulating the currency against us i think this is having devastating effects it looks a lot of evidence that it is on china i have great hope that this will work out and to president trump is what you said to his credit you put your presidency on the line for something that you believe in that you truly believe this is good for america and this will save this country from from china interventions negative interventions you've got to applaud you can disagree with him all you want but he's doing this under conviction yeah and i've got great respect for that yeah erin i think he's doing enough i certainly don't want him to do more right now i don't want to see an escalation of this so i would say enough yes the one thing that i worry to be most about this is that china has something that we don't which is the ability to not have an election they don't have to worry about this and they can hold this and they can make it worse and worse and worse as we go into next year they can manipulate and hold this country's economy hostage at some level um you know i think there's also an argument there though that trump has the ultimate sugar rush in the economy that if it does start to turn negative i think if he were to switch around on these policies and and make a deal go through whatever the best thing he can get is there may be a big sugar rush for the economy it may help him towards the election as well but i mean china doesn't have to worry if they they may they are having negative consequences it is hurting i think both sides here but they they could just kill a couple hundred million people like that's what china does when they get in problems and that makes me it makes me worried not only for the poor people in china but also uh you know the election because he really they can hold uh our economy um at gunpoint as well and you know they need us more than we need them i think that's true but it's it's also they don't have those effects it might not hurt our country as much but it can hurt donald trump as much you know they can they can get donald trump out of there now they don't want to listen if warren either i mean we should we should point that out as much as they love communism i don't think that they want to deal they'd rather have a market partner to deal with to boost their own version of it so i don't think they want warren or sanders either those are disasters as well so your point about they don't have to have an election i see a narrative playing out now in the mainstream media and this has been happening over the last couple weeks about china they're saying well this may take trump a second presidency to get it under a second term to get this under control and what the media is really telling you when they say this is if you don't like him you better get him out now so you don't have to deal with pushing the china deal for another four years after 2020 they're constantly pushing that as more ammo for their side to say hey or or moderates who don't like the uncomfortableness of all of this to say hey move president trump out um i mean he's been asked about though he's you know he said look you know there will this be a recession what if it causes a recession well if it causes a recession it's worth it right i mean that's again you act you you give him credit for that you elect someone on what they said and if he's gonna stand by it i mean you know he's standing by he is doing what he said he would do on that one yeah let us know what you think by going to the blazes
