    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Second hour of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show is already here. Clay and I have a great time talking to all of you. Appreciate you joining us. Lines are open. 800-282-282. And if you're not on Twitter, you shouldn't be on Twitter if you feel like it. I guess that's kind of a having it both sides there. But if you want to be on Twitter, follow that Clay Travis, follow that Buck Sexton. All right. I just thought we hadn't given that shout out in a while. So it's throwing that in the mix. A little bit of breaking news for all of you from the Supreme Court. Not big breaking news, although I think tomorrow there'll be some big Supreme Court news. And we're also going to discuss the ongoing lib meltdown courtesy of the Supreme Court decision of last week. But Justice Breyer is retiring, stepping down. Tomorrow, I believe at noon, officially. We've known this is coming. So this isn't it's not like when there's, oh my gosh, a sudden opening. Katanji Brown Jackson is replacing him. She, I believe, will be well, I don't know if it's possible to be more left-wing than so to my or. So you'll have a very far left judge on the court, Justice on the court. That will happen starting tomorrow. And we also, so that's just a bit of a Supreme Court update. But then tomorrow, you're also going to have a Kledal break it all down for you. A case having to do with Remain in Mexico, which I think there will be some lib tears about because the Biden administration is in the wrong. Essentially, the Remain in Mexico program should be must be implemented, although I've already heard from people in border patrol that Clay, what they're going to do is put as few people in the program as they possibly can, right? So they'll just abuse their bureaucratic prerogative in order to avoid doing what would actually help the border. And then we have an EPA case about West Virginia, the Environmental Protection Agency. I think EPA is about to get slapped down tomorrow and told that they can't use all of these tools to dramatically slash CO2 emission from power plants. I think it's likely this is about the Clean Air Act. We'll get into it tomorrow when the decision comes down, but that'll be a big one. Oh, and one more bit of news from the last 24 hours. Congrats to Lee Zeldin. We had him on yesterday. He is the now Republican nominee for the governor's race in New York state, which will be closely watched. But Clay, with all that Supreme Court stuff coming down, it is fascinating to watch the arguments that are being made right now. I'm not even sure they're arguments. I think it's more, more accurate to call it whaling, shrieking, shouting, and throwing a tantrum from the left on a whole, in a whole range of ways, the media, the Democrats in Congress. You have Elizabeth Warren in the Senate and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in the house, both recommending the setup of emergency abortion clinics set up on federal land. There's so much here that I think is interesting, but one thing is they are about to lose control, I think, quite obviously, of the house and the Senate. What do they think is really, I mean, that is their solution to set up abortion clinics in national parks. People are saying like, we're going to have abortion clinics in Yellowstone now. They think this is going to give them what they want. I'm just picturing taking my family to the Smoky Mountains for summer vacation. You pull into the Smoky Mountains, which I believe are the most visited national park in the country every year. Partly that's because they're so accessible to the East Coast. So many people can drive. You get to Cades Cove and you say, hey, kids, get ready. Oh, look, there's a bear. Then you drive a little bit further and you're like, what's that? Oh, that's an abortion clinic. Think about it, Buck. You go to Gettysburg and you're like, hey, let's go watch. Let's go look at Cemetery Ridge. Let's walk through Pickett's Charge and then at the base of Pickett's Charge, you suddenly have an abortion clinic. I mean, this is next level crazy, Buck. Next level crazy. As an aside, we're going to play the AOC calling this in a second. This is just an aside because I saw this story this morning because there's, I think, unfortunately there's video of it. I don't know. People in Yellowstone, I've never been and I actually want to go. I'd love to go to and I haven't been either. Need to understand bears and bison look cute from far away. I have seen grizzly bears in the wild. I've also seen them run. When did you see a grizzly bear in the wild? Oh, I went fly fishing in Alaska with my dad and my brother. It was fantastic. And you were just out there and they were close. I've got video of it. Yeah, we had grizzly bears walking around as Clay. When we, when we, when we first got to the stream, there were bears that would just come and we're eating the salmon. Alaska, in terms of natural beauty, is one of the most amazing places. I've never been to Alaska either. Oh my gosh, amazing. So did you see that grizzly man movie about the guy who went and lived with the grizzly bears? Yes. And it was getting killed by them. And then they have the audio. Don't play it. Yes, I saw that. He was going to, like that was going to end badly. The coolest thing about that guy's situation was that he had wild foxes became his pets. Like they'd follow him around like a little miniature Schnauzer or something. Anyway. So how close, I'm still a boy. Not a Belgian Malinois Clay because those are badass dogs. Yeah, I know. Everybody mad at me for not knowing the Malinois. But no, I just, the aside here, I've got to get back to AOC in a second. Could you read the, like, could you throw a football and hit a bear? Could I have thrown the football? Yeah. No, they were probably like a hundred yards away. Okay. Yeah. So, so, no, no, you, that's all. And we had, we had Smith and West and 500s, a 50 cow handgun. Yes. Because you're, they could charge you. And by the way, the guys, the guides, we were told us they're like, if they charge, it's probably still going to get to you even if you hit it with the, like, because they're, they're mad. I bring up because the bison, people think that bison are like, you know, it's like a cow. It's two thousand pounds of muscle with horns and can run 30 miles an hour. Someone just died in Yellowstone. I, or actually, I think maybe severely injured. I'm not, I have to check on whether it was a fatality. So they just opened Yellowstone back up, right? Because they had all the flooding. Someone got it. Somebody already got killed by a, by a bison. Someone, someone got mauled by a, I mean, I don't know if maul is a proper term, uh, uh, gorged. I, but is that, is that the, what's it? Gored. Gored. Thank you. Gorgeous eating. Gorge by a bison. Um, in the park. Anyway, side notes, stay away from the bison folks. Um, Yellowstone, AOC, federal lands. Um, here is what she said about it. I'll start with the baby. I'll start with the baby. It's the baby. It's the baby steps. Open abortion clinics on federal land. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Can I just say there's something really twisted about talking about a opening abortion clinics on federal land and saying the babyist of babyist of baby steps. Weird. Weird. Weird to say. She's weird. Uh, and we need to play some of that cuts. I guess she did like a 25 minute interview on Stephen Colbert last night who was just completely given up on the idea that he does comedy at all. And now he sits and talks to Stephen, uh, to AOC. Isn't it great that our friend Greg Godfeld showed just kicks his butt. Just just just never know why his crush was just just fantastic. It's it's not only did he destroy Stephen Colbert, which effectively is on the corner from your place, right? Your close fire. I see the Stephen Colbert line every day and I want to walk past them and say, look, I know you're visiting New York. This is not worth your time. Yes. I want to tell them. I love David Letterman. I know he disputed this before, but he was in that studio and the Ed Sullivan theater there in, in, in New York City. What's, what's wild to me is not only did Stephen Colbert destroy the legacy, in my opinion, of the late show with David Letterman, of being funny and a reverent Zany and all those things, but everybody else followed him off the cliff because he had success. And now Greg Gutfeld on Fox News is beating all of them in late night and they try to pretend his show doesn't exist in media because there's still a lot of people who cover late night as if it's a story and they won't even discuss by and large Gutfeld's show, even though it dominates all of them. But, but what this is really about is not even just on national park land because in many states, abortions are going to be even more available post-row decision than they were before. For instance, if you want to go to New York, California, Illinois, they're going to expand, expand abortion rights even farther than Roe did. So this is really about going to red state national parks where those people who live in those states are making their own decisions about what the abortion policy can be. This is how, you know, there's a lot of federal land in Utah, for example. Yeah. They want there to be. They want abortion clinics. And remember, that means abortion clinics funded directly with federal dollars too. Then now getting into the seriousness and the morality of this again for a moment, this is about making every state and every taxpayer complicit in this even after Roe v. Wade was overruled as a non-constitutional right, which is obvious. They can keep this, you know, this make believe game going of, oh, it's not a constitutional right anymore. If we had to sit and stomach for decades, the lie that it is a constitutional right, they just have to stop being babies, pardon the phrase, they have to stop being so, so, uh, sour grapes about this and pretending that this is not actually the way it's going to be going forward. What do you think happens when Republicans take back control of the Congress, by the way, with their federal abortion clinics? Oh, well, what do they think is going to be the reality there? And also why do they hate democracy so much, Clay? Why can't they allow this to play out in the states? Again, I think the wild thing about this, and that's why I use the Smoky Mountains as an example, Tennessee, my home state is going to make whatever choice they want as it pertains to abortion based on the democratic process. The idea that you're going to build on federal lands, because you would have to build, right? You can't just start doing abortions intense, I can't imagine. You would have to build a physical facility. And suddenly, when you're driving through the Great Smoky Mountains, you're going to pass by an abortion clinic. It just, I can't imagine it becoming a reality. It just, it strikes me as really wild in terms of how it would be applied. And the, the lack of logic that would also be entailed and also would be messy, just messy in terms of the way that people would respond to the federal government coming in and trying to Bigfoot state law. I mean, there's, we've gotten used to conservatives actually have lived with this regime of state laws can be very, very different. We have a sec, we have a right to bear arms, right? We all know this. And liberals try to undermine it or eradicate it, destroy it all the time. We live in a country where clay, I mean, you know, if I'm found with a firearm in New York, I face multiple years in prison, right? Whereas if I lived in Texas, I could just go and buy a gun at the store walk around. New York says I'm a bad person for having a gun. And of course, they until recently they wouldn't even give you one to carry says I'm a bad person who deserves to be in prison. Texas says no, actually the second amendment really counts. Same thing in Florida, right? We can find these other states. This is the reality that we face day in and day out. The left has to have it their way or they want to just overturn and overthrow the whole system. They have a meltdown. They can understand this is actually the system we have. Roe was the wrong decision. Roe was the problem within the system. And that problem has now been purged. Another easy analogy and obviously these are very different different things, Buck, is what happened with gambling laws. I know this because I spend a lot of time with sports gambling. Supreme Court says we can't have a system set in place when it comes to federal gambling legislation. So now every state can make their own decision. So if you live in my home state of Tennessee, you can gamble on sports. You're down in Georgia. You can't. Every state gets the right to make their choice. Gambling lotteries to your point guns. There are lots of issues all over the country, even how much alcohol you can have in beer, what how you can buy them, what the rules are going to be. They're different for every state. We'll talk more about this when we come back with each mortgage free home. However, the tunnel towers foundation delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices America's heroes have made for us. The heroes need your help. Gold star fallen first responder families with kids. Our nation's most catastrophically injured first responders and veterans, even our homeless service members. US Marine Corps corporal Christopher Greer was a firefighter and an EMT in Tennessee, my home state when he was deployed to Afghanistan. He was 25 years old when he gave his life serving our country. Corporal Greer was survived by his wife and their kids. Tunnel the towers paid off the Greer family's mortgage. For some families, the foundation brings the comfort of knowing they can stay in the home they shared with their fallen loved one. For others, the foundation enables new memories to be cherished forever. All of this is possible because of your generosity and support. Donate just $11 a month to tunnel the towers at t2t.org. That's the number two T dot org T the number two T dot org. Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. We are rolling through the Wednesday edition of the program. I've got by the way, my two boys who were fabulously well behaved according to woman sitting with us at dinner here in the Panama City studios here in Florida. Buck, they came because they did research and found out there are two baseball card shops within close proximity of the station where I am doing the show. So they're playing on their iPads in the studio next door because they get to go to baseball card shop right after you collect baseball cards at all when you were a kid a little bit. I really I liked the stale piece of gum that they put in with some of the top scums. Yeah. My they still sell some of those old packages. And when we were down in Atlanta, my son bought 1988 and 1989 baseball card packs that still had the gum in them. I'm sure I'm pretty sure at one point, I thought maybe I'd be able to pay for college with my Ricky Henderson rookie card and my Don Mattingly in a little plastic card. Yes. And then that whole world of those things being valuable collapsed. But apparently it's now surged back. You just gave up too early. They are wildly expensive now. If you can find your cards and you had cards in like the 70s or the 80s or the early 90s, they have skyrocketed in value. So you got to go find them. I wanted to play this. Who who is the dumbest person in all of media according to to our perspective, Buck? I mean, we're in agreement here. You know, you know, we're going to say Joy Behar. She weighed in on the Supreme Court's prayer case and said, I'd like to know if it would apply to Colin Kaepernick. Listen to Joy, the biggest idiot in media at Behar. I would like to know if it would apply to Colin Kaepernick, for example, he takes him. I don't know if this is really legal or anything. What I'm saying, but it seemed to me like the guy takes a knee and he gets thrown off the team. But he could be praying too, praying, you know, that these people would leave him alone. I don't always pray. But he could be praying. I don't know what you're doing when you're taking me. Doesn't that look like prayer to you? Suddenly it's illegal for him, but it's okay for this group. It's so dumb. It's not even wrong. It's hard to even explain all the places in that one soundbite that this televised multi-millionaire talking head went wrong because wow. Listen, can we just play that opening like just the first three or four seconds of this? Because we need to grab this cut and keep it. I love before she even shares her opinion. She says this may be wrong and it might have nothing to do with the law, something like that. What exactly did she say? The first three or four seconds again? I would like to know if it would apply to Colin Kaepernick, for example, he takes a knee. I don't know if this is really legal or anything what I'm saying, but it seemed to me like the guy takes a knee. I don't know. That's all she actually it would be better if we found out that every day before that show, she's about four Merlot's deep. Honestly, it would be better for people out there who are dumb like Joy Behar. I knew there would be someone who would compare this to Kaepernick. This was a public school employee who was fired for praying after a football game. Colin Kaepernick was not fired for kneeling during the national anthem. He just wasn't good enough to draw attention to himself and also suck. Right? Lesson is if you're going to be controversial, be really good at what you do and then maybe you get to keep your job. Colin Kaepernick, not very good at what he was doing, but you know who's great at what they're doing, Wolf and Shepherd. They will give you an incredible look for your shoe. You'll be able to have the comfort of a sneaker with the style of a dress shoe. The founder is a former athlete who became a designer. He brought athletic shoe innovation to dress shoes. I wear my crossovers. I've got them down here at the beach. I can wear them out to a restaurant here. They are fabulously comfortable full grain Italian leather on top that merges seamlessly with athletic shoe bottoms. You can join Buck and I in wearing these by going to their website wolfinshepper.com. That's spelled S H E P H E R D. Get your pair of shoes at wolfinshepper.com and join the pack today. Certainly not reality based, but it's starting to come together where they see clay that their electoral fortunes are going to be very dim and keep in mind everyone. It's not just this midterm. The midterm will effectively mean the end of the Biden presidency as a force for progressive change, right? Because not only are they going to lose any control. Now remember, they still have the budget. They spent there two trillion for the American rescue plan, 1.9 trillion. And the president has his executive orders, but you got a Supreme Court majority that's pretty constitutional in its thinking for the most part. Certainly five four constitutional in its in its approach. And you're going to have Republicans and control the House. The Senate, how do we get to this point? We often talk to you about the nuts and bolts of day to day life in this country that are frustrating people and understandably so like the price of gas, the price of food, the price of rent, the wide open border. We just said that horrific tragedy over over 50 people killed in that one human smuggling incident because we have a porous border. So the cartels think they can run tractor trailers. Think about this. And I'm sure they're doing it successfully most days, by the way. So that's why they're taking doing these kinds of operations because it is lucrative for them because it usually works and now led to an awful tragedy in that instance. The crime in cities across the country has, I think Los Angeles just voted to downgrade some of the funding for a for the sheriff's office out there. So there's there's all this craziness of the policy, but also in the in the tone and the language and the overall approach, people are starting to realize there's something really wrong with these lives. I mean, here is, and I know we're going to AOC, but I think she moves the media, moves the media conversation in this country more than really any other Democrat. I mean, Joe Biden's president. Okay, fine. But you know, usually it's Joe Biden's mumbling. He doesn't know where he is. And everyone goes, well, you know, that's Joe. AOC can say something and then all of a sudden, the media tries to back her up. We pull it apart because it's usually so flimsy and stupid. And then they say, why are you obsessed with her? Well, here she is talking about the Supreme Court decision. I just want you to hear it. The Supreme Court has engaged in the overreaching of its authority in denying the human and civil rights of any pregnant person or person that could become pregnant in the United States of America. They have engaged in overreach. And it is the responsibility of the president and Congress to put the Supreme Court in chess because they have deeply given that. I believe that President Biden should entertain expansion of the Supreme Court. I believe that he should forcefully come out in ending the filibuster of the United States I believe that you could call Congress to repeal the Hyde Amendment. Okay, can I just put a sign when we can dive in, Clay, if you think it's worth it for everyone listening, this the really childish legal and political analysis here of the system. And this is what the left does. They don't like the outcome. The system is a is illegitimate. They like the outcome and shut up your threatening or democracy. But she said pregnant people. You know, we did have a moment there on Friday when Roe was overturned when they're saying women's rights, women's rights and AOC here she is going. Guys, it really is pregnant people's rights. Folks are listening this and they're saying the Democrats are actually insane. This is this is a real problem. I hope that they run on a lot of what AOC would argue because she represents the blue checkmark brigade on Twitter. The idea that you would say pregnant person, Black, white, Asian, Hispanic, male, female, women get pregnant. That is an overwhelming 90 plus percent win for sanity. Same way here on expanding the Supreme Court and ending the filibuster. Those are more detailed, nuanced perspectives because a lot of people don't know. I bet the most most most people in the United States don't even know how many Supreme Court justices there are. I would bet. So when you're talking about expanding the Supreme Court, people's opinions on that is not that refined because most people don't even know how many there are or that they have lifetime tenure or even how a Supreme Court justice gets put on the court. Most people are busy. They're not paying a lot of attention to that. But when you're using the phrase buck pregnant person or Latin X or you are arguing that America is a fundamentally awful and racist place, all of those things resonate in a big way and they resonate in a big way with people across identity spectrums, Black, white, Asian, Hispanic. And that's why I focus a lot on this show. And in fact, I'm working on a book right now building on this idea that there's really become a division in America between saying and insane. And Republicans are mostly on the same side. But Democrats have gone full on insane. And when you are arguing that men can get pregnant, I think it's a bonkers banana land argument that everyone out there sees regardless of their identity. And here's another one. You will not see a single Democrat. I know you had, I have a story at the excellent website outkick.com dealing with this. There's a story about a 29 year old man competing in the border competition in New York City against, I just didn't say everyone understands, usually the competition last year was one by a 16 year old girl, a 10 year old girl actually came, I think in third place. So a lot of teenage girls in this competition skateboarding competition. Okay, it's skateboarding competition. This prize money, a 29 year old man is competing against these teenage girls. And the media wants to tell, I mean, you can see the photos, the individuals grown out, named veteran with three kids, I believe. Yeah, it's grown out is grown out of his hair a little bit. And other than that is, is a biological male folks. I mean, it's a 29 year old guy competing against as a, you know, competing against in the women's division against teenage girls. And the media wants you to believe the Democrat media. AOC, if she was ever asked about this, which she won't be because the media knows this is not a good place for them to actually, but if she were asked, but if she said, this is great, this is progress. 29 year old guys beating 13 year old girls in athletic competition is progress. This is America. This is what it means to your point, Clay, 90% of America looks at them and goes, you guys need to stop being crazy. I wonder on some level, whether, you know, we have pride month, what if men decided they wanted to identify as women month and basically went and won every women's competition that was going on that was open? Because how do you, it's so absurd, just follow my logic here. I don't know how you're pointing out this 29 year old skateboarder, which we wrote about it out kick. What standard do you have to meet in order to be able to identify as a woman? In other words, if, if there was ladies night at the bar down the street here, where I'm, where I'm living, and ladies got in for free and got dollar beers, I've got a beard. But if I wanted to be a lady, could I, could I identify as a woman to take advantage of ladies night and the lower price on beer? In other words, I don't know that there's any standard even to be applied to identify me as a man or woman when it's just my gender identity in my head. So for so many of these competitions, if a man walks up and says, Hey, today I'm identifying as a woman, could I go become a WNBA superstar tomorrow? I haven't played basketball in a long time. I think I could make a WNBA team right now. I think it's six foot, you know, 185 43 years old. I think I would be good enough to play women's professional basketball. I really do. If I just decide I want to identify as a woman, can I become a WNBA player? Can I become a pro women's athlete? It sounds ridiculous, but that's where the Democrat logic has taken us. And if I followed their logic, I think I could apply and say, yes, I'm a WNBA star. I think that's true. And by the way, they would tell you that it you will be very brave of me. It's stunning and brave. In fact, stunning and it would be stunning and brave. Folks, we're talking about all this stuff. And it's important to keep in mind that lives, they hate alpha masculinity. They hate people that do it their own way that want to be the, you know, the dads, the males in our society, the guys out there who are just going to keep pushing for what's true, what's right, going to fight and not going to be told what to do, not going to be wimpy beta male types.

We're almost now four weeks out and I got asked this question yesterday when I was hanging out at the pool buck and I thought it was a good one and I don't know the answer and I'm curious what you think. Are we safe from Joe Biden being able to pass any more awful bills before the end of the year? And I know we've talked about the the Republicans running out the clock and we need to get maybe some senators on to talk about this. When is the drop dead date so to speak? When Congress will be out of session and we no longer have to worry about them making disastrous decisions that make for instance inflation worse. I.E. are they going to pass any new bills that could increase taxes that could lead to more money coming into the government's coffers and I didn't know the answer. Do you have a good sense on that? My sense was if we can get to Labor Day because come Labor Day everybody is going to go back to campaign for the midterms and that really is kind of the start of campaign season aggressively but I didn't know when the drop dead date of hey we're safe actually is because if the Republicans win the house and or win the Senate which we feel pretty good about nothing would really get passed for two years after this this is actually in my mind the system showing you its brilliance as in gridlock protects us from the stupidity of the people who happen to get in positions of power by promising things they couldn't deliver lying about they you know all the all the different usual underhanded political nonsense right so gridlock is good I almost feel like I could give the Gordon Gekko speech yeah gridlock is good when you have an administration as incompetent as this one so I certainly hope that will be the case and I guess a way to step back from it clay because we'd have to get into well what what you know parliamentary tricks could be pulled to try to get something through here try to push something to the Senate the House what would they want to do at this point tax increase I said so but right so that that's exactly right so now we look at okay they're going to pull a tax increase in the last months before a midterm election where they're about to get crushed because they're going to go with a class warfare theme we know what exactly is the sales pitch to people that can't afford comfortably anymore food gas rent it's going to be we're raising the corporate tax and in you know in in five years this is going to bring me with the thing it just it doesn't fly right so that's I can't even think of what short of some executive orders but executive orders are immediately reversal which the libs always find out and cry about they go oh they can be on by way that's what remain in Mexico is effectively about right they're just saying well we're not going to we're not going to re implement the policy and accord has already said what do you mean you're not going to re implement the policy my concern and this could potentially happen in a lame deck lame duck session which is even a little bit give me your worst give me your worst case my worst case scenario is we get to september or late august right before they're going to leave they see all the polls they know that they are going to lose the senate and they know they're going to lose the house and they just say we've got to pass whatever we want in terms of transformative legislation right now because once we lose the senate in the house or even just the house we're not going to be able to pass anything for two years then we got a difficult election to potentially try and win in 2024 we may not control congress and the white house again for another decade or more let's try to change taxes for instance and get through another big spending bill just because we won't be able to do it for a decade or more so my concern is they could be staring down the oncoming train recognize that it's going to flatten them so it's basically go for it's break the glass time who cares what you've got nothing else there's no and and the lame debt lame duck session is even a little bit more uh scary in that respect because i'm not sure what parliamentary rules apply once they lose the house in senate could they try and push something through before the new congress is brought to brought in why would manchin for example i'm just just a play this out right what why would manchin go along with that at this point he's he's essentially he may have an even he's basically the president he's basically save the democrat party from an implosion the likes of which we've never seen because as we all know if inflation was 12 percent or 15 percent i mean the cpi you know index never mind what the real cause what the real inflation is that people feel uh for the goods that they actually need that's even that's usually a higher number than the official number um you know i i don't see it but i also never underestimate how slimy and unfair and underhanded the democrat left is willing to be clay so i don't want us to get caught unaware that's my concern and i would just say we got to be vigilant in trying to keep that from happening because everything bident touches makes everything worse the bydus touches real the opposite of the mydus touch we got to be very careful and we also need to play some of these aoc comments about Cassidy Hutchinson i know we've been making fun of aoc but you've got to hear him last night on cold bear but oh it's it's remarkable friends we are it's interesting with democrats and republicans the democrat leadership these days we are living in two different countries we're living in reality i don't know where the democrats are living it's some other place a far far galaxy that no one's ever heard of before clay travas and buck sexton on the front lines of truth"
