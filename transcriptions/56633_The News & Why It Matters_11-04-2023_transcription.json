    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals. A new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Today, the child mutilation surgeries, the left keeps saying, aren't happening are still happening. We'll give you the latest is Bud Light feeling the heat after their partnership with Dylan Mulvaney and the FBI is spying on your churches. What could possibly go wrong? We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and a cosmetic surgeon in North Carolina was busted showing off her work mutilating children as young as 14 on her website, you know, all in the name of inclusivity. This is Dr. Hope Sherry, owner of the cosmetic concierge in Charlotte. Up until a few months ago, when she was called out by local activists in the area, Dr. Sherry proudly displayed the before and after pictures on her website. Only the pictures you're seeing right now, these pictures with the black lines over them, they were not censored on her website. No, these 16, 15 and 14 year old girls had their breasts exposed and posted on the internet for all the world to see, you know, just a little child porn for inclusivity, of course. The doctor called the girls males in her picture gallery before referring to their ages and which surgery they had undergone, which is strange because if they were males, they wouldn't have any breasts to remove, you know, unless they were Alex Stein's wife's boyfriend, Dontarius. The website also states that the doctor does not require her patients to be on hormones for any length of time at all. The only requirement under 18 is parental consent and a doctor's letter. She claims she relies on the informed consent model. Informed consent, really. Is the doctor explaining to the patient all of the complications that can arise? Is the doctor explaining that this is an irreversible procedure, that there's no coming back from this, that these girls won't be able to breastfeed their babies if they change their minds later on, which studies tell us the majority of people who experiment with being trans do change their minds? Does she tell them that she's turning them into lifelong patients that she can profit from forever? You know, it's fascinating because as much as the left keeps telling us, this isn't happening. They're not doing this to children. It just keeps happening. Like we have piles of evidence, actual people like Chloe Cole and so many others, Chloe, who's been on this program, telling horrific stories of the damage that was done to them when they were children. They call you a right-wing nut job pushing lies because you hate gay people. They're just lies. You're just transphobic. You're doing this to stir up fear and hate. That's not happening to kids. Oops. Well, that turns into, all right, it might be happening, but it's really rare. Then all of a sudden we're at this, well, if you pass this bill preventing doctors from mutilating children, you're a hate-monger and we will riot. Okay. Well, we'll see how that works out for Dr. Sherry soon because last week, the North Carolina legislature introduced a bill that would ban gender modification surgeries for those under 18. And one of their Democratic representatives just announced she is switching parties, which gives the Republicans veto-proof control of the legislature. And when the legislature does pass that bill to protect children, I would encourage all of the groomers on the left to go cry about it. Joining me now to discuss this and more is my good friend, Chad Prather, host of the Chad Prather show. It is really wild to me that in 2023, this is even, I mean, this is considered controversial for YouTube. In fact, after I just, what is it, the first couple minutes of the show, we're probably already demonetized because I dare say we shouldn't be mutilating children. Well, let's spend the hour talking about it, right? Hang on. I mean, where do we start? Where do we end? I don't think there is an end for this thing. So, uh, bup, bup, bup. First of all, my first thought is they can't, they can't help themselves. They have to talk about it. They got to show their work, right? They've got to expose themselves as what they're going to do because they've been told, these doctors have been told that nothing's going to be done to them. And guess what? Nothing's going to have been done to them. You know, as we speak right now, they're marching on the Capitol yet again in Nashville, Tennessee. And basically you have Tennessee lawmakers who are leading an insurrection right back into the Capitol building. But for what reason, right? So again, you saw the pictures and that that's a horrifying thing. You saw a 14 year old, you saw a 15 year old, you all saw a 16 year old. It's horrifying that this is, you know, the cosmetic concierge, right? Here's before, here's three months after this is giving your child exactly what a double incision with nipple grafts, 15 year old male, as you said, three months after FTM, chest reconstruction with the nipple grafts. This is very graphic. This is a child. This is a child. This is a person who doesn't know who they are, where they're going in life. And when I think about this, what purpose do we have elected officials? What purpose do they exist if it's not to protect the innocent among us, right? This is the kind of thing, these Tennessee lawmakers and lawmakers in every state ought to be doing to make sure that children are protected from these types of monsters. This is barbarianism. This is absolutely horrible. Did you ever go through a phase in your life, Sarah, where you wanted to, I don't know that I did. You know, you try to figure yourself out in your teenage years. People have tried, did you go through a phase? I didn't, so I was a tomboy. Yeah. So I wouldn't say it was a phase where I was like, I want to be a boy, but I was a tomboy, I hated wearing dress. I mean, the basically the exact opposite as I am now, right? I own a makeup company. Yeah. I would have never, the young prepubescent Sarah would have never, I didn't like makeup, I didn't like dresses. But you went through changes, right? Your identity, it evolves, it changes. I mean, my God, I didn't know who I was still as 42 years old. People sometimes will say, I'd pray, they're like, oh, I'm a big fan of Chad Prather. And somebody was like, well, I've never heard of him. And I'm like, well, I'm 50 years old. I'm still trying to figure myself out. That's life's journey, right? You're always trying to kind of evolve into yourself. So you've had, you've had people, they were goth and they were punk and they were emo, and they were whatever all these other things were, where they went into this alternate reality. So I've stopped calling this transgenderism. This is trend, genderism is what this is. This is, because these kids aren't trans. These, they're not trans. The Dylan Mulvaney's, the Jeffrey Marsh's of the world, they're not trans. And I can't even imagine putting myself, and I know people who are the parents of kids who were going through this, this dysphoria in their head. And this is traumatic to watch. And they'll even say, my kids dealing with these mental issues, right? Hard, hard to watch. My heart goes out to these people. But to make this a trend, the way they're doing it, and you just, you know, it's like getting a tattoo on your neck, you know, you're just going in for a little procedure. Or we're going to get your nose pierced or something like that. That's not what this is. If anything, these lawmakers need to be standing against this trend. Because in 20 years, this trend is going to be gone. Which by the way, it's fascinating to me that Texas is still not one of the, what is it, 13 states now that have been under modification. Yeah. Still waiting, Texas legislature. We're still waiting. I realize. The Texas legislature is a joke. I know. I know. The Republicans in the Texas House are a joke. I know. I know. I mean, this should be the most basic thing that you could tell your constituents is we are going to protect children from mutilation. But I want to, okay, so I want to, I want to get into, because a lot of people say, well, you know, I mean, we don't want it, we don't want it for kids. But what adults do is none of our business. Okay. I guess you could make that argument. But I would argue that us allowing the adults to do it, us promoting adults on TikTok and Instagram and all of these mentally ill men like Dylan Mulvaney and Jeffrey Marsh and all of these others, bearded men who dress up like women and call themselves women, is what is leading to the childhood epidemic of thinking that they're trans. Case in point here. I want to get to Bud Light, but I first want to show you the latest to partner with Dylan Mulvaney. This is oil of Olay. Here is oil of Olay's latest at watch. Yes, because females always think about it. Olay. Everyday. S.P.F. That's just my way. Getting sun, I'm going crazy. Olay. Olay. I'm slay. Everyday this, everyday that. Let me hit you off and sign to the dot. Enough hydration for the whole nation. S.P.F. Baby, we're going on the daily. On the get my vixi. Tuesday. Lightweight energy. Whips. I got some liquid. Creams of liquids. Saturday, Sunday. I'm addicted. Olay. Everyday. S.P.F. That's just my way. Getting sun, I'm going crazy. Olay. I'm slay. I cannot express to you how offensive this is. That this grown man who doesn't have, I mean, he's not so convicted about being a woman that he's gone to chop off his penis yet as far as I know. Because he's not trans. Because he's not trans. Yet he's stealing women's sponsorships, campaigns, all of these things where women could actually be promoted. This dude is going to wear a bow and pretend like he's sleeping in it and promote this facial cream, which obviously, I'm not saying men don't use facial cream, but obviously the majority of oil of Olay's customers are going to be females. I would like to just remind everyone that AmericanBeautyBicerra.com does have a skin care line that you can go get. But that is why, that is the entire reason why we did it. It's like, I don't need to see a man showing me how to use skin care. I don't need to see a man pretending to be me being promoted by a skin care line that they're trying to advertise to women. It just doesn't, that's ugly. It just doesn't seem like a good marketing strategy. I just wanted to point out again how ugly that is. Yeah, there's not enough oil of Olay in the world to cover up that five o'clock chatter. And the ridicule in mocking set aside, very close to where I can still reach it, I want to make the point that women don't sleep with those bows in their hair. They don't, unless you're drunk and you come home late, you don't really go to sleep in your makeup either. No. And he wakes up with his makeup, then puts his oil of Olay over top of the makeup, which I don't think that's what y'all do. No, that's a purpose. And then, like the other day, the Bud Light deal, women, not only do women not want to be wearing a bra when they're at home and lounging around the house, they, y'all don't want to wear a bra at all. And I don't blame you. He's wearing one in a bubble bath because he's not a woman. Right. And again, he's not trans, he's trend. And that's the difference. You'd start calling them what they are. One, they're not transgender. That's their term. They're transsexual at best. And if you're not lapping off the goodies, you're not trans anything. Because you're trend. And that's the whole thing. He's getting rich off of this. He's making a parody out of femininity. And this is the exploitation of womanhood. Maybe this will segue over to the Bud Light thing if you want. Yeah. But the Bud Light thing, see, the Bud Light thing hit different because it was the perfect timing. It was after the circumstances surrounding the Nashville shooting, which we all know. And then it was the exploitation of women in just a complete affront to true womanhood of saying, OK, we're going to put those persons. We're going to celebrate their 365th day of being a woman. No, you're not. No, you're not. This is a guy who's on parade who's a gay man who's choosing to dress like a woman because he's he's a weak beta who wants to be dominated by another man. And he's trying to appear attractive to draw straight men in. Just call it what it is. That's what he's trying to do. He's a gay dude who's playing a game. Dylan Mulvaney will go away. He'll go away after he's had all the he can have. He will go away. He said in his whole deal, there's a swear drug. It's not a bad word. Is it? I'll put 20 in. What? Here's the thing. Here's the thing. He'll do. He'll he said it. He said it. I'm not accusing. So don't come at me with the whole hate thing because because whatever you want to accuse me of at this point, like I'm done with you like the road diverges like this and I can bury my head in the sand like most people are doing and saying, oh, it'll just go away or I can mock the hell out of you. And that's what I've chosen to do because he said that back when he was trying to figure out who he was and he was just boy crazy when he was in college and he didn't. So he himself has admitted that that's what he's after. He's a boy crazy dude who's gay. And now he's found a way to capitalize profit off of this whole deal. He is the ultimate grifter. He's the ultimate grifter. He's a transgender. He's not a transgender. Yeah. Huge difference. Well, it is fascinating too. I think a lot of the Ls, the Gs and the Bs are very upset about this because you're literally you're trying to erase being gay. Like just because you're gay, you're just gay. You don't have to pretend to be a different sex. You're just gay. Like you like men. Okay. Go get to some then I guess. Stay in your alphabetical lane. Right. Be a G. You ain't got to be a T. Right. Exactly. You don't got to you don't got to jump straight to the T. Yeah. You ain't a GT. You just a G. And so that's the thing that fascinates me about the Bud Light deal is because you know they doubled down on this marketing campaign and I think people had just had enough. Like it really hit different. I was down in New Braunfels, Texas, Canyon Lake area of Texas and I went into a grocery store on Saturday and somebody had asked me to pick up a 12 pack of beer while I was in there. So I walked over to the beer section. I'm not a beer drinker. You know this. Yeah. I'm not a beer drinker. I might have one but I go in there and I look and man there were stacks of Bud Light. Yeah. All the other beers were picked over for the weekend. Yep. Yep. All the other beers were picked over. Well we've seen Bud Light touching it. We've seen anhyzer bush distributors go online say the same thing. We've seen multiple. Where's this? The this is a bar owner in Missouri who said sales of anhyzer bush bottle products dropped 30% at his bar over the past week. Their drought beer plummeted 50%. Another bar owner. I believe this is in Boston said 80% of their Bud Light drinkers ordered something else that week and I mean it's we're seeing it all across the country. Our friend John Rich. Our friend John Rich. He took Bud Light out of his Redneck Riviera bar there in Nashville on lower broad. Wow. It's a big deal. It's a big deal. But people aren't touching it. We saw we went to the after party for the nefarious movie. Nobody was touching it in there. Well it's just fascinating. It was free. It was free. It was free to us. It was open bar and I was like nah. It's okay. And it's not why I need it. Nobody touched it. Well it's just it's fascinating because if you're going to make that bold of a move at least be a good beer. Yeah. Yeah. And that was sucks already. And that was the point that I wanted to make. It kind of slipped my mind there is everybody says well what about Miller Light. It's like okay listen. Every major corporation in America has their LGBT initiative out there. They have their marketing plan for all of that. They've all put the pride thing up there. But that's different. We don't care if you're gay. Right. We don't care if you're trans. We don't care if you're bisexual. We don't care if you're lesbian. We don't care. But you decided to use it to exploit women and that is different. And then you know you decided to weaponize your insanity and put it on your flags. Put it on your posters. Actually go into schools and shoot people or write manifestos about it. And so we're like nah we're just gonna be done with you now. Yeah. Or really just gonna be done with you at this point. As we mentioned at the beginning of the program or using that initiative to push you know child gender mutilation surgeries. No. No. No. No thank you. I'll pass on the entire thing. The entire movement. No. I have people who say to me all the time and I'm sure they do to you. Just quit talking about them. No. No. Not gonna quit talking about them. That's why we're here. Yeah. We're going to talk about them because we're going to ridicule them to the point of showing the absurdity. Because if you think they're going away they're not going away. See anhyzer bush. They're not worried about the drop in sales. They may lose four billion dollars in stock but they are not going to go away because their handler's out there that have a bottomless pit of money. They're okay with this marketing campaign because to them they're like you know what if we tell you to jump you'll say how high. Because we're the money behind the thing and it yeah you're dropping some shares you'll get some bad PR but this is this is the initiative in the narrative we're pushing and you're going to obey the agenda. Right. Yeah. No. Yeah. We're let's make one thing clear. We are in this current predicament of having these crazy folks running the show because we didn't nobody talked about it. Everyone wanted to live and let live. I'm going to mind my own business. I'm going to tend to my family. You do you and hey guess what they took the entire culture. Yeah. We got to talk about it. Thirty years ago I said this they don't want equality they want control. Yes. Correct. You're seeing it. Yep. And they're not done. No. They're not even halfway down on the bullet points of their agenda. No. No. They're coming hard on you. That's why I have people to say just let people be. Why so much hate. I don't. No. Hate them. I hate the agenda. I hate the narrative. I hate what's being pushed and promoted. I hate those pictures of a 14 year old with their breasts cut off by the cosmetic concierge. Like this is some kind of cool trend to be a part of that I hate. Yep. Yep. I really want to cuss on this show man. I do. Because I hit the limitations of the of the English vocabulary and my vocabulary ain't that great anyway. Well listen I don't it's not my rule it's just our edit team gets mad. Well I'll get it. I'm adding work to them. I won't do it anymore. Okay. He's not look he might. He might. He might. He might. We don't know. I won't. All right. Let's go ahead.

If you had a foot cam that was only available on Blaze TV you would be the highest subscribed show. You would you would beat Beck. I'm telling you there would be more people signed up under your promo code if you because people are weird. Let me know. Let me know. I'm telling you I just gave you a million dollar idea right now.

It comes back for you and your feet. We'll do that. So the the FBI. We've known for a very long time that they I mean look they probably got Chad and I on about a million different watch lists. They just made my name. They did. Chad we talked about it yesterday. Hey. Thing. Yes you are a violent extreme. A violent extreme. So I know I've already been on the list but now you're double in down. You're double on the list. So the weaponization of government committee has discovered that the FBI has sent undercover agents into Catholic churches to investigate certain parishes for domestic extremism. This is a letter from Jim Jordan to FBI director Chris Ray based on the limited information produced by the FBI to the committee. We now know the FBI relied on at least one undercover agent to produce its analysis and that the FBI proposed that its agents engage in outreach to Catholic parishes to develop sources among the clergy and church leadership to inform on Americans who are practicing their faith. Oh no. So this is I feel like people are not talking about this as much as they should. I mean we're talking about the FBI going undercover trying to develop strategic relationships with leadership in churches. We're talking about the FBI going undercover trying to create strategic relationships with January 6th defendants legal team. I mean this stinks to high heaven. We're talking about the FBI who we now know was working directly with the Biden administration to raid Mar-a-Lago. This is this is scary stuff and yet again every time they call you the fascist. You remember when extremists to Muslims flew airplanes into buildings? You remember when they passed the Patriot Act and they were worried about sleeper cells in in Islamic mosques. Remember those things? See they used all of that as a ploy to make sure that they could violate all your privacy and everything that you wanted. They're not worried about sleeper cells in mosques anymore. That's so blase and past tense. Now they're worried about the Christians that are in these Catholic churches. I mean when I think of extremism I don't think of the Catholic church. Like that's just not where my head goes on something like that. It's amazing to me that you have something that is being you know federally backed and pushed by federal law enforcement that really reeks of Nazism. I mean it really does kind of scream 1938 Germany. Literally while they're calling you the Nazi. Yeah. They're calling you the Nazi and they're using all of the same tactics that the Nazis used. See what you need to do is you need the news and why it matters just provided a valuable resource for you. So what you need to do is you need to find that quote. Thank you Jim Jordan for bringing this to the surface and Chris Ray who should be way out of a job because he's a pissant. But in an enemy of the people I could go on since he put me on the list and I'll call him out too. I mean he's just a Chris. I'm a chat he's a Chris. What you should do is you should take that quote right there. And every time somebody calls you a Nazi. It's just take that little screenshot right there and boom Twitter. I don't care what you say. There it is. Boom right there. Now explain this to me. You want to call me a Nazi. You want to call me a fascist. Explain this right here. To inform Americans and don't come back to me with some meme. You want the FBI. You want the clergy to inform on practitioners in the Catholic church to the FBI. You want the church leadership to inform on Americans practicing their faith. Man man. The rot is deep. It's bad. It's so it's not just here with the FBI. It's like lawmakers just blatantly disregarding the way you know that how people like AOC are always like we need to maintain our democracy. If we don't do all of these things democracy is going to die. Democracy is the most important thing ever. And then you know fast forward a few months later and she's directly urging Joe Biden to ignore you know courts rulings that would halt approval of the abortion pill. So the Justice Department just appealed a Texas court ruling. Did you see this that would halt the approval of the drug used in the most common method of abortion in the United States? And AOC just goes on television and blatantly just like I think that the president should just have supreme power. I think he should be a dictator and just ignore states rights and all these courts rules at all. What? I believe that the Biden administration should ignore this ruling. I think that we you know the courts have the legitimacy and they rely on the legitimacy of their rulings. And what they are currently doing is engaged in an unprecedented and dramatic erosion of the legitimacy of the courts. It is the justices themselves through the deeply partisan and unfounded nature of these rulings that are undermining their own enforcement. So the Biden regime should just not listen to the courts and do whatever they want because it's what they want to do and they want to push their agenda. But no that's not at all like threatening your precious democracy that you think you have. So AOC is not only unhinged but she's ignorant. That's a dangerous combination. Insanity and stupidity do not mix well together. So with her, God please, well someday in my life please let me sit down with this woman and just have a conversation and I'll be nice. I'll be nice. I just want to ask questions because if you don't, now you're supposed to uphold the constitution. And I said you took an oath to do so, to do so. If you don't know the Constitution then it's literally like fishing in a swimming pool. There's no fish in there. When you ask her to recall something constitutionally she can't do it because it's not in there. It's not in her head. So when she says something like this and basically calls for tyrannical overreach on the part of the federal government and just enforce it at whatever and ignore whatever the states say because these courts are so big they could just do whatever they want. Don't give up your guns. Don't give up your guns. Right. If you have to die don't give up. Same party who wants you to do that. And start asking these people online be like do you want me to die? Because it sounds like you want me to die. I mean I fear that their answer would be yes. Yeah they would be. So start calling them out. They're the violent extremists. Right. Because I know the messages I get sent. Yeah. I've seen yours too. Yeah same. All right let's go ahead and let's take a quick break. We'll be back with more. I want to thank fast growing trees.

Way to vote tomorrow on whether to reappoint Justin Pearson as a representative to the state house following of course you mentioned it earlier in the show his expulsion from the body last week he was one of two members who got expelled for you know just inciting an insurrection which we were told was like a very bad in fact the worst thing you could possibly do as an American citizen was incite an insurrection and yet they did and didn't think that they would face any consequences for it. Now it's fascinating because there's these new videos that have surfaced of Justin Pearson back in 2016 he was running for president of his student council and I just want to show you just the the contrast between Justin Pearson in 2016 and Justin Pearson just on Easter delivering a sermon at First Unitarian Church of Memphis when he addressed Mother God in his prayer. Watch what a difference a few years makes. Hey everybody I'm Justin J Pearson and I'm running for president of PSG. There are a few reasons that we're running this campaign this year. One has to do with representation. How can we represent all voices in a conversation? I want to do this by partnering with organizations from the booty Democrats to the booty Republicans. I want to bring together different voices dissenting voices voices that may be more liberal or more conservative in order that we can reach a point of sort of the radical middle where conversation and dialogue happens and growth happens. Well y'all I was glad when they said unto me let us go into the house of the Lord. I'm so glad to be in the house of the Lord with you this morning. Would you mind going ahead and praying with me now Mother God, creator God, loving God, holy God. And we saw him last week with his you know over the top dramatic speech his radicalism and I think if they think that you just over a non-C8 and spread your words out and make them longer that it makes your sound smart. Makes you sound eloquent like a black creature sure. So in all the bobble heads out there just bobble in the head. You know you talk about Dylan Mulvaney being a grifter which is totally true. Yeah. How many of these radical politicians are just grifters? Of course. Listen what happened to him you asked the question what happened to him with social media. Right. Like he started he you know he started seeing where he could benefit and capitalize off of this thing and and he became something he's not. Right. You know I and I think that's what you have to do is you look at people and say okay have you consistently remained who you are. Somebody can watch your show for the last 10 years you know other than a faux pas in the 2016 election you've basically been the same person. You know I've been the same person consistently through that deal but I mean this just goes back six seven years you see this guy and all of a sudden now you mother god and yeah again dude. That's quite a transformation. I mean he became a whole new person. He really did. I think he's in the hair growth. Whatever he put on there to make the fro grow is what I mean the soul glow melted into his brain and just saturated in there and again he let that soul glow. So I just I'm I'm trying to decide is he a grifter or are these young kids. They're just they're so they're vulnerable. They're hearing all of these you know radical ideas from people that they trust or maybe or maybe he's seen that Al Sharpton still owes the IRS $4 million and is making bank day in and day out. Perhaps you know he's kind of seen how the thing works. He may probably not stupid at all. I don't think he's stupid. Yeah yeah but yeah he's he's learned how the game works. And yet all of the sheep all of the lemmings will follow him right into as you know as we saw with the. See like what I was. Hold on hold on. That fateful day. Faithful day that day of March 30th or 31st. Shame on me. I can't remember the worst day in American history. The day democracy almost died. Yeah we got it back. So good. I wish that while he's speaking there at the Unitarian Church in Memphis that suddenly they would just play a clip of him going hi guys I'm Ron for president so I can bring the Democrats and the Republicans the gala on our college campus. It's gonna be fantastic y'all. Let's bring that clip up there and just play it over. Mother God. Mother God you have brought me from soul men of hardships such as this. Hi kids I just want to share all my how will we treat with you. Yeah it's a little bit of a transformation. A little bit. Let's be some money in it. A little bit. Not just as you pointed out not just in speech and looks and all of that and demeanor. Messaging. Messaging. That messaging was one of unification. Now he's leading an insurrection on the Tennessee Capitol and not even at all sorry about it. Sure mother God will be so sweet to him. Mother God I think he maybe needs to relook at that bible that I'm sure he doesn't own. I'd like to sit down with him too. You know you want to sit down with a lot of these. I don't I don't want to be in the same room with them. I don't want to share a country with them. I don't want to share a planet with them so good for you I guess. I just want a mock and ridicule them. Well okay that's fair but I do also do that. All right let's take another quick break. We'll be back with more. We want to thank pure health and you know who knows about taking care of your liver or who should know about taking care of their liver the most. It's chad afraid. I do.

You know on the show we often talk about the I don't know trepidation from some conservatives some in the GOP who say you know Ukraine is like kind of a I don't know they're not the good guys necessarily engage in a lot of corruption historically and this little Russia Ukraine conflict maybe we shouldn't keep funding. I'm a little concerned with the billions and billions of dollars that keep being sent there when we can't you know pay for Americans that we have here. Perhaps we should like take a step back and stop trying to provoke World War III. Well House Speaker Kevin McCarthy would not be in agreement with you because he just recently pledged his full scale support for Biden's war policies in Ukraine saying we must win their watch. I want to play something that Speaker McCarthy said because he it seemed to at least shift a perception of where he is on the issue of Ukraine. Let me play it. I think what's happening in Ukraine is a trusty and I think Ukraine not just Ukraine the world has to win there what Russia has done is wrong in a phrase that I use a blank check I use that for anything. I look at every dollar of taxpayers that we would use but the one thing I know that in Ukraine we have to win because it also would save Taiwan at the same time. Would it? Would it? Yeah would it? We? Who's we? I didn't sign up sign off on the kids. I mean they got to go fight this you know keeps going down the line the way it is. We have to win we have to win there. When are they just going to say that when like this is it's a proxy war and it's a poorly hidden proxy war at this point so like why don't you just come out and say it because we all see it. Yeah I yeah yeah and we know he's a warmonger there's money in it so they're going to do that. He's going to spin the rhetoric the way they I just finished a book this this week about the end of World War II specifically the Eastern front the Germans against the Russians Western front when the Russians were just 40 miles from Berlin and the atrocities that the Russians were committing against the German citizens and German soldiers it is like the Germans we know how bad they were in World War II and the Russians although we were allied with them for the same purpose to beat the Germans if you read about their atrocities you have to sit back and you look and you go okay who were the good guys in in this at in World War II between the Russians or the Germans pick one neither one of them were good now Russia served our purposes in that you know they helped us defeat the Germans in that regard but this is why General Patton said we need to keep on going and hit the Russians too right and they ultimately killed him for it but this is the kind of thing that I was reminded of when I was reading that book and I was like you know everybody said okay we got to pick a side we got to pick a side there are no good guys in this deal no and what it's going to end up doing is we're going to continue funding this deal because there's money in it they're going to keep laundering your taxpayer dollars back into their own pockets in DC as well as make people like Zelensky rich and yeah while I do feel bad for Ukrainian citizens I feel I feel bad for American citizens especially this generation is going to have to go over there and put boots on the ground fight this war and why because you believe in it well it's just fascinating we've talked about this on your show before which by the way everyone should be subscribed to and you know watch whether we on on Blaistv or YouTube it comes on right after this program but it's just fascinating that they use that excuse that like well we you know that we have to make sure that Ukrainians taken care of it's like how many other countries are there around the world that have invasions this is happening in Africa right now in Africa all over the place and we don't butt our noses in there yeah so gosh what's the difference it's either you don't like black people or it's that this is financially you know somehow lucrative for you it is lucrative right because again it's from Russia is which is you know is our cold war enemy and that's you can easily drum up you know that fear of the Reds there and of course Ukraine they they put Zelensky out there as the poster child for the persecuted and so it it's it's a money maker I mean it's appealing definitely the imagery of it I don't see a whole lot of battle scenes from Ukraine emerging I mean every now and then you can search out and find something where something happened there but I like yeah I mean I can easily find footage from Vietnam or you know Kuwait I can find it from any of the desert wars that we fought Afghanistan I can find footage of all of that stuff but it seems to be lacking in this whole Ukraine debacle at the same time we have people who are very important people like you know Nancy Pelosi when she was speaker the house you've got Joe Biden visiting you've got like you two yeah you two oh no visiting all these people showing up for these charity concerts and it's just as fascinating to me because it they get the hell out of there after so but if it's that dangerous why are all these important people going wouldn't they choose to meet in an alternate location if it's that dangerous and that big of a deal why is Zelensky stopping what he's doing to go pose for GQ magazine with his wife it's really fascinating to me yeah I think it was pho but whatever whatever shut up Joe right shut up you know what it's a news thing man just get it right um I'm protecting you uh you know it just the point remains everything everything said it all when Kamala Harris and and at the time speaker the house Nancy Pelosi were holding a Ukrainian flag in the house of congress they're uh behind Zelensky speaking on the house floor that that's that tells you everything you need to know oh and a GOP representative introduced a bill to put a bust of Vladimir Zelensky in con I swear in congress I swear it was one of the Carolinas I got a joke I can't tell yeah who was it control it was it was South Carolina I believe representative oh GOP representative yeah that's how bad it is um all right we we got it I think Chad's about to his head's about to explode we got to take a break we'll be right back you catch me on security camera well Chad we've only got a little bit of time left here and I'd like to introduce you to Sofia Rebecca this is of course a grown man who was accepted into the what is this the prestigious Royal Academy of dance as a ballerina let's see some of his beautiful elegant graceful moves watch see the camera shake hit the floor it's not supposed to happen in ballet oh wow look at that hmm oh that is graceful but did he feel graceful hmm he did feel it he did look at that he did feel it wow I am so glad that a woman was robbed of a spot at the Royal Academy of dance for this gigantic clown I'm going to encourage people to watch my show tonight because I have very specific things to say about this but uh you know I'm a father of a professional dancer before the jokes come in a legit ballerina I mean she's professionally classically trained she went to school to do it she had four-year degree in dancing it has a great career going because of it uh this is amazing to me to watch this I mean they don't care they'll destroy womanhood they'll destroy the arts they'll destroy everything they can with this and and I mean this is like watching a dancing bear at the Moscow focus right here you mentioned the camera shake it's like no that ain't the way it's supposed to happen you're not supposed to stop it oh so bad well we appreciate you guys uh you know going through the crazy times with us chat thank you yep see you all tomorrow stream and subscribe to more blaze media content at the blaze.com slash podcasts"
