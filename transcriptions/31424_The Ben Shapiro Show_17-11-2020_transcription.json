That makes Owens the 12th GOP challenger to unseat his incumbent Democratic opponent during the 2020 election As the Republican Party continues to cut into the Democrats house majority. This is Tim Pierce at Daily Wire reporting Owens announced that McAdams had conceded the race in a tweet on Monday evening He said I received a call from McAdams He expressed appreciation for the opportunity to serve the Utah fourth district and his commitment to a smooth transition my sincere Thanks to him for both thanks to my fellow Utahns I am committed to have an open ear to serve you. Thank you for the opportunity that is a big pickup That was supposed to be a race that was fairly easily won by McAdams and in the late polling Burgess was down and he ended up winning the race Demonstrating once more that the Republican Party wildly outperformed expectations in this particular election Nancy Pelosi wildly underperformed the Democratic Party has a real problem on its hands regardless of what happens in the presidential race Which again, there's still legal cases outstanding Whatever happens there Democrats have a real problem. They have a real problem So long as Republicans actually go out and vote in Georgia So I'm going to remind you right now if you are a Republican You need to give money to David Perdue in Georgia and to Kelly Leflorn in Georgia Because the last thing that you want is the specter of a 50 50 Senate with presumably Kamala Harris presiding as Joe Biden's vice president and breaking ties That is the last thing you could possibly want checking the ambitions of the Democratic Party is a must at this point So you need like there's no time to rest on your laurels There is no time to Fominate about stuff that has already happened instead you need to focus on what's coming up January 5th There is a double election in Georgia David Perdue Kelly Leflorn. They deserve your support. They deserve your money They deserve your time The Democrats must be defeated in those Senate races. Okay. Meanwhile speaking of Georgia yesterday 2600 votes were discovered in Floyd County They had not originally been tallied and they did reduce the deficit that Trump has to Joe Biden in the state According to the Atlantic Journal Constitution Trump could gain nearly 800 net votes from the discovered ballots There were 1643 new votes for Trump and 865 for Biden According to the Atlantic Journal Constitution The problem occurred because county election officials did not upload votes from a memory card in a ballot scanning machine It's according to Gabrielle Sterling the state's voting system manager. He called it an amazing blender He said the county's election director director should resign He said it's not equipment issue. It's a person not executing their job properly This is the kind of situation that requires a change at the top of their management side The previously uncounted votes were cast during in-person early voting at the Floyd County administrative building Which includes the county elections office said Luke Martin chairman of the Floyd county republican party Over half of the 5,000 printed out ballots cast on an optical scanner. We're not initially recorded Martin said it's very concerning this doesn't appear to be a widespread issue I'm glad the audit revealed it. It's important that all votes are counted The ballots will be rescanned and tabulated before the results are finalized on friday's and state elections director chris harvey He said you want every vote counted right the first time that is one of the goals of the audit to identify problems All the votes will be uploaded the results will be And what they are So The the state is insisting that the audit is exactly what found it anyway that it wasn't trump Putting pressure that found these additional votes eric ericson tweeted out about this he said this was a scanner malfunction It wasn't a machinery per se a human error in scanning ballots, but most counties still align identically with the machine count at this point Right, he has an entire thread about dominion voting systems in georgia And he uh, he says that he talked with the georgia secretary of state about signature issue He says that georgia verified signatures for absentee ballot applications Not just the ballots themselves the applications were matched with both the voters drivers license and their voter registration card So georgia has actually been attempting to verify that people requested the ballots legally It's not just that they filled out the ballots legally, but that they requested the ballots legally Apparently lindsey gram asked specifically about this this pissed off the georgia secretary of state who then suggested openly that lindsey gram wanted to exclude legal ballots It turns out that that's not true But according to the the guy's name is raffins burger This was reported by a mediaite in their conversation gram questioned raffins burger about the state's signature matching law and whether political bias could have prompted poll workers to accept ballots with non matching signatures according to raffins burger Graham also asked whether raffins burger had the power to toss all mail ballots in counties Founds have higher rates of non matching signatures according to raffins burger Raffins burger said he was stunned that gram appeared to suggest that he find a way to toss legally cast a ballot That is not what gram says gram says no no I was just asking if there is a way to toss ballots that are not legally requested Or in which there is no way to verify the matching signature in any case The process is working as the process should work Eric Erickson points out that all claims of dead people voting in Georgia have thus far been the bonk He says no dead person has actually voted in Georgia He says contrary to claims about dominion voting systems the hand count in Georgia aligned perfectly with the machine counts There could not have been hacked machines in Georgia altering votes for joe biden as according to eric erickson Who does a show down there on wsb? obviously the biden camp meanwhile Is a demonstrating full scale what the real corruption in this election was and it has very little to do with the voting systems Again, we have legal cases that are proceeding we have allegations for sindy powell the lawyer for president Trump she has suggested that she is about to release the kraken Which of course is a very colorful phrase and here's my view of this go ahead and release it seriously like We're all waiting like republican democrat Everybody's waiting the democrats are waiting because they want to say that you're lying and republicans are waiting because the evidence Would actually be really great at this point you're gonna make big allegations like that Then it's time to actually release all the evidence that you've got not to interviews about it release the I mean It's not like we have a huge timeline here We're gonna get states certifying their election results as early as the end of this week or early next week So like now would be the time to release the kraken if you're going to do this But the real corruption in the election is perfectly obvious as i've said from the beginning the real corruption in this election is the media The media simply refused to cover anything they did not want to cover And they just didn't cover it according to sam stein Reporting about the daily bees the daily bees head of peace all about joe biden online Sam stein who reports for the daily bees now He says according to biden campaign metrics online chatter about the hundred biden's story during the elections last week Was greater than it was around hillary's emails during the last month of 2016 the difference it never spilled over into mainstream outlets Oh, you think oh you think so the fact is that You are now bragging the biden campaign is now bragging that they were able to suppress information That was bad for joe biden that mainstream media decided to do the dirty work of the biden campaign by not allowing Well reported and factual stories to emerge into the public view because mainstream media never jumped on it mainstream media just decided it was more important to defeat trump than to report truly reported stories I mean we all knew this was the case The fact is that the biden campaign and the media are one and the same you can see it Right joe biden is now doing these press conferences and every question in the press conference is how wonderful are you joe biden? We are back to the obama era in the obama era the press walked around holding drool cups for barak obama Now we are back there and they're walking around holding drool cups for joe biden And so which both of them are drawing they're drooling biden because he's falling apart and the media because they're drooling over joe biden And then trying Straining to get themselves enthusiastic about common arias which is a good luck with that gang According to the daily beast fearing a redox of the disastrous end of campaign implosion of hillary clinton The team dove further into the research what they found was more assuring while the hunter biden story had taken off on facebook YouTube and various right wing sites it had not crossed over into mains from outlets The campaigns internal polling meanwhile showed that voters largely weren't persuaded by it The wildfire ended up being mostly smoked but even so it provided the biden campaign with yet another reminder about the perils that social media platforms present to democrats As they traverse the modern political landscape Let it be known. This is why democrats are attempting To quash the social media companies democrats would love nothing better than for social media companies to act as their Suppressive wing stopping stories from trending preventing people from disseminating information They do not like right that is the future of battle that is the informational battle that we are going to be about to wage in this country The platforms are now being perverted by democrats They're being threatened by democrats that if they do not suppress information democrats don't like then democrats themselves will go in and break up these major corporations Or regulate those corporations and these corporations facebook twitter youtube they are responding predictably by catering to the left and hoping for the good will of the right They're responding by suppressing exactly the information left wants and hoping that the rights focus in on free markets and free speech Will prevent the right from Siding with the left in regulating these companies they can only count on the kindness of people who are bad Who are you are clubbing about the ears for so long? And there will be a breaking point here with the right Right there's going to come a point where the right says to these social media companies Listen We're like batman at the end of batman begins Right we we're not going to kill you but we don't have to save you and that is the direction in which all of this is moving Okay in just a minute We are getting to the healing of the democratic party and we have been told that there's a healing time lots of healing going on cultural healing We'll get to that healing in just one second. It does not appear that a lot of healing is going on first Let us talk about your sleep quality. So I will admit my baby woke me up at 5 30 this morning It was not fantastic But between the time I went to bed and the time that my child awoke me I did sleep well why because I was on a helix sleep mattress Helix sleep they make a mattress just for you it is personalized to you They've a quiz it takes just two minutes to complete and they match your body type and sleep preferences to the perfect mattress for you Whether you're a side sleeper or a hot sleeper, whether you like a plush or a firm bed with helix There's no more confusion and no more compromising helix sleep It's rated the number one mattress by gq and wired magazine cnn has called the most comfortable mattress They've ever slept on just head on over to helix sleep calm slash ben take their two minute sleep quiz They will match you so customize mattress that'll give you the best sleep of your life I've got a 10 year warranty you get to try it out for 100 nights at risk free I'll even pick it up for you if you don't love it, but you absolutely will helix is offering up to 200 bucks off all mattress orders for our listeners Get up to 200 bucks off at helix sleep calm slash ben again that is helix sleep Dot com slash ben go check them out right now You need a high quality mattress so your sleep quality is better Why not have it personalized to you just like everything else in your life We live in a time of personalization personal personalize the mattress that you are sleeping on eight hours a night Go check them out right now helix sleep dot com slash ben and get up to 200 bucks off when you use That code helix sleep dot com slash ben one final note When it comes to voting in georgia and media bias So the media have been trying out this narrative ever since the election that stacey abrams won the state of georgia for joebiden Nope, nope. They just keep trying to make fetch happen And fetch is not happening guys. You can you can keep saying this over and over and over But fetch just not as thin it is not a thing According to nate cone at the new york times georgia is the first state where they now have a fully updated vote history It shows the black share of the electorate falling to its lowest levels since 2006 So the black share of the electorate black share of all voters actually dropped precipitously From 2018 to 2020 The black share of the electorate in georgia It was about 29 percent it dropped all the way down to 27 percent this time around Okay, but we keep hearing that it was stacey abrams registering black voters all over the state that drove joebiden to vectrine No, it was not It was the suburbs it was white suburban women did not vote for donald trump And so georgia went the wrong way for donald trump in the current vote count Okay, but it's ame it's amusing to watch the media continue to prop up stacey abrams as a thing She's not a thing. She never was a thing. She lost her gubernatorial race by 50 000 votes in that state And then she went around claiming she was governor of georgia the dnc touted her as the elected governor of georgia after losing by 50 000 votes And then if you say to the media by the way, you know, you guys keep feeding stacey abrams like fe ti I entry you keep feeding stacey abrams you keep praising her even though she continues to maintain that she was Ripped off and deprived of her gubernatorial seat in georgia At the same time that she's going on tv claiming that Donald trump is a whiner Like you guys this is you guys you guys keep doing this like no no no you're not allowed to talk about that So just a data point there stacey abrams was not in fact the person who drove georgia out of the republican lane In the presidential race so please stop trying to make stacey abrams happen It's not a thing. Okay, meanwhile the democrats have proclaimed it's a new era of healing and unity, right? This is joe biden's line joe biden after he uh after he gave his quasi victory address obviously precipitously because not a single state has yet been declared joe biden came out and he said that he's all for unity it's time for america to come together and it's time to heal So i have a question at what point is he gonna say to his own party guys you need to stop being jackasses I seriously that'd be good. We talked about this yesterday We had rioting and we had people beating each other up blm antifa in washington dc During this trump rally over the weekend And members of joe biden's own party Are going around basically suggesting that everybody who disagrees with them is a member of the kkk So at some point is joe biden going to calm the waters on his own side See that there used to be a thing called a systis soldier moment back during the 1992 campaign. There was a little known rapper named systis soldier And she made some rather racially charged comments and bill clinton kind of picked her out of a hat because he wanted to make this move And he he proceeded to make her famous by saying that this sort of rhetoric is not acceptable and not okay That was his move to the moderate lane bill clinton's Okay Well, when does joe biden actually move to the moderate lane by chiding people on his own side? For castigating everybody who disagrees with them as a plan member so illhan omar Right truly a terrible human being illhan omar is a rabid anti-semit Um, they're they're credible allegations that she has repeatedly funneled a bevy of money to her uh to her boyfriend Or at least her boyfriend's firm In violation of campaign finance law We'll check out those allegations, but those allegations heaven floating around for quite a while and seem to be mounting in any case Ilhan omar the person who hoses on the cover of magazines with nancy plosie before declaring that for the jews It's all about the benjamins. She says that donald trump rallies are like clan rallies I can feel all the peace in the healing can't you so much peace and healing happening to Speak about me at every single rally didn't really matter where he was Uh, sometimes multiple times in a day Um as he had held his clan rallies throughout the country other clan rallies now You see more than tens of thousands of people show up for rallies for donald trump those are clan rallies Which is strange because there are a lot of people of color at those at those particular supposed clan rallies Which don't actually seem a lot like clan rallies Okay, but it's not just illhan omar the media obviously believe this deeply as well Brian williams suggest that trump voters are tyranny curious brian williams on msnbc It's trump voters who are interested in tyranny Which is weird because I keep hearing from the democratic party that they want to run nearly every aspect of my life But it's trump voters who are tyranny curious here's brian williams fake journalist As you look at home from there and when you come home on your next visit Do you view it as a changed country because millions of people Uh decided maybe over time like the frog boiling experiment to become at least tyranny curious See you see trump voters are so now we know from elhan omar that they are clan members Now we know from brian williams that trump voters are tyranny curious and we also know from wopi golberg that republicans literally don't care If you die they don't care at all they want you to die now This has been a line democrats been using ever since paul ryan They literally cut an ad I believe it was back in 2010 in which Paul ryan was like throwing an old lady off a cliff or something in any case here is wopi golberg suggesting the republicans don't care if you die I can feel the healing can you feel the healing power of new happening right now? I feel it. I think it's all warm and cuddly and here's wopi golberg saying that the republicans just want people to die That's what all of this is and when you go into vote in georgia remember This is the party that doesn't care if you drop dead because you can't breathe Clearly they know what has to happen and they're not doing it weird because uh, I am Reliably informed that half of the democratic legislature of california Just traveled over to malley for a conference then traveled back and didn't quarantine So yeah, no, it's it's uh and by the way a lot of people died in new york in new york and new jersey and but it's the republicans And to always the republicans, okay in just a second We're gonna get to the gaslighting of the american people because at root so much of what's going on is the gaslighting of the american people It's an attempt to get you to shut up there is a process that is used to get you to shut up particularly if you're a culturally Conservative that we need to talk about okay, we'll get to that in just one second first Let's talk about the fact that right now. Nuns are flying off the shells. They haven't flying off the shells for a while I wonder why might it be the fostering of chaos in america's major cities Might it be the fact that the media and the democratic party are fully willing to overlook violence so long It is this violence that aligns with their political worldview Well, whatever your reason you might be looking for a gun and when the framers wrote the constitution The first thing they did was to make sacred your right to keep and bear arms Right, this is the thing that they were focused on at heart They knew that all your other rights are protected by that particular right owning a rifle is a heavy responsibility building rifles is no different Bravo company manufacturing builds a professional grade product which is built to combat standards That's because bcm believes the same level of protection should be provided to every american regardless if they're a private citizen or a professional The people at bcm assume when a rifle leaves their shop it can be used in a life or death situation by a responsible citizen law enforcement officer or soldier overseas So every component of a bcm rifle is hand-assembled and tested by americans They understand that you're not buying a gun because you really want to go target shooting you need it in case god forbid you need it So this is why you should check out bravo company manufacturing head on over to bravo company mfg.com you can discover more about their products special offers and Upcoming news that is bravo company mfg.com if you need more convincing find out even more about bcm and the awesome folks who make their products at youtube.com Company usa okay, so There's a gaslighting project that is that is happening in real time the gaslighting project is designed to shut you up You yes you right whether it is abigail shrier writing a book on why it is bad to transition young children from male to female through hormone therapy Or whether it is matt eglaseus, right? He's just a mainstream left guy Basically leaving his own publication. There's an attempt to shut down debate. There's an attempt to shut you up It is particularly directed at conservatives Okay, there's a process that the left has been using for quite a while and it is quite effective process So let me describe the process of getting you personally to shut up because I know that you felt this in your regular life Right you felt this from your peers you feel this from your bosses you feel this from the media Okay, so here is the process the process goes like this is basically a three step process The first the first move is for people to tell you that if you voice your opinion you're being not nice See what the left understands about conservatives is that conservatives generally value decency They generally value politeness Right conservatives tend to believe that decency and niceness and politeness. These are virtues These are good qualities now It's very easy to shift from being nice and being polite and being decent into a belief that this means being inoffensive Right because if you're nice typically that means that you're not offending anybody Right you're being a nice person that means that you're not offending anybody But there is a difference between being decent and being and being inoffensive There's a wide difference in conservative philosophy Sometimes you actually have to try people when they do the wrong thing It's actually a biblical maxim is that you're not supposed to You're not supposed to ignore it when your friend sins you're supposed to try to him and correct him But it is very easy to fall into the trap because it's seductive of basically saying that i'm a nice guy And so i'm never going to say anything offensive And so what the left does is they simply deem anything that you are saying offensive and thus You have you have now violated the niceness principle you're no longer nice You're no longer decent you're no longer kind Right they understand that you want to be kind and you want to be nice And so if they act offended that's a way of shutting you up Right so a way of saying your principles are offensive to me so you should be quiet Okay, then they push even further Okay, because you might say well, yes, you're offended But your offense is really not the main thing the question is is what i'm saying true or is it not Right, you might say like i do facts don't care about your feelings and it's not Mean to simply state a fact So what the left instead does instead does is they conflate offense and harm Right, this is the second step of shutting you up The first step is you're not being nice and you say well, it's not about niceness or not niceness I'm it's there's nothing mean about saying something true They say no no it's not just that you're being offensive And that you should be inoffensive. It is that you're harming me right they conflate offense with harm Right you are now harming me you're saying something that harms me and therefore you should shut up Because it's one thing for you to be not nice. It's another thing for you to be harmful and cruel And this is why the left spins up every offense into a deep-seated harm This is where you get the language of microaggressions on college campus Right, I say something that is factual and now you get very offended and you don't just say that you are offended You say that I have harmed you. I've addressed you I've done something that infringes on your ability to see yourself the way you want to see yourself And this is an actual harm to you. It's an emotional harm to you and therefore I should shut up I violated the non-harm JSNL principle Okay, so step one was you're not being nice step two is you're actively harming me So you need to be quiet Okay, and that brings us to step three right step three is silence is violence Right step three so we went from you should be quiet to be nice to you should be quiet because you're harming me too You being quiet is the problem Now when folks on the left say silence is violence What they don't mean is we want you to speak freely What they mean is we want you to speak and repeat exactly what we are about to tell you And if you do not mirror our preference if you're not celebrate our preference If you're not celebrate our political points of view, this means that you are a bad person Right and now you're being not nice. You're being harmful Silence is violence. You are actually acting in a violent way by refusing to go along with what we are saying It's the signfellowed age ribbon episode Right if you just refuse to wear the ribbon that in and of itself is the crime because you're not repeating You're not joining the cause and this is the ibram x-kenya routine where it's not enough to not be racist You have to be anti-racist you have to repeat all of the bull crap that ibram x-kenya Spuse in order for you to be considered anti-racist So we went all the way from we don't want you to express your viewpoint to we want you to positively express our viewpoint So that is the process and the process always begins with you're not being nice Okay, so you're not being nice that first step Usually is implicated when the left does something controversial so left has this gaslighting thing Okay gaslighting is this phenomenon it comes from an old movie from the 1940s with charles boya and engrae Bergman the Movies about a woman who is being driven crazy by her husband He wants her to commit suicide so he can take her inheritance And so he changes the the light on the gaslight every night and then tells her he has not done so right to drive her nuts That's what gaslighting means gaslighting is where you know something is going on But people around you are telling you that it's not going on right? That's what gaslighting is so the left engages in this gaslighting the way that they engage in the gaslighting is they do something controversial They say something controversial they push a controversial point of view they celebrate this controversial point of view and then if you Say no, I disagree they say ah you're not being nice. You're being offensive. You're causing harm Right, that's up. You're a bad person. How could you how could you? You get this phenomenon a lot in for example, los angeles The kind of attention seeking behavior that you see very often and then if you pay attention to the behavior they go Why are you paying attention? Why are you because you asked me to pay attention? Right, this is all leading up to a discussion of Harry Styles by the way if you are not aware where this is going There's a there's a thing that happens very often in places like l.a. Where you walk into a you walk into a coffee bean And the barista has pink hair and a ring on the nose and a ring on the ear and a chain connecting both connecting all the way to the other ear And then you you kind of look for a moment too long and the person looks at you and says, what are you looking at? Well, it feels like you were seeking attention when you decided to connect a chain from your ear to your nose to your other ear Well, that's an actual overt sign that you might want like your hair is shockingly bright pink I feel like you might want some attention there and then it's like, well, why are you paying attention? Why are you paying attention? Well, that's why we're paying attention. The paying attention is not the sin If you want to act that way to free country you can act that way But us paying attention to having opinions is not in fact a violation of the niceness principle nor Is it an excuse to silence other people? Okay, this brings us to the Harry Styles issue We'll get to that in just one moment But first let's talk about the fact that as dudes a lot of your identity might be wrapped up in your hair Not your pink hair it might be wrapped up in like actually having hair and as men age they tend to bald Okay, this is just one of the realities of life Male pattern baldness is a genetic thing and most men start losing hair in their in their 20s and in their early 30s Well now there's keeps two out of three dudes are going to experience some form of male pattern baldness by the time they're 35 The best way to prevent hair loss is to do something about it while you still have hair left You used to have to go to the doctor's office for your hair loss prescription now thanks to keeps you can visit a doctor online and get hair loss medication delivered directly to your home They make it easy.

I don't care about him I honestly as I say like my only experience like knowing who he is is that he was in a christopher nolan film But he did this photoshoot with vogue in which he dressed garishly in a bunch of women's clothing and he looks like an idiot And let's just put that out there straight up front He looks like a moron Okay, because men wearing women's dresses typically that's like there's a reason that bugs bunny plays it for comic effect When he puts on a dress to fool elmer fud Right, it's inherently funny. We're not talking here about a guy who's identifying as transgender and has gender dysphoria or something This is a this is just a regular dude putting on a dress Okay, and can we use like a bit of common sense here that that's at least strange It's something different and by the way vogue knows that it's strange and something different See here's where the gaslighting comes in vogue treats. This is groundbreaking and wonderful Now in your regular life if somebody that you let's say that you're a married woman and your husband comes through the door wearing one of your gowns Would your first reaction be I love how you're bending gender norms, honey Fabio I asked our uh our hair and makeup person fabiola Without this and her reaction. I thought was it was on the mark. She said my husband walked through the door wearing one of my dresses I would punch him Okay fair fair enough fair enough But in any case, I'm not saying that anybody who wears a dress should be punch. I'm just saying what fabiola said Okay, I'm just reporting to you the facts in any case Harry styles is wearing these Bizarre garish outfits and we are told this is very brave incredibly brave It's not just that he put on these outfits by the way We know that this is playing with stereotypes and redefining masculinity right that is the goal here It is the overt goal because if this were just about you know, I like to wear a creative clothing He'd put on like a panabair suit or something Or you seem walking around in like a finding Nemo costume But he's not he's wearing a dress and the reason he's wearing a dress is because he's trying to violate preconceived notions about masculine Okay, and vogue makes this perfectly clear So we are told by various interview subjects that styles cross-dressing represents quote the image of a new era Of the way that a man can look Okay And that the pop star is quote redefining what it can mean to be a man with confidence Uh, you see the most confident men are the ones who are dresses The more confident you are in your masculinity the more you can afford to be not masculine In fact, the highest form of masculinity is to completely castrate yourself That would actually be the highest form of masculinity because if you do that that shows how masculine you are because you had to have balls to take them off Right? I mean that really is the highest form of masculinity is to do things that make you as As little masculine as humanly possible. That's that's the mark of manhood Okay, the actress Olivia wiles has quote I hope that this brand of confidence as a male that harry has truly devoid of any traces of toxic masculinity Is indicative of his generation and therefore the future of the world I think he is in many ways championing that spearheading that it's pretty powerful kind of extraordinary to see someone in his position Redefining what it can mean to be a man with confidence. Oh, that's okay. So first of all, it's not just devoid of toxic masculinity is devoid of any masculinity Okay, this is not It there's nothing masculine about this in fact the whole point here is to rob Masculinity of its masculine side right that is the entire point The point is to redefine masculinity to now include doing feminine things if it were just about a man being confident to wear what he wants to wear Then he'd be out there like boar at in a banana hammock or something right? But that's not what he's doing Right? What he's doing instead is he's putting on a dress because he's trying to mix up the stereotypes of male and female So this is an attention seeking behavior Right? This is harry styles with the pink hair and the nose ring and the and the chain going from ear to ear Right? That's that's what this is and it is overtly a political attempt to shift the definition of masculinity I'm not making this up. Don't be gaslit by the left. It says what? Why are you making a big because you made a big deal out of it You don't get to crash a car and then when I look at the car crash say hey, look there's a car crash ago There's no car crash. What are you even looking at? You guys are the ones making a political point out of a dude wearing a dress And I am saying I think that your political point is stupid because it is stupid Okay, so that that gaslighting attempt is really irritating so We'll get to what candace had to say and then where I had to say about this in just a moment because There is a broader point to be made if the left is going to now decline Is now going to claim That being a man wearing a dress is the highest form of masculinity because you have shed toxic masculinity And then I say I think that this is a perversion of masculinity because feminizing males Is not the goal of being masculine masculine and feminine have definitions It is good for men to be masculine. It is a good thing to train boys to be masculine And then for masculinity to be tempered by civilization Right for all of human history Ambowned Has had very very negative effects right masculinity unbound from anything like responsibility The aggressive instinct that is inherent in males generally speaking Unbound from civilization and civilizing influences and traditional judo-Christian morality has had dire dire effects Okay, but Masculinity has also done incredibly great things for the world Assertiveness has meant progress. Assertiveness has meant growth Assertiveness has meant defense of family and hearth and home And has meant prosperity right masculinity is a good thing for civilizations and civilizations that decide to essentially Defenestrate masculinity are going to bear some pretty ill effects Now if you make that point the left says you have to shut up. You're not being nice right now You're being offensive so do something outrageous Somebody else comments on the outrageous thing you should shut up. Don't don't comment on the outrageous thing celebrate The outrageous thing or silence is violence Now we're gonna get to the actual analysis of this particular issue in a second because masculinity is important What the left wants to do is rewrite masculinity. They do not want to to fight toxic masculinity They want to fight masculinity itself Right being a man is a bad thing unless you are treating manhood as actually acting In feminine ways because feminine masculine have definitions We'll get to that in one second Confusion is the goal here because if they were to make this argument straight up that men should act like women That men should don dresses and act just like women Everybody would realize how stupid this is so instead they've decided to deliberately confuse the terminology first They say masculine and feminine are categories True and then they say feminine and masculine are not categories and if you point out their categories then it's because you're some sort of bigot So it's all self-contradictory crap. We'll get to that in just one second first Let us talk about the fact that if you are looking for a great sleep quality It's not just enough to have your keel sleep mattress You also need to have an excellent set of sheets What do millions of americans and three former us presidents have in common? They all agree that bull and brand sheets are the softest most comfortable pure organic cotton sheets on earth Bull and branch cotton is rain fed pesticide-free and carries the highest organic certification Which is why it is so soft because they work with family-owned mills all over the world to expertly weave every set of bull and brand sheets But the highest levels of craftsmanship is quality you can feel the moment you open the box I love my bull and brand sheets.

Okay, we're gonna get to more of this in a second the gas lighting Which does have again broader ramifications for our public discussions We'll get to that in just a second first If you are not already disgusted by the mainstream media Yeah, absolutely should be it is obvious that they were 10 points to Joe Biden in that election cycle They lied about every single narrative they continue to lie about every single narrative Just because CNN MSNBC even Fox News declares something that doesn't necessarily make the narrative true It means that media outlets push a narrative that very often they find beneficial Not only that the media has already shifted from demonizing Trump and his supporters to flattering Joe Biden and Kamala Harris before they've even taken office If you watched Joe Biden's presser yesterday, the media basically just acted as sycophantic lapdogs So we are back to the Obama era If you're sick of the media feeding you a narrative replace your cable and your new subscriptions with the daily wire We have big plans for the next four years It starts today Candace Owens, New York Times bestselling author founder of the blexet foundation is joining the daily wire Where she'll be launching a brand new show with us early next year We'll also be launching an entertainment channel like with actual movies and tv a new investigative journalism team Building partnerships with like-minded content creators like preggar you Their entire show library will be available to daily wire.com members by the end of the year We're building up an alternative to the mainstream media a replacement for the mainstream media Join us because not only are you helping us You're also helping to destroy the legacy media that have crafted this entire narrative Around the idea that you're a bad person right now just to show you we're serious We're offering 25 off all memberships with code election over at daily wire.com slash subscribe Members get our articles ad-free access to all of our live broadcasting show library The full three hours of the bench a pyro show exclusive readers past content available only to daily wire members If you're considering an all-access membership you get to join us on all access live every night for live stream discussions With our hosts and an amazing online community You also get not one but two leftist years tumblers with your membership as well as early sometimes exclusive access to new daily wire products So remember that's 25 percent off all memberships with code election over at daily wire.com slash subscribe replace the legacy media with daily wire You're not going to regret it. You're listening to the largest fastest growing conservative podcast and radio show in the nation Okay, so a couple of obvious stipulations up front men have always done cross-dressing There've always been some segment of men who cross-dressed very often it was played for comedy And the entire premise of some like it hot is that it is funny when men cross-dressed That is not what the Harry Styles photo shoot is about Right there have been pop stars have done this before David Bowie wearing a dress They always look like idiots by the way you always look ridiculous But the whole point is to be transgressive right? But what we are seeing with the Vogue article is not just an attempt to be transgressive obviously It's an attempt to redefine masculinity itself. I mean this is overt in the article I'm not making it up. I already read you the segments from the Vogue magazine article Okay, so my friend cana so one's tweets out quote There is no society that can survive without strong men the east knows this in the west the steady feminization of our men At the same time that marxism is being taught to our children is not a coincidence. It is an outright attack bring back manly men Okay, I I I'm not sure what exactly is controversial about this that masculinity is a good and important thing when channel properly It requires men to defend family it requires men to provide It requires men to channel their aggressive instincts towards defense of values and civilization That that is it requires assertiveness Masculters thought will talks about masculinity in exactly these sorts of terms harvey man's field has an excellent book called manliness All about masculinity and what distinguishes it from femininity now It's not that the left doesn't acknowledge these are qualities the left fully acknowledges the qualities of masculinity and femininity Right, which is why they suggest that there are a wide variety of genders because they suggest that a man can be very feminine And this actually makes him a woman right so they agree that this means that there is such a thing as masculinity and femininity They then just suggest that men should act like women right that men should masculinity should be made more feminine and candice disagrees She says that when you make men more feminine when you suggest that men need to be like women they need to wear dresses right that this Underminds some fundamentally good thing about men In the same way that if you said that women ought to act like men It's funny if you say that women ought to act more like men This is considered sexist because it actually is sexist But if you say that men ought to act more like women, this is considered progressive and forward-thinking The attempt to feminize men is ongoing on the left Okay, so this prompted me to defend canis's comment And I said this is perfectly obvious anyone who pretends it is not a referendum on masculinity for men to don't fluffy dresses And then be celebrated by magazines like vogue is gaslighting you Masculinity and femininity are categories they exist Right some behavior is more masculine like punching people in the face some behavior is more feminine like wearing fluffy dresses Right there are many different forms of masculinity and femininity and most important form of femininity is bearing and rearing children Okay, that is something that is endemic biologically to female mammals of all species Is bearing and rearing their young right and it is endemic for men and males of all mammalian species to be more aggressive Right, these are just biological realities to pretend that they are social constructs entirely is completely idiotic and anti-scientific and anti-evidentiary Masculinity and femininity do exist and not only that. How does this tie into the whole dress? Conversation outward indicators of masculinity and femininity exist in nearly every human culture Right, we train little boys to be masculine and we train little girls to be more feminine We try to breed out of them the toxicity of masculinity or the toxicity of femininity We try to use civilization to civilize children, but boys are boys and girls are girls Right and these are important things boys ought to be allowed to act like boys Girls ought to be allowed to act like girls Boys are taught to be more masculine in virtually every human culture This is not a western centered thing boys are taught to be more masculine in virtually every human culture Because the role of men is not in fact always the same as the role of women There can be crossover men and women can do very many of the same jobs But to suggest that men and women are identical and they are widgets created by social conditioning is just bull crap It is not true. It is not scientifically true It is it is a violation of actual scientific biology There are differences between men and women on the broad range That does not mean that there's not again men who act more like women or women who act more like men They're not more effeminate men and more masculine women Right all of that exists But the fact that there is a spectrum of human biology does not mean there are not polls There are indeed polls Right as in p.o. l.e. s. There are polls masculine and feminine The left knows this In fact the point of the harry styles photoshoot is to violate those polls right is to feminize masculinity Olivia wild says it herself the idea is to rethink masculinity as femininity to feminize men to get rid of toxic masculinity By suggesting that men should act like women Otherwise it would not be headline worthy for harry styles to put on the dress Or if you were just about harry styles again playing with dress the way he says that it is And he would have dressed up as a giant baby in a diaper with like a with a pacifier, right? Like he's not doing that He's dressing up in a woman's gown because he's attempting to make a point which is that men should be more like women Right and the left knows this they know this They openly say that gender is both important and socially constructed Right they say that gender is actually inborn but also socially constructed right they want it both ways They say the gender is a social construction and that and that it's that that femininity is just men cramming down the patriarchy on women, but they will also say that gender which is the manifestation of biology, right? But they don't think so they think the gender is just your femininity or masculinity is actually inborn and inherent to you So they say that a man can be a woman even though there's no biological underpinning So gender is real but also it's socially constructed. It's all self-contradictory, but Let's assume for a second The honesty of some folks on the left to at least acknowledge that femininity and masculinity exist They also have indicators outward indicators Dress has been for virtually all time and in virtually all cultures and outward indicator Which is why the bible explicitly says that it is against cross-dressing for example Okay, but in virtually every culture men and women dress differently This does not mean that all men dress the same and all women in all cultures dress the same It means that in every culture there is a distinction between how men dress and how women dress the stupidest form of the argument that I saw yesterday online Was well in Scotland they were killed That means that a man in America wearing a skirt a fluffie skirt is the same as a man in Scotland wearing a kilt No, because they also distinguish between how men wear clothes and women wear clothes in Scotland too It's just that men wear different clothes than men in America It's the most idiotic thing people are like well. Yeah back in roman times men wear togas You understand those were basically just dresses. Yes and women wear a different form of clothing at the time women and men were Distinguishedable by dress they have always been distinguishable by dress in virtually every human culture And noting that men wore fluffier stuff in the 16th century in Britain does not change the fact that women wore completely different clothing in the 16th century in Britain Right, this is a category area morons To suggest that because men wore something like a kilt in Scotland That if you transferred over to america would look more feminine therefore a man wearing a skirt in america in 2020 is is just the same in the male female paradigm as a man wearing a kilt in scotland in 1590 Is insane and idiotic and ridiculous on its face and we all know that Okay pretending that men dressing like women is not about feminizing men is ridiculous Because they are overtly celebrating the fact that style is fem that styles is feminizing masculinity So this is all a big gaslighting effect, right? The left will do this the left routine is this look how important and magical it is that harry styles is wearing a dress He's subversively undermining masculinity by bringing the by bringing the effect of femininity to the masculine and that's real masculinity Isn't dude wearing a dress and then people on the right are like yes Men wearing dresses does undermine masculinity by making it more feminine and that is a bad thing And then folks on the left don't respond by saying well Why is it a bad thing to feminize masculinity because then they would lose the argument because Masculinity has very many good things and ought to be upheld instead what the left does is this weird gaslighting shot routine Where they say how dare you say that wearing that men wearing dresses undermines masculinity You said you on the left you said that wearing a dress undermines masculinity That is the whole point of putting people on the cover of magazines who are men wearing dresses Okay, so here's the bottom line There are a lot of conservatives. I know who listened to this sort of stuff and they go Well, why aren't we talking about political races? Why aren't we talking about why aren't we talking about tax rates? Why aren't we talking about policy? This stuff matters it matters because these are fundamental ideas to the preservation of a civilization boys and girls are different Boys and girls are different It is important to inculcate in your children that boys and girls are different and any parent who fails to inculcate in a boy that manliness is A good thing and that responsible manliness helps build civilization any Person any parent does not teach their girls that femininity meaning The protection of hearth and home in a different way than masculinity Is a good thing any person who doesn't teach their girls that is not doing their kid any favors And they are undermining the civilizational compact between men and women that exist based on biology in virtually every human culture And the left knows that they can't win this argument because biology cuts directly against them science cuts directly against them So instead they just confuse it instead They just play these stupid semantic little games where they say that masculinity and femininity are interchangeable And if you say no, they say how dare you how dare you It's it's absurd and it's ridiculous and we shouldn't be shy about discussing these issues Because the left certainly isn't shy about discussing these issues the left will put these in public schools Right the left will will tell your kindergartner that real men wear dresses And then you'll be explaining to a five-year-old why real men do not wear dresses And and I don't feel that that is an acceptable Ramification of our cultural discussion is that you're supposed to shut up because it's offensive and rude for you to say that boys and girls are different But it is inoffensive and groundbreaking to treat as completely Without debate that men and women are exactly the same in every respect except that men Suffered from toxic masculinity that must be bred out of them by wearing 17th century fluffie dresses on the cover of OBE The answer to that is no But i'm glad all y'all really enjoy your hairstyles music and hairstyles He's a free man living in a western country by the way a west defended by quite masculine men as a general rule. Okay, that is Congratulations to Harry Styles. You can enjoy his music. I'm not saying don't pick up his CDs I'm not saying don't listen to his music I'm not saying don't watch the movies he's in all i'm saying is that when you put out there an argument that men ought to act like women And that this is a good thing you're doing something that undermines and tears at the fabric of not only civilization But of families it tears at the fabric of child's rearing and child raising and everybody with half a brain knows this And don't be silenced by people who just tell you that it's rude to talk about it while simultaneously demanding that you put on the Kramer aids ribbon or they're going to or they're going to club you about the head For not celebrating that which you don't find worthy of celebration Okay, so meanwhile in actual news covid continues to uh to blight the land And the response is of various political figures continues to not be particularly useful So build a blazio announced yesterday that they are closing the schools in new york despite evidence Is perfectly obvious at this point that schools are not chief vectors of transmission does not matter They're shutting down the schools anyway because all of the political incentives are aligned to shut things down Even if there's no actual evidence suggesting that things ought to be shut down We said we would make health and safety the priority We said we would hold this standard that was part of how we convinced everyone that it would be safe to come into the schools Now we did expect our schools to be safe. The only way i differ with you say it is not Unexpected that our schools are safe. We expected them to be safe. We've been very very impressed by the work. Everyone's done They are extraordinarily safe But that said We set a standard we asked everyone to trust it and believe in it. It's important to keep consistency with that Okay, first of all, I love build a blazio talking about consistency his consistent standard has been yell at the jus While suggesting systemic racism is responsible for up ticks of covid in every other racial minority So the captain consistency over here has been like let's have giant riots in looting in the middle of fifth avenue That's totally fine with covid. But also you can't have a family gathering Captain consistency over here. I love when he says that um, we set a standard our standard makes no sense But we have to hold to our standard now shutting down the schools. Good luck to parents by the way I hope that you've enjoyed that two weeks of schooling in new york that you got I hope that it went really really well for you Meanwhile joe biden is is out there still maintaining that he has a plan It must be wonderful being joe biden at this point not having to have a plan but getting to blame trump for every bad thing that is happening He said some very bizarre things yesterday in front of his carboard His cardboard displacing office of the president's elect there is no office of the president's elect as we have no To going all the way back to you 2008 when barak obama actually created placards that said office of the president elect that is not the way that works In any case joe biden said that the vaccine is coming and I trust the vaccine because fauci says the vaccine is good He says people only question the vaccine because of trump which is a weird take considering your vice president Your vice presidential candidate hamala harris openly said that she would not take the vaccine if trump said to take it So I feel like the undermining of vaccines and taking vaccines that's actually been your party joe But i'm i'm glad that now you're on board. That's exciting news Funny how you switch from i'm a little wary about vaccines your vice president saying that uh to vaccines are the most wonderful thing And trump is the only person obstructing them when he's the one who created the program to develop them in the first place Here's joe biden being a tool The only reason people question the vaccine now is because of Donald trump That's the reason why people are questioning the vaccine because all the things he says and doesn't say whether it's a truthless It's not truthful the exaggerations. I think we're on a clear path now We're in a clear path for the international community and national leaders Uh in the scientific community have focused on these two vaccines They appear to be Ready for prime time ready to be used and if that continues on those roads, I would take the vaccine Okay, so that old codger is going to be curing covid so that's that's exciting stuff And then of course he saved some more blame for trump Right that trump is refusing to coordinate and it's going to get a lot of people killed Uh, no it no, sorry, not true Okay, the fact is that apparently biden is receiving some sort of national security briefing today. So Um, yeah, here's biden trying to blame everything on trump as per our usual arrangement What do you see is the biggest threat to your transition right now given president trump's unprecedented attempt to obstruct and delay a smooth transfer of power More people may die If we don't coordinate if we have to wait until january 20th to start that planning It puts us behind over a month month and a half And so it's important that it be done that there be coordination Now Now or as rapidly as we can get that done Okay, so again everything is trumps fault Meanwhile the media pushing the idea that if you're republican you're more likely to get covid because you're an idiot So it is it is very odd how the the virus pretty much affects everybody And that if you are more careful, there's a lower likelihood that you're going to get a severe strain of the virus And if you are or a severe case of the virus and if you are less careful than you are probably going to have a higher chance of getting it Nonetheless here's cnn declaring that president trump and every republican Those people are responsible for their own covid cases they hosted a south decoder nurse Who then proceeded to explain that people are dying in south decoder while declaring that covid is not real And this is of course because of president trump as opposed to the huge number of people who died in new york Who thought presumably covid was real and also died it turns out the virus doesn't care what you think because the virus is not in fact A woke mind reading tool I think the hardest thing to watch is that people are still looking for something else And they want a magic answer and they don't want to believe that covid is real And the reason I tweeted what I did is it wasn't one particular patient. It's just a culmination of so many people And their last dying words are This can't be happening. It's not real and when they should be spending time based timing their families They're filled with anger and hatred and it just made me really sad the other night And um, I just can't believe that those are going to be their last thoughts and words I'm glad this is uh cnn's narrative. I mean, we by the way, we also heard stories Uh a little bit earlier before the election about people whose last dying words were things like I hope trump loses or something It turns out people have all sorts of weird Ideas Uh when they are on their deathbeds, but cnn apparently only is interested in featuring one type of particular story Okay, meanwhile joe biden is laying forth his economic plan So in the in the final days of president trump's first term Yeah, depending on what happens here. Joe biden is laying forth his economic plans his economic plans suck Now Let's be frank about this if joe biden ends up as the president elect of the united states if he ends up taking office in january Then joe biden might be the luckiest cat on planet earth Uh not just because he presumably would have been declared the winner But also because if the republicans win the senate joe biden is going to get the benefit of operational warps feed He's going to be handed a vaccine that will be widely available by march in april Which means that the economy is going to boom It means that the v-shaped recovery that started under president trump will continue It means the economy is going to spike and because you will have a republican senate Joe biden will have no way of stopping the economy from growing Right hill have wanted to put forth all of these crappy proposals raising taxes and increasing regulations and all of us And he'll have very little ability to actually implement that you want to know why the stock market jumps on election night The reason the stock market jumps after election night is because there was an assumption that republicans were going to keep the senate Which is why those georgia senate races are really important But this does put joe biden in particularly rich In a particularly rich political area Meaning that that for joe biden All he has to do is continue to sit in the basement and just reap the rewards of trump's economic plan and trump's vaccines And then the media will credit him Right so that that's a wonderful thing But he's at least going to pay lip service to all of his parties most idiotic economic plans So yesterday he gave a speech on the economy which basically amounted to trump is a big bad mean orange man At some point you would figure the the spectra of trump will will suddenly just dissipate but never right i mean Barack obama is still blaming george w bush seven years into his term So you can imagine that that's exactly what joe biden will be doing as well So joe biden says he wants to restructure the tax structure We need a fair tax structure where people at the top pay more which is insane considering the people at the top pay literally all net taxes in the united states That means taxes That are that are paid after you receive government benefits people in the top 1 percent are paying the vast bulk of those taxes people in the top 1 Percent are paying a highly disproportionate share of the taxes It's funny the same people who will suggest that america's rich are not paying their fair share And also say that norway is wonderful neglect the fact that norway and ben mark and sweden All these places have incredibly regressive tax systems compared to the united states america has an incredibly Progressive graduated tax system where people at the top get absolutely shall act And if you're not earning all that much money or if you're middle class You're not paying very high taxes if you go over to europe everybody is paying high taxes in any case Here's joe biden just lying and saying we don't have a fair tax system, which is code for I want to seize more money from people who earn a lot It's time to reward work Not just wealth in america We're going to have a fair tax structure that makes sure the wealthiest among us and corporations pay their fair share Our plan will create millions of good paying union jobs in manufacturing Building the vehicles products technologies that are going to we're going to need for the future to compete with the rest of the world From autos to our stockpiles. We're going to buy american Okay, so um let's let's should be real about this when he talks about how work must be rewarded Family income grew under donald trump in the first three years of his administration faster And more completely in total than under eight years of barakababa And the people who are mostly making that money or people in the middle and the bottom end of the spectrum You know there's actually faster income growth among people who are at the lower end of the spectrum than in people at the top and Of the spectrum doesn't matter. Joe biden is going to continue to push the these crappy plans Meanwhile joebiden has another plan and this one again is incredibly regressive So first of all It's it's hilarious that that joebiden continues to suggest that america's tax system is Regressive when it is actually quite progressive. Also. He wants to push what? sounds like the most regressive policy Prescription that I can think of he wants to simply cancel student loan debt Now this is idiotic in all respects. We'll get to this in just one. It's all explaining just one second here is joebiden saying this yesterday To student loan forgiveness figure in your plan, would you take executive action to achieve it? It does figure in my plan. I've laid out in detail for example the legislation passed by the democratic house calls for immediate $10,000 forgiveness of student loan just holding people up during real trouble They're having to make choices be trained paying their student loan and paying the rent those kinds of decisions It should be done immediately. Okay So he wants to just come in and relieve student loan debt So a few points here one if you paid your bills, you're a sucker Right. I paid my wife's medical school bills. I paid my law school bills My parents helped me out with college We all took on debt and we all paid off that debt in order to pay off our debts And we did so in the assumption that that was going to be a way of investing in the future And here comes joebiden saying basically you're suckers because not only did you pay off your debt Now the taxpayer is going to assume everybody else's debt Which means that you're going to have to pay for some Jackassas jackass antifa students degree in queer studies So I'm a sucker you're a sucker if you're a taxpayer or a sucker if you're a high school student If you're a high school grad and you didn't go to college You're a serious sucker because you could have gone for free and then just had joebiden alleviate that not only that You're not going to have to pay because the taxes are going to come You're going to have to pay for that college student to get that ridiculous degree And what this really is is a subsidy to a university system that indoctrinates kids in stupidity There are two types of degrees that come out of college systems Hey, there's the type of degree where you actually learn something my wife was premed Right. So she was in psychobiology. That is a hard science If you look at the hard sciences science tech engineering math, right the stem fields Those are actual degrees with actual skill sets Then they're what we at ucla used to call the north campus degrees Right there are the english majors and the polycyme majors I'll speak about polycytes. I was a polycyte major. It was useless crap The only reason that you got a polycyme major was that you could go to law school or brag that you got a polycyte Agree from ucla without any concomitant skill set. It was a scam designed to give you a degree These are degree mills that is what these that is what these colleges are They are designed as sort as sorting mechanisms as feeder mechanisms Right. The idea is that employers are I believe banned by federal law from giving things like IQ tests in order to determine Whether or not you are smart enough to be hired. So instead we have an entire Ridiculous and backwards and convoluted system where you're supposed to incur tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars in debt to basically take an IQ test Which is all that that a degree from a college basically is Right because you take an SAT which is a low level IQ test or an ACT same sort of thing And then you get funneled into a college and then the college weeds out people who are not particularly hardworking And then you get the degree and all an employer an employer learns from that is not that you have a marketable skill set They learn that you are quote-unquote smart, right? This is why if you have harvard on your on your diploma Even if you majored in something really stupid you're probably more likely to get a job Then if you have junior college on your diploma and you majored in something not particularly stupid Because everybody sort of understands that unless you're majoring in science technology engineering math Then you are basically learning not much of anything You're just going there to get the degree and then that sorting mechanism can be used to get you into into a job somewhere We'd be much better off pushing apprenticeship programs So I have an alternative proposal instead of rewarding these colleges with taxpayer money Because again when you wipe out the debt taxpayers pick it up. That's all that means There's no such thing as free college. There's just taxpayers paying for your crappy major One of the reasons that I like the idea of private institutions Providing the loans for colleges as opposed to the federal government backing them is because private institutions Sometimes take a look at your degree and determine whether they think you're going to pay back See the thing about a degree is that it is not foreclosable When a bank gives you a mortgage on a house They make an assessment one are you gonna pay back to that too? If you don't pay back to that can they seize the property Right, it's secured. It's a secured loan education is an unsecured loan There is no collateral they can seize if you'd stop paying back your debt So what banks typically do is they look at what you're getting a degree in If you're getting a degree from Harvard law Then they can assume that you're going to pay back to that because you're probably going to get a high flying law job That makes you take a couple hundred grand a year start Right, that's a better bet than if you're getting a theater major at Wesleyan Right, that might be harder to get a loan for in the private sector, which is right The federal government comes in and guarantees all of these loans Which is idiotic because now they're subsidizing a bunch of crappy majors At a bunch of colleges that are just there to indoctrinate you into wokism Okay, so this should all be privatized in the first place, but I have another idea if we are going to Actually forgive these debts. How about this? How about instead of having the taxpayers forgive the debts? How about if you have a useless major and you're not earning a lot of money And you actually have serious loan debt because you took out a bunch of loans to do that theater major in lesbian dance theory over at Wesleyan How about this? How about Wesleyan has to eat the cost? Because Wesleyan was in on the scam Wesleyan knew you weren't going to get a job In lesbian dance after you got your degree How about they who helped perpetuate the scam they have to eat the cost that would end this scam this grift right quick, wouldn't it? But Joe Biden has no intention of doing that because of course these colleges are turning out democratic voters They are a way of indoctrinating people into ideologies that Joe Biden favors This is an anti blue collar program. It doesn't help high school grads It does not care for people who don't feel like wasting four years of their lives and hundreds of thousands of dollars at a college to earn a degree in in Crap It doesn't help people who have already paid their debts and it subsidizes people who are in the least profitable and least useful majors Okay, so this is a very regressive program that Joe Biden is pushing Naturally, but this is the the left. I mean the left wing democratic party is now basically a coalition of the of the intersectionally aggrieved and the woke white people that that's what the democratic party coalition is Well, good luck with that in the future. Okay. Meanwhile, the media are trying to pave the ground Going forward for a Biden administration They're trying to somehow create the narrative that Biden ought to get back in the iran deal So one of the signal achievements of the Trump administration was getting out of the iran deal Which put the Iranian mollas behind the eight ball economically and put them in a very difficult situation because all of their ability to access world markets Basically collapsed they've been in a state of economic collapse for years. It has prevented them from achieving the kind of the the kind of forward thrusting aggressive terrorist backing action that they had been pursuing in places like yemen or in lebanon or in syria So that that was very it was very successful and it also happened to result in an anti-Iranian alliance between israel and the ua And the fact of the saia rea bea egypt jordan Yeah, all of that was very good. So now the media have to come up with some excuse why Joe biden should be able to cut a new deal with the iranian government, which is on the ropes So the way that they are now crafting this narrative Is that donald trump is going to nuke iran Right, the donald trump is creating danger in iran And the iran has created new nuclear facilities that trump wants to pursue militants And the only alternative is for joe biden to come in and sign an agreement with the iranians So they are pushing a headline suggesting that trump sought options for attacking iran's who stop its growing nuclear program This is the article from the new york times Okay, now here's what the article says and you'll see how it doesn't agree with the headline president trump asked senior advisors in an oval office Meeting on thursday whether he had options to take action against iran's main nuclear site in the coming weeks The meeting occurred today after international inspectors reported a significant increase in the country's stockpile of nuclear material for current and former u.s Official said on monday a range of senior advisors dissuaded the president for moving ahead with the military strike The advisors including vice president pence secretary of state pompeo christopher miller the acting defense secretary and general millie the chairman of the joint chiefs warned to strike against iran's Facilities could easily escalate into a broader conflict in the last weeks of trump's presidency Trump asked his top national security officials what options were available and how to respond after pompeo and millie described the potential risks Officials left the meeting believing a missile attack inside iran was off the table Okay, so in other words trump said what are our options on nuclear facilities? They said well we shouldn't do anything military and trump said okay The headline is trump considered military attack because the media are now attempting to craft a narrative Where the all only alternative to joe biden making concessions to a terrorist regime is war We did this already right? We did this back in 2019 2010 when the obama administration crafted a narrative and then threw it out there for stenographer's to push Right jeffrey golberg to push ben road's bragged openly that this is what they were doing Ben roads who is then deputy national security advisor bragged openly that the obama administration had crafted a lie around iran Which is that there were only two alternatives full-fledged war with iran and submitting to iran's will And it turned out that was crap because trump came in and did a third way and was very successful in containing iran He killed off their terrorist leader kasem solimani He he created an alliance against them that checked their power. He drove their economy into the ground Right all of that was very good So now the media are trying to revive the same narrative obama pushed the first time that the only alternatives are open warfare with iranian government Or making concessions to the iranian government don't fall for it It is a media crafted narrative and it is garbage But the media will shift on a dime when it comes to foreign policy anyway There is a certain humor in the fact that the media are very upset that trump is now talking about a troop drawdown in iraq in afghanistan This prompted cnn's brgana keeler to rip trump for this say this is very bad Now i'm old enough to remember when barak obama pledged a troop drawdown in iraq did it and created ices I'm old enough to remember when he pledged to troop drawdown in afghanistan And it was it and was negotiating with the taliban and you know what the media said then what a forward-thinking foreign policy leader now cnn's like how dare trump do this exact same thing joe biden and barak obama pushed Who does this who dropped something like this in the lap of an incoming president No one other than donald trump. I think what he's trying to do is go through his bucket list quite honestly And saying you know he promised to get out of these wars and he was going to do it and jake capper was Can i can it but glory can we just be clear on that he's not getting out of these wars. I mean, that's right He's just like you're sending it. He's just he's just handicapping the next guy who has to deal with it I mean who who is going who would do something like this who would say for example in the last month of an administration Push forward a un resolution completely up ending all previous conventional wisdom about israeli claims to for example Jerusalem who would do that by abstaining from a un resolu- away barak obama did that in the last month Just as a parting shot at bibinatinyahu and and the jews.
