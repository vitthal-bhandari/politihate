    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative truth the conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minimans standing at the ready to fight a new for our life Liberty property and all that matters if that is your goal actual substance and outcomes over talking points well this is probably your only place to go here at Blaze Media Sierra podcast your host Daniel Horowitz back here for June 7th it is a Wednesday and we got a lot to talk about as always you know one of the things that I always strive for as I say often is not to be a thumb sucker an outsider that just wants to muse pontificate propagate a commentator's an end to itself and not get on the playing field and one of those things is even when I'm proven right and I say something's a mistake and we get betrayed and Republicans betrays and do it anyway well look I could give up or I can come back the next day and say all right well you screwed up this opportunity but here's another one every day there is a sunset there is a sunrise God provides us with opportunities to do the right thing and in politics that takes the form of leverage points budget bills different events in the news that you could harness on issues that really are 60 40 70 30 80 20 in our favor and say we will not back down until this and this happens and you build your case for it in anticipation of that leverage point and you hope for the best and pray for the best and that's all you can do and that's what we're gonna do here now that we were screwed on the debt ceiling fight well we got about you know throughout the summer a little bit more than three and a half months left in toll the budget debt deadline for fiscal year 2024 everything that our government is doing to us on culture on economy on our life liberty and property it comes down to funding of this government this is an opportunity nothing about what was done legally during the debt ceiling necessarily screws up this leverage now politically they're signaling that they want to incorporate the debt ceiling deal into the budget bills it doesn't have to be that way and it's time that conservative media finally focus on what matters we cannot wait until 2025 for a reckoning we need like we said this point of a reckoning we hope the debt ceiling would be that reckoning but of course it wasn't now we have to make the budget bills be that reckoning so I want to talk about what that reckoning needs to encompass and how we push that leverage first our sponsor today our first sponsor is our friends at better spectacles you know too often when people get eyeglasses they focus on the style of the frames the style of the lenses the aesthetics and frankly I don't like the new looks these massive glasses like they're from the 1970s but typically the functionality becomes secondary but that should be the primary objective because your brain actually thinks with with your eyes even if a store offers expensive name brand lenses they're often a decade behind the technology from road and stock lenses provided to you by our friends at Better Spectacles America's only conservative eyewear company they design their business around the bet that people want to see with the best visual experience possible and you know look good with high quality well-engineered frames so many of my listeners have purchased these glasses like I have in my wife as well my oldest son they have the best glasses that they've ever had most people aren't are unhappy with the way they see not after getting the biometric intelligence glasses from better spectacles today it's a use of artificial intelligence for the good there are good uses for believe it or not and they're changing lives daily so if you want to get the best pair of eyewear you've ever had go now to better spectacles dot com slash conservative to schedule a teleoptical appointment you don't have to leave your home you get 61% off on your eyewear today so again that's better spectacles dot com slash conservative so folks yesterday there was a big new story that of course is not cool and soap opera like to my colleagues but nonetheless it was the most important story of the day conservative in the house a group of eleven freedom caucus members took down a rule for the first time since 2002 so we're dating back 21 years where they successfully prosecuted this rebellion against Kevin McCarthy we had congressman Dan Bishop who was one of the eleven on last week and he warned there would be a reckoning and it's beginning and you know one of the things we noticed from the speakers fight in January that it was the first time we ever had an organization a cohesive organization of conservatives willing to fight back willing to take the slings and arrows willing to use leverage and coordinate properly without leaking it to the press and even allies because I was unaware of this which tells you it was a very well done well orchestrated rebellion and first we'll talk about the rebellion and then the significance of it going forward where it needs to be channeled so the actual rebellion basically in order to vote on any piece of legislation you don't just vote on the bill you vote to adopt a a rule in the form of a resolution governing the debate surrounding that actual bill and sometimes they'll have a rule governing several bills for that day or that week worth of legislation in this case it was several bills and the way it typically works is that the rule is kind of an affirmation of the majority party's control of that chamber so in other words typically the dem in this case with Republicans in control the Democrats will always vote against the rule even if sometimes some then plan to vote for the bill they'll vote against the rule and certainly in this case they were gonna vote against the bill because it was the underlying bill was either the reins act regulatory reform or a pair of bills that would ban these restrictions on gas powered stoves HR 1615 HR 1640 as well as again the regulatory reform was HR 277 and 288 and what that would do is so so the Democrats vote against it and Republicans even even if Republicans who are members of the majority party don't like the underlying bill they always vote for the rule to at least bring it to the floor and not doing so is considered a full-scale rebellion against your own leadership and undermining their authority as you know leadership controlling the majority so in other words the unspoken rule over the years and it's almost never broken again not since 2002 is that you might not like the bill and you vote against the bill but you won't block the ability to bring it to the floor so that is that sort of you know it's not exactly like this but kind of like the procedural votes you have in the Senate to consider a bill a little bit similar that if you want to take it down this is where you have more leverage now you've had here and there a handful of Republicans or conservatives vote against a rule on a bill they don't like but typically they don't have enough to take it down now in this Congress Republicans only have a five-seat majority so if every Democrat votes against the rule you you just get five Republicans to vote with the Democrats and boom you take it down so this actually happened last week during the debt ceiling adultery bill actually 29 freedom caucus members did vote against the rule but remember the bill was so favorable to the Democrats that Hakim Jeffries had no problem breaking precedent and actually voting yes supplying McCarthy with the votes he needed 40-something Democrats voted for the rule now this time it was a little different because this time the bill itself is fine in fact we all support the reigns act and borrowing the Biden administration from banning gas-powered stoves so this was a case where the freedom caucus guys knew that Democrats would definitely vote no and they shocked leadership and this is the first time they've ever done this not only did they succeed but they did it on a bill that really we support and they voted no on the rule 11 of them voted no which was enough to take it down and it failed and they had to pull it from the floor and we'll see what happens today momentarily I'm watching the floors I'm talking but they they haven't convened yet so it was Andy Biggs then Bishop Lauren Bobert Ken Buck Tim Burchit Eli Crane Matt Gates Bob Good Ralph Norman Matt Rose Nell and Chip Roy mainly from the original rebellion but you have people in there like Ken Buck who did not join the speaker's fight so that is important that we are picking off some new people so obviously the messaging is this you guys want to bring our most important bills to the floor with Democrat support all right well then we'll vote with the Democrats to take down a rule on your bill now to be clear obviously everyone supports these underlying bills but I think part of the you know subtle messaging here too in general they're just gonna hold everything hostage in order to get McCarthy back on track but I think there was something significant about these bills because the GOP is going is playing the typical bait and switch you have certain leverage points the budget bills debt ceiling bills to force change or at least some of the changes that you want so what McCarthy did was he screwed our leverage on on this other reigns act and the green new deal and then now okay now we're gonna pass a you know reigns act now we're gonna pass you know repeal of some of the green energy stuff but that's bull because they know they only have control of the house and they know it won't pass the Senate won't be signed into laws so what so this is the typical thing as we talked about yesterday from the New York Times article Republicans want to continue this game of allowing the Democrats to have the substance on the important bills and for us to get the talking points that's what Trump is all about that's what the GOP establishment is all about that's what they have been about that's what conservative talk radio is about and no we want to force a substantive fight we are in a fight for our lives we cannot wait another few years to deal with the salt on our life Liberty property the green energy stuff illegal migration the biomedical security state the tranias and all that stuff it needs to be dealt with right now the political persecution that needs to be dealt with now in a substantive way so no you're not going to screw us on the bill that matters and then dangle in front of us a little standalone bill that you know won't go anywhere I have no problem with messaging bills if you fight for at least some portion of them on the must pass bills but to do that screw it so that's kind of the background in case some of you are confused you know why our conservatives opposing the rule on a bill that where the underlying bill is good that's why that's why they did it there now how long this is going to go on honestly I don't know they're very mum which is a good thing that shows a lot of discipline but to me the way this needs to be channeled is the message needs to be conveyed to Kevin McCarthy that we will continue to obstruct so long as you don't make commitments to us that you're gonna reset the debt ceiling deal and go back to the drawing board on the budget bills and I want to explain what that means but first the next segment is sponsored by our friends at Birch Gold Group look folks on the first day of the debt ceiling increase I believe Janet Yellen at Treasury just serviced for getting the numbers like some like 351 billion in one day they're just gobbling it up that's gotta be yeah I think it is actually a record the most debt issued in one day in American history so the dollar is gonna go to hell interest rates are gonna continue to go up so you're gonna have a recession we're gonna have this quasi-staticflation now is the time to diversify with gold why Birch because Birch specializes particularly in converting your IRA or 401k into not the stock market but into something of value precious metals that's stored for you in an actual account if you want what I did text Daniel to 9 8 9 8 9 8 to claim your free info kit on gold today and then you'll have a number there to call someone up very knowledgeable like Ron Paul sort of economists it's not just some customer service guy these guys are very smart they have an a plus rating from the better business bureau thousands of happy customers countless five star reviews so again don't put your money in the stock market casino or at least diversified to some extent with precious metals always a good bet for diversification certainly in the era of the debt hell we're about to enter so text Daniel to 9 8 9 8 9 8 today so yeah I mean the debt is immutable in terms of the fact that they gave Biden an unlimited amount of debt suspension that he will never have to come to Congress for the remainder of his term for a debt limit that is true and it was horrible but I want to make something very clear there is nothing about that bill that commit legally and officially commits McCarthy and Republicans in the house to abiding by the spending levels in that bill is that well Daniel wasn't a pass yeah was passed now a lot of the things are side agreements but even the things that were passed in there it doesn't self execute the budget in other words it just says for now we're adopting these top line budget levels but at the end of the day you have to pass an individual appropriation bill to fund the individual accounts of the agencies and departments and programs so at the end of the day we still have leverage now before the bill was passed I argued that you're weakening your leverage because you're agreeing to certain things that we shouldn't have agreed upon but we should say that's McCarthy that wasn't us we didn't agree to that and they need to begin passing throughout the summer that each of the 12 individual appropriation bills that completely reset the baseline this needs to be the agreement from McCarthy you already gave him the debt ceiling don't screw us with the budget bills this needs to be the goal now to limit the destruction the sabotage of our leverage to only the point of the debt limit bill not the budget bills and I want to explain a little bit what needs to be done but until then they need to commit to blocking any new bill saying we're gonna shut down the floor until we get locked in in agreement from McCarthy and not that he is gonna do what he did with the debt limit which is past some you know halfway decent house pass appropriation bills and then have no intention of standing behind them in substance other than getting some sort of talking point in the final bill that will be an omnibus bill whether it's in September or December instead what needs to happen is this so he has to commit to standing behind them because I just want to say this just to set the table the fundamental leverage point that was there in the debt ceiling that the sabotage is still there now and that is house Republicans are the only ones that have the ability to pass a bill out of the chamber they could pass the preparation bills where Senate Democrats do not have the votes they only have 50 seats in a chamber where you need 60 so Republicans have that leverage moreover this should be easier and the messaging that I would argue the Freedom Caucus needs to go to McCarthy with is this we know you are maniacally afraid of a debt default cliff which was a lie but you bought into it fine but that's over with there's no default cliff anymore okay that that's done with if anything now you should have more leverage with less fear to go up to the line and through the line on the brinkmanship with the budget because now the worst that would happen is a partial government shutdown which is a joke and the message needs to be that we lived through a year's worth of a private shutdown of the private economy and even private human life like going to funerals so you need to tell me we're gonna be scared of some stupid partial government shutdown of the fourth Reich shut it freaking down shut it down who cares let's shut that stupid thing down you either pass our bills we passed them out of the house passed them to the Senate or if you want to suffer suffer government shutdown that's fine then we'll shut it down permanently you want it funded at some level well you're gonna have to fund it at our levels here are the priorities as a starter I'm just gonna mention some of the main things obviously at a micro level we should load it up with many many many things but number one on the spending levels now we need to get more than what we asked for in the house passed debt ceiling bill the original one not a return to FY 2022 levels a return to pre-COVID FY 2019 levels we went from 4.4 trillion to 6.4 trillion overnight because of COVID in 2022 that needs to be reversed COVID is over so the COVID era level of spending should be over so at a minimum the the non-defense discretionary spending needs to be reset to pre-COVID which by the way at the time was considered astronomically high and really we should throw in some of the food stamp Medicaid and unemployment some other stuff spending levels should go back to then too but whatever that's negotiable but at a minimum the non-defense discretionary spending needs to go back to that level what is so hard to stand before the American people and pass the bill and say COVID is over it was biblical levels of spending we're we're bankrupting ourselves over it's indefensible and and stand by that you want to shut down the government to perpetuate pandemic levels spending when the pandemic is over you do it what is so hard about doing I'll buy Iowad a grade so what screw it that's number one number two well if the pandemic is over we need to also eliminate all funding for the COVID vaccines and and mind you everything I'm positing here these are winning issues the public doesn't want them all funding for COVID vaccines needs to be terminated and that includes not just the direct funding to the manufacturer but to all the funding that the government directly promotes it and CDC gives funding to all these cultural institutions and medical associations and College of OBGYNs to fund it as well all COVID funding again in at HHS FDA needs to be taken off it is a disgrace that we have not had had this reckoning yet the Republicans continue to refuse to touch the COVID shots now is the time to have that fight done all COVID policies need to be defunded period so that's number two number three defund all political persecutions last year in that omnibus bill they gave the DC US Attorney's Office an extra 212 million it's a lot of money for a bunch of lawyers to engage in more indictments and a minimum the messaging needs to be we are defunding all new January 6 prosecutions everyone has been overcharged over indicted over convicted by a mile some almost did nothing that needs to end immediately it needs to end immediately period full stop even if you're gonna have the existing ones but certainly any new ones by definition anyone who did anything wrong has long since been roped in you're roping in another thousand people that needs to be defunded now I will argue of all the issues on my list this probably will pull will have the least you know favorable polling of all of them and that's because of just Trump's personality kind of sabotages this because it's inextricably tied to him but it is what it is this persecution needs to be stopped you know I I want to actually now that I'm on that before we continue with some of the other items I do want to get into just some of the important news on that and we'll probably talk about this more with a special guest tomorrow but first our final segment here is sponsored by our friends at Patriot Mobile again we're

capital for 36 seconds he did nothing there he was sentenced to 60 days in federal prison this dirtbag judge Reggie Walton cited in part in part his appearance on Tucker show which he said contributed to misinformation they are literally being sentenced based on their political views this is what needs to be brought out in these budget bills that you I mean a very simple proposition this is not a right-wing idea that you should be charged and convicted criminally based on what you did not on what you believe this is America another big news we saw from Julie Kelly at American greatness Ryan Samsel he was the guy that was right next to Ray Epps part of that first breach and legitimately he did jostle and you have a shoving match with with cops he didn't kill anyone he didn't like beat people like the way you saw cops really get maimed by BLM yet shoving breached went in you know nothing more than that so I mean he did something wrong but he has been held two and a half years pre-trial so one of the interesting thing is how do you delay a trial like that for two and a half years it's not scheduled until October almost three years so Julie Kelly interviewed him and he said that so there's a famous picture of Ray Epps whispering into Samsel's ear something and it was don't pull I mean don't pull back I've got people we have to push through so again this guy is held pre you understand to be held pre-trial for three years that's like a capital case and yet Ray Epps who was in the same boat never arrested and yet Samsel's trial is being held clearly they don't want the discovery on that so they're just holding him pre-trial obviously we have the Pelosi video showing her staff kind of like you know waltzing out of there as if it was pre-planned clearly she knew about it we have a lot of evidence about that her son just happened to be there filming it and there's a lot that ties into the whole Richard Barnett case maybe we'll get into tomorrow so the point is this is something that cannot wait Republicans need to act like there's a sense of urgency that we cannot wait but instead it's all this cosmetic talking point garbage all over the subpoena this guy that guy and by the way another important thing on the Capitol police okay and this is gonna be in the legislative affairs budget so one of the appropriation bills is to actually fund the legislative branch Congress Capitol Hill police is a police force that works not for the executive branch but for Congress they are demanding more funding house Republicans crafted their annual probe spill for the legislative branch of government and they plan to provide 781 million that's more than three-quarters of a billion for the US Capitol police which is 46 million more than their enacted FY 2023 levels itself was a whopping 22% increase you know because the Democrats have heralded the Capitol Hill police are had become a Gestapo that needs to be burned to the ground we're gonna talk a little bit about that more tomorrow hopefully with a Capitol Hill police whistleblower but Capitol police chief Thomas Manger asked Congress for more funding outside the Capitol so they have an office in Tampa they create an office in California that needs to be completely defunded they're outside operations they need to be burned to the ground it is truly truly a disgrace but anyway that back to our list that is number three so to defund all the January 6 stuff or at least the new stuff the political persecutions that need to be in there obviously what needs to be in there is barring any surveillance by DHS you know agents like HSI or FBI of any American where there is no probable cause that he committed a crime and to have a special cause of action for defense attorneys to go after individual members of the executive branch law enforcement agencies well I mean the case of Capitol Hill police I guess that's legislative branch to unless or in the case where there is prima facie evidence they're targeting them for their political beliefs and one of those things is to use comparisons where you do not find similar cases among BLM or Antifa that would be a valid motion certainly as a defense motion but possibly also a cause of action against individual members but again this is the type of thing we need to do and then there's the big one I wanted to get to want to spend some time on here today which is the Green New Deal Republicans totally screwed us over on the debt ceiling deal not getting rid of the Green New Deal we cannot wait until 2025 to deal with this massive misallocation of energy resources you don't understand I mean if we don't stop this the average person will be boxed out of purchasing a car this this um this entire green energy thing this electric car hell needs to be uprooted immediately do you know that it's not just more expensive to purchase an electric vehicle but actually this is from the UK Daily Mail the price of a of a petrol trolling is dropped to around 144 pounds per liter meaning it cost 72 pounds to fill up a typical car as a result the cost per mile for the electric Volkswagen ID3 is 21.43 pounds compared to 13 for their equivalent Volkswagen's equivalent gas powered car so almost double because obviously they have two policies at the same time they're making electricity more scarce and the electric grid a weaker and more tenuous than ever by forcibly putting it through mandates and subsidies on solar and wind rather than gas and coal so they make it weaker and then they're flooding it with electric vehicle usage we cannot survive that that will it's not just that it's gonna kill the American automobile which they're doing but it's also going to destroy our electric grid I mean that's game over this is the sort of thing that we were worried about post 9-11 that the terrorists would do but instead our own government acts like terrorists just like they did with biomedical security everything we feared they would do in after 9-11 attack us with bio weapons our government did this attack our electric grid our government's doing that I mean this is really really bad and again these things don't work and they know that according to a survey from JD power 21.5% of EV drivers complain that they were unable to successfully recharge at a public station another survey found 25% of the 657 plugs in the San Fran sicko area weren't working their parts break information screens freeze payment systems malfunction copper thieves steal the courts said to think in all these blue areas where they have this stuff so because of their crime policies jailbreak they're still in the stuff so it's out of out of operation and again they know this they know this of course 80% of the EV market all the processing is in China all the resource so by the way it's it's dirty as hell the amount of mining you need is much dirtier to create an EV for the environment than it is you know normal car but then at the same time our government is regulating our own mining out of existence purposely ensuring that China gets all the business because again our government is a client state of China I mean this stuff is a winning issue it ropes in the basic cost of living the standard of living the energy the lifeblood of our economy and China you can't get a better issue than this and then I mean this is already happening Jeep maker stellante is already warned that they're gonna be sending fewer gas powered cars to the blue states to the car dealerships there because the mandates that a certain percentage be EVs and now Biden has that mandate you know what is it 67% EVs by 2032 that needs to be defunded you cannot wait until 2025 I mean we're already suffering with the car market is completely destroyed by EVs our electric grid is being destroyed and then it's not just the EVs it's all the other stuff to the carbon capture the solar and the wind it needs and the carbon capture we have because of the subsidies landowners getting screwed over in South Dakota now that could be dealt with at a state level they won't do it but the subsidies are at a federal level that needs to end this is the Obamacare level fight of our time which they screwed us in Obamacare of course we cannot wait we've talked a lot about the presidential election but the bottom line is we cannot wait until 2025 this fight needs to be picked now now now now by the way just mark Mills of the Manhattan Institute perfectly summed this up to match the energy stored in one pound of oil requires 15 pounds of lithium battery which in turn entails digging up 7,000 pounds of rock and dirt to get the minerals needed lithium graphite copper nickel aluminum zinc magnesium and so on thus fabricating a typical single half ton EV battery requires mining and processing about 250 tons of materials for the carbon counters tracking such things the global mining and minerals sector uses 40% of all industrial energy dominated by oil colon gas by the way and that's before we take into consideration the massive expansion that would be required to supply all the battery factories plan for the widespread EV adoption it is the biggest lie in the world we cannot wait this needs to be repealed lock stock and barrel and by the way here's just another great explanation of how they're gonna make everything so much more expensive there's an article at the cowboy state daily why do electricity costs keep going up despite more wind and solar being added to the grid you know so basically we've been told over the years well imagine just harnessing natural God given wind doesn't cost anything you have sunny have wind and you're good to go yet the more we put into solar and wind consumers paid 14.3% more for electricity in 2022 than 2021 and that's going up in a lot of localities they paid even more so they note that they quote this guy from the University of Wyoming a researcher there Paul Boniface levelized cost of electricity tells you the cost of electricity but only when the power source is generating electricity electricity is a product is unique to any other product produced in that it's consumed instantaneously at the moment it's produced what do we want to happen when we flick a switch law on it's not that we want electricity it's that we want electricity all the time when the wind isn't blowing where the Sun is not shining coal-fired and natural gas-fired power plants increase their output to cover the lack of energy from wind and solar farms without this dispatchable power available the lights don't stay on as more wind and solar farms are built dispatchable power plants sit idle more often but they are indispensable because they must be available when they are needed this means more infrastructure has to be built to back up intermittent solar and wind power this is the lie that's not put into any of their calculations to illustrate this boniface uses a hypothetical island that requires a hundred megawatts of electricity for its consumers if you build a natural gas-fired plant it will produce electricity nearly all the time the same 100 megawatts solar farm however will produce power several hours a day unless it's cloudy then it's nothing maybe a battery power will get you a few more hours but it's very very expensive that still leaves a large portion of the day without any electricity that means a natural gas plant needs to be ready to go when the batteries and solar farm are laying an egg and here's the important point it's not like just because you're running the natural gas plant less often you can lay off most of the staff the incremental cost saving is the cost of operating the that power plant less when the sun is shining any notes if anything as we always understood it makes it worse it makes it worse because you have you have more fixed and maintenance cost than you would have otherwise right because you have to constantly basically you have you have to have the same level of staff and infrastructure as if you're pervaying something a hundred percent but only do it let's say 60 70 percent so you're literally paying more just to prop up a scheme okay it's literally like let's say I'm loading a bunch of them I'm at a farm and I'm picking vegetables and I'm loading things into loading the harvest into a tall truck and I'm like you know we want to I don't know I have an agenda I want to teach young kids eight-year-olds had to pick vegetables so I'm gonna line up a bunch of eight-year-old kids in front of the trucks to go and dump the vegetables in except the kids are too short to reach the thing so I'm gonna have to have the adults pick them up to do it that's what we're doing with our electric this is untenable and they know it they know it and by the way this stuff is horrible horrible for the environment the solar the wind the turbines and the the solar panels the degradation and depletion and the you know this stuff does not biodegrade it is really bad this entire thing is the most destructive thing to our liberty our lifestyle our economy our prosperity this thing needs to be repealed just like Obamacare we were like we our health care system will be destroyed and indeed as we learn painfully it has been our electric grid and energy will look like Obamacare if this is not repealed and and yeah I mean you have the carbon capture stuff too Greg Price who's the communications director for the freedom call the state freedom caucuses so not just out the code of but all of them he has this a sub-stack called parabellum when green energy comes for your farm and he talks about we were the only one who's covered this but the eminent domain so it turns out that over over 80 properties have now been hit up with court summons for eminent domain and this carbon summit summit carbon solutions is just knocking on their door and they have these big private security armies it's literally out of a movie so our government through venture socialism enables private companies that would never be able to subsist on their own in a free market to come with security and grab your land for agenda 23 in the Red States in America oh by the way to fund a pipeline to nowhere to capture carbon ironically for ethanol which itself only got off the ground because of government subsidies and mandates then itself degrades our efficiency and energy disgusting it is disgusting that Christie gnome has not called a special session to deal with this but this is where we are so anyway that is why we must repeal the green energy there what are we up to that's four five no new Ukraine funding period this thing is a freaking scam by the way we're led to believe they're saying now always the Ukrainians who blew up the Nord Stream pipeline dude the Ukrainians I don't even know if they have a navy the degree of specialty you would need to do that how in the world did they have a navy my buddy Jordan Shachtell has a funny map Ukraine is landlocked they would have had to have somehow gotten around the Russian blockade in the Black Sea got out to the Mediterranean Sea somehow went all the way to you know to Gibraltar and then the Atlantic Ocean north to the North Sea and then the Baltic Sea to somehow blow it up it is the most absurd thing in the world we know exactly who blew it up that scam needs to come to an end the entire Biden corruption nexus works through Ukraine number six obviously the border this is a very popular issue ban funding for all catch and release nobody can be released at our border done period okay that needs to be in the bill seven transgenderism to defund all promotion of transgenderism grooming funding of sex change operation mandates on the states with Department of Education funding for sports or bathrooms all of that needs to be taken out its Department of Education but it's really certainly HHS and it's all over the gambit of government funding state Department are exporting the filth the filth that we are exporting to Africa to the Middle East to other countries is disgusting that America has now become the biggest cultural polluter in the entire world exporting that trash to cultures that don't want it don't need it it's not enough that we've ruined our own so I mean these are some of the things I mean I could think of more aid obviously would be the department Department of HUD funding the AFF H that is the tool to gerrymander suburbs and mandate a certain amount of low-income housing in the suburbs that needs to be blocked as well there are many many things we have three and a half months in toll the budget we need to build the the actual details of the bills and the messaging behind them I know they're not going to do it but I need to lay down that marker anyway to show you the opportunity we have these are winning issues it's winning leverage if anything you have more leverage like I said as a block and tackle when you have control of just the house now is the time to do this you will never get another opportunity but again Republicans don't see this sense of urgency they don't feel it they don't believe in it to them it's just another day in politics it's like our lives have not changed it's like these eight or so issues we've mentioned don't exist it's truly truly disgusting how pathetic these people are they refuse to use these leverage points you know another one's gonna be the farm bill they need to block all subsidies that create monopolies for Chinese subsidiaries and you know monopolies for these big ag places that are doing to our food what we did to healthcare we need to get rid of all the conservation programs paying farmers not to grow food we need to ban all the global warming regulations and subsidies in that bill just just to name a few things food security is a huge huge issue some of the regulations on unpasteurized milk things like that need to be dealt with we need a provision banning mRNA in agriculture why don't we have strategic thinkers thinking of this this is where the fight is at it's not in two years from now it's on the presidential election it's right here right now use the leverage you have and by the way speaking of leverage there's other leverage points I want to talk about so Democrats technically have very very tenuous control the Senate but there's a tradition called the blue slip with judicial nominees that that you could really gum up the works of the majority party if you have members of the minority party from the state where that judicial nominee hells from so Biden is set by the nominated two individuals to fill vacancies on the federal district courts in Louisiana okay so Louisiana you have two senators Bill Cassidy an official rhino and John Kennedy who's a fraud that has this whole folksy business but he's really you know nothing new typical establishment Republican conservative media loves him but he's he's a fraud so those two dudes are officially Republicans they could do what's called a blue slip you refuse to fill out the blue slip where you where you have the home state senators sign off and that could really gum up the works on these people one of the nominees is a guy named Brandon Scott for for this federal district court brand I'm sorry Brandon Scott long he is a former deputy chief of staff to FBI director Chris Ray after everything this FBI has done to violate the spirit on which America was founded surveilling persecuting targeting people for their political beliefs not just January 6 across the gambit and yet these senators already filled out the blue slip see this is what it means when you say you did what you poison the American people you politically targeted you worked with the cartels to open our border you groomed our people with trannyism you ruined our economy and inflation and energy with the Green New Deal we will not cooperate on the debt ceiling we will not cooperate on the budget on the realization bills on the farm bill and and on something like judicial nominees the blues liberal these are I'm just giving you examples when they say we have no power it's not true it's truly disgusting by the way Biden has now nominated 170 people to judgeships I mean it's pretty good for two and a half years really remaking it by the way 64 per just so you know 64 percent have are non-white which is insane when you look at the percentage in the pipeline just you know um qualified in the profession 64 percent and again I just want to end with this point we're almost at a time we talked a little bit yesterday about judicial supremacism and a we need to fight judicial supremacism and at a minimum when you have power you need someone who's going to appoint a Clarence Thomas to every Supreme Court um appellate court and district court vacancy not just oh he's not a Democrat we can't have more Brett Kavanaugh's um to underscore this I mean again the Biden admin they are batting a thousand there is not a single one of them that is not a pedal to the metal forth right nutcase whereas on our side we don't have that so there was another judge and now this is a Democrat appointee yesterday we talked about how you know the one success we had was on some of the training issues in the state legislative sessions well federal judge in Florida paused the enforcement of of Florida's ban on on uh castration now it wasn't across the border was only for the plaintiffs which is really how an injunction should work there were three of them now it is true that Florida has a lot of very bad federal judges to Santas fix the state courts but federal obviously is no control over um most of the time they are overturned by the 11th circuit but i'm just going to tell you in general there's been this fight on the right where they're accusing the left of oh you're weakening the supreme court you want to weaken their jurisdiction you want to you know add more justices you want to limit their power i'm like bring it on baby i i believe we need to shake hands with the left on this if you think the the courts have too much power fine nine times out of ten it will benefit us and here's the reason why because basically there's judicial defense judicial offense in blue states we want to play judicial offense meaning they're passing laws that we feel are unconstitutional are going to harm us so we want to take it to court i will promise you there is no evidence that we ever benefit from that we except for guns guns is the only thing and even then they're gumming up the works with that passing all these limitations the blue states do what they want you need to get out of the blue states by a factor of a million if you want to live freely in the coming years you're never going to fix that so you have to move to a red state so all we can do is go into red state in hope to pass good legislation which is a enough of a struggle there we're playing judicial defense they're going to go to the courts and they will invalidate every last thing we want to do so i am just telling you i am all for saying hey you think we have a permanent majority in the supreme court fine well let's go up and down the gambit of the federal courts and let's weaken the notion of judicial supremacism the notion that other branches of government are helpless in pushing back against them i know this is a little bit terse you know at the end of the show it requires its own uh uh you know discussion but i'm just saying judicial supremacism as we get some of these red states to do more things that we want increasingly it's going to get in our way while never being there for us in the blue states when we need them but anyway folks a lot of information we covered a lot of ground you listen to this show versus others like whoa it's a it's a world of a difference that's why i need you guys to help grow our algorithm on itunes if you haven't if you could give us a five-star rating with a comment because that helps the algorithm um it also helps us against the trolls we really really greatly appreciated the fight is right here right now the leverage is now now is when we need to act on substance and outcomes not just talking points till tomorrow god bless y'all and thank you did you know that when a news site puts google ads on its articles they're also giving google the ability to suppress any article they don't like and make it virtually impossible for you to find it's true virtually every new site in the country uses google ad exchange which gives the big tech giant incredible power to control what you see at blaze media we've had enough we're doing something about it the blaze dot com has been revamped to get rid of every last ad that makes us the only conservative news site that's truly independent from big tech have a look for yourself and learn what you can do to help join the fight against big tech censorship visit the blaze dot com today"
