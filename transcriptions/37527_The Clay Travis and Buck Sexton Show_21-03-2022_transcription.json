Welcome to the Freedom Hut Monday, March 21st edition. I cannot believe how fast time is flying so far this year. Thanks for being with me. We have fascinating data out of Canada on how vaccination status somehow very much corresponds with Ukraine intervention opinions. I'll explain, but once you hear it, you'll be like, whoa, plus the Babylon B, an excellent satirical news and comedy site has been locked out of its Twitter account for calling a man a man. And I'll not do that anymore. Bloomberg has an amazing graphic or op ed with graphic on how to deal with inflation, which I'll tell you about. And the spies who lie from the New York Post from page, amazing stuff there, um, all these former deep state, supposed intelligence professionals and experts who somehow got it very wrong about the hundred Biden laptop right before an election, almost like it was never about getting it correct. It was just about doing what was necessary at the time for the apparatus to get what it wanted. I'll explain that and more coming up here. The tax filing deadline is coming up April 18th.

Russia's offensive northward from Crimea, southward from Belarus and then west from the Donbas region. This is a three pronged movement to try to cut the country effectively in half and cut off Ukrainian cities and the forces to defend them from resupply. So this is looking like it's going to be exactly where I thought it would weeks ago. Whenever it's like, oh, the Ukrainians are going to beat the Russians. I said, no, they're going to cut the country in half and have negotiations. That is the situation. And that is the reality as far as we can see from what's going on inside of that country. And here's a situation we're going to have to deal with. How do we end the conflict if we insist on a state that will not actually endure or if we insist on a state of affairs that cannot continue? Here is US ambassador to the UN saying the UN can't say if the US would recognize Crimea, if that was actually formally part of peace talks here. I can't say that at the moment. We certainly have not recognized the independent Dovoss regions that the Russians just declared as as independent. But I can't preview how we will respond to a negotiated settlement that the Ukrainians come up with the Russians to save the lives of their own people. What is the alternative to this? What is the alternative to a situation in which Russia gets some concession? It's continued bloodshed and warfare because the Russians have plenty in reserve. The Russians can keep going here. The Ukrainians are watching their cities get destroyed. And so we want this to end as quickly as possible. We want an end to the conflict. There is no future that I can see in which you do not have Crimea and Donbas as officially part of the Russian Federation. Maybe they'll give back the area that they have taken through invasion around Kyiv. But otherwise what we're going to have sanctions on Russia forever. We're going to live with the specter in decades long specter of a Russian nuclear exchange because we refuse to bring Russia back into the international community. There's what there's what feels and sounds good for people not in the conflict right now on the outside. And then there's what is reality. And they are not the same thing. I think that's very important to recognize as we move through this. And I mentioned you at the very top here. How should Canada respond? This is a poll that came out of the weekend. And E. K. O. S. Ecoce poll, whatever from the from the Toronto Star, I think it is one of those Canadian papers. How should Canada respond to Ukraine invasion by vaccination status? Now, why should vaccination status have anything to do with whether or not you think we should go or sorry, Canada, but close enough, Canada should do more in Ukraine. Right. That doesn't hold others to make any sense. Oh, because what this is really giving you is a snapshot of who believes state media, which is officially what they have in Canada. And pretty much what they have in this country on the Biden regime to who believes state media regime mouth pieces in the news media and who can be most easily pushed by emotion into taking very extreme positions on matters of foreign policy that don't actually affect the individuals in Canada or the US. How should Canada respond to Ukraine invasion vaccinated versus unvaccinated? If you have received three or more shots of the vaccine, so you're you're boosted or beyond 86% won even tougher economic sanctions on Russia. 85% want Russian assets oligarchs or Russian oligarchs assets seized, cutting off all oil from Russia 81%, sending more military equipment to Ukraine 82%, providing additional loans and non military aid to Ukraine, 78%, providing Ukraine with fighter jets 52%, dispatching military forces to Ukraine 30%. So a third of them are like, let's go, let's go for war with Russia. And that's what that's straight up that's military intervention in an active combat zone. Now we are a combatant. That is or Canada close enough. That is war with Russia. He's like, okay, Buck. Well, how did the unvaccinated view these issues? And this is fascinating. Impose tougher economic sanctions on Russia 13% sees Russian oligarchs assets 13%, cut off oil 21%, send additional military 18, provide additional loans 15, provide you cram with fighter jets 15, dispatching military forces to Ukraine 11% and do nothing of the above 52%. So isn't it fascinating to see that people in and I'm sure this would be pretty similar in America too, the unvaccinated are somehow much less desirous of a military intervention by the Canadian Armed Forces in Ukraine than those who are already boosted. Hmm. Why is there such a big correlation here? What, what does one have to do with the other? Well, because as we know, the vaccine apparatus, the regime of get the shot or else relied very heavily on state media relied very heavily on its control of communication in order to silence dissent and get people to do things. And now we recognize we're completely unjustifiable, baseless and wrong. You can also get people to think whatever you want on foreign policy. If you can mobilize people to get shots they don't need or else and and for them to be supportive of it, yay, boosters, you can get them to think, yeah, we've always been at war with Russia and Ukraine. We've never not been at war with Russia and Ukraine catching the Orwell vibes here. When really this needs to be a negotiated settlement brought to a conclusion as quickly as possible, this, this idea that is being pushed in the West that the glorious Ukrainian resistance, if only we give them a little bit more is going to defeat the Russian military is in my assessment, fantasy and dangerous. But people who have believed everything they were told about the vaccine, they believe everything they're told about Ukraine too. You're noticing this, you're noticing the crossover. Can you say that a man is a man on social media anymore? No, you cannot. Not unless you want to lose your account, not unless you want to lose your access to a important digital town square. We'll get into that in a second. Twitter banning for now, the Babylon B and what it tells us about our future. You've heard me say what's happening in our cities to police is a disgrace. There's all these hostile activists defund the police, abolish the police, rogue prosecutors, all this stuff, liberal media, politicians who pander, progressive policies have even resulted in wrongful charges against cops who then face unimaginable personal pressure and financial burden. That's why the law enforcement legal defense fund at police defense.org educates the public on the risks and threats associated with being a law enforcement officer today. They raise funds to support police financially burdened as a result of being wrongfully charged. They can't help without generous support from people like you. Go to police defense.org. See what they're doing to support our heroic officers and their families in an era of defon the police. Learn about defending the police. Use the simulator. See the types of decisions police must make every day on the street. It's time to stand up for our men and women in blue. Help today at police defense.org. That's police defense.org. Babylon be suspended from Twitter. You might be wondering, why have the bee been suspended? What terrible thing have they done that has resulted in this? Well, they just spoke the simple truth. Babylon be referred to Rachel Levine, the health and what HHS or whatever it is, Admiral. Apparently HHS has admirals. The Babylon Bee did a story naming Rachel Levine, the transgender Biden administration official, Man of the Year. Twitter has now said it will restore the account if the Babylon Bee, after they suspended it, obviously, yes, Department of Health and Human Services Assistant Secretary Rachel Levine. Babylon Bee says it will restore the account if the bee deletes the tweet. The problem with that is there's nothing wrong with the tweet. The tweet is accurate that it is upsetting to people who like to live in a fantasy world that like to live in the unreality of gender is a social construct. No, it is not. Obviously the people say this to you are pathetic too. The ones in the media that are pushing this narrative all the time, it's just a social construct. Really? Really? You're a bigot? Four years ago, all these same people would have said, oh, no, of course, we won't have men and women sports. That doesn't make any sense. No, you're a bigot. Just like the people that get the three shots and want us to invade Ukraine, whatever the apparatus tells them, they parrot. Whatever they think puts them on the side of the good smart people they go along with. They have no capability to think for themselves to decipher fact from fiction on their own. They're just a part of the herd and it's all the same to them as long as they're safe and warm and fed. It's all, it's all they care about. So we have this tweet, delete or not situation underway here to delete or not to delete. And Seth Dillon, the Babylon Bee, says that he won't do it because the Babylon Bee's man of the years, Rachel Levine, that's what they've said. The Twitter sensors have decided that you're not allowed to say that. Rachel Levine is a man. This is a fact. Rachel Levine is free to change his name. He is free to do any number of things. But you cannot change reality just because you feel like it or because your emotions dictated as such. And this is a parody site. It does satire and this satire bites. This satire hits home too much for them. So they are demanding, they are demanding the inversion of or the rejection of reality in, in this instance, that Rachel Levine is not a man. Rachel Levine is a man. Rachel Levine has been a man until this year, I believe, or the last couple of years. So this is a person who is now middle-aged and you've only ever heard of because he is transgender. And we're to believe if you say anything that is wrong about this individual, you're a, or you refuse to go along with the storyline here, you're a bad person. I say no. How can you deal with the rise of inflation right now? There is a, a fantastic op-ed in Bloomberg, Bloomberg. Hello, everybody, about what you can do to deal with the cost of inflation. But first, you run a small business, but who's running your HR? If the answer is, answer is, I'll figure it out myself or no one.

Senator John Baroso pointing out here that Biden cannot hide from the fact that he is in fact the high, high gas price president. Joe Biden can't hide from the fact that he is the president of high gas prices and they're looking for anyone to blame. Whether it's Putin, whether it's Republicans, whether it's the energy companies, whether it's COVID, the Democrats have a very big problem with 40-year high inflation, highest gas prices ever. When Joe Biden came into office, it was $2.38 a gallon for gasoline. American families paid $1,000 more George for energy last year than the year before. And on polling last week, 70% of Americans say more American oil and gas and less emphasis on climate. The climate emphasis is the lunacy that makes everything more difficult, expensive and problematic for us on the energy front. That's why they're always making the wrong decisions, even obvious decisions they make in the wrong direction because they believe in this other thing. We're not trying to achieve the same goal, which is energy independence for America, low price of energy, a booming economy and lots of prosperity. No, they want to save the planet by lowering climate change. That's their most important goal, which is why going into this midterm, they got a problem. And this is the Bloomberg opinion piece that addresses it in some way. As I've said, take the bus peasant or go get a Tesla peasant is not a compelling midterm pitch for Democrats right now. That's probably not going to work out very well. Bloomberg opinion piece. I should check out who wrote it. It doesn't even matter. It's amazingly published it inflation stings most. If you earn less than $300,000, yeah, no, you know what, here's how to deal. Don't take the bus. Don't buy in bulk. Try lentils instead of meat. And nobody said this would be fun. Take the bus and eat some lentils peasants. That is a winning political message. Because who wants a delicious cheeseburger? Maybe with some bacon on it, when you can have a nice patty of lentils to save a dime or so. Take the bus and eat your lentils peasant. Plus don't buy in bulk. Also, doesn't make sense because the price is going to go up with inflation. Prices aren't going down. So buying in bulk allows you to get the discount of bulk buying. Plus, you avoid the inflationary increases that you'll see in a month, three months, etc. So this is bad advice across the board. But it is hilarious that they're saying this is this is like when when the the boomers blew up the economy so that they could package mortgages and sell them on Wall Street and everything else. You know, the Wall Street boomers and then they turn around after almost melting down the entire global economy. Maybe the millennials should make their own coffee. Maybe you should stop drinking those four dollar lattes. I don't think the four dollar lattes were what almost destroyed the entire global economy. I'm pretty sure it was the commoditizing packaging and reckless risk selling of trillions and trillions of dollars of mortgages. Yeah, that was probably bad. Bad idea. But nonetheless, here we are.
