    "text": " I think a lot of people put too much of like an artificial separation between housework and market work. And there's these weird kind of status issues where the person doing the market work gets a lot more respect than the person doing the housework. And I think that's probably not good. But yeah, I think it's helpful to try to not have those kind of strong connotations to it and just you want in a partnership, you want both partners to be contributing roughly equal amounts, but they can do that in different ways. And if you have one partner who's working very hard and bringing in more of the income, it's just totally reasonable. The other partner would contribute more around the house. Hello and welcome to Why's This Happening with me, your host Chris Hayes. Well with Bob listeners, I'm going to take you behind the curtain today. Right now, as I'm talking to you, it is 3.10 PM. Right before I got hopped on this microphone, my son David is 8 years old, came home. And I was in the midst of a editorial call, but I sort of finished that up. He sat down, we talked a little bit about his day, talked to me, had any homework, made him some popcorn for a snack. I was drinking a fresca, he asked for some, I gave it to him, but just a little. And I am sharing these banal details of my day because to me, these moments are totally utterly transformational. They have completely changed my life, thanks to the pandemic. And what I mean by that is, I have three children, Ryan who's 11, David who's 8, on he who's 4, about to be 5. Before the pandemic, my schedule was such that I would get up in the morning with the kids and me and Kate would get them out of the house to go to their various places, which if you're a parent, you know, is incredibly, incredibly stressful. And not like, I wouldn't really call quality time. It's like a lot of like, brush your teeth and put your shoes on. Wait, did you leave your jacket at school? Okay. Like, you know, you're doing this kind of high energy motivation the whole time. And then they would go to school and then I would, you know, go to work midday and I would come home at 10 and they would be in bed because my show's from 8 to 9. So I get home at 10. And then I wouldn't see them until the next morning. And then that would be then the next morning we would do the same thing. And that would be the week. Good mornings of 40 minutes of frenetic condensed, like getting them to school time. And as time went on, we have more and more kids and our family grew and it really started to wear on me to the point where I was like, I can't keep doing this job anymore because I feel like I'm not really getting enough time with my kids. And it also meant that Kate shouldered a really big parenting burden in terms of doing bedtime, which is its own sort of like being undertaking, particularly with three kids and dinner and also like coordinating after school activities and there's kids to go all these places and I'm like, well, I'm at work. So, you know, the pandemic happened and what's changed my schedule is that since I started going back to 30 Rock in the fall of 2020, so it's now two years, I go into 30 Rock at 6 p.m. Basically, I work from home during the day to make the show, do the calls, you know, all the things that I would normally do, just not at the office. And then at 6 or 6, 15, I get on the subway, I go into 30 Rock, I get into makeup, I do the show, I check the scripts. What this means is, this time right now, when I'm talking to you in the old days, I would be doing it from 30 Rock right now, doing it from my home. And what it means is I got to see David come home, I will see Anya when I go downstairs and we will cuddle on the couch and read a book or two. I will walk Ryan to her to do track at the YMCA before I go into the office. This is, I can't articulate what a revolution it's been in my life. And I think both for like our partnership with me and Kate, I can do more of coordinating after school activities. I feel like I'm a better and more equitable partner in the parenting and some of the logistical stuff. I feel closer to them. I mean, I think I was always a present dad and a loving dad, but just time wise, like being around them really makes a huge difference. And I'm doing all this as a big setup for the guest today, who's someone who I've known and read and really admired for a long time, his name is Tim Lee. And he's a reporter. I'm definitely encountered his bylines. He's written a lot about economics, housing, labor markets, technology. He's been in a variety of outlets for the years, Washington Post and Vox and Ars Technica for a while for the Ars Technica heads out there, the real ones now. And he's now writing a great sub stack called Full Stack Economics. But he wrote a piece a few months back that was basically about the decision he made as a father to what he called lean out, which is to say, just to reduce the hours he was working so that he could be the primary parental presence caregiver, while his wife, who's a doctor, was working lots of hours. And the decision that went into that, the rewards that it gave him, and then he got a lot of feedback and interviewed a lot of other dads about this decision. And I found it really, really inspiring. And I thought it'd be a great topic for conversation, just some good holiday dad talk, basically with Tim Lee. So Tim, welcome to the program. Hi, thanks for having me on. I've been listening to With Potts since the beginning, so it's really fun to chat. Oh, that's awesome. I love the piece you wrote. Maybe I thought before getting into it, maybe you could just describe your basic household setup before the kind of leaning out and the kids you have, the ages, where you live, what your sort of general kind of household situations like. Sure, so I have three kids. They are seven, four, and one currently. And I live in Washington DC. Yeah, that's the thick of it. Yeah, it's a lot of. I guess I'm two or three years behind you, but similar age distribution there. And live in Washington DC. My two older kids go to a neighborhood school, so we're able to walk to school. So that's very nice. But I wouldn't say there was one very specific point in time. And there was the point last year when I quit my full time job and started the sub-stacks. So that was important. But even before that, what happened was really just my wife has a very demanding job. She's an old guy and doctor, and so she delivers babies, which means about one night a week. She has to be in the hospital, and she has to be at work at 8 a.m. every morning. And so just as we got went from zero to one to two to three kids, there were just more and more demands on the time of one parent and as the one with the more flexible job that usually fell to me. And so over time, when my second child was born, I cut down my hours about 10%. And then like I said, last year I quit my job and became a full time sub-stacker. And so now I'd say I probably work 30 to 40 hours a week, but the hours kind of work around when I'm needed for the children. So like if the kids are sick or if there's a point that I need to take a kid to or something like that, I kind of prioritize that. And then I write the newsletter in the hours that are left, which is a fair number every week, but it's a little bit unpredictable, which makes it hard, for example, to schedule reporting trips or do other things that really require me to be at a particular place in a particular time. Yeah, I mean the point about the flexibility I think is worth just pausing on, because I think it's such a key thing, right? There's like the total hours that one works, and then there's the flexibility with those hours. So for me, I have two aspects. There's one part of it, which is utterly inflexible, which is that a green light comes on to that our camera at 8 p.m. exactly on the dot eastern time. I have to be sitting in that chair and we have to do the show from 8 to 9. That is utterly inflexible. The stuff during the day of the workflow of when like that's more flexible, we can sometimes we just ended the meeting I had before this like a little early so that I could come do the podcast. But I think for everyone up and down, you know, the hierarchy of the American labor market, we just saw this with the railroad strike, right? Or the threatened railroad strike. I mean, when you read into it, what you found out was railroad workers are essentially on call all the time. Like they have to get told this train needs to be fixed 90 minutes from your house at 2 a.m. Go. And so no amount of compensation or, you know, protections or all that stuff makes up for the sheer fact of flexibility versus inflexibility when trying to structure a household be apparent and raise kids. That's right. And being a parent is in a sense one of the most inflexible jobs around because, you know, if your kid gets sick and school calls and says, you have to come pick them up, like you have to come pick them up. There's no like, oh, like you guys keep them for a few hours at all come later. And so yeah, you have to have at least one parent who is available to at least to be available in emergencies. How much have you guys discussed this through the years as this kind of progressions happen, particularly with the very demanding and important and also inflexible work of being a doctor that delivers babies? So I think, like I said, it was gradual. So I don't think there was ever a moment where we kind of made it the explicit decision that I would like I would be the leaning out dad. But we definitely check in regularly. My wife's a very empathetic and thoughtful person. So I think she definitely expresses appreciation for the times when I kind of step up to do parenting and conversely, I like kind of check in and make sure she's okay with me not making very much money with the current arrangement. And so I think it's worked out well for both of us, but I definitely think it's, yeah, it's important to have that communication and have both members of the couple kind of feel comfortable with who's contributing what to the relationship. Yeah, I mean, I think that's one of the things that happens, right, is that habit, culture, hierarchy, socialization will fill the gap where communication doesn't happen. Yeah, right. No matter how I think equitable your particular relationship is or how feminist you identify as a speaking for myself is like a cis straight man. We're all products of society and in the intimate little factory that is the household, you know, these roles will sort of just slide in. And that is probably even in my part sort of not taking enough responsibility for agency, right? Those roles are that like you don't have to do as much work in the household as the dad. And you know, that's a certain kind of luxury that is I think can be seductive for men. Yeah, absolutely. So I think in my case, because my wife had this demanding job long before we have kids, I think I probably leaned out a little bit in more subtle ways earlier. So I followed her to medical school. Right. She would often come home very tired and so I ended up kind of doing the dishes. And she would go to bed and then I would stay up and do the dishes while she was sleeping. And so I think we had a little bit of those kind of patterns of there were certain things that I did where I was doing more than half of the dishes in laundry before our kids were born. But yeah, it's definitely is something where it's easy to sort of get lazy. And so it's important to kind of check in with how things are going. Did that produce? Was there, you could tell me if any of these questions are overly invasive, like, did that produce resentment? Was there, did you feel like, here I am doing the dishes? No, I don't think so. So I guess it was good for everybody if my wife was happy and well rested. And so I'm actually a little bit like a sleep zealot and so I'm like constantly pushing her to take our naps and get to bed on time. And so that was kind of part of that strategy is like, sometimes she would want to step and do the dishes and I would know that if she did that, then she wouldn't get enough sleep that night. It would be like in a bed mood the next morning. And so yeah, in my case, I think I just had a pretty good attitude about it. And it was just like the work needs to be done. But I think it does make a big difference. Like she was making like two to three times as much money as me. And so I just think it was like pretty obvious that like we needed to prioritize like her being kind of on the top of her game. And so supporting her in ways like that helped her do that. I mean, that's the other big part of this and we'll get into some of the conversations you've had with other people. But I think that these, right, so there's these two things that happen, right? There's like gendered expectations in the household where there are messages sent about who does what work. And often those are massively favorable to the man. The sort of like the essentially what ends up being a kind of retrograde justification for it, at least in the old like heteronormative mid century family household, right, was that there was a division of labor where like one person in the household's doing market labor ones doing mon non market labor, the man is doing the market labor. They're going to work. They're producing the income for the household. The woman is at home doing the non market labor that's uncompensated, but incredibly important. And so that's the like, that's the division of labor and the comparative advantage. Of course, that's all bound up in all centuries of hierarchy and patriarchy. But it's still the case that in modern relationships, it will often be the case that one person will produce a lot more market income than the other. And then that question presents itself of, well, are we going to sort of have the kind of compensatory comparative advantage, you know, relative lanes? And I guess how much did you guys talk about that as an actual thing? And how much was that just evolved? I mean, I do think part of it was that it was just like physically not possible in some cases for her to do half the housework. And so if I kind of slacked off like what would happen is the work wouldn't get done. And then she would, I think she would more feel guilty about it than be mad at me, but then that was kind of bad for everybody. And so just like, I don't think I'm a particularly person, a person, but she's like not like a compulsive cleaner either. And so it just got to the point where I think she's a little bit non-sereotypical for women where usually the woman has a much higher threshold for kind of the level of cleanliness that they'll accept. And I think she's a little bit had a lower threshold. And so she just didn't do the work. And I was like, well, it needs to be done. So I might as well do it. And that didn't produce like there was no resentment there or there was no like fights over that. No, because I mean, I'm sure there'd been a few cases of disagreement, but she was like working so hard. Like we got married just before she started her residency. So during her residency, there would be months where she was working every night five days a week for a month. Yeah, those are the most insane work hours imaginable, Mason. Yeah, and so she'd just be totally exhausted. So I never felt like I was doing more than my share because she was obviously doing more than her share of like, as you combine kind of home and market work. And I was obviously gonna benefit in the wrong one because she was gonna make a lot of money as a physician over the course of her career. And so I just felt like that's my contribution was like I'm gonna do this housework that's like not as difficult as what she was doing. It's interesting as I hear you talk about this and because I've known you for many years and we have had like mutual friends in common and lived in DC at the same time. And I feel like you've been an economics writer and I feel like you have a pretty like econ framework for viewing things generally. And I sort of hear it in your head in an interesting way that like seems like it is a way of thinking about these trade offs that takes like the some of the emotional freight out of them. That's these sort of like family firm decisions about who's doing what. Yeah, absolutely. I mean, I think a lot of people put too much of like an artificial separation between housework and market work. And there's these weird kind of status issues where the person doing the market work gets a lot more respect than the person doing the housework. And I think that's probably not good. But yeah, I think it's helpful to try to not have those kind of strong connotations to it. You want in a partnership, you want both partners to be contributing roughly equal amounts, but they can do that in different ways. And if you have one partner who's working very hard and bringing in more of the income is just totally reasonable. The other partner would contribute more around the house. So there's a double edged sword to that logic though, right? Because if you say like that logic has it in your case has this kind of like, you know, sort of post patriarchy feminism do it because it's not the traditional, you know, inherited gender roles, but given the way that market structures work, given the massive ways that socialization produce different jobs, the way that the labor market values work that's like care work, for instance, which is like coded as, you know, female and other kinds of work, which is coded as male, that you could very end up easily end up. And I think it happens to many couples, many straight couples I should note here or couples with a man and woman, that the logic of this sort of like the person doing the market work is doing less at home ends up just being the traditional gender division. Yeah, and I think that it's not bad that there are some couples where that's how it works out. I definitely think it would be good for society if there are more couples that work the way that my household works. But I think the trap that a lot of people have fallen into is that you're so you're going to have some kind of more conservative couples that are just going to do the traditional thing and not be conflicted about it. If you then have all the feminist couples hold up like perfect equality in like every aspect of the relationship as the ideal, that means there's going to be very few women who really excel in their career because usually you have to work, you know, more than 40 hours week to excel. And so you can end up in a way you cannot end up actually reinforcing patriarchy because the only people who excel are the ones who have a wife at home, you know, doing more than half of the housework. And so I guess I'm not inclined to like moralize about it. If some couple wants to have a traditional male friend, whether it's like household, I kind of see that as their business. But I think if you are a feminist who really wants to see more women rise into leadership roles, you should be really thinking about is like equity of the ideal or if you had in a couple where the woman is pretty ambitious, should you actually think about maybe she should be the breadwinner and maybe the husband should take a supportive role. I'm not saying anybody was like obligated to do that, but I think that should be seen as a if anything a little better than a little more feminist than the kind of 50 50 relationship. It's also important I think to make distinctions can be talking about sort of what is broadly called housework, right? So the maintenance of a household and whether that's laundry or other things. But then there's parenting, right? And that to me is in a different category because like I'll be one, I'll keep it 100 here like I don't really like doing laundry, but I do like being with my kids. Like those are very like, you know, parenting is really difficult, but it's the most profoundly rewarding experience of my life. Whereas like a lot of the other stuff doesn't give you the same reward, it just has to be done and a question of who's going to do it. And I do think that like one of the great, you know, and we've seen this, you know, if you look at the time use surveys, which are really interesting, you know, men are spending more and more time with their kids than a generation ago. It's one of the really good and encouraging trajectories in time use. Now the funny thing is women are as well. So parents generally are spending more time with their kids and women are still disproportionately spending more time with their kids than men are. But if you compare men now to 20 years ago or 40 years ago, because we have an American time use, you know, survey data that's, you know, tracks how the hours in the day men are spending more time with their kids. And I do think Ezra has talked about this a lot as a client. It is like one of these great sort of a lie sold to men, right? For generations that like being with your kids was a chore or being with your kids was like, you know, quote unquote, housework or women's work or whatever it was when in fact, being with your kids is like the awesomest thing in the world. Yeah, absolutely. I do think there's different types of, as you were saying in your introduction, getting your kids to school in the morning is probably more rewarding than doing the dishes, but it's not as rewarding as, you know, doing some kind of, you know, more play oriented activities. And there are aspects of childcare that are still quite difficult and not super rewarding. And I think the spouse that kind of leans out often gets to do a lot of those things. Yes. And the one that maybe leads in and sees their kid less like when they're there, they get to kind of often they get to do more of the kind of fun stuff where they're taking into the playground or, you know, playing a game with them or something as opposed to, you know, taking them to a doctor's appointment. Yeah, that's a good point. Although don't you think I think there's a relationship between the two and this is one of the things that I've found from being just around the kids more in the last three years is that we're, I guess, two and a half years. I do think that like being around for the more sure like aspects of parenting, right, which is like the doctor's appointment stuff like that, it has an effect on the bond and the relationship and the depth of what you have with your child that is ultimately when added up rewarding. Like in the specific instances, there are things you do with your kids that are like a grown right every parent has that. But in the aggregate, like, I don't think I'd trade a lot of them because a lot of the time you spend with your kids is going to be that ultimately. And the relationship you have sort of gets developed over even those, you know, frenetic mornings of getting the kids to school. Yeah, I agree with that. I mean, my wife makes enough money that we could hire more child care and I could put in more hours working and do something closer to full time. And so the other thing I don't think we've mentioned yet, my sister lives with us and she does pick up some afternoons. But yeah, we do definitely value having our kids spend most of their non school time with family members as opposed to hired help. And so yeah, I definitely agree that there's value to having spending time with kids. You talk about your sister learning to you because that was another aspect of your household I found fascinating and intriguing. I think like as I've gotten older, I more and more understand the logic of big households with multiple people or multi-generational. I mean, I think that multi-generational households are a little harder to pull off for people that have kids later than several generations ago, right? Because if you're having a kid, if your parents have you, 25 and you have a kid at 25, then you've got a 50 year old, which man, that feels so young to me now, right? Who's like there to help out with childcare, whereas if you have a kid at 40, your parents had you at 40, then an 80 year old is just not going to be in this, normally is going to be in the same position. And in fact, often needs care themselves. So these sort of multi-generational households that flow from people having kids younger, like I understand the logic of that much more. But I generally also just like having family around and even with all the complexities that that can obviously entail because I like being around family and there's something about having kids and kids having relationships with your siblings and your parents and other and cousins and things like that, that just feels incredibly fulfilling and beautiful. And so when you write about having your sister there, I was like, that's cool. That seems like an awesome setup if you have a good relationship with your sister. Yeah, we really love it. Yeah, absolutely. Because if you hire a nanny or something, they can bond with that person for a year or two or however many years and then they leave and it's harder on the kids. And yeah, I totally agree. So our both our families are in other cities. I'm from Minnesota, she's from Ohio. So we don't really have any other family here in Washington, DC. And yeah, just the logistics of making sure they have enough time with them is difficult. And so having at least one family member in the house is really good. And I also think having kind of a surplus of adults just makes the logistics of childcare much easier because my wife and I can go out on a date sometimes. And we don't even necessarily have to have my sister do bedtime, but just she'll be in the house and so we can leave the house. Or when somebody's making dinner, there's somebody else there to watch the kids is just having one or two extra adults around makes everything lower stress because you don't have to be super structured and scheduled about everything. It really is like a safety net for that stuff. And Kate and I, we have an au pair and this is the second year that we had and we had just like amazing, tremendous luck with it. And it's just great. I had no experience with au pairs. Kate had grown up and had au pairs. And I was like, yeah, let's try it. And like that's one of the things. First of all, I like it because it feels like another family member in a way. I feel like I have this like, it's like niece from out of town is visiting. But also because that safety net, particularly when you got three kids, we have a lot of kids, that safety net, there's another adult in the home. If I need to leave and Kate can't come back, right? And I remember this one moment where she was coming back from, this is before the pandemic, but she was coming back from a business trip and I was going to the airport. And like her flight had been delayed and the cab was stuck in traffic and I had to leave and there was just like, it was like, there was like two inches of carpet missing to cover everything. And I had to go knock on the door of the neighbor to be like, we got like a 15 minute window here with no adults. Would you mind? She was part of the neighbor. It's great. But that was one of the moments where I thought, oh yeah, having this added layer. And then that's another reason you recognize like multi generational households and all that stuff. Yeah, absolutely. There's also, I mean, there's a big part of this too. I mean, in all these sort of like household formation questions, right, when you talk about like hiring someone, there are enormous sort of wealth and class questions here and determinants, right? I mean, childcare is really expensive. I think it's something that even relatively like affluent professional people are shocked by when they encounter it in the market. They're like, holy smokes, this is so, so, so expensive. And I think it's actually a good and sort of radicalizing moment for a lot of people from that social strategy. And they're like, wait, how do people make this work? Like I can stretch and make this work with my salary and I make a good salary. Like how does everyone make this work? It's like, yeah, well, people cobbled together all kinds of solutions, but we don't have any kind of like bedrock version of them. Like there's no institutionalized solution to this question the way there is when your child enters school, right? When your child enters school, it's like, well, we have mandatory education for children. You send them to school. You have to deal with after school. But before then, there's just nothing. There's like, there literally is nothing. You have to solve it. Household by household by household. Yeah. And I think almost always there's some like family element to that, you know, grandma helps out or a sibling helps out. Or in some cases, I think people have like really punishing work schedules where, you know, one parent works during the day and one parent works in the night or something and they barely ever see each other. But yeah, it's really tough. I mean, we're definitely lucky to have enough money that we can hire some help for at least some of the time when we child care. More of our conversation after this quick break. So one of the things you wrote about was the sort of these sort of status questions and these kind of like patriarchy questions. I want to talk about like, yeah, just like these deep questions about, you know, what it is to be a man and being the breadwinner and your place in the household and your central importance as a man, you know, if you are not the quote unquote breadwinner. I'm saying all this obviously, I think listeners program, no in quotes. And I'd love to hear you just talk about that. Like how much that stuff was, did you discover that you had some of that stuff in you? Has it just never appeared in you? And so you're sort of blissfully clear of it? Like where are you on that? I would say I was never, it never concerned me particularly. I think this is an area where actually attitudes have shifted a lot. I think that our parents generation, the kind of baby boom generation, it was still pretty widely accepted that, you know, men would be embarrassed if they weren't the primary breadwinner. And I'm not saying those attitudes are gone completely, but as you mentioned, I did a second story where I talked to 20 dads who have made various versions of this decision. Some fully fit stay at home dad, some just kind of cutting their hours or being the kind of more flexible parent. And very few of them actually said that they've experienced any kind of stigma around it. I think some people still experience surprise like people are like, oh, like I kind of didn't realize that was a thing. But I think American society really has accepted the idea that it's totally appropriate for women to be in the workplace and for men to do more of the childcare. And so I think it's, yeah, I think it's gotten much easier than it was a few decades ago. I mean, for me, it's more just like, I just enjoy the work I do. And so if all SQL I would like to do a little more of it. And so it is something of a sacrifice to be doing less of that in more childcare. But yeah, I haven't for whatever reason, I haven't personally found that I was really kind of questioning my identity as a man as a result of doing more of that. Yeah, talk about the, because you did a follow up story because you got such reaction to the original piece, which is great. And you interviewed a bunch of dads who were sort of along this spectrum. And I'm curious just what struck you, what surprised you were didn't about the experiences they had and what you related or didn't to what they said about their own sort of setups. I mean, I think one thing that struck me was just that people are really very different. I mean, there are stereotypical differences between men and women, but just also within men, like there are some men who are just not that into their jobs. They maybe don't hate their jobs, but they just don't see their goal in life as like climbing a corporate ladder. And so when they have the chance to like spend all day at home playing with their kids, like that's great. And they don't really feel conflicted about it. And then the other men who are the opposite who really do identify with their jobs and enjoy their work and find it really difficult to make that transition. And then obviously women are the same way. I think they're probably a little bit more often more common to have women who kind of like to spend time with their kids, but they're definitely women out there who are extremely ambitious. So I think in many individual couples, it's going to be kind of obvious. Like in this couple, the women's just more ambitious than the man. And so it just makes sense for the woman to be the one that prioritizes her career. I think one of the things that definitely came through from that reporting is that going to be a full time stay at home data is a much bigger leap than just kind of cutting your hours or finding more flexible job. And there definitely were some men who regretted that because once you've been out of the workforce for a few years, it can be quite difficult depending on your career. And in one industry, and it couldn't be quite difficult to get back into the workforce. And so I think the men who regretted it the most were ones who kind of thought it would be pretty easy. They could take a couple of years out of their jobs with the jump back in and then find like, oh, actually like this gap in my resume really makes it hard for me to kind of get back to where I was before. And so I think if somebody's thinking about doing the kind of soft version of this, where you maybe cut your hours, I think that's almost everybody that's something worth trying. But if you're thinking about actually doing the full types day at home dad thing, you want to think really carefully about how you're going to feel. If it turns out that that means a kind of permanent change in your career, and then obviously talk to your spouse and make sure that she's going to be okay with it. If in fact a temporary stay at home data range, when it becomes a permanent stay at home dad relationship. And we should also note that like, obviously this sort of income levels we're talking about matter tremendously. Millions and millions of American households are basically function in which it is necessary for both the parents to work full time. And they may or may not have much control over whether they can or can't take more time or not. They may not have much control of their schedules. And that is the reality for again, I mean, I know people know this, but just to reiterate like some of the choices you're talking about and the choices that we're discussing or even that Kate and I are making were making from a position where we're not a position where we need every last dollar to make ends meet and also don't have control of our schedule. Even though even at people who are working minimum wage are going to be making trade-offs that are imposed on them on this too, because to get back to the original point we made, like kids need to be careful. So like in the end, all of these things are problems that must be solved for every individual household. It's much, much harder at the bottom of the wage scale and for people in poverty. And we have a very sort of tattered social safety net deal with that. But the fundamental thing which is, and I think I forget who said this, but just in a capitalist economy, there are some people who are capable of producing market income. And then there's huge slots who are not. And one of those categories are one year olds who just can't produce market income and have to be cared for. And that is going to be a problem that a capitalist economy is going to have to solve somehow by hook and crook. And basically we will solve them in America at least essentially on a household by household basis. Yeah, absolutely. I do think for lower income families, obviously they have fewer options, but also for them, childcare is relatively more expensive. So I think for some of them, it actually does in some ways it might make more sense for to have one parent stay home or have a part time job or something like that. Because if you had a full time job and you hired childcare, you might be giving 100% of your paycheck to the big care center. That's absolutely right. And I think that's why essentially you end up relying on family. I mean, I think grandma ends up being the kind of modal solution to that problem. In most households dealing with this, because it's the only way to square the circle, right? Absolutely. You can't square it any other way. And in fact, one of the really striking things that you realize about the cost of childcare when you do the math on childcare, which is like, you're going to pay someone your post tax income. That when you sketch out the math, it's like, oh, like a teacher in the New York City public school system is not quite making enough to make it make mathematical sense, right? To stay in that job and hire a full time caretaker for a kid because of the way the market incomes work out. Yes, especially if you have two or three kids that are close together in age, the cost of childcare for two kids is often comparable to the after tax income for even a pretty middle class person. And so I think this is another reason why often people do jump out of the labor force for two or three years, because there's that period when your kids are from like one to four years old, where if you have more than one kid, it's just it makes it's often effectively free to not be working because almost all your money would otherwise be going to childcare. That's exactly right. We'll be right back after we take this quick break. So, on the sort of stigma or status question, it was really interesting. And I found like encouraging the response from the dads that you talked to who felt like they really weren't encouraging it. They weren't really wearing encountering it. You said a thing before, I want to just come back to about like Americans expect, you know, women are in the workplace and men are doing some childcare. But I do think there's a difference between those two, like how much like I do think women in the workplace is like a quite established norm at this point. Not at all, we should say not. I mean, I've definitely walked into like hedge fund offices and been like, oh, there is not a single woman in here. Like, this is weird. It's weird for me to do this space, a workspace where there's no women. This is strange, but that's like just the way it is. That said, you know, I think the general expectation of women work in the workplace, I do think the expectation like if you go to the wire, you go to decor, you go to music class, like the gender breakdown there remains overwhelming. And it is notable, I think, as a dad in those settings, how much that's the case. I was struck by that when I had little ones and I was bringing to those kinds of environments. Lesso at school where like the school drop off and pick up feel a little more equitable in terms of dads and moms. But of young kids, it is still striking to me how gendered that is. Yeah, I think that's absolutely true. But another thing I think is true is that I think one of the aspects of the feminist revolution that I think of it as being kind of not completed. But like, so like, I think one of the ideas of feminism was that market work is this high status thing. And so we have to get women into this, do more of it. So women kind of get the respect they deserve. But like pre feminism in like the 1950s, you had a lot of stay at home mothers who were doing a lot of volunteering, a lot of PTO activities, a lot of civil society stuff that also was very important. And as they moved into the workforce, there were fewer and fewer people to do that. And one of the reasons I think it would be helpful to have more men consider this kind of thing as an option is that I think you do need people to do that. I don't necessarily think it should be usually or always women. But it would be useful to have more people who have kind of slack in their schedule. So I talked to another husband of a doctor who is a full-time stay at home dad has been for the entirety of his son's life. And early on, obviously, he was busy taking care of his child. But then later in his life, when he was middle school, high school kind of age, he served on his local school council. He did a lot of volunteer work. The kind of civil society stuff that couple generations ago would have been kind of middle class, homemaking women. Like he's doing a lot of that. And I think that's very valuable. And I think it would be valuable if that kind of activity was had a higher status. It was kind of seed as on par with market work as a something that is a way you can contribute to your household and to the largest society. That is such a great point. And I think about this often, like civil society stuff, think about a lot in terms of community board meetings and stuff on just local issues around development, things like that. And it's a frustration. I was just actually looking for about proposal for a street redesign in my neighborhood and wanting to go to the meeting, but then being like, well, my shows at eighth. And obviously these are all scheduled for after the normal work day and so I can never go. But yeah, that's a really fascinating point. And I think there's a nostalgia sometimes. It's a complicated nostalgia for this period, as a post-war period, basically, that runs from basically 45 through, let's say 75, something like that. And where there's a whole bunch of things that come together to produce the kind of iconic mid-century American household, the suburbs, the one way, journalist who can make enough to buy a house with a yard, send the kids to college because in-state tuition is incredibly cheap compared to what it is now. These pillars of middle-class life feel accessible. But then also that idea of a one-way journey and what it means for a broader society and community, right? How that sort of cascades down is such an interesting point to think about civil society. Think about like clubs that happen and people getting together and coming together for bake sales and things like that. And the kind of harried nature of the current time use and how it sort of attacks that. And yes, it was totally gendered in a way that I think we want to leave in the past. But to have space for that is such an interesting point about that there are repercussions that are public fundamentally and not just in the domicile, not just in the household, to arrangements like the one that you're describing in which there's someone who's home with the kids. Absolutely. Do you think there are policy questions here? I think you're right that these are largely these are sort of individual decisions that couples make. And I sort of agree with you that I don't personally feel like it's my place to tell any particular couple how they should order these questions. But it does seem to me like there are some policy questions about what would happen in terms of how we might craft levers and policy to make this more possible for men that wanted to do it, I guess is sort of the question, right? Yeah, so two things come to mind there. One is obviously to the extent that there are going to be parental leave policies, it's useful for it to be parental leave as opposed to maternal leave. So at least allow or potentially even require dads as well as moms to have time off when a child is born. The other thing is I think there's a fundamental trade off as a lot of people are talking about ways to help young parents around childcare and just the cost of parenting. There's kind of two approaches. One is really focused on providing childcare to have universal pre-K or even subsidized childcare as we saw in Build Back Better. The other is to just give parents cash or provide some kind of subsidy that's available to families with stay-at-home parents as well as childcare. And I think this is an argument for pushing in the direction of supporting all families with cash as opposed to having a childcare system because I think the kind of traditional feminist attitude is who want to get both parents out of the household and into the workforce because then women are working, but then I think that's not necessarily a good model for everybody. And it's certainly true that if you give parents cash that you're going to be supporting some families, I'm probably more families where you have to stay-at-home mom, which feminists might not love, but I think it also is going to support some families in the other direction and hopefully more over time where you have that cash allowed so they have to stay-at-home and take care of their kids. This is a fascinating policy question. I want to just put a little finer point on this for because for people who are not familiar with this particular policy debate, it's an actual live one. So the Build Back Better sort of care economy model is embodied in democratic legislation and progressive think tanks. It's this sort of notion of you provide people with childcare so that they because it's a completely underserved need. This is a thing that you will note often, again, relatively affluent professional people who have a fair amount of money. You're like, why is there a huge, I can't get my kid into daycare? How is it the possible? The fact that there's just not enough daycares and a bunch of closed actually during the pandemic. So this idea of care work is essential and it's important and we could create basically a kind of public infrastructure provide that it's different than what public schooling is, but basically that's the vision, right? That there's this public provision of this care and people can take advantage of that. That's the kind of progressive position. Now that what has been basically a kind of conservative position, I think Mike Lee, Senator from Utah and others have proposed is they basically say, well, I'm characteroring. But basically these big government liberals want to take your kid away from the household and throw them into a socialist daycare or they can be indoctrinated and be away from you. But what we want is for the government to support families with little kids and give them cash. And in the case, I think of someone like Lee, he's probably thinking of constituents in Utah who have divisions of labor that break down among much more traditional gender lines, mom and home, dad in the workplace. You're sort of interestingly offering a kind of like third perspective on this, which is to say, to the extent that you want to incentivize households like yours, right, where this division of labor is happening in a different way and also maybe recoup some of the benefits that you talked about about civil society and volunteerism of having a parent at home that maybe going this sort of cash route to parents makes more sense and could produce that. It's very interesting. I have not heard that argument because it has been coded often as an argument, essentially in favor of subsidizing traditional gender hierarchy. Yeah, I mean, I think it's a little bit wrong to characterize this as entirely a right-wing thing. I mean, the Democratic Congress did pass the expanded child tax credit. Yes, in 2021, I was in favor of extending that. I think it's too bad they didn't. And so I think that was both of those were options that were on the table for the Democratic Congress at L-20, they didn't do either one in what became an Inflation Reduction Act. But given a pot of money, I would have rather put that money towards extending like what the Democrats did in 2021 with the child tax credit as opposed to trying to create a new daycare infrastructure. Totally. Let me just be clear, because I want to be the child tax credit to me is the floor. Like, I think we all agree, you and I definitely agree. It should be extended. It was remarkably successful. This was about the question above that in Build Back Better, where there was both the CTC at the baseline, right, which was cash, and then above that, there was a care infrastructure. And there was a response by Mike Lee that like, let's not do a care infrastructure. Let's do, you know, cash above that CTC. But yes, I agree. Child tax credit, floor, everyone should get that. But I do think it's an interesting way to think about it. And I also think it's an interesting thing to think about how these social transformations happen, because at one level, there are these two different social phenomena that have happened over time that are a product of the feminist revolution. One of them, which you chart is women in the workforce is just one of the most dramatic changes in society since the Industrial Revolution, right? I mean, just completely remarkable what that looks like. Fathers as primary caregivers doesn't look anywhere like that chart, right? So that in some ways has been one of the modern feminist conundra, which is women have entered the workforce and retained all the traditional duties and responsibilities they had when they were not in the workforce, thus now essentially giving them much more to do. And you see this again in time use data where you will see that like men do more around the house than they used to. And women also do more and now do, you know, an order of magnitude more. And so getting to that position of equity ends up being this sort of like very difficult thing. Yeah, and I think this part of this is a certain amount of wishful thinking among feminist thinkers about the way workplaces work and about the way kind of careers work. That like, I think the idea is that you should be able to have a 50 50 household and still really excel in your job. And you can certainly be a competent worker and have a successful career as in that role. But if you want to become a CEO or a member of Congress or a partner at your law firm, it's going to be really hard to do that if you are in an equal marriage. That's an interesting point. Yeah, you're saying that's not a solvable problem that basically like you're squeezing the balloon and there's got to be some sort of comparative change because when you're talking about people at the upper upper echelons, who's a US senator, who's a CEO, who's all these things, those are people that almost by definition have been like working like crazy. And it's just hard to make that work if there's two people working. Yeah, and the traditional answer is well, we should like change the way workplaces work. So you can become a CEO after working nine to five 40 hours a week for 20 years. And like that's a nice like theory. But on the one hand, I don't think that's going to happen. But also like, it's really important that the CEO of a Fortune 500 be really good at their job. And you look at the people who do this, they travel to a bunch of places around the company, they know a ton of people. And I think that makes them better CEOs because the job of a CEO is to be really, really familiar with their company, to talk to lots of people, to make lots of decisions. And I just don't think it's good for the American economy. It wouldn't be good for the American economy to have CEOs who can't make an important meeting because they're at a little league. You need a certain number of people who really prioritize their jobs because some jobs are really, really important. And if you want women to do that, you need to arrange for women to work as hard as men traditionally have in those jobs. And this is, I will take it out of the CEO perspective, which is something I know nothing about and just talk about Kate working in the White House, when she was right out of clerking for Justice Stevens, White House jobs are insane. But again, anytime, and I was probably not the best sport about it honestly, just because I'm needy and I need a lot of attention. So you sound better about all this. I mean, I guess I'm at least self-aware about it, but I just, if people didn't know, I need a lot of attention, you can watch my television show at 8PM. So I don't think I was the best sport about it. I'm sure she'll be listening to this. And I wonder where she's chuckling over it. But it was this funny thing where like, okay, you get, this is back in the day of the Blackberry, right? You get an email at 1 in the morning and you have to do X. And it's like, from a household or from a partner who presents, it's like, well, that sucks. But it's also like, it's the US government. It's the White House. What are you going to say? It's not trivial. It's genuinely really important. It's arguably the most important organization in the entire globe. Is this one building on Pennsylvania Avenue that commands the most powerful country on Earth? Like, yeah, it's super important. There's going to be no way to make that job, not be nuts. It's just going to have to be nuts. And I think you're right that there are going to be some jobs. I don't know if it's CEO, but there will be jobs that are going to be hard and difficult and require. I mean, your wife's jobs are perfect example, where I think there's a job that's going to indelibly require that. And also, I think for incredibly the most, literally the most important social end, the propagation of the species and caring for, you know, newborn children. And there's no way around that. There's no way to make an OBGYN, like a job that like isn't going to have these hard requirements of sometimes you just have to be at work. Yeah, there's, I mean, there have been nights when my wife's called me and we like my patients just had a miscarriage. I'd like to like spend an extra hour with her and make sure she's okay. Is it okay if can you take the kids for an extra hour? And obviously I say yes. And like, you said, it wouldn't be reasonable to say, okay, we're just going to start my shift and I did five and you know, I'm just going to take off like that. That just doesn't, that doesn't work. I'm laughing because it's obviously it's an incredibly upsetting thing when that happens. And I know obviously people that that has happened to and it's like devastating, but also like, yes, being on the other end of that, like something truly world ending in the moment for my patient has happened, I need to be with her. Like, yeah, you can't say, well. Yeah, one of the most important, most interesting writers in this area is Anne-Marie Slaughter, who was one of the top advisors to Hillary Clinton when she was Secretary of State and wrote about her decision after a couple of years to move back to New Jersey to be with her teenage sons. And I think that's another example where she, you know, if there's an international crisis or there might be about to a war about to happen, it's like really important for her to do her job to make sure that the US government doesn't make a mistake that leads to thousands of people dying. That's just more important than helping your teenage son. And so it's totally reasonable that she only wanted to do that for two years and go back to her job. But there's never going to be a future where being Secretary of State is a nine to five job or being a top advisor to the Secretary of State is a nine to five jobs because there's just the stakes are so high. Do you think also, I mean, the other thing about this is one thing that I've gotten more clarity on is how intense these specific years of young children are on a household and how things really do change. I mean, I think in the trajectory of a household, it just young children are just in a category all their own. And even now I've seen now that I've, you know, I've four, eight and 11, it's just way different than two or three years ago. You know, my 11-year-old is commuting by herself. She comes home speaking of wishes. She should probably make sure that she got home. But you know, there's a specific period in your life. We're squaring the circles the most difficult because of the age of your children. And that over time, those relative trade-offs in a couple and whether that's a same-sex couple, whether it's a hetero couple, and whether it's whoever is doing the trade-off, that those can also change over time. Like, I think I have a better sense of like the length of all of this than I did when I was younger. Yes, absolutely. As you said, you're a further along in this than me. So you would have a better insight. But my assumption is comparing my seven-year-old, my one-year-old, when my one-year-old is seven, that it's going to be much easier. And so this is something that I personally am very lucky because I think journalism is a very flexible profession in this respect, in particular, doing a sub-stack, a newsletter, self-published publication makes it very easy because I can cut back my pace. Not as many people are going to sign up. I'm not going to make as much money. But nobody can be like, well, where'd you go? I'm publishing often enough that people don't forget about me. And I can scale up as much as I have time and inclination for whenever that happens. And so I think there's some professions with this not as easy. If you're a partner at your law firm or you're an engineer at some firm that really requires 40 hours a week, that's harder to do. But I think a lot of kind of white-collar professions, there are ways you can be a consultant or a freelancer or you can find ways to practice some version of your profession at a lower pace for a few years when your kids are young and then scale it back up. But it's definitely not easy. Timothy Lee is a reporter for full-stack economics.
