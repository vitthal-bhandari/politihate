    "text": " Hey, great podcast today for you if you're into space and UFOs. Believe it or not, we start there because Congress is having open hearings on UFOs. Not that that's going to matter, but it actually kind of does matter, especially when it comes to our schools. And we tell you what the latest is with your science teachers and the National Science Teaching Association. Yeah, holding seminars instructing teachers on how to queer their classroom. Also, more trouble in Virginia schools. You've got kids in middle schools, middle schools that are now being charged with sexual harassment because they won't call their friend them they. And when you see the ramifications of that, it's quite amazing. Also, we talked a little bit about what happened in Buffalo. The truth of the eco socialist racist that did the shooting and who's really behind the article in the Rolling Stone, the editorial about, oh my gosh, Republicans are just so incredibly racist. Also, we have Dave McCormick on. He's running for Senate in the great state of Pennsylvania and so much more including ESG. Oh, and something that everyone has to pay attention to from the WHO. It's all on today's podcast. Don't miss it. All right, I want to start here and believe me, we're going to get back to school in a second and you'll see the transition a House Intelligence Subcommittee. Today is holding the first congressional hearing on UFOs in 50 years. Now, I don't know if the world has been paying attention to what is happening with the Pentagon and UFOs, but is I think the biggest story possibly of any of our lifetimes may be the biggest story in all of human history. But let's talk about misgendering. What's happening right now is the Congress has decided to call a hearing on UFOs because there are things that are happening that for the very first time, the Navy and our military can actually track these UFOs. In the past, you haven't been able to track them. You've only had pilots that say, I swear to you, I saw this, but they move so quickly, at least the ones now, that they could never lock onto them. We have locked on to some sort of a ship with, as it's described, no apparent propulsion system, no heat signature, nothing, and they are moving at high speed. And we have tracked them, locked onto them for weeks at a time. They move in ways that are beyond our understanding of physics. And we have seen them up close. They seem to be, according to the Pentagon, I can't say targeting, observing our nuclear weapons. They have been hovering over some of our Navy naval bases. They have engaged in dog fights with our pilots. They have shown that they are way beyond our technology or understanding. So you're left with two things. Now that we have verified, we're left with two things. Are they otherworldly? Or is that China that has developed technology so far ahead of us that there's no chance of defeating them? From what I have discussed with members of the Pentagon that have been part of this search, they say that they just don't believe that it's China because the technology is so far ahead that it would affect the rest of your society. There's no way you could develop just that and not let it bleed into other things. It's too great of a leap. So we don't think that it is China. There's also evidence that we have now collected that shows there are the metals that these things are made out of are otherworldly. There are alloys that we have no idea how to make and we don't recognize some of the metals in the alloy. So Congress is going to ask, are these weather balloons? Is it something else? Adam Schiff is the guy who's leading this. So I don't expect anything to come from this meeting in Congress, this hearing, everything that is worthwhile is going to be confidential and they want these to be open hearings. This in my opinion is really for those who are paying attention or for those who just want a salacious story about UFOs. But we're not really going to get any information, I believe. Now I want you just to listen, just listen to this. The government has said that UAP that UFOs probably lack a single explanation, neither classified nor unclassified reports from the government rule out space aliens, but other possible explanations like airborne clutter like birds or balloons, natural atmospheric phenomena like ice crystals, highly classified US government programs or foreign adversary systems from Russia, China or other countries. I don't believe any of those, but it could be. Let's assume they say it's another country, another nation or another group that is operating something that we don't understand, according to the Heritage Foundation senior fellow for naval warfare and advanced technology. That's definitely a security threat that we can't necessarily defend against because you can't defend against something that you just don't understand. So we are looking at technology now that defies the laws of physics. Now let me bring it back to school. The National Science Teaching Association has just held a seminar. Remember, we are talking about possible alien life. What are the ramifications of that? We are also talking about if it is alien life, what do they want? Why are they here? Why are they now presenting themselves and sending a message? This is what Pentagon says, sending a message to us. We are beyond your capability of stopping us. So don't try. The message is very clear and correct. So if it is aliens, why are they here? What do we do? If it's not aliens, somebody has technology here on earth that is way beyond our understanding. We don't even understand the alloy. So as we are raising our children and looking for tomorrow's scientists, the National Science Teaching Association has just held a seminar calling, called Queer Your Classroom. It happened on April 2nd, instructing teachers on, quote, simple tricks and strategies to affirm and represent queer students who are marginalized in science. This seminar led by Bronx High School of Science, the chemistry teacher there, Jamie Kubrick, who goes by they and he pronouns, which do not work. You can't be a he and they. It's not possible. And I'd go as far as saying, you can't be a they. I digress. He instructed attendees on how to affirm and represent queer identities and make impactful changes to K through 12 curriculum. He instructed teachers on the, on the glisten gender triangle education guide, which defines gender attribution, gender identity and gender expression, explaining that there's a common misconception that gender and sex are the same thing, but they're not according to his presentation slides. This is put together by glisten, a national advocacy organization, which aims to quote transform K through 12 schools into a safe and affirming environment. Okay. Students for defending education say this is just more political activism. I guess what, what are you kidding me in the presentation? The, the instructor provided simple strategies for queering the classroom, which includes a suggestion that teachers replace any terms or phrases that reinforce the binary, like prom king or prom queen. Do you see what's happening? Do we have the Michelle Obama quote? Can you pull that up real quick, Sarah? They are changing everything. Just like Michelle Obama said in 2007 and Brock knows that we are going to have to make sacrifices. We're going to have to change our conversation. We're going to have to change our traditions, our history. We're going to have to move into a different place. We have done all of those things and we're being told now we have to make sacrifices. We have to make sacrifices. I'm sorry if you want to fight this war in Ukraine, we're going to have to, well, cause starvation all around the world. You're going to have to pay six dollars a gallon for gasoline because Brock knows we have to make sacrifices. We have to change the way we talk to each other, our conversations. Have we done that? We have to change our traditions. Have we done that? Teachers are instructed to ask students for their gender pronouns rather than assuming gender identity or misgendering with incorrect pronouns and use terms like everyone and you all instead of saying you guys. A sample student information survey included in the slides asked students for their gender pronouns if these pronouns can be used front in the class and which pronouns the teacher should use when contacting the family. This is again undermining the family. So not only are we taking science and making it all about gender studies and let me go on, the presentation suggests queer ideology can be implemented into every subject including history, math, English, Spanish and science. The instructor said in my chemistry class, I've infused talking about gender and sexuality even when it doesn't seem like it could even fit or that there would be time. For instance, when we talk about the electromagnetic spectrum, I can connect the word spectrum to how gender and sexuality can be a spectrum so students can understand that there's two ends but values are possible in between. We are now facing a world that is actually on a path by leaders for something called transhumanism. Do you know what transhumanism is? It is the merging of man and machine and it will happen within the next 10 years. We are facing a world of technological change like the world has never seen. You will not recognize your world in 2030. We are looking at a world that is going to change jobs. You will change what you're doing now. You won't be doing the same thing in 2030, 2035. Everything is about to change and we're facing a threat either from China or from space and we don't know what it is. And we're having our science teachers talk about the spectrum. America, this is a recipe for disaster. Pull your students out of school. If you can't afford, let me put it this way. I understand. I really do understand. I didn't want to homeschool my kids. I don't feel qualified for it. My wife doesn't feel qualified for it, but I'll tell you this. Your kids will be better off even if you're not qualified for it than learning this crap. This crap will sink your kids and your family. The teachers unions are currently turning your children against you. There's no way for America to survive if they get our kids. And believe me, those both getting our kids and ensuring America doesn't survive, both of those are goals of the teachers union. You're listening to the best of the Glenn Beck program. US Senate candidate Dave McCormick joins us now. Hello, Dave. How are you? Hey, Glenn. How are you? Thanks for having me. You bet. You bet. We can't lose this seat. It is down to three of you. Donald Trump has endorsed Dr. Oz, which I don't understand. Kathy Barnett was on with us last week. I think she's good. I have some questions, but I think she's good. I wanted to make sure we talked to you today, the day of the primary. Let's just start with, I know who you are that you were a guy who went out and fought for our country. You went to West Point, you were a paratrooper in the 82nd Airborne with the Army. I really appreciate all your service. Where do you stand on ESG? Well, listen, I think what's happened, first thing, and thanks for having me. What's happened in our business community and in government with this shift towards wokeness, it's the combination of really wokeness and weakness that has made me want to run and really believe in that taking our country in the wrong direction. And ESG is at the top of the wokeness list where essentially the idea of sustainability and the broad ESG platform has permeated everything. It's become the highest order. It's become what's supposed to drive companies, what's supposed to drive our government. And I think it's taken us in a really damaging direction and it's thoughtless. It doesn't have a lot of rigor behind it. And I think it's bringing CEOs into the world of policy and politics, which is exactly where they don't belong. And so I think it's a dangerous trend, but it's part of a broader trend where you see wokeness really chipping away at our institutions, our military, our schools, our business community. And that's one of the reasons I'm running to push back on the combination of those two things. So tell me about inflation. What is happening and what do we do to stop it? Yeah, I'm driving around Pennsylvania in my pickup truck. I have a family farm here. I grew up here in Pennsylvania, a small town called Bloomsburg, one company with the McGee carpet mill, which sadly has mostly gone away at this point. And this is the issue that comes up over and over again is inflation. And it's the direct result of Joe Biden's terrible policies. Joe Biden's blaming on everybody but himself. That's the first thing I learned at West Point is we just take accountability and he's taken none. And there's three things that he's done that have really driven it. The first is the enormous spending. What's happened in the last 18 months goes beyond anything in history in terms of the spike in spending. It's his terrible energy policy, which overnight made us energy dependent. And of course, fuel costs is a primary component of inflation. And that's killing Pennsylvania's working families, elders on fixed income, disensolation and gas prices is just very damaging. And then he's had a very socialist agenda and high regulation, which has hurt our economy and really taken us back from the pro growth policies of President Trump. So what do you do? Well you show up on day one. I'm a guy who's been a CEO of two big companies, ran a company that created 600 jobs in Pennsylvania and you have to reverse those things. You have to cut back on the spending quickly. This is extreme and it's flowing into our economy and driving prices up. You have to reverse the energy policies, make us energy dominant, deregulate our energy sector, create pipeline capacity and you have to have pro growth economic policies, keep make the tax cuts permanent and reduce regulations. And that's the magic formula. This isn't a mystery. That's the magic formula for unlocking our economy. Joe Biden's done the opposite thing and not taking responsibility for it. Parents all over the country are facing crazy things in their school. Would you defund and close down the Department of Education? Yes, I would. I certainly would and I defund anything that supported the teaching of critical race theory in our schools or a distorted sense of American history. It's outrageous that the exceptional America that we all love and have benefited from, the greatest country in the history of the world, that history is not being taught. What's being taught is a history of apology. All the things that are wrong about America as opposed to all the things that are right about America and you can't even raise your hand to disagree or argue about it because of cancel culture. I think what we learned in COVID was that parents got a little closer look at what's going on in their schools and they don't like what they see. They don't like what they see in terms of the schools and school boards and local governments, petty, petty, tyrants telling them what they should do with testing and mask and vaccines. They don't like the the curriculum that's being taught and they haven't even historically had transparency on curriculum. It's only because you're sitting next to your kid while they're working from home that you see really what's being taught and they don't like the sexualization that's being taught in the schools and when it's being taught by whom. I think we've got a crisis in our schools. Certainly the Department of Education is part of the problem but the real problem is we don't have school choice. That's the way to create the right accountability is to break the back of our current model. The only way to do that is give parents and students choice, put the money with the kids and I think you'll see a completely different system. It'll be disruptive as hell but it's very necessary. The border. Yeah, I went to see it. I've been following this carefully. Obviously watching on TV. I went to Yuma about six, seven weeks ago. Brandon Judd, the president of the Border Patrol Union has endorsed me. Whatever you think you've seen until you've been there, it's worse. The border is wide open. It's killing Pennsylvanians. The fentanyl crisis in Pennsylvania, five thousand deaths last year. The crime, the midnight flights. It's a top three issue for Pennsylvanians. It's an easy fix. You just have to go back to the policies President Trump had finished the wall. You can see the wall where I visited. There's a wall and then there's big stacks of steel and there's contractor trailers. By the way, the contractors got paid even though the wall wasn't finished. She's. The construction and you got to reverse the catch and release. Then we got a crackdown on this fentanyl problem and the border is the first step. Law and order in our cities is the second step. We got a terrible district attorney in Philadelphia and we're not being tough enough on drug crimes. We got to kill the cartels at the border. You know where that fentanyl is produced? China. We got to go hard at China on a whole range of things but we got to close down the fentanyl factories which come to Mexico. Go across the border 48 hours to get to the Northeast. It is a big deal in Pennsylvania. This is probably the thing on the campaign trail that surprised me the most was how big a problem we haven't fentanyl. I had read about it but it's terrible. 18 of what is it? 18 to 49 or 18 to 39 year olds. It's the number one killer in America. I think 9,000 which is about 50,000 more than died in COVID. I mean it is a massive, massive problem that nobody's talking about. Talk to me about, you know, you just mentioned China. Talk to me about what we're doing in Ukraine. Would you have voted to the for the last 40 billion dollars to bring our aid up to Ukraine to 58 billion? Absolutely not. I'm offended by it but I'm offended for two reasons. I'm offended by the way this came about. $33 billion proposal from Biden makes its way to the Congress. Somehow along the way 7 billion more gets thrown on top of it. No hearings. No clear accountability. Not sure where the money is spent. So that's offensive and then on top of it 40 billion dollars going out the door at a time when America is in crisis. A fraction of that could finish that border wall I was just talking about. So I think the whole notion of doing that just shows how disconnected Washington is right now from the people I'm seeing in Pennsylvania every day. And they're angry, Glenn, you know this. They're angry about a lot of things but it's stuff like this that makes them scratch their head and say what the hell is going on down there. And listen, as a business guy, as someone who's never been in politics, I can't go down there and be a disruptor. I will look at things through the lens of what makes sense, what's common sense and what do my conservative values that I've lived my whole life tell me we should do right now. And my obligations will be only to the people of Pennsylvania and I won't be afraid to break a little glass. The US military is just, it's being run by idiots and morons and politicians, honestly, leftists. Can we clear enough wood out of the top of the Pentagon to restore the credibility back? Well, you need, listen, you need war fighters. You need war fighters. There's two problems that I see with our current military. The first problem is the one you refer to where we've got a whole social hearing and that's the wokeness that I mentioned earlier and that takes focus off of war fighting. We've got a bunch of leaders both uniformed and civilian that are much more worried about ESG and things like that than how do we go head to head with China. And so that's problem one. Problem two is I fear we're making the mistake that our military has made in the past, which is we're fighting the last war, not the future war. And when I look at what it's going to take to go head to head with China, I don't think we're investing in the right things. I don't think we've got the right kind of innovative leadership. I think there's complacency. And I think we're not on a path to be the dominant force in the world that we need to be. And I'm subscribed to Ronald Reagan's line of peace through strength and America needs to have the premier military in the world. And it needs to be clear that if you cross the line with America, the results will be devastating. I fear that our military is taking us on a path where that's not the case. And then of course, when you have incompetent leadership at the top like Joe Biden and the debacle in Afghanistan, that invites time. It's around the world to test us because they think they found a soft spot. So one more question. I'll let you go, Dave. I know it's a busy day for you, but we're talking to Dave McCormick. He is running for US Senate in Pennsylvania. This is probably the number one race. You know, some people don't understand why Kathy is surging in the polls here recently. And I think it is because if I may translate, I don't think Republicans truly understand how done Republican voters are with the Republican party, how done they are with saying one thing and then getting in and thinking you're fighting the same fight that we fought in, you know, 1985. We are up against the wall. The Constitution is barely hanging on. We are in the fight of our life. Why should Pennsylvanians trust that you're going to go in and you're not going to be part of the McConnell, you know, Romney clan? Yeah. Well, listen, I think Pennsylvanians are zeroing it right now on a couple of things. They feel like the country's slipping away. They know the disraces, the most important race in their lifetime. They're trying to figure out who the candidate is that best shares their conservative values and agrees with what you said is going to fight for it. They're asking themselves who can win this general election because the stakes are so incredibly high. And they're asking themselves, who has the experience to show up on day one and deal with the things you just asked me about, the border inflation, because we don't have time for on the job training. We know what that looks like. That's Kamala Harris. That's on the job training, right? That's a disaster. And so I believe I'm not candidate and that's the momentum that I'm feeling on the ground because there's people zero in on this. They don't want to take any risk. And with regard to Kathy, I know Kathy got to know her on the campaign trail. I admire her personal story, but she's been tested. She was tested 18 months ago and lost a congressional seat by 20 points and now is under the spotlight. And listen, I've been under the spotlight for a long time. And there's questions that all of us need to ask and she's our answer rather and she certainly needs to answer all of those, including the support she has from the club for growth, which is a perfect example of a big part of the establishment. So that's the state of the race. And I appreciate the opportunity to be with you. One of the things I would like to close with is for your Pennsylvania listeners, I'm asking for their vote. Somebody asked me the other day if I'm America first. I've been America first since the age of 18 when I went to West Point and then went to the 82nd Airborne Division. And I'm a conservative that has succeeded in business. I've lived the American dream. And I want to have a chance to make sure that American dream is available for our kids. And it's not going to be unless we take significant change, corrective action right now. And I can be a big part of that change in the Senate on behalf of the great people of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. So thank you, sir, for having me. I appreciate the opportunity. Dave, it's great. Thank you so much. Appreciate it. That's Dave McCormick. You can follow him or find out more information if you are thinking of voting in Pennsylvania. Dave McCormick P.A.com. Dave McCormick P.A.com. The best of the Glenn Beck program. Andy Puzder, he is the executive chairman of Second Vote Advisors and Visiting Fellow of the Heritage Foundation. I just have to go through his resume here just for a second. Hardees in Carl's Jr. He's the one who really made them into what they are today. He was the guy who started Carl's, Carl's, Karchners, personal attorney in 86. He became the CEO in 2000, led the company out of serious financial difficulties under his leadership. They expanded to almost 4,000 restaurants globally. Currently, the executive chairman of the board of Second Vote Advisors. It's an investment firm formed in response to stakeholder capitalism and the ESG movement. He is a frequent lecturer on economics and politics for various groups, as well as colleges and universities, senior fellow at Pepperdine University School of Public Policy, a visiting fellow, business and economic freedom at the Heritage Foundation, senior fellow at the America First Policy Institute, member of the Reagan Institute's National Leadership Council, director of the Job Creators Network, also on the Washington University Law School Board of Advisors, the State Financial Officers Foundation National Advisory Committee and the advisory board at Prager University. Obviously, he has nothing to do with his day. How are you? I'm great. My wife keeps asking when this retirement thing starts. I told you, this is it. I know. I know. There's no, you know, the one word that it does is there's no word for it in the Hebrew language and that is retirement. I don't think God intended us to retire. Can't do it. So let's talk about ESG and I want to get to Second Vote because that's a real solution. But you just described ESG off air as the biggest threat to America in your lifetime. Yeah. It's a real challenge to the core values of the Constitution. It's a threat to our democracy because it takes away the right to resolve things at the voting booth. These large investment firms vote stock to compel companies to do things that they might not otherwise do, accomplish these progressive agenda items. And they do it as a shortcut around the ballot box because they can't get these things passed popularly. It's a threat to our economic freedom because they pressure CEOs rather than to pursue profit, which is the heart and soul of the free market capital system that's given us this incredible prosperity. They compel them to do things that are consistent with this progressive agenda. And it's a threat to our individual liberty because they use our money. They're using the money of red state pension funds. If you've got an investment, if you have any assets at all invested, you probably have investments with BlackRock, State Street and Vanguard. Guarantee it. They will vote all of the shares they own with your money against your values and against your financial interests if they're pursuing these agenda, these progressive agenda. So it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a large, as you said earlier, it's the most severe threat to our nation and our freedom and our liberty in my lifetime. And I'll be 72 years old. That's about 30% of the country's history. So that's amazing. So when I first stumbled onto this two years, two plus years ago, I thought this is a conspiracy. There's no way this is true. And the more I looked into it and found the original sources, I couldn't believe how well done it was and how far done it was. Are we, I mean, are we cooked here? Well, we're not cooked because we can still react. And as you know, from the conference you're having here, as we speak, state governments are beginning to react to this because they're finding that their, their state funds are being invested to pursue things they were elected to oppose. Correct. So we can fight back. But look, it's, you know, like as I said, it's insidious. It's what they did. You have to respect what the left did on this. It's all of a sudden it appeared and it looked by the time I discovered it about 18 months two years ago, by the time I found out about it, it looked like we had lost. All right. We were fighting back now. So we haven't. But I mean, they affect your credit. You know, they're now talking about individual ESG scores. Yeah. Which means that you individually will be may not get the credit score. You may not get the interest rate you want or you may not get a bank loan because of the charities you contribute to. Maybe you contributed to your church's charity that that could be held against. Or you were in the paper or online standing up against the local school board. Are you supported a Republican candidate or a conservative candidate? All of these things will go into the ESG scoring and you will be compelled to hide your religious beliefs. You'll be compelled to hide your political beliefs. If you want to loan, if your kids want to buy a car, if they want to get insurance, they're going to have to hide who they are or what they do. If we let this continue and they say that, you know, people will say, well, that's unconstitutional. And these are private corporations. Why not let them do that? And it's unconstitutional. They couldn't do it in the first place. And it's you're right. It's not constitutional. If there's any government support for this, that would tie them into the Constitution. And in fact, if you look at a number of people that are guiding the economic policies of the Biden administration came from, BlackRock. And so there are ties here. The SEC, the Department of Labor, they're all working to advance this ESG agenda. It's almost dystopian. It's 1984 and you don't even know it. And now they're even using phrases that come out of 1984. Like this, what's the group that's now going to judge whether or not they can say the disinformation government governance board? Yeah. It's right out of George Orwell. These are scary times. I don't think people believe Americans were naive because it's never happened here. And so they don't think that, you know, you hear, oh, global governance. And they think, oh, well, that's just a conspiracy theory. And there's no way these banks, you know, because you immediately go to, it's a star chamber and the Rothschilds are involved. And you're like, no, this, forget all of that stuff. But people don't believe it could happen here. Yeah, I was, I was suspicious. Now, when they came out with stakeholder capitalism, I thought that was a ridiculous thing. I thought that no business would, no business would divert its intent from making a profit. That's what you do, right? That's how you're, but the more I looked into it, the more I found my God, they are doing and it's not, it's not the CEOs of these companies who actually would. I think many of them like to make a profit and not be politically involved. Yeah. It's these fund managers that control, I think BlackRock alone controls $10 trillion in investments. If you look at BlackRock State Street and Vanguard, those are the three largest fund managers. They manage our money. They manage my money and your money. Combined, they are the largest shareholder in 80% of the companies in the S&P 500. That's 80% of the largest publicly traded companies in America. If you add them together, they're the largest shareholder and they're all pursuing this ESG agenda, radical environmental policy, critical race theory, human resource programs, this so-called diversity hiring where you put people on your boards or directors, not based on their qualifications or their character, but based on their race or their sex, which quite honestly, I've been fighting against my whole career all of a sudden, now it's the fashionable thing to do. This is bad. Very, very serious threat. People need to take it seriously. Okay. The first thing we can do is take our money out of these organizations. I know my own advisor said, Glenn, you've got to stay in. They are the powerhouses and they are going to make all kinds of money. Make money with them and then use your money to fight against them. That was the quote. Yeah, I think we need to change that now. I think that they've become so powerful. I said, this is so insidious. It's the kind of threat that we've always been warned about. It's the kind of threat that comes from within. And it's one of the reasons that now my friend Vivek Ramasami is talking about coming out with a group that will have investments where you can put money and fight this will capitalism thing. My friends, Dave and Diane Black, who you know well, have already started a group called Second Vote Advisors. I'm not the executive chairman of that group. And we offer, you can buy our products today. Vivek's products are probably coming out in the fall. But today we've got a pro-life product where if you invest, it's L-Y-F-E and you can get it on a merit rate or have your broker get it for you. And that is a fund. And that's an exchange traded fund in ETF. If you invest in it, you will not be investing in any companies that support abortion. Not only will you not be supporting companies that perform, but companies that make charitable contributions to Planned Parenthood or companies that are now talking about sending their employees to other states to get abortions. They will not be in that fund. And this performed very well. Beat the S&P 500 and the Russell 1000 consistently. And we have a site. It's amazing when companies decide to just do what they do best. How good those companies can be. Well, we actually have a fund coming out called the Shareholders First Fund, which will only invest in funds that are politically neutral, not left, not right. It's an ETF that should be out in the next month or two. We're in SEC approval right now. We've got to prospect us on file. And the theory behind this fund is that companies that focus on making a profit will be more profitable than companies that don't. Wow. Say that to me again, professor. That's pretty deep. People always expect me to say something else, but that's really it. Yeah. You know, having run a large public company, I can tell you that it's hard enough to make a profit when you focus on it, correct, let alone when your focus is on changing the world consistent with some collectivist political agenda that changes all the time. And we do have one other. We have one other ETF you can buy now. It's called a society defendant. And the companies that we exclude from this ETF are ones that support defunding the police, oppose the Second Amendment, oppose border security. It's EGIS. It's also on a merit trade or through your broker. And it's actually performed better than the life fund. They both perform better than the S&P. That crazy. Or are there also one thousand? Is that divine in Providence? Or what do you think that is? Well, number one, it's picking stocks that I think have CEOs or management whose heads in the right place. You really are focused on what your company is going to be doing profit-wise, not politically. And secondly, we apply financial methodologies. Once we pick those stocks, we hone it down to what the stocks we think will be the best. And so you've got the strong financial methodology. In fact, on our ETFs, the stock pickers we use are Art Laffer Jr. and Nancy Tangler. Laffer Tangler Inc. And they're both very, very qualified and good. So this is our way. We're out there with Products Now Fighting This. Thank God you're fighting it with the organization you have here that's opposed to ESG. There are other, each state has to fight. Alec came up. I drafted a law about three, four months ago that makes it a breach of fiduciary duty for fiduciaries, the pension fund fiduciaries, to invest in ESG as opposed to profit-motivative. And really, I really just took what was in ERISA, which is a federal law that doesn't govern state plants, and a regulation that Gene Scalia got passed when he was Secretary of Labor and combined him into a state law and took the voting rights away. I said, the state has to take all the voting rights away from all of these fund managers and the vote that aren't shares themselves and not let them pressure these CEOs. Now, Alec adopted that legislation. I think it's called the State Peduciary Duty Act. That's the American Legislative Council that does a lot of conservative legislation. So it's been adopted. We've been talking about it here in your meeting. Good. And I think we're going to get some action on it next year. So we are fighting back, but nobody should underestimate. This is a huge thing. You thought communism was a threat. You thought Bernie Sanders and AOC and their ridiculous version of socialism was a threat. These were, that was penny any stuff. Yeah, we are currently paying for it at the pump. I think there's a good argument that ESG investing by driving up the price of gasoline, the price of oil empowered Vladimir Putin to invade the Ukraine. He couldn't have done it if he didn't have the money. You'll recall Ronald Reagan defeated the Soviet Union by driving down the price of oil. Correct. Well, we drove it up with our ESG investing. Yeah. And now we've got people in the Ukraine paying the price for that. Andy Puzder is with us. He is the executive chairman of Second Vote Advisers. Where can we find the information? There's a website called Second Vote Advisers. You have to put advisors in though you'll end up other places. But second vote, the number two ND vote advisors with an ERS at the end. So you can go to that website. Okay. I want to talk to you about something else that I haven't really heard people talk about and maybe they've been talking about it in the meetings that you're having across the Birkeyard here. And that is it's not just using our money at the state level, using our money to work against us. It is also giving the radical left the ability to shut states down. What we did to Vladimir Putin, that was ESG in action. And the biggest corporations in the world, McDonald's. They didn't want to do this. And then they said, we might have some reputational risk at stake. So we're going to go along with it. That was ESG. And if these states decide that they're going to go after CRT or they're not going to have bathrooms for all genders, this can be turned on them. And I mean, shut them down like states have never seen before. It's true. This happened in Georgia, as you recall. They went to the transgender bathroom. And there was a people were boycotting the state and they backed off. We do have some governors that won't back off. Governor to Sanderson, Florida being the prime example, you go after him. He's going to go after you. It's very much like a Donald Trump type thing. You know, you're you're you're you can oppose him. You can argue with him. You go after him. He's going to come back at you. You were going to be. What were you? He nominated me for Secretary of Labor. But I you know, the attack from the left was was was vicious to say the least. It was it was a tough period to go through because I'd been advised not to go. I was told I couldn't go on TV to defend myself. They were the people that were running this said, no, don't worry about it. You're going to get confirmed. Well, you know, I mean, I was a trial lawyer. I'd been on TV a lot. It really wasn't an issue for me, but I didn't didn't want to defend myself. And the attacks finally weakened some Republican. But a lot of this was because of what I had done with the pro life movement. Quite honestly, I was attacked. Sure. They, you know, they, they really don't want you if you've done something meaningful for the exactly right exactly right. Do you think I've talked to Donald Trump about ESG and I'm not sure it completely clicks with him. Have you talked to him about it? Does he understand what it is? I haven't talked to him for a couple of months. And we did not talk about ESG when I spoke with him. But look, you give me five minutes with him and, you know, I'll give five minutes at some point and he'll understand that this is not, he'll get this quickly. What people think they think, well, it's like stakeholder capitalism. And that's really not a real thing. Exactly right. That's the biggest thing we fight is people think they either dismiss it as a conspiracy theory or they dismiss it as it's not really that powerful. It's not going to happen. People need to understand that it's, this isn't the CEOs of these companies making decisions to do these, these leftist, collectivist agenda item type things. This is the people that control their companies. This is the people that own the stock of their companies. Look what happened with Exxon. You had a little bitty hedge fund decided to want it called engine number one. Wanted to put a couple of environmentalists on the board of Exxon. Well, guess what? These large investment funds, Black Rock Vanguard, they owned about 21% of Exxon. Voted all their shares in favor of putting the environmentalists on Exxon's board at a time when oil is going through the ceiling, right? Your price is going up and up and up. And we're going to put environmentalists on Exxon's and it's succeeded. Now the real problem is- Hang on. We're going to, we have to hit a break here. Andy Puzder, he is with second two-nd vote advisors.com."
