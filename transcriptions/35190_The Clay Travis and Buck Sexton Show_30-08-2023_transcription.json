Welcome to the Freedom Hot is Joe Biden in favor of women competing against men in sports. Very straightforward question. We have the answer from the White House for you. And then are you allowed to wear a Gadsden flag patch in school? We also have that news story here playing out. We'll get into it in just a moment. Now, let's start with this. Joe Biden is supposed to be a moderate who would unite the country. Now, I know I say that and you laugh because it's so absurd. But that was the initial premise upon which he ran in 2020 that he was a moderate Democrat. He was good old Joe. He was a grandpa. You know, he was a guy. You see things as they are. You know, it's not overly ideological. That's all a lie. It's very ideological. And I think in no place have you seen that more clearly than on the gender identity issue, on the issue of what exactly the White House's position is on. There's all gender identities have made it. There's no such thing as gender identity. This is a fabrication. There is gender. There is male female. There are people who maybe are slightly more feminine as males or more masculine as females. But gender is a thing. It is real. There are two of them and everything else that they try to push on all of us is really just. A lie. It's worse than an ideological fad. It's worse than just a question of belonging. It's also in meaning belonging to the in-group or the tribal political identity. Because it's meant to make you admit something, affirm something, say something. That's just not true. Because if they can get you to do that, then well, what else can they get you to do? It's meant to confuse you. It's meant to debase your own ability to reason and to trust the evidence of your own eyes and ears instead of what Big Brother, so to speak, tells you. But that's certainly not the way the Biden administration approaches any of this. And so you have today, Karine Jean-Pierre, effectively trying to dodge. It wasn't effective, but essentially she was trying to dodge a very straightforward question. Here's how it went. Does he care that girls are allowed to compete in sports without just a urine? I agree. Does he think it's fair for girls to have to compete against biological males? I just answered the question. It is a complicated issue. It is truly a complicated issue with a wide range of views, a wide range of views. There is no yes or no answer to this. It is complicated. There's a rule that the Department of Education has put forward, and we're going to let that process move forward. Again, we want to make sure that while we establish grog rails with this rule, that we also prevent discrimination as well against transgender kids. But again, a complicated issue with a wide range of views, and we respect that. Now, understand this. It couldn't be more obvious that the American people are solidly clearly on the side here of men should play against men, boys should play against boys in sports and same for women and girls. This is a 80-20 issue, maybe a 90-10 issue, but it's definitely an 80-20 issue. But you see, this White House is completely enthralled to. It's completely at the whim and at the mercy of the far left ideologues who push this stuff. The activists in the LGBTQIA plus community, the White House won't upset them, won't go against them. They're afraid of what those consequences would be. Should they step out of line? Should they say, boys or boys, girls or girls, they should play sports separately? They're not willing to go. They're not willing to say that. And I think it's noteworthy that in this White House, in this situation, it should be the most obvious thing in the world. But Green John Pierre is trying to just dodge it by saying, it's complicated. Well, yeah, you can say that about anything, really. That's a major issue of political contention. It's complicated. They don't say it's complicated when they talk about abortion. Democrats want abortion all nine months of a pregnancy. It's not complicated. Abortion infanticide. Same thing. Go for it. They don't care. They don't say it's complicated when it comes to is masking effective or should we have vaccines? No, no, no, none of that. No, no, interesting. It's complicated then. And should we have the vaccines for COVID? I'm saying, of course, no, that's that's very straightforward. That's a black and white issue. That's true and false. That's binary. But gender is not a binary. Gender is not a binary. Now, part of this is that they have run out of of real civil rights issues to champions. So the Democrats are now effectively manufacturing. Well, they're manufacturing the delusion that gender is not a real thing. That is not man and woman. But beyond that, they're also manufacturing the fight for civil rights under gender identity. It's just it's not a real phenomenon. The problem they run into here is the argument is entirely self-refuting. It can't stand up, which is why there's this frenzy around it. But they're ferocious in defending this. This White House, Joe Biden's White House thinks that if you have a 12 year old boy playing basketball that decides he's a girl, he should go play against. Well, now the 12 year old actually wouldn't even have that much. He'd have an advantage. But now once you get to be 14, 15, 16, once puberty hits, because of gender, then it's a massive, a massive difference. You know, I mean, the city of every guy watching this, every guy listening knows the same thing. And I'm somebody who used to play sports growing up. And now I'm a guy who sits at a radio at a desk. I'd be stronger and faster than most of the female athletes who are professionals who are in the WNBA right now. And just because I'm a male, that is not a bragging. It's just because I'm a guy. I'm six foot tall guy. So some would say five, 11 and three quarters, probably some would say five, 11, three quarters, 215 pounds. But oh, really, I think we all understand this couldn't be any more obvious. And it's observable and obvious. It's not like, oh, people should know this from reading about it in books. You can see it all the time. But the Biden White House dodges the question says it's not complicated. It's the opposite of complicated. But they insist on pretending. And it's important for all of us to hold the line on this. Because as I've said, if they can get you to affirm such absurdity, they have demeaned your ability to look at yourself in the mirror and say, I speak the truth. I know, I know up from down. I know right from wrong. They make you complicit effectively in the lie, which is also why they want you to use this specific pronoun so badly. Really? Who cares? Right? I mean, how sensitive are people? Oh, I called you a he, you actually say you're a she. No, it's it's not about politeness. That's how they got us to concede as much as we did. It's actually about you conceding to unreality, you bending the knee to falsehood. And that's why this White House refuses to do what you would think is so politically expedient, which is just say, yeah, we should have men competing. It's men, women competing. It's women boys, girls, same thing. They should do that because it's the right thing to do. You think they do it because it's also the politically expedient thing to do based on the voters. But it's not about the voters. It's about the the activist class, the activist community that remember has raised from the LGBTQIA community. I mean, you look at the money that's been raised for example, the tens of millions of dollars to push for a whole range of issues that to do with, you know, gay rights. And now there's this need for these organizations to still raise money, spend money and exist. And so it's all been turned to this transgender issue. But as I was saying, the problems, there are many problems it runs into. But why if gender is a mental construct, why does the physical reality of femalehood, why do they have to change it? Meaning if you can just be a if gender identity is is internal, a nate or not. And it's, I would argue this is it's clearly not innate, but put that aside. If gender, you look at all these, you know, blue haired leftist, communist mothers who are, oh, my daughter is trans, he say, what a shock, right? But put that aside for a second. If it's really just about the psychological state, and if it's not the physical manifestation, if having a penis does not make you a man, why does a trans woman have to have his penis removed? What's the difference? Right? If having a penis doesn't make you a man, why does having a fake vagina make you a woman? And I never thought this one through. Oh, it's because it's really just about making others concede to this psychological delusion. And that's what this is really about. Okay. All right. So I think we ask anybody this, they won't have a good answer for you. I mean, you know, and this is very straightforward. You also notice that in so many cases, the, the transgender female, male to female transition, which is not really possible. I mean, you can't actually become a female, but the version of a female that a man who wants to be a woman presents is usually a, a hyper pseudo feminized caricature of a woman. You know, it's usually, you know, they just piling on all this makeup and, you know, they want the giant fake breasts and all the things that they're doing. Usually that so often that you find this, you say to yourself, uh, it's a parody of what a female actually is. I mean, Dylan Mulvaney, the most clear example of this. So, you know, it'll be helpful on all this, my friends. If we just had guys feeling like they had enough testosterone to get through their day.

Now, these are one of these moments where I say, what history are we allowed to still have? What history have the communists not decided? It's time to get rid of or that is too toxic for anyone to celebrate. This is bringing me to this story about a Colorado elementary school teacher who kicked a student who was 12 years old out for having a don't tread on me. Gadsden flag. Now, Governor Polis has come out and defended the school boys response to the teacher. So sure enough, there is some recognition here that this is this is bad news. This was not a good idea that a Gadsden flag, which goes back to the American Revolution and the war against the British monarchy and the imperial, you know, imperial English tendency to well, run people's countries from far overseas. This is not about slavery. It's not about what the left wants to pretend it's about right now, or at least as one woman did is one teacher did, because that's just that's just historical ignorance. It's just not rooted in reality. But what you see here is there is a a focus now on always being if you're a Democrat, if you if you believe in the Democrat mindset, if you're a leftist, you have to always go to the extreme of that history is that history is racist or it's unacceptable or whatever it may be because you're terrified that you may get on the wrong side of the issue by saying, Oh, actually, I kind of like this, meaning this aspect of history, like George Washington's a good guy or, you know, really interesting or whatever, right? That you're not allowed to do that anymore. Now, if you're a leftist, you got to say, Oh, no, it's bad, bad, bad. I, you know, I have to wonder what's going to be okay. If you're a leftist now, who says the founding fathers are evil and racist, who says the founding of the country is right. If you're a leftist who believes in the 1619 project, what are we allowed to celebrate from the first 150 or so years of this country's past? Gads and flag just got in trouble, right? Nothing to do with slavery. What are we to celebrate and not get called out on it? Right? What can we look at in our history and say, well, that's interesting. That's cool. You'll notice that that part of replacing or rather part of what they're doing here is replacing the narrative of a shared history, a shared idea of America with something else and to do that, they have to tear down what already exists. This is what this is what communists do. This is what this is what the revolutionary era French did during the French Revolution, very different from our own revolution. The revolution rooted in a narcissism of men, the triumph of reason, but it was a narcissism, a solipsism of the French intellectuals and the French left that they then tried to change the calendar. As you know, they destroyed the Catholic churches, they violated nuns. I mean, the horrible things they did, they were so violently and viciously anti-Christian, anti-Catholic, specifically, that if you remind yourself, hold on a second, why did they do all that? They wanted to replace the society that existed with something else with a society that was godless, stale, run by the reason of man. But as you know, the reason of man absent a connection to the divine and eternal and universal truth turned into a bloodbath of people getting their heads lopped off in the town square or in the city square in Paris at the guillotine, right? That's what ended up happening. But replacing history is always what the radicals want to do. They, and tearing it down a step on you, tear it down, then you replace it with something else. You tear it down. This is what the Soviets did in the Soviet Union as well. Everything that the czars, there was nothing glorious or beautiful about the czars or the Russian Orthodox Church or anything else, it was all terrible. Replace it with the glorious revolution where people are starving and being murdered by the millions. So that's their version of replacing things. So no, I think we fight for our right, pardon the rhyme, to celebrate aspects of our history and have, you sure have honest conversations about our history, but you know, we all agree, I can't say we all agree, any normal person understands that, yeah, there are bad things in our history, they're good things in our history, just like every human being, just like every country. But to pretend that anything that you say about something because it's imperfect is somehow an elevation of the worst parts of it. I mean, where does that end? What history are we going to be left and able to celebrate going forward? That's what I would ask you. You know, my pillows team has a great sale going on with an everyday item for your home.
