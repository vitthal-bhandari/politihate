    "text": " Hello everybody, I'm Lou Dobbs. This is The Great America Show and welcome. Thanks for being with us today. Another suspected Chinese balloon has been spotted flying over the United States following a familiar path across the northwestern states. The balloon spotted Sunday night over Montana at 57,000 feet. The Biden regime following the same course as previous balloon intrusions, first saying the origin and destination of the balloon is unknown, the Department of Defense saying that due to the size of the balloon, there's a quote, low probability that the balloon is conducting surveillance. And now the administration is saying not only will they not shoot it down, but they won't even be investigating. And while Biden allows what could be another Chinese balloon to float over the United States, he's apparently unconcerned as well that China is about to build a military base in China, 90 miles from the southern coast of Florida. President Biden has yet to say a single word about China's intentions in Cuba. President Trump over the week did speak at the Faith and Freedom Coalition and said he has an idea why President Biden has yet to say a word about China and the China military base in Cuba. These countries know every penny the Biden crime family has taken in. The country is no Ukraine, China, they all know that many countries. So he can't even or ever go against them. He can't go against them because they'll reveal the corruption because they know exactly. They'll say, well, we sent the check here. We sent the check there. We said, so he has to be very nice to China, has to be very nice to Ukraine. And a huge success will be when the New York Times and the Washington Post and others put it on their front page, what's really happening here, because this is truly 100 times bigger than Watergate. This is a much bigger story than Watergate. That's why Biden doesn't mind that China has opened up these military installations and in the process of building a tremendous amount in Cuba, it's only 90 miles off our coast. He's basically said it's okay. He's not doing anything. He's not even saying anything. He's not talking about it. President Biden is under mounting pressure over the last two weeks as whistle blowers bring forth more allegations and evidence against Biden and his family as the congressional investigations roll on despite stonewalling by the White House, the Department of Justice and FBI. House Speaker Kevin McCarthy moving last week to stop Republican members from supporting a resolution to impeach Joe Biden again, McCarthy following the right away. And now McCarthy says he is open to an impeachment inquiry into Attorney General Merrick Garland. But why not Biden and Garland? Here is McCarthy on Fox News talking about impeachment of Merrick Garland. By July 6, because of the allegations from the IRS, because of the whistle blowers and the DOJ are Garland, what he is saying and what David Weiser saying privately are two different things. And if it comes true what the IRS whistle blower is saying, we're going to start impeachment inquiries on the attorney general. Although Garland should be impeached for a number of reasons, Garland isn't the one who took bribes from China and from Ukraine. And is complicit in protecting the Biden family. And certainly President Biden and Attorney General Garland are corrupt. To take all of this up and much more, let's turn to our guest today. Joining us is Lee Smith. He's the author of the books, The Permanent Coup and The Plot Against the President. Lee, great to have you back with us on The Great America Show. Let's begin with where we are right now with what appears to me to be an all out frontal assault across the board from all of government to take on and to take down President Donald Trump. Well, Biden has a free pass. Yes. And this certainly corrects a bizarre talking point that we saw over the last previous months about how no, no, no, the reason the Democrats are going after Trump is because they don't want to run against Ron DeSantis. They're really scared of him, but they really want to run against Trump. Look, I very much admire Governor DeSantis. This has nothing to do with him. What I'm saying is it's now time for people to understand what's happening. They're not trying to destroy Donald Trump because they want to run against them. It's not how the law works. They're trying to destroy him to destroy him. That's it. So it's important. It's important for our folks to understand what it really means when they're trying to destroy Donald Trump. Yeah. And it's as straightforward as it could be. And yet the national media is setting out all of these little interesting spinning shiny obstacles in their coverage and their narratives, all of which add up to nonsense. They're trying to bring anyone in whether it was Mike Pompeo. It was Chris Christie, whoever the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the, the Hudson's even gotten a run. They're looking for anyone who could possibly stand up against Donald Trump. Bernie Rhino and controllable Rhino who would do the bidding of the donor class, the oligarchs, the establishment Republicans and establishment Democrats, right? Luke, a lot of people. I think we can learn a lot of things from, from the Democrats and the DOJ, DOJ's campaign against Donald Trump. A lot of people believe that certainly because of what happened in 2022 midterms that there's not a clear path to victory for a GOP candidate. I've heard that argument and it seems pretty reasonable to me. I've heard it from serious people from serious pollsters, not that I, that know much about polling to begin with, but I'm telling you the way they're attacking him, it, it, it really does suggest to me that they're, that they're quite fearful that Donald Trump could win in 2024. And the law of unintended consequences in, in vigorous display, his numbers, his polling numbers, Trump's go up with the, with every indictment, every nefarious phony charge brought by either the Justice Department or state or local prosecutors. Yes. And the reason why is because they think they're dealing with the emotional and moral tenor of people on their eye, right? This is what the elites think. If you, if you paint one of their friends, one of their allies, one of their comrades as questionable, they'll back off them. That's how Washington works, right? These people have the spines made of balsa wood. They're nothing. But as it turns out, there is a very important part of this country, which feels, which feels loyalty toward its people, toward its friends, toward its family members, toward its leadership, toward the people who have stood up for them. So they are using the kind of operation that would work against their own people. If they called one of their own people creeps, you bet your life that they would abandon him in a second. But that's not what's happening with the other part of the country who looks around and they say, if you creeps are attacking a guy on my side, I know where I am. I know where my loyalty is light and it's not with you folks. It's with the guy that you keep targeting, that you won't let alone because you're coming after us too. It is truly remarkable that the national corporatist media, the propaganda media, the legacy media, every day, conspires to take on Trump and to shield and protect Joe Biden at all costs. I looked at the Washington Post this morning on their home page, scrolling, scrolling, scrolling some more, not a word, not a word about Joe Biden, the bribery evidence that is now direct evidence against Joe Biden. Not a word from the Bezos bugle, as I now call the Washington Post, another oligarch and other news outlet. Give me a break, your thoughts. I think I told you beforehand that I had one thing that's really been on my mind the last couple of days and that's among every other reason I'm always excited to talk to you. I wanted to talk about this. There are a lot of people, a lot of folks, I hear them friends, neighbors and they're like, well, don't you think the fact that some of this Biden corruption is coming out? And it looks like the press was really going after Korean John Pierre the other day. And it looks like who knows, maybe Obama let them loose on Joe Biden and they're going to swap swap out Biden for Gavin Newsom or for some other bright and talented rising star in the Democratic Party. And my answer is this and I think this is so important for us to get straight is that they knew that Joe Biden was incognited decline in 2020. That's why they hit him in a basement, right? That's why they kept him away from the public. They knew what they were getting. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I was just saying I think you're absolutely right. No one talks about it, but I think you're absolutely right. They knew what they were getting then and look at what look at what has been accomplished behind the blank screen of Joe Biden. The progressive progressives build very a central central parts of their wish list. Most importantly, opening up our southern border. One and number two, earmarking trillions of dollars for the climate change agenda. What do they have wrong with Joe Biden at this point? Nothing. I say that this is important for us to understand because we need to recognize the nature and the character of the people we're dealing with. If this was a regular moment in American politics, of course, they would look to move out a semi cadaverous figure out of the office. But this is not a regular moment in American politics. This is a moment in American politics where the president of the United States appears to be mimicking the talking points of Charles Manson trying to kindle a race war. Remember that speech at Howard University? Everyone responded, this is nuts. What's this guy doing? Let's remember the people who have the people who have pushed this in the past are actually pathological individuals. That's where we are right now in American history. So again, I urge all of your great audience, all of my friends and neighbors and anyone else. I don't mean to dispute or demoralize anyone. Quite the opposite. I mean to encourage them and say there is light and we will be seeing light soon. But to see the light, we have to recognize everything that we're looking at. We're dealing with pathological lunatics. They're not about Joe Biden. We have to fight with what we know. Who in your judgment are these pathological personalities that are in the shadows, if you will, amongst the cabal that obviously is directing this impaired puppet president, certainly he's not leading the nation. Who are they? Well, I think there's probably a pretty broad network. I'll tell you one person that I'll tell you one person who comes immediately to mind. It's the Democrats number one donor. We've been sitting around wondering for the last several years ever since he's been doing it. Why George Soros has poured millions into the campaigns for district attorneys across the country. And why is he doing it? I don't understand. Why does he want to loosen felons on the streets of great American cities? And unleash them against American families against American communities. I don't know. Is there some weird play here about devaluing the American currency like he's like he's done in the past? Is he going to pick up real estate in New York and San Francisco pennies on the dollar? And you know what? There might be answers to all those questions. But here's the simple fact. This is a man who is paying to set felons loose on the streets of American cities. That's psychopathic. So when I'm talking about a pathical network of corporate, political and cultural interest, I really mean that these people are pathological, right? Whatever motives, whatever financial motives there might be, and we don't know there are, we look at the play and that's what we see. Something that is pathological. Pathological, we're talking with Lee Smith. He's the author of the permanent coup, a brilliant political analyst. And I have to say social critic as well. Lee Smith, we're continuing with him in just moments. Please stay with us through these messages. All right, we're back now. We're talking with Lee Smith, great American. And Lee was talking about the pathological forces that have been unleashed on our society, on our country, on our people. In particular, by George Soros. And a lot Lee, as you said, is coming forward to the, out of the fog to confront the American people, whether it's CRT, ESG, IDE or whatever. If you put those initials together, diversity, environment and inclusion, you can spell the word die, which is exactly what I think many of these left Marxist activists are trying to accomplish your thoughts. Well, just to continue on the vein of the lunacy, certainly what's going on with the ESG indices and with the right diversity, well, what inclusivity, equity, whatever it is, this is certainly meant to tear huge gaps in the social fabric here at home. But I want to mention something that a lot of us are obviously concerned about, which is Joe Biden's proxy war on Russia's borders. And we have to look at that and tie that together with what we now know about the Biden family's corruption in Ukraine. So again, to come back to this, to come back to understanding the character of this regime, remember, this is one of the things that we're supposed to do in foreign policy. And this is what the so-called realist refused to do to look at the character of regimes, right? And the neocons went in the other direction just as stupidly. They said, well, a regime is only described by the very people on top. No, a regime is also how it afflicts an entire society. And our entire society is now paying for the pathologies at the top. Look, we have to ask ourselves now that it seems that Joe Biden wants to reenter the Iran nuclear deal with Iran. Isn't it time that we should start wondering, wait, why is the Obama Biden faction so intent on delivering, legalizing a nuclear weapon for a terror state? What is going on? What can possibly be the upside? The problem is not just have this threatened, traditional American allies in the Middle East, on top of the list is Israel. But what does it do to the United States? What does it do to the character of our country that our leadership class shares values with a terror state like the Islamic Republic of Iran? So again, I want to, I am keen for people to start looking at the character of our leadership class, our ruling class. So we understand what we're up against and we don't confuse ourselves saying, this is a normal time. Tragically, it's not a normal time. But as I said, I am fully confident that the great patriots in the great country will lead the way. And there is light over the horizon. That light also is brought to you by none other than the man who's been carrying the torch for reason, the American way and American values. And that of course is Donald Trump. I look at these other candidates and to continue this theme on the pathology. When we see the first, what, five, six entrants into the race for the presidential nomination by the Republican Party, all of them are just attacking Trump. They're not there to win. They're not there to show off their skills and appeal as a potential vice president candidate. The slower half of the ticket, they're there trying to destroy President Donald Trump. Don't you agree? I think so. I mean, I haven't heard much from Senator Tim Scott yet, but he may be the only one who's not, you know, who's jumping on top of the pile. But it certainly is peculiar. But I mean, Lou, you've described this better than better than anyone else in our entire country and our, you know, conservative, conservative media or elsewhere about how this is a function of corporate interest. This is what they're doing. They want to gang up and they'll pay whatever they can to help destroy Donald Trump and they have plenty of allies, plenty of allies in crucial U.S. institutions like the Department of Justice. Why are Republicans playing along with this? I don't know. I mean, it must be that the people, that the people who are whispering in their ears are making very powerful cases to the vanity of different candidates. And that's understandable. But you would like to hear other people whispering in the other ear and saying, Hey, man, this might cost you your career. People might not like you after this. People have, first of all, Donald Trump is the head of a movement and there's tens of millions of Americans who feel he was cheated, not only out of 2020, but 2016 as well. They crippled his presidency. And now you're serving as an instrument to disable them heading into 2024. You need to rethink what you're doing. I would love it if there were responsible political consultants and counselors, consiliaries, who were telling them, you should not be doing this. Think what you're doing. Support Donald Trump, support the American public who supports Donald Trump and your reward will be the love of the American public. Right now you're heading in the wrong direction. Yeah. And I think that it's time for us to find some leaders who seek nothing, no advantage, no reward, but simply because it's the decent and right thing to do for the United States, for this country. Why would Mike Pompeo, the graduate of West Point, served in uniform, worked for this president, both his head of the CIA and the State Department, why would he suddenly become a buffoon on the campaign trail, talking down the man who gave him every advantage and every opportunity in his administration and simply to attack him? What has President Trump ever done to create such animosity other than perhaps offend their egos? But this is a man who for eight, this is the eighth year of the political persecution of Donald Trump. And he's never been found to be guilty of any wrongdoing whatsoever. By the way, even the cases that were brought against him had to come up with puffery to even begin to think about impeaching him or setting a special counsel on him. Right. I mean, I mean, everything from the e-gene Carol case, which, you know, which is silly and laughable. But of course, that shows us something that we've seen certainly since the Michael, Michael Flynn trial that our justice system, our large parts of our justice system have run off the rails. They're delirious. And the e-gene Carol case is certainly a lustre to that. I mean, the whole story when you think about it, Lou, you know, New York, I know, New York. I mean, Birdorf Goodman is a very big apartment store. And the idea that Donald Trump could walk in there, you know, as people have said, who knows if Donald Trump even does his own shopping. But the idea that he walks into Birdorf Goodman and he's not mobbed instantly. And even though he, Jean Carol, can't remember exactly when this happens. Anytime over the last nearly half a century, Donald Trump walks into a pit, walks into a department store anywhere else. And he's mobbed by crowds. Right. So the idea that he could whisk off his carol in secret is preposterous. But it just shows you again where we are. People are believe people are. It's not just that they're credulous. People want to believe these incredibly destructive fictions. And this is how we have to look at the, the, the, the so-called classified documents case as well. The whole thing is just ridiculous. Yeah. I love your analysis in terms of the personality, the pathological personalities of the, of the Marxist left. But there is also a pathology that's abroad across our society. The left in this country has gone stark raving mad and people have to understand that over the weekend. Looking at, and looking at Breitbart to see the pictures of these pride marches and the obscenity that was on display before children on streets across the, across the country, the trans marches and signs saying we're coming for your kids. And I just went, why in the world hasn't there been someone cited for a public indecency? Why in the world isn't somebody saying this is outrageous and we're not going to tolerate any more of it? You are at, what is next? Are we, and these people are mentally ill. First of all, people have to understand that they have to comprehend it and they have to understand it. There's no ambiguity in it. They are mentally ill. And what is next? If you identify as schizophrenic, we have to deal with multiple personalities on the streets. What is this? When do we have to, how in the world are we going to come to terms as a society with this pathological welling within our own society? We're going to take that up with Lee Smith on the other side of this commercial break. Please stay with us, ladies and gentlemen. It'll be worth your while. I promise. We're back with Lee Smith and Lee, again, thanks for being with us here on The Great America Show. I want to pick up where we left off and that is with the broader pathology in this country. The mental illness of entire, the LGBTQ, what would you call them, lobby. There are some really terrific, talented people in that group. There are really some really crazy off the wall people as well. And they seem to be the ones who are leading LGBTQ plus your thoughts. Well, I mean, I think that this is one of the things that's really, that's really stirred the moral outrage of Americans. And they're there because with the trans industry, the trans agenda, the trans movement, whatever we talk, whatever we want to talk about, there are two different things going on, I think. And I think it's important to distinguish the different aspects of the trans agenda. You have people like Rachel Levine, who is now in the Biden administration at HHS. And I mean, this is basically a cross-dresser, right? And Americans are forced to, this is part of the thing. Americans are compelled to say, no, no, it's a woman. We're forced to tell a lie. That's part of the point, right? We're compelled to lie, to live in their false reality. The other aspect of it though, is not the man, you know, is not what are called auto-gano files. Men who are play acting as women. The other part is the more malevolent, satanic part, which is processing young women, in some cases, teenagers, and disfiguring their bodies, mutilating them, sterilizing them. So I think that a lot of people are starting to look at this. And here's one way that I think about it. You know, of course, the famous formula in George Orwell's 1984, which is two plus two equals five, right? Forcing an entire society to commit to a lie, right? It's not enough to say it. It's you have to believe it too. And again, to come back to our theme, to come back to our theme today of the pathological, I think that this represents for lots of people. I mean, this really is a flashing red light, the trans agenda. And I don't like to confuse this with, you know, with gay and lesbian community and stuff like that. I think this is a very distinct thing. I think this is a shocking moment for most Americans as we realize what we're really looking at. And so again, but I think that people are coming to that recognition. There's something wrong with this country's elites. The corporate class, the political class, cultural class, media, of course, as well. The professional class. I mean, we're talking when you talk about the mutilation of children, of young people, it is happening at the hands of doctors, physicians, whatever happened to first do no harm, whatever happened to science, whatever happened to the medical community that it is trembling before this movement. And in point of fact, embracing it and destroying and devastating the lives of young people. It is incredible. Not only embracing it, they expect to be celebrated for their moral stature, right? They expect praise for it, that what they're doing, right? What they label as gender-affirming care, sterilizing, mutilating children. They're the morally righteous ones because they do this. Look, I'm not even sure. My understanding is that our study of past totalitarian regimes suggests that these kind of experimental medical procedures were hidden away from the rest of society. The top officials in the totalitarian regimes understood about these gruesome surgeries, as we see with the Chinese Communist Party, right? Live Oregon harvesting from live subjects, from prisoners of conscience, right? But they don't publicize this. They don't boast about it, right? They try to hide this because they understand that people are looking and it would bring them shame and a pro-ream. But here, right now with our leadership class, they expect to be saluted for this. That is a dark, dark stain on this country. And the stain is widening and deepening. We're looking at churches, religion in this country, organized religion is in decline, Satanism and all of these cult organizations and societies are rising. We are looking at a society that is off the rails morally and objectively. It is a society that's at war with itself and we don't even have the courage to look at ourselves and say, what in the world are we doing? Our Congress is busy with a lot of investigations, but we also should be investigating the truth about ourselves as a society. Why is it that LGBTQ+, suddenly has this absolutely devastating bit toward torturing children and taking on a campaign of conversion for crying out loud in our public schools and our universities and our left-wing national media? Why are they evangelizing? Because this in many ways is the replacement faith, this kind of darkness, this pathological evil. And I think you're absolutely right to describe it as satanic. This is something I've been reading a lot about lately, writing some about. I'm eager to talk to you more about it when my thoughts are even clear on this. But I think that it's important that we also see that there are lots of Americans who are rising against it. I heard my friend Sean Davis, great guy, he's the publisher of the Federalist. Sean was telling me that he was at a dinner for the Heritage Foundation and Tucker Carlson gave the keynote and of course disappeared on YouTube and it's been all over. As a terrific speech and Tucker is the one who as we all talk about among each other, what we're really looking at here is not primarily a political struggle, but it's a spiritual struggle. And Sean said, you know, after that speech, everyone understood that something really important had been said. So I think this is something that people recognize. What we lack right now is the clarity of language to explain exactly what's happening because people know they see these dark forces and it looks like evil and it is evil. But it's very hard for us to believe that this is happening here, right? Chitescu's Romania was an evil regime that was swallowed up by the ground. How is it possible that trembling beneath the foundations of the world's oldest democracy, the greatest nation in world history? How is it possible? So that's why I think again, the more we can talk about this, the more that we can refine our language, our understanding of this because people do feel it and people do see it and people are outraged and people are scared as well. We need people to be less frightened and we need them to be forthright and we need them to have this clarity of thought and the clarity of language to get through this, to win. And I think you're exactly right. And I also think that we also have to understand this is not only a battle between good and evil. This is a battle between the elitists of both parties, not just the radical Marxist Dems, but those elites of the Republican Party who most for the most part are rhinos and libertarians, if I may say. And we are watching our middle class just being beaten down. They have been brutalized over the last 30 or 40 years, our middle class. Working men and women and their families have been shoveled every kind of nonsense and told to accept it, whether it be critical race theory, whether it be systemic racism and your, you know, the idea of reparations. Think how that sounds to a couple with a couple of kids are working all day long and they're hearing about reparations from the California state government. They're out of their minds and nobody will say it. Who the hell thinks that? Who thinks that that's a correct response to any, any slight ever done to someone 150 years ago. It's madness on its face and no one will say it out loudly. We always give, we always give our guests the last word. And I'm going to, if I, if I mainly ask you for your concluding thoughts on our visit here today, great to have you with us. Louis, it's great to be with speaking with you as always. It's always a treat and wishing you a great summer. And I hope that I hope we get to speak again before the summer is over. I just want to say following up on what you said, I absolutely agree. This assault on the middle class has been going on for decades. And once we go back and actually look at it and piece it together, everything, every, every single one of these initiatives was designed to destroy the middle class, whether this was the, whether this was getting China into the WTO, whether it was the global war on terror, terror, all of these different initiatives have been designed to assault the middle class. And yet, and yet Americans stand tall. And who is it? What is the repository, the treasury that holds the love of this country? Those are the same people. Those are the same people that they're attacking, that they seek to destroy. But these are the people who continue to revere this country's traditions. It's heroes, it's anthems, it's holidays, our songs. And that is why America is powerful. And the people around the world who revere America don't look at it. And they don't want to move here because of who's governing America. They want to be part of the great American people. That's what's understood the world over. So even when someone like Joe Biden runs us into the ground, the world looks and sees our strength, the core of which is the very middle class that's been under attack for those decades. God bless them. I wish them all a wonderful Independence Day, a great summer and forward on to victory. Amen, brother. Lee Smith, always a pleasure to have you with us here on the Great America Show. Thank you, my friend. Thank you, Lou. Lee Smith, the great American, and you can read and watch all of Lee's work at least Smith dot locals dot com. That's least Smith dot locals dot com. That's it for us today. Our guests coming up this week include pro Trump candidate for Missouri Attorney General Will Sharf, former NSA senior intelligence analyst Russ Tice, Senator Tommy Tuberville, former Capitol Hill Police Chief Steven Sund, be with us for all of those great folks. Thanks everybody for being with us. God bless you and may God bless America."
