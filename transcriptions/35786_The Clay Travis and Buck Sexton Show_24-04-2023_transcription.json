    "text": " Bud Light recently came under fire for partnering with transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney. The company lost billions in backlash with, you know, even country stars speaking out people like Travis Trit, Kid Rock, Bradley Gilbert did a concert recently where he took Bud Light to task. But you might ask yourself, why would Bud Light do this? Does anyone honestly believe that Dylan Mulvaney, this transgender influencer, sits around and drinks Bud Light? Does anyone honestly believe that Bud Light's customer base likes someone like Dylan Mulvaney? How does this happen where a company like Bud Light would choose someone to partner with, which is essentially giving their customer base the middle finger? We'll talk to Will Hild, who's the executive director of Consumers Research. He deals with this stuff on a daily basis. Consumers Research also launched something called Woke Alert, where people can sign up and find out which companies are engaging. And this kind of Woke left-wing nonsense. They've also previously launched television ads, taking companies like American Airlines and Coca-Cola to task for their policies and going woke. But we're going to talk to him about this Bud Light controversy. Also, when did companies start getting so woke? And why do they continue to ignore us as a customer base, conservatives? Stay tuned for Will Hild. Well, thanks so much for coming on the show. It's the first time this is an important topic. Obviously, Anheuser-Busch has come under fire for partnering with a transgender influencer, Dylan Mulvaney. The companies lost billions of dollars in the backlash. Why do you think this one was different in terms of the company taking a financial hit when sometimes that doesn't always happen? Well, I think there are a couple of factors that play the key role. One, I think the egregiousness of what they were doing. I mean, it's in solid. If you just even watch the video of what Mulvaney did, it was frankly insulting to Bud Light customers. Most people don't want to be portrayed as Bud Light drinkers, you know, pretending to be a woman, sitting in a bathtub, pretending to be a woman like that. From the average Bud Light customer, it's like the opposite of how they think of themselves as some weirdo in a bathtub, pretending to be a woman. I think that played a huge role, just the egregiousness, how in your face it was, what they were trying to do. The second thing is that it's a very much a retail product. I mean, this is something that people go and they buy at gas stations and grocery stores day-to-day. So it's very easy and very quick. They can make a purchasing decision. It's a little bit different than, you know, stopping, flying an airline or something. You make those kind of plans weeks or months out. So I think that played a role. And then sometimes there's just a magic ingredient of why things go viral. And, you know, once the ball gets rolling, it becomes a snowball. And I think that turns into an avalanche. I think that played a role here too. I mean, I think a lot of people are wondering, you know, how would a company like Bud Light come to this conclusion of, yes, let's partner with Dylan Mulvaney and put our finger in the eye of every of our customer base, right? Like basically just giving a middle finger to the customer base. So clearly they had to have known that. So like, how would that be approved? You know, how did this even happen? It doesn't make a lot of sense. It's a great question. And I think, you know, the average person has been scraps in their head increasingly over the last decade is more and more companies have taken positions and done things like this where you're going, are you just going out of your way to insult your customer base? I think what you really have to do to understand this is to look at the ecosystem of a corporation and the ecosystem that they're within. By that, I mean, the corporation doesn't make decisions, right? People within the company make these decisions. And increasingly, there are different portions of these companies that have different interests. By that, I mean, for example, a lot of companies have adopted what they call a DEI Department, a diversity, equity and inclusion department. And, you know, this was kind of billed as like the next evolution in human resources and just, you know, supposed to be more conscientious of your racial disparities. What it is in effect, and I mean, it's both in the pejorative in the technical sense. Is a cancer on the corporation. These departments exist solely to soak up as much resources and control over the company as they can. They don't care about the company's customers. In fact, they often resent and dislike them. And they see their purpose as utilizing their position within the company to push an ideology inside and out of the company. So that's part of it. And nothing's been confirmed, but there are rumors swirling on Twitter that this had been approved inside sources. It said that this was approved by a lower level marketing employee who didn't get top level approval. Whether that's true or not, I think the entire incident speaks to the powers that some of these DEI and woke portions of the corporations have got. They're aided by another portion of that ecosystem. And that is a lot of times coming from above these large asset managers like BlackRock, State Street, Vanguard, they have been using their assets under management, meaning the shares they own on behalf of their clients to push wokeness in a lot of these companies. So even though it's not their money, BlackRock has about $10 trillion under management, but none of it technically belongs to them. It's in their custody as a fiduciary, but they use it to pursue political objectives. And they go to these companies and they push racial quotas, far left social issues, the LGBTQ2 stuff, pro-abortion stuff. And they are effectively the owners of those shares until their customers retrieve them from the company, based on fire, BlackRock or State Street, Vanguard. And so for right now, they control large portions of these companies. And so you see that being pushed on them from above in addition to these DEI departments pushing it from within. But it does seem to be more in our face now. When we saw this with Disney as well, again, a company pushing values that are the antithesis of their customer base with them trying to push the LGBTQ agenda. So when did it become so in our face? And I guess when did this all start happening? Well, as there was an increasing push to enlarge these DEI departments, they became larger and larger portions of the corporation. And a lot of decision making now runs through those portions of the company, which is surprising because they don't generate any revenue for the company, right? It's not like the DEI department increases sales or creates new products. But there was this huge push over the last five to seven years. To really start having all decision making at the company run through these departments. So whether it's hiring and trying to increase minority representation at the companies or making sure that their marketing was in line with whatever the social trend of political issue of the day is. They've gotten a lot of power over the last 10 years that they didn't have. So you're seeing them flex it more and more. Even though you would think, you know, instance after instance of it backfiring on the companies, but it takes a long time once these kind of people are entrenched. We've seen this in academia as well, right? How many universities have had disgraceful incidences because of these same types of individuals, but it takes a long time to get one certain trench. It takes a long time to get them out. Well, you know, it obviously seems like they're not concerned about diversity. They're more concerned about pushing an ideology. What do conservatives do about it? I mean, part of the challenge too is even if you look at the response to Bud Light and this campaign that they did with Dylan Mulvaney, you know, there's a split among Republicans as well. You know, some Republicans said, Hey, they give us money, leave them alone. And then others said, Oh, let's put the screws to them. You know, so I guess how do we fight back when it seems like not everyone has the stomach for it? Yeah, it's a great question. And you're right. I think it kind of shows that there's even division within the conservatives on how to push back. I would argue I'm in the put the screws to them camp and not just purely out of spite, but there needs to be measurable changes made at the company that are articulable. Right. Tell me CEO of A&H Out of your Bush. How have you made sure that this will never happen again? I don't know if you read his apology letter, but it was completely milk toast. It wasn't even really an apology. It just kind of was like, I'm sorry that this cause such a such a kerfuffle. That's not going to, you know, I want to know, you know, we've revamped our marketing department. We've gotten rid of our department. So and so has been fired. Those are the kinds of things that the left has that's how the left got to where they're at in terms of the power that they have within corporate America. They asked for definable changes in either power structure or staffing or policy. And that's basically the right should not be satiated until we see, you know, articulable moves to our side on these things. The other thing we can do is start and we're working on this in consumers research where we're pushing this in about 20 to 25 states is start taking away those big pools of capital, namely the state pension funds from these big asset managers. So, you know, companies like BlackRock again, and Statry and Vanguard, they should not be managing red state pension funds. They have policies on the books to push all this progressive left policies with their entire asset portfolio. So states like South Carolina and Florida that have money with these companies, those assets are being used to push these progressive left positions. And so we need to start working those and move those to asset managers that the respect of fiduciary duty to these states and stop, you know, using them to simply push democratic party platform agenda items. The only place I would disagree with you is I would also want to do it out of spite. So that would be the heavy, heavy, I would be, I would be pro-spy. Well, that's a nice fringe benefit. I would be pro-spy. I often say the only reason I wouldn't drive an electric vehicle is just because people are trying to push me to do it. So, you know, so you talked about the state pension fund. So that would obviously take, you know, the governor and take the state being interested in doing that as well, right? Yes. And you've seen a ton of states start to take action on that. Florida in particular has moved. West Virginia. Texas has passed a law that says if you have as a company policy, you're going to try and discriminate against a particular industry. And in their case, fossil fuels with all these net zero targets. Then the state is no longer going to do business with you. You're not going to do our bond issue instances. You're not going to manage our state pension funds. You know, your persona non-grata to us as a vendor. And you're seeing that start to spread throughout, like I said, there's about 20 to 25 states this legislative session this year that are considering similar legislation on that issue. And that's what it's going to take to turn the market because other states like California and Illinois and New York and New Jersey, for years started saying that if you wanted to, if you wanted to be a customer of CalPERS, for example, the California pension system, then you had to agree to use all of your assets under management to push net zero. So they basically allow a hijacked all of the red state pension funds by doing that because the red state pension funds didn't object until now. So putting it into that, bifurcating the market saying you can't serve two masters. You can't use our money to do California's bidding and New York's bidding. That's going to hugely dampen the ability of BlackRock and other big asset managers to push this kind of nonsense. I do think, and I don't think people always realize how smart Governor DeSantis is here. I live in Florida in the way that he uses government to fight back and against some of these, you know, the woke, right? And trying to defeat them. But it does seem like more and more Republicans are finally coming to the conclusion that, you know, playing nice, like we used to, is not going to get the job done when the left is capturing every institution in America. It's absolutely true. And as a fellow Floridian, Sarah Sowin myself, I couldn't agree more. I think what Governor DeSantis has done has been fantastic and should be a model for all other Republican governors who care about defending freedom and liberty in the country. One of the pushbacks we sometimes get in our efforts is that this is somehow anti-free market. You know, you've got the government coming in and saying, you know, what companies can and cannot do, or they'll stop in business with them. But that's already what's happening. California and New York and New Jersey are telling the market, the asset managers, that if they want to do business, if they want to get these huge amount of billions of dollars that their pension funds have, that they have to sell out the interest of these other states. There's only one way to solve that. If you had a lawyer that was giving away private information of yours to another client of theirs and returned for money, you would fire that lawyer. Well, that's what's happening. These big asset managers and big banks are selling out the interest of red states on behalf of their blue state paymasters. And so there's only one way to solve that. You have to fire them. Yeah, see, I look at it as survival. You know, what hope do we have if we have no power moving forward? So, you know, I think the battle lines look different than the use to when, you know, we've got, you know, every institution working against us and trying to punish us just for simply being conservatives. Quick commercial break. More with Will Hill. What else would you like to see from governors or see from Republicans to try to push back on some of this nonsense? Like, what else could they be doing effectively? Well, I think they basically need to look at enforcing a lot of existing law around fiduciary duty. The other thing that I think really raised question, this is an antitrust violation. Many of these asset managers are members of groups like something called Climate Action 100 and another one called the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. I know that's a mouthful. Sometimes it's usually just referred to as G fans. But in order to join these organizations, what you promised to do is to pursue net zero targets. Coordinating with all the other members in this organization. Well, what effectively that means, it's like if you've got together all the owners of all the oil companies in the world and said, hey, we're all going to agree, we're going to decrease production by 10, 15%. Well, if you put it that way, everyone would recognize that's obviously an antitrust conspiracy. That's, you know, textbook. They've effectively done that. They just call it net zero, but it's the same thing. And I think increasingly states looking at that, looking at that avenue, the Sherman A.T. Trust Act allows states the right, the right of action against these companies. And I think if you start seeing a bunch of lawsuits against Black Rock and State Street and Vanguard and even the big banks that have also signed on to this stuff like City and Vacuum Morgan Chase and BOA at Wells Fargo, I think it will end it very quickly. The good news for us is on this front is a lot of this woke capitalism stuff is pushed by conspiracies that are illegal. They're violations of long existing fiduciary duties and long existing federal statutes against antitrust. But we have it to your point. We haven't had the political will to simply enforce the law and that has to change. I'm looking now and I think, uh, where is it? There are 22 Republican trifectas in the country right now, 17 Democrat trifectas, 11 divided governments. So there is absolutely no excuse for 22 of those Republican states to be doing everything they can under their power to push back against the stuff. And it may companies, you know, punish companies that are pushing a woke agenda and pushing an agenda that's actually, you know, hurting Americans as well with what we see with the, you know, some of these environmental stuff that they're doing. Uh, you know, I don't, you guys just launched recently, you know, woke alerts. Talk a little bit about what that does and some of the specific things that you guys are doing at consumers research to push back against the stuff. Absolutely. Well, in 2021, we want something called the consumers first initiative. It's an ongoing multi million dollar ad campaign to name and shame companies that go woke in order to distract from their misdeeds in the market or their mistreatment of their customers. We spent millions and millions of dollars blasting the brands of companies like American Airlines, Nike, Coca-Cola, BlackRock, obviously, taking a master MLB. And the next phase in that, one of the things that, that when we launched these people kept coming to us, like, where can I find out what companies are woken up? When, how can I, can you guys tell me, you know, who should I be shopping with? And so we came up with this idea of, of woke alerts, meaning it's a text message based system. You can sign up on our website at consumers research.org. And we will text you when there is a company that goes woke. Sometimes it's a big story, like the Bud Light. Sometimes it's a company that's flying under the radar. They're going woke and they hope no one finds out about it. And we're going to put it into that. So it allows consumers who care about when corporations are undermining their, their values to know about it and to be able to do something about it. So, like I said, people who would like to sign up can, can visit our website at consumers research.org. And you've also previously launched ads against companies like Coca Cola, American Airlines, you know, talk a little bit about some of that work in terms of trying to, you know, target them and ads on cable stations as well as local markets. Yeah, absolutely. So, so yeah, we, we spent millions of dollars, uh, tarnishing these, these companies brands because when we realized was the companies that were the wokest, most likely to go woke, they also had some of the worst skeletons in their class. And it became very clear that what they were really trying to do, the real game here was they wanted to distract from those issues. It would cozy up to woke activists and what politicians, they get really glowing coverage in the New York Times, the Washington Post for signing onto a letter, condemning Georgia election integrity legislation or Texas election integrity legislation or whatever the key issue was. But in reality, they were some of the worst offenders, like take Nike, for example, obviously, they're famous for having Colin Kaepernick, you know, uh, you know, call America. White supremacist nation and compare the NFL combine to, to a slave trade. Nike has had decades of issues with, uh, uh, sweatshop labor. And right now they have a huge problem with slave labor in China being used to make their shoes. And that's according to congressional, a congressional report. In fact, at the same time that they were attacking the Georgia election integrity legislation, they were quietly lobbying against a federal law. That would have barred products made using slave labor in China from entering US markets. They wanted an exception so that their shoes could continue to increase the hypocrisy. I mean, I'm not one for pointing out hypocrisy because it doesn't really do much. These people are pretty, pretty blatant sociopaths. But I do think the average consumer needs to understand that when they see a company go woke, what that usually means is that it's projection. They're doing something probably worse than what they're accusing the other side of. And we were simply going to call that out. It's not going to work. Uh, our idea is simply to defeat, you know, there's no reason to go woke now because if you're, if you're trying to distract from those issues, we're going to put a spotlight on those issues. Coca Cola also had issues with the same thing. And American Airlines is one of the worst run airlines in America. Um, the same, you know, the same year that their CEO, uh, got a 10 million plus, uh, pay package. They had to go to Congress for a $4.5 billion bailout. So, and that's a, that's a company that goes out and starts, you know, preaching to Texas about how their election should be brought. So, you know, we're always out there. We're going to be continuing to, you're going to see more and more campaigns come from us. Uh, and to any of anyone in C-suites listening, uh, you're, you're on notice. Uh, if you go woke, uh, we, we will and can, can, and we'll come for you. Also think it's, you know, easier to target these companies, like, and how's her bush or Disney where, you know, they need us more as a customer base. I don't know what Nike's, uh, breakdown looks like in terms of consumers. I did stop wearing Nike's. I will say that I worry. Deed us now, although they probably are just as bad, which is the sad thing and a lot of this, but after the Kaepernick stuff, I said, all right. Enough with this. Is there anything else you'd like to leave us with before we go? I would just say that, uh, you know, ESG, the, the driving a lot of this and the, and the woke capitalism stuff. This is something that your elected representatives can do a lot about, but it's not, it's not often the sexiest issue. It's not the easiest thing to talk about. I would just ask for people that are interested in listening, call your elected representatives. No matter where you are in the country, let them know that your governor know, let your attorney general know, let your treasurer know. You care about these issues and you want to see them do something about it and you support them doing something about it. That makes a huge difference. Never underestimate the importance of phone calls from, uh, to, to your elected representatives. They don't always get as much feedback as you think they, they might have. And just hearing from you that you care about this and you want them to end this wokeness in corporate America makes a huge difference. No, I mean, I know they pay attention. You know, I used to be a staff assistant at uncapital Hill way, way back in the day. And I know that, you know, the, the member I worked for would ask me, you know, where the calls lined up on certain issues sometimes. So they do pay attention. Also, the culture war stuff is more important than anything in my opinion, because if we cease to be a free country, nothing else matters. So it's kind of, uh, you know, the most important thing. Uh, Will Hill, uh, executive director of consumers research. I appreciate you taking the time to join us. And then where can people, I know you'd mentioned the website, just mentioned it one more time. Absolutely. That's consumers research. O R G and people can follow me on Twitter at at will Hill. That's W I L L H I L D. Cool. Well, thanks so much. I appreciate you taking time to join the show. Thank you so much for having me. So that was Will Hill that with, uh, consumers research, appreciate him taking the time to join the show. Appreciate you at home. As always for listening every Monday and Thursday, but you can listen throughout the week. What do they, John Cassie, my producer for putting the show together. Leave us a review, give us a rating on Apple podcasts until next time."
