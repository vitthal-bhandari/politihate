    "text": " Today, with all that's going on in the world, thankfully, the Biden administration has announced the first ever national gender strategy. Also, the Washington Post says, parents do not have a right to have a say in their children's curriculum. I have a feeling, just a feeling that the two gentlemen at our table will have something to say about this. We've got a lot more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the News and Why It Matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez, today joined by my two favorites. I think your two favorites as well. Blase TV contributors, Yaku Blueyans, host of the Yaku Blueyans Show, and also Eric July, host of For Cannon's sake. Also known as Young Rip of Five-Nine on the Interwebs. You're my two favorites. Oh my gosh, thanks. Well, I mean really, the audience raves about you guys and it's funny because whenever one of you has gone for several days at a time, which is just like you guys are contributors, which is great, but this is not your only job. You're gone for maybe two days and they're like, where's Yaku? Where's Eric? Where are they? Why aren't they on? Okay, I promise I have them on as often as possible. It's humbling. We're happy to be here. Yes, we're happy to have you. I think it's a good day for you guys to be here. Not that every day isn't a good day for you guys to be here. The Biden administration amidst all of the chaos going on in the country right now, we have inflation happening, we have the pandemic that is still going on, of course, because everyone hasn't gotten their 10 millionth booster. As soon as you get your 10 millionth booster, you will eradicate COVID, so they say. But as all of these things are going on, the Biden administration is focusing on something way more important, which is a national gender strategy. So Kamala Harris tweeted out, President Biden and I released the first ever national gender strategy. This is our vision for the future of our nation, one that is bold in strategy and one that this moment calls for, this plan calls for, you may be wondering, well, what is this bold strategy? So it is, they want cemented abortion rights, of course, because nothing says national gender strategy, gender equality, like being able, well, I mean, I guess they're asking to kill both genders equally. So maybe that's what they mean by all of that. But a push for more women in the US military, no thank you. And closing the gender wage gap, although there is no evidence that the gender wage gap is due to some sort of, you know, equal input, not equal output. But hey, what do I know? So these are just some of the things that they are talking about. They want national paid family leave, you know, affordable quality healthcare, which as I said, they mean abortion, but they always want to say that it is health care for women, they want health care, affordable health care. Really, they just want to be able to kill their babies for free, if we can be honest with you. Help achieve global equality for women, at least finally they're talking about global equality, although I haven't ever seen the Biden administration nor Democrats in general call out the countries that need calling out when it comes to women's equality, when it comes to certain countries that are still like throwing gay people off of buildings, typically we don't try to achieve global equality. We typically will just like partner up with them in some UN counsel. So maybe that will finally help achieve some actual global equality. I will say they also say, Yaku, they also say promote reform of laws in other countries that discriminate against women and combat human trafficking. Love to get your comments on whether or not that will actually happen. Listen, you're just in like two minutes or whatever was destroyed the Biden administration. Single handed. To be fair, it's not hard. And you just killed the five on Fox who's lame to me. I just sitting here going, keep going, keep going. They're not going to do nothing about human trafficking, but this is what they've always done. Clinton did it, Obama did it. We're going to fight human trafficking in these other countries, but we're going to traffic kids on our border. I was on the border last week. Oh, we're going to have kids sexually exploited in our classrooms, but we got no problem here. We're going to do it in other countries. Look, it's isn't it ironic that from the same camp, the group, the school of thought that goes, oh, there's no male and female. Oh, you can't say men and women in Congress, but we need women's rights. Eric, we need women's equality. It is hard to come up. All of a sudden now there's women. Now you're a woman. I thought there's no gender. I thought tomorrow you could be a dolphin. I thought you could just do whatever you want. Now all of a sudden is that, oh, and by the way, can't we just for the record say that over 60% of the babies killed in the womb are girls and over 50% of those girls are black girls. Okay. So hey, we want to kill black girls. You need to let us do that. Okay. But we're for the rights. We promise you, but we're not for the rights of the kid that's being sex trafficked in our country because that doesn't happen over here because he's sons doing it. Okay. Now we got to go to kids in the other countries. Like what is it? Are there men? Are there women? Are there not? That's a great point. This whole thing has become very confusing if you take the word that they used like literally last week. Eric, it was International Pronouns Day. Right. And now, and it's like they, them, yeah, I can't keep up with all of these things. And now we're back to men versus women. Look, this is just yet another example of how idiotic sort of these radical egalitarian nonsense that these guys put out there to act as if individuals aren't individuals. To act as if there's no differences between men and women except when they can try to point to some sort of fuzzy up numbers that they make up really on the dot to say that there's some sort of inequality that exists because there's some bad thing actually happening when it's not. And it's funny, they mentioned particularly the military. I don't know if they're going to talk about women being drafted or what that actually entails there. That's going to be very interesting. But when you consider what a lot of people, especially conservative, think of what the military actually is, it doesn't seem rather conducive. But to be fair, that's representative of really everything it is that they talk about on this subject matter. And nothing's about merit and everything's about what box can be checked and trying to conjure up some weird narrative or conjure up some weird situation in which exists equal representation among all individuals proportionate and sometimes it's not even proportionate to whatever the demographic is or representation is regarding the United States population. That is an impossible thing and I need people to understand that. So anybody that leaves with that is talking out of their behinds like the great Thomas Sowell once said the same man is equal to himself on a different day. So you can't look at some like disparity that exists and say well there means that there's some sort of wrongdoing not to say that there may not be but to say you can't point to disparity alone because some are naturally and voluntarily arrived. And to them that is not a thing. So they go issue to issue. It doesn't matter what it is. Contradicting the other direction. It doesn't matter. They go issue to issue. They can be a hypocrite in the same sentence. It doesn't matter. But they go issue to issue because they know that there's a bunch of stupid American people that fall for this nonsense that say well there's some sort of disparity that exists before there must be a wrongdoing. And here comes the government to come save you and usually as it always says it's just an excuse to steal money from people and then line up the pockets of their folks and to throw money at some given ridiculous I don't know like program or something of a bunch of academics with fake jobs so they get lined up to feel like they're useful. It's just money laundering is all it is. Yeah and it is very frustrating as a woman specifically to keep hearing about the gender wage gap and you know they don't want to take into account that women generally speaking are the ones who take more time off for the children. We've got doctors appointments to take them to and we've got to go pick them up from school and when they're sick we have to stay home and you know I mean we are not putting in generally speaking the same work as men. I'm a mom. I know this. The difference is that I'm not only willing to admit it I want to embrace it because I am the mother. Of course I'm going to take more time for my kids. Of course I'm going to be the one to handle all of that stuff. I'm their mother. That's what my primary role is. I find it very sad that all of these feminists, all of these women's rights activists want to toss that part of the equation aside as if the kids are not you know more important than the pay that you get from the job. I want to get your thoughts Yaku. I know you look like you have something to say here but I also want to throw in something else into this because the same thing that we were talking about here you know Eric you're talking about there is there is always going to be disparity but what is the root cause of it is it always because of some sort of discrimination. No well the Biden administration seems to disagree with you because that's what they're doing at all points in time now. It's just appointing people to find out why we have disparity to combat disparity to make sure because it must be because of sexism and racism and homophobia and transphobia and all of these other things. So now there's a woman by the name I'm sorry I just said woman. A woman by the name of Janice Boudler who will now serve under Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen. We'll now serve as the Treasury Department's first counselor for racial equity. So this is yes exactly so Secretary Yellen said I've appointed Janice Boudler to serve as Treasury's first counselor for racial equity charged with coordinating Treasury's efforts to advance racial equity including identifying and mitigating barriers to accessing benefits and opportunities with the department. Guys the civil rights movement was a long time ago. I can't think of one thing that one race has access to that another race does not have access to there are very specific laws prohibiting that and still here we are the first counselor for racial equity not like in a private business not you know in some local town where they've gone bonkers the Treasury Department of the United States of America. Guys the in South Africa this exact position under a different title was created the minute before affirmative action came in and I said it months ago watch it's coming and it's coming from State Department they're going to pick players winners and losers I want to say that number one and I want to get back to something you said earlier the same administration is now telling you they're going to stand up for women's rights is the administration that sends a billion dollars to the Taliban who abuse women left right and center who marry off their eight year old children who has you know sexual relations with kids at 1812 the hypocrisy is so insane you're right you're calling it so so accurately it is issue by issue as if it's a brand new day in a single issue with a single issue nation today and we can say whatever we want right they don't care about women one lick and by the way Jordan Peterson has an incredible program that he does on this this supposed pay gap right we've actually go hour to hour right there's no gap right the toughest job on earth is the job of being a mother yes and it when it's a mother sitting at the table also working also running a business that is like insanely awesome and impressive right but there's no gap there's no glass ceiling no we just we've just signed up to do the most important job in the world that happens to you don't you don't get paid for yeah right and that's just part of the deal you know if I got paid for all of the work that I did as a mother I would be so rich I would not even be working here right now billions and billions of dollars so Eric I want to get your thoughts on this specifically so I actually I just thought of this as we were as we were talking yaku was talking and I just looked up a picture of Janice Bowler because I just just wanted to see what she looked like because she she did say in a statement I have spent my entire career working in solidarity with black latinx AAPI native communities and other communities of color to dismantle the structural and institutional racism that perpetuates the racial wealth divide now I don't want to presume but I I don't think that she is black or no there ain't no black woman yeah that's a let's let's let's let's let's see milky I would yeah I mean again I don't look I'm I get called a white passing Hispanic all the time first you say no but I'm just saying if they really not saying it's right but if they really cared about this kind of stuff why is it always coming from old white people look this this I mean it's funny that they talk about this among their own as if they have to exist yeah I don't think people understand Janet Yellen is arguably one of the most criminal people it works but one of the more criminal sides of this institution that we look at when it comes to the United States government and her working in combat very really the treasury as well as the federal reserve are crooks right they they if you wonder why you talk about inflation and you talk about all these other issues that's that fort is being rather manned by both treasury and the federal federal reserve you know where Ron Paul said in the Fed which is what I'm of course pushing for is if they don't need to exist so it's weird to see a bunch of criminal speak among themselves as if they have to be there and they say hey look at us we're adding some person to be a part of our department so we can figure out what type of weird stuff is going on like we're here to help we're here to help like if you hear the help get the hell out of the way quit yeah quit or matter of fact I knew you weren't better abolish your your entire department and then get up out of there if you actually want want to sit up in here see these guys never it seems to they never look at the government in itself and its mere existence as an actual problem that could actually be the solution they never look at they're like okay maybe we're a part of the issue so maybe we should get out of the way so they never go attack those actual issues we're talking about institutional racism they don't it's not like they're talking about licensing you know go to state control licensing where a black woman can't braid hate her legally because she doesn't have a license which is stupid as I don't know what they don't look at those types they don't look at these different forms of regulatory bodies that as well as taxation they don't ever look at that it's never looking at themselves on what they have or rather their institution has for decades caused in terms of an issue they never look at that it's all right well some other issue that y'all created so here we come and try to try to solve yeah you really want to solve some problem get the hell up out of the way I think she's there to find something too there's what they did to Gruden I want to go investigate something sounds about right and then they go the rest of the NFL no 600 000 out of emails no nothing else to see here just that guy she's probably there to go cause some drama and some trauma and would not be surprised one bit all right we've got more to come but first we want to thank our sponsor the segment home title lock so you know we talk about big government bureaucracy all the time how how does this sound the social security administration's computer servers are almost 50 years old does that does that shock you at all does that shock you one bit no yeah exactly so it was very easy when cyber criminals went on and hacked the u.s. census bureau and all of their computers it was very easy because the computer systems are a hundred freaking years old they're definitely stealing all of your tax money not using any of it to upgrade their system and make sure that they are protecting your information all right it is it's a big risk but let me tell you what's a bigger risk on top of that is when those same cyber criminals go online and take over ownership of your home it is called home title theft it is one of the fastest growing crimes according to the FBI they go they do it the same way they go on to you know a database online where copies of your home's title is stored and they can forge your signature stating you sold your home to them then they borrow on your home they can just deplete your entire retirement nest egg that equity you have in there and leave you in debt you're not going to know it until it's too late all right you got to protect your most valuable asset you can go to home title lock.com all you have to do is register your address to see if you are already a victim they will tell you they will let you know use promo code radio you can get 30 free days of protection that is home title lock.com promo code radio home title lock.com Virginia Democratic gubernatorial candidate Terry McAuliffe accused a Republican Glenn youngkin of trying to ban black authors from schools now that on its face sounds very very problematic or trying to ban black authors from schools what a racist right well what actually happened is McAuliffe said that Glenn is spending his final days of the campaign focused on banning award-winning books from schools and silencing the voices of black authors I know we can read between the lines and see these Trumpian dog whistles for what they truly are on November 2nd we must reject these politics of hate and divisiveness but we can't do it if you don't get out and vote now he actually is alluding to these books that yes Glenn youngkin had a problem with they are called genderqueer and lawn boy both of which parents in all of these school systems have complained about because they contain graphic images inappropriate for adolescents eyes I want to look I want to get your thoughts on this both of you I know that you have both have very very very specific thoughts about the school system and how you feel about the public school system yes but he of course responded Glenn youngkin and said this lie is beneath you even you Terry Washington Post fact checker on 930 21 McAuliffe mischaracterized the bills he vetoed neither bill would have allowed parents to veto books or take them off the shelves according to the bills and veto statements issued by McAuliffe but if you have a problem with books that contain pornographic images and pornographic details in these books you are now accused if the author happens to be a different color than white you are now accused of being racist and you are engaging in a Trumpian dog whistle this is at the same time gentlemen I just want to throw this into the equation the same time the Washington Post has a published an op-ed that says let me let me just give you the headline those of you who are listening on audio and can't see this parents claim they have the right to shape their kids school curriculum they don't so that's good that's really cute and this is co-authored by assistant professor of education at the University of Massachusetts Lowell Jack Schneider and freelance journalist Jennifer Berkshire who think that parents rights is just it cannot overstep the fundamental rights that these kids have to learn different things other than what their parents want to expose them to yep and so McAuliffe by what he says promotes child sexual abuse I can say that this book long boy to get real yeah please because you've done a lot of work this is what I do I fight sex trafficking and we fight the sexual exploitation of kindergarten or 10 year olds in school this is happening in the United States and then this book long boy is in in the Episcopal School of Dallas this it's in Christian schools this book long boy and I'll be real brief it's about two boys one boy coercing a boy behind a shed to do oral on the boy and then they go back and forth and explaining oral and promoting oral sex between 12 year old boys right in the classroom when that happens when a teacher endorses sexual activity to a child there's a reaction in the brain of the child they now become promiscuous by design they become desensitized to sex they will end up in porn they will most of them will end up being exploited they'll get trafficked so McAuliffe is for the sexual exploitation of children it doesn't matter who wrote the book black white pink I don't care what your race is the books got to go okay nobody's talking about who wrote the book that's irrelevant but it's a nice little candy wrapper in a news flash you say oh we're banning black authors no we're banning pedophiles that's who we're banning from the school system and I want to pass it to my brother here to take it over because we're talking about probably just banning the whole dang school system not the book well I want and I want to throw this in here to Eric because in this op-ed I just found it rich I'm sure you will too that they said that overturning all major decisions to parents would quote risk inhibiting the ability of young people to think independently the idea there is that it's the school that's teaching them to think independently Eric it's the parents who are stifling them and indoctrinating them are believable it's the complete opposite when dealing specifically with the public education system now look I know there are people that insist that because I have waited until I don't know I got a ring on my finger before I chose to have children that I don't have a safe but you all are taxing me so I actually got way more to say in that regards let me just say that you're paying the same amount exactly that you are so you don't get to tell me not to say any damn thing by the way but I don't know I find it actually insulting that people think that I would bring a child into this world and despite me knowing what type of criminal corrupt bull crap that goes on in these educational system I think at that point it becomes child abuse if I would ever then drop my kid off at that spot but on a serious note going back to what we were just discussing these people think that they have the right to your children yes that's just so that's just what it is the public education system because we a lot of us grew up in it here I did I did too we've been conditioned to believe that that way is the way that has to exist and I had to do a lot of one learning in that regard certainly when I became an adult to try to again unlearn a lot of that bull crap that I was taught that a social outcast where the home schoolers when it turned out the home schoolers tend to be better off than what a lot of us were you find out that much more like skills that yes exactly sexual exploitation violence generally the only time a lot of people will ever experience a lot of that is in the public education system and God forbid that you as a parent go to them and say I don't want this there I don't want this to be a part of their curriculum they say to you shut the hell up now look God this is a subject that I've obviously spoken very passionately about many many times on my show at some point you have to look at that and and how they are so protective of that institution they always roll out the academics to say well it's a threat in this case you're solid some black authors or whatever sort of nonsense because they understand that they don't have future generations if they don't have access to their minds yeah particularly at the time when they're like sponges so that's why they are so protective of that institution I'm not here to reform it I'm here to eliminate it that way the power actually goes fully and get back to the parents so you take your money wherever and go if you don't like that that what that school is teaching you go somewhere else instead of being forced to go there because I don't know you live near the actual district or whatever arbitrary lies that they drew in some cases like mine I actually stayed outside of the city in terms of the school that I was going to because again all these weird lines I couldn't even go to the school that was down the street but that's how stupid all of this is but more importantly you need to look between the lines of what they are actually saying here again guys you wonder you take all these people that's tossing bricks and Starbucks and all that they they don't some of them don't come from conservative parents you're crazy as all get out if you you cannot what's the old saying like you can't hand your children off the season and not expect them to come out as Romans that's what we're dealing with here I love that this last year woke a lot of parents up to how corrupt that institution was and thank god we have enrollment uh uh public school enrollment down then further than what it's ever been we need to pump those numbers up I mean down I guess in terms of this but we're starting to see how people are paying more attention to that and that's why a lot of folks are screaming at these school boys your Caesar comment brother I don't know how accurate that is Rome fell because of sexual immorality mmm okay here we go again yeah they understand the left understand when you bring sex into the classroom confusion of sex gender whatever or promoting sex you're gonna break a society and they will have a class that they can control like Caesar did right but so America will fall if we allowed it I say if you're a parent and that book is in your child's school storm is that gates okay you overrun them take every school board back make that principle you know quiver in these boots remind them who pays their salaries that's what I love it's like you guys are acting like we are not the ones who are paying for your job and now we don't uh does your boss get a say in how you perform your job does your boss get a say in your daily tasks uh I think that we get a say as taxpayers in what the hell you're doing in our children's schools all right we've got more to come first we want to thank our sponsor built bar so uh built bar sent me a package last week and I've been enjoying it so they just came out finally I wasn't sure if I was supposed to say anything last week but I did they have a pumpkin puff they just came out with it I

first order over at built built built.com promo code news 15 so I was going to start this segment with uh the update on the Biden administration announcing a new international air travel policy but uh during the break I just happened to see on my my news notifications that the FDA you know they had a committee that were voting on whether or not the Pfizer vaccine should be uh given to endorsed by the FDA given to children elementary school age so five to eleven they voted 17 to zero with one person abstaining that they wanted to grant emergency use authorization for Pfizer's COVID-19 vaccine in children ages five to eleven now this comes a few days after Pfizer and biotech bio-NTech uh released new data showing that their vaccine was 90.7% effective at preventing symptomatic COVID in in in a study of children that age and I just would like to remind everyone what we were told uh at the beginning of this vaccine at the beginning of the year you can you can hit me for misinformation if you'd like but it is not misinformation because we have all of the documents all of the articles that were written at the beginning of the year saying that this was the vaccine is 100% effective at preventing COVID the vaccine is 99% effective at preventing COVID oh whoops it's 95 oh whoops just kidding it's in the 70s oh crap wait now we're all the way in the 40s and here we are again for children who by the way statistically speaking are not prone to any sort of long-term damage from this virus now we're to believe that it is 90.7% effective which I don't know how that lines up with the fact that uh what is what is the recovery percentage it's like 99.99 yeah for that group age group it's almost statistically insignificant that there'll ever be hospitalizer show symptoms anyway right right but 90.7% effective they want to tell you for now for now we've seen that number slide in adults but 17 to 0 the FDA committee is now telling you you should get your five-year-olds injected with this drug and you want to and you want to still wonder if this administration is actually for people they're coming for your children we're not kidding hide your kids hide your wife hide your kids hide your wife husbands yeah I mean I'm look I had a family member in her 60s this week got the vaccine by choice all good you know I'm not hypocrite went to her doctor yesterday and he said you cannot take the second vaccine your body is having incredible reaction to this thing you cannot take well god bless her doctor who is actually willing to say that actual doctor in Tennessee that actually has some hutzpah they are coming for the kids this is the deal it's that old saying Disney knows this you get the kid you get the parent yeah it's it's simple yeah I just it just boggles the mind but even even with these numbers 90 points 90% effective what they're natural their natural immune system is way more effective than that at this virus so why are we giving them these drugs that have no long-term study and that's what I want to look at yeah I'm screeching yeah complain in the comments I don't care I got a vaccine for the government I got to cook up a cocktail in my backyard I got a cocktail for the government like Alan you some African mojo but the thing about this is I would love to look at what study kind of their referencing and how they are determining this 90 percent efficiency rate because well the study Pfizer gave them I'm sure yeah of course that's exactly so I want to know what specifically they're looking at and I think people need to understand what exactly that term mean look I think it's important to note that that age group you're talking about was a five between five and eleven it's almost statistically insignificant that they will be hospitalized for for COVID that is so important I mean even in my age group it's almost statistically insignificant I believe last time I looked it was like eight and every 100 000 so you can imagine and I'm I'm only 31 you can imagine someone younger than yeah you're a five-year-old how because it continues to decrease depending on how young that you actually are I mean they're more susceptible to the flu than they are the COVID stuff so looking at that they come up with this number 90 percent I look at that after the show and really kind of break that down maybe even later on when I'm here on the show and actually look at what it is that they're looking at but it was funny we were just talking about public education y'all know that's why they're doing that right yeah that's why they're doing that because then now they of course they control that that's the institution so now they can force because they're going to say well the FDA or these alphabet drug institutions have said that this is something that we need to do or they're going to wreck a CDC is probably going to come out soon now we recommend that this is something that you're doing then the public education system will say well do the CDC recommendations we're going to go ahead and come to school if you're not right exactly exactly that five years old which is absolutely insane that's specifically why this whole five to 11 year old demographic is so important and why they're why they're actually pushing for that that's all this has to do with well Eric can I also add into that equation on the fact that we have seen them continue to say you're five year olds and you're 11 year old five through 11 need masks in schools they need to be masked they need to be masked where's the study that shows that this is working well we don't have it but they still need to be masked until there's a vaccine and now we're seeing are they even going to let them stop masking probably I mean I don't know because but once they're but once they're they are giving the vaccine to all of the school age children I mean to me that's that's the that's their end game so at that point maybe they will drop the mask but but but but you know that that's why they were keeping the mask protocol absolutely to begin with to make parents just like oh god when can we get a vaccine for my kids so they can stop wearing a mask exactly but how are you going to fight a book that's sexualizing your kid in the curriculum if you're going to let your kid get the vaccine at five they know they're pushing this country over the edge over the cliff yeah and there's no return from that yeah big daddy government please tell me what I can do with my kids so what's next exactly do I mean do I need to inject them should I inject them so that they can stop wearing a mask because you told them to okay I will you want them to read a book with sexually explicit activity oh okay well you tell me I don't know how to raise my child you raise them for that's why they send them there though Sarah like I we've had this is a uncomfortable conversation for a lot of even even for some of our viewers here like really all it is is an expanded sort of daycare really for them because I found out this past couple of years a lot of people don't like they damn kids everybody talking about a great game oh we take pictures we put on Instagram put on Facebook look at I do everything for my child no you won't you hand them off to the enemy and then you moan when they come out thinking the way that they are that's exactly what it is that they do so seriously god this is a line that needs to be held this is insane this has nothing to do with science what was it back in the May even the CNNs had to concede that there were nine new billionaires created out of the form of a suitable company and you idiot still think this is any damn thing to do with science of course Pfizer wants more people to get jab it's not because they oh they care so much about the children and they want to keep them safe no I mean it's the government will pay them to have those vaccines so they can inject them into your children it's that they line and they pocket them courses and everything oh that's the best money scheme ever quick question quick people will continue having children that you then have to inject oh my god oh it's somewhere in there you'll find Planned Parenthood I'm sure they're in there some quick question yeah what stock does Congress in Informa City go own most of what stock oh no what is it fine oh my god oh my god I never saw that coming all right we have got more to come first we want to thank our sponsor Birch Gold Group so we've discussed this on the show inflation is really really high it's right at the highs of the last couple

implications or penalties you got to get started now with a tax sheltered account request a free info kit from Birch Gold you can text the word why that's WHY to 9898 988 you got to do it you guys i'm telling you the Biden administration is running everything in the ground you really want to diversify right now you can text why to 9898 988 Joe Biden yesterday is very cute he was talking to children which is good because they are about like his same IQ level so he really was talking to like just one of his peers at this point was at an elementary school in north plainfield new jersey full of children that he can't wait to inject with his vaccine but he spoke to them about the press always following him around and asking him questions and how he always tries to avoid answering them just such a cute cute moment let's watch you know when you're president see all these people here they're they're with you all the time they get to ask you all kinds of questions and you try to figure out how you can avoid answering them sometime yeah so you can do that by like hiding out in your basement always traveling back to Delaware when your country is in crisis you can have your press secretary constantly dodge questions and not give truthful answers the list goes on but i do think if there's one thing that Joe Biden has mastered it is avoiding questions from the press he's pretty good at that he has a talent and to forget the forgetting talent and but i don't know if that's he's good at that so much as just his brain will allow him to tell he wants to inject the children he sniffs the children okay okay and now and now he's literally you can't do that while i'm drinking my water he's literally indoctrinating the children's tell him run away from questions that's incredible leadership it is a plus leadership Joe yeah i mean that's a great point that's really what you want in your president is someone who's like yeah well uh my main goal is just to avoid taking responsibility and answering questions from uh free press is so do we really have a free press at all no you don't but yeah that is kind of a bizarre thing that you got this guy who was being perpetuated as the big leader of the free world first thing oh i don't know if it was the first and the last thing but one of the things that he's telling them is that you see all these people you are run away from my problems i try that's what i do and it's like yeah man i don't know if that's something that you want to be telling youngsters uh specifically at that age that's not really conducive to living a uh a good life but uh maybe for him it's working very well um he does a lot we see it all the time turn his back immediately on the press and he doesn't take answer stuff that previous presidents have been very criticized of we would hell when the other one would last one would talk to them and he made fun of them they really didn't like that uh but specifically this one they don't see well they sometimes have an issue with it they kind of they're not as aggressive as i think they do see maybe yeah that's true we're having issue but the press secretary jens sake seems to take field all these questions and she's winging it at the time up there anyway uh-huh being very very sassy look man this is representative of of the american government right now so i couldn't think of a better person to serve as the president uh considering that because he's a representation of how stupid this whole situation is that's why it needs to be eliminated that's a great point that's a great point uh all right just we've got about another minute here so let let me let me circle back let me just circle back now to uh the international air travel policy really quickly just to give you guys a good idea of how far down clown world we are living uh you will have to foreign national air travelers to the united states will be required to be fully vaccinated and provide proof of vaccination status prior to boarding an airplane uh i do love that this this little picture it says the the new u.s international air travel policy is consistent across the globe and also guided by public health what the hell does that mean guided by public health because reasons that's basically what it means guided by public health like if you if you actually dissect each of those words of public health what public health policies public health what cases guided by public health it's a key word right it's just the key word it's just a key word by the way just uh just for clarification though even though you're fully vaccinated you will still need to show documentation of a pre-departure negative viral test from a sample taken within three days of travel to the united states before boarding hmm it's almost like they know the vaccine may still uh may not prevent infection it's almost like they know yeah well you know what i'm gonna stop talking because i want you guys to be able to watch this on youtube and we got to take a break we'll be right back hey you got me back then you have the vaccine if you still have good i'm gonna let you guys in on a little secret uh i actually can see the
