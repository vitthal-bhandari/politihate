    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in clay Travis bucksxton show we are rolling into the friday edition of the program Hope all of you are having a fantastic early start to your weekend on the east or west coast We will power you right into hopefully a fantastic friday We've got a loaded show headed your direction our buddy Alex Berenson next hour We'll be on with us at 130 Eastern Breaking down the latest covid numbers. He of course still banned from Twitter for being accurate about everything Just a little bit too early. We have got our also buddy from Fox News works Fox News weekends also regular guest on Fox News Formerly at ESPN will cane will join us in the third hour of the program But right out of the gate we've got so much to get to in particular the Unbelievable lies that are being told to you right now in the White House surrounding Hunter Biden and the fact that there are still Still right now Media that are helping to cover for everything having to do about Hunter Biden So I want to play a couple of things for you this is from the October 22nd Presidential debate this is the final presidential debate between Biden and and obviously Donald Trump and I want you to listen to Biden say neither he nor Hunter has done anything at all wrong This is 100% a lie. He lied to you. He lied to the American people listen vice president Biden There have been questions about the work your son has done in China and for a Ukrainian energy company when you were vice president in retrospect Was anything about those relationships inappropriate or unethical nothing was unethical. Here's what the deal With regard to Ukraine we had this whole question about whether or not because he was on the board I later learned of a britzma a Company that somehow I had done something wrong yet every single solitary person when he was going through his impeachment Testifying under oath who worked for him said I did my job impeccably I carried out u.s. Policy not one single solitary thing was out of line My son has not made money in terms of this thing about what are you talking about China? All lies by the way the whole thing at the whole thing is a lie The the China thing is a flagrant lie because we now know his son Hunter got four point eight million dollars This is not some right-wing conspiracy theory. This is coming out of the Washington Post New York Times everybody is acknowledging it now And to their credit the White House was pressed on this yesterday and said hey You know now that the data is out there the checks have all cleared everybody can see that your son got four point eight million dollars from China The White House is still trying to say that Biden didn't lie about that answer in the in the debate Listen to this yesterday play cut five during the last Presidential debate Then vice president Biden was asked if there was anything inappropriate or unethical about his son's relationships business dealings in China and for Ukraine President said nothing was unethical You went on to say my son has not made money in terms of this thing about what you're talking about China Does the White House stand by that comment? We absolutely stand by the president's comment and I would point you to the reporting on this which reference statements that we made at the time That we gave to the Washington Post who worked on this story But as you know, I don't speak for Hunter Biden, so there's not more I can say on that I mean just total misdirection clay wise Oh, yeah, I direct you to the reporting the reporters all lied about this Mike here. They are talking about Hunter Biden back in the day There's no evidence that Hunter Biden has done anything wrong. There is no evidence of any wrongdoing between By Biden by Joe Biden or by Hunter Biden president Trump has falsely accused your son of doing something wrong while serving on a company board in Ukraine Or point out there's no evidence of wrongdoing by either one of you president Trump Wanted dirt on Joe and Hunter Biden Trump's claims about wrongdoing here are Unsubstantiated we have looked lots of outlets have looked Politi fact found no evidence to support the idea that Joe Biden advocated with his son's interests in mind I've never read a memoir like this one before this is Hunter Biden's book beautiful things. It's breathtaking It's breathtaking clay. Let me just say that was Anderson Cooper falsely accused he's asking a question during a presidential debate in which he says or maybe as a presidential town hall I can't remember but this is when Biden's running. He says you've been falsely accused Why don't you speak about this thing? This is the way they play the game This is how the Democrat apparatus does what they do and this is bigger than just they were all lying there was evidence It was on the laptop. There was other evidence to The the hill.com as I said John Solomon while I was working there broke the baris mr Stories back in 2019 not even the 2020 election year. It was known what was going on They suppressed it. They said it was conspiracy theories. They went on attack and I think one of the reasons this you know They're there are two levels at which this really hits home. What is our Democrat aligned corporate news media is a complete and utter joke and anyone whoever says in the White House or anywhere else But the journals looked into this is just absurd I mean it's ridiculous at this point But then the other part is this is about a presidential election They're always telling us all they're lecturing us about integrity and the need to support our democracy and democratic Information flow and all this stuff. They basically cheated. I mean, I know it's within the rules But they subverted the information flow They decided to stop doing their jobs to suppress this story And and big tech actually shut down the community I mean imagine if a week before presidential election clay all the cable providers came together and were like, you know what? Not putting any commercials on air for the other guy Then you can say oh, well, I mean, maybe there's some regulation by this you say oh, but that's you know Those are privately owned things cable companies cable that would seem to us like it was Unfair it was tilting the battlefield in one direction. It's exactly what they did Well, and this is where I come down in a big way here buck There's a difference between a platform and a publisher And this is what has been missed time after time after time and I say this is a guy who owned a media company When you make editorial decisions, you are a publisher And publishers are held to a different standard than platforms Let me explain it simply if you're just a platform Let's say most people out there probably somewhat familiar with message boards If you're just allowing everybody to come on and say whatever they want buy and large within some, you know content neutral patterns and rules Then you are a platform twitter tries to argue we are a platform. Oh, we're not picking sides We're not choosing what the stories are are getting attention We just are a platform that allows people to come and share their opinions for instance Facebook tries to argue the same thing But twitter in particular is a publisher Because they decide all the time what trends and what stories they are going to allow to circulate in which stories They are not going to allow circulate which opinions are permissible and which opinions are impermissible But you know this you've seen it with the way that your accounts get treated our accounts at at facebook Regularly whenever we got deemed at facebook our and i've talked about this under oath in congress testifying in front of jim jordan and his committee The number of times that we had stories that were considered to be unacceptable Our traffic would suddenly decline by 90 at facebook It would cost us massive amounts of money at outkick because suddenly we don't make the ad dollars that we were anticipating You can see it right on the charts. Oh, you did this and boom your traffic Just falls off off the it's it's crazy the power they are publishers They're making choices about what people see when they see it what they see and they rigged the 2020 election They did 100 billion percent the tech companies rigged the election in favor of Joe biden and now they want to try to argue that somehow Democracy is under attack when they are the primary purveyors of that attack they built these companies promising Promising to everybody remember google for a while was even don't be evil and then felt like google doth protest too much I mean they built these companies under the promise that they would be free speech free information flow entities And then they used to lie for years they were lying about how oh we don't we don't have a bias against alternatives and that's not true or that was a mistake or and they've been realized why is it only happening to people really on the right? Why is that and became too apparent then they said yeah, you know what? Sorry, we call the shots You guys don't get to actually have free speech on these platforms anymore and for people that say it's fascinating The left is always you didn't build that You know, where would you be without the government making roads and the electrical lines and all the stuff? They're always the government can control anything and then on this issue. It's oh no no big tech Internet Billed your own internet you you don't get to say anything about because they just want the private company Yeah, that's one of my favorite. They're a private company if you don't like it leave That's what they always that that's the argument all the time and a lot of libertarians are useless on this one too Libertarians are like Santa Claus. They only really exist if you talk about them too much So you know what and let me say this for the libertarians out there you cost Donald Trump the election in 2020 There needs to be a libertarian vote exchange and let me explain but the buck I've argued this for a while if you're in a competitive state You have to make a choice Democrat or republican and how you vote if you live in California or you live in New York Uh, and you know exactly how the election's going to turn out if you live in Alabama. It's a red state you live in a blue state You should be trading saying hey, well If you're worried about libertarian support in states that aren't competitive vote whatever you want But if you look at the numbers in Georgia, Arizona Pennsylvania Wisconsin Michigan Libertarians who I don't know how in the world you could not have chosen trump over over biden You guys cost the election to donald trump by voting libertarian libertarians as and I mean professional because I don't want people writing And i'm a libertarian i love liberty no i'm talking about the professional Libertarian class folks right in the media Most of them have been either mia or just worthless on the issue of of covid and covid lockdowns because They live in in hipster areas and they don't want to up they don't want to upset their neighbors So they were kind of yeah, you know, whatever. I guess we got a science means we have to mask up to there are exceptions There are exceptions. I have a lot of libertarian tendencies. Look, but i'm also irrational. I well I do too But I actually believe in liberty. I don't believe that liberty is whatever your neighbors in brooklyn or sanimatica You it is because you're scared at a cocktail party, which is what I see with a lot of libertarians But nonetheless, I think back to uh back to the big tech role and all of this the big media the big democrat corporate media Uh, lie to everybody about hunter bida and we that's why we play you those clips. You know, we're not making up They just completely lied to well How was the clay and I knew the laptop was real and that hunter was getting money from china and trump was saying hunter was getting money from china And from ukraine and the and the media's response is that's not true You look into worse We we can't confirm it. How hard is it to confirm? Have you seen the photos of hunter biden on on the laptop? These would have to be it's impossible to fake I'll just say it. It's impossible to fake many of the things that are on the hunter biden laptop Yeah, we'll come back and by the way, we have we have Some sage words because we I keep posing question. I asked clay. I gave you my sense of it We asked marena divine from new york post yesterday. Why now? It's a very important question We have some sage words from the past a voice you will all remember on Why may be they're deciding that it's an open free for all right now on the biden family What's going on with it?

Why all these new stories? About hunter biden the biden family the obvious corruption tax evasion Possible money laundering a lot of stuff right now. Let's all come out the verification of the laptop Although we all knew it was real, but they're pretending we verified it All of us. Why would they do this now? Well, I would want to point out to you that rush himself of course the man who created this Fantastic audience that has now been entrusted to us to continue the fight with rush himself said Uh just a couple of years ago that if it is going to be biden who at some point is pushed out There's a reason for it and this is how it will go. I'm gonna take folks. I think we're seeing enough information on the bidens Now to safely say that biden will serve at the pleasure of barack obama If obama gives the green light to democrats to take biden out there will be ample evidence That biden has lied about his knowledge his family was selling his name and office with his permission And if that's in fact the case Then there's likely unreported money that will be found The fake news media will temporarily become hard news media if the decision is made That biden has to step down until that time They will be covering for biden. They'll be making excuses for biden. They'll be ignoring all the negatives You wait and see and then watch what happens to their ratings when that happens He nailed it clay that's that's in 20 october of 2020 and that feels exactly like what's going on right now Yeah, I I think the one difference is that I would amend a bit here is I don't think they want him to step down because I don't think they want kamala in as vp I think what this is suddenly designed to do is guarantee that he's not going to run in 2024 Well, that's what I mean, that's the okay fair fair point. That's the uh, the Distinction there but they're no longer all in on biden is the point and suddenly they've decided the apparatus has decided that's where we are 100 and I think the one difference is Kamala has been so much worse than I think anybody could have foreseen I don't think there's very many people out there who would say hey, you know what I anticipated I anticipated. Oh, I think a lot of you did and we did that biden would be bad as president I didn't anticipate that kamala Harris would be worse as vice president right as bad as biden has been The expectation was he's gonna be a out of sorts. He's gonna be out of his mind The dementia is gonna continue to get worse and they will elevate kamala Harris. That's the goal I don't think that's the goal anymore. I don't think they want to let her be in office running Let's wargain this including the possibility of a part in here Which I still think is a gonna happen because I don't think they're gonna bring actual criminal charges again That here in a second. We got a question to your point though to your point about uh Hillary possibly stepping in The best option it would seem to me would be to have biden stepped out have kamala take over and then have a contested democrat Primary against kamala right you don't want to have a contested primary So biden would have to step down or you're saying he just wouldn't run at all for real He just would announce he's not gonna run. I think you I don't think if Hillary potentially is ordering this kneecap And it wouldn't stun me if you look at her relationships in the dnc Then she doesn't want kamala running as the incumbent in any way. She wants a wide open primary We'll talk about it. We come back that would be my theory Uh when too many americans determine they no longer identify as americans first But instead identify by race class or sex it's time to ask why Hillsdale college has made this conversation a focus arriving at the conclusion more americans of all beliefs need to be reminded How great and special this nation truly is they're doing it right now with a new free online video series You can watch it again.

I rarely do this buck I got to give credit to some of the members of the white house press corps I think a lot of them are starting to listen to our show buck We know some of them are we appreciate you guys Because all of a sudden they're asking questions that frankly, I haven't heard even be debated hardly anywhere else buck This week we've been talking a decent amount about the hunter biden case We've obviously got the stakebed over whether or not he's going to be indicted But we forwarded the conversation to how would joe biden respond if his son were indicted maybe his brothers I really think the interesting question coming out of if you heard our interview with marynded divine Uh congrats because all those really interesting if you didn't you need to go to the podcast and listen to that But I thought one of the most interesting questions that we talked with her about was whether tony bobolinsky was going to testify And if he did and she said she couldn't tell us if he testified in front of that grand jury To me joe biden could get sepina to testify in front of that grand jury So a question that I would toss out to people in the white house press corps is based on the grand jury investigation currently going on with hunter biden would joe biden Except a sepina in that investigation and testify under oath or would he fight it? That's a great question should be asked in the white house press corps, but this is a good question And it's it's indicative of people listening and paying attention to where we are headed The white house communications director kate bedding filled Would not even entertain the hypothetical of whether or not joe biden would pardon his son Listen to this If you're aware if there have been any discussions here inside this white house about whether the president might use his part in our commutation power with respect to either his son or his brother That's not a hypothetical and get entertained. I don't have anything to add from this podium Great question great question. That's that's what you should get and you could even hear her a little riled up buck in that response I remember I mean clay as they say we and our audience is old enough to remember When during the russia collusion investigation there were blue Which remember just to be very clear everybody to put in the proper context was a massive fraud paid for by the hilly Campaign orchestrated through the deep state actors of the fbi and cia and using and leveraging democrat propaganda media Altogether that was the real collusion the whole thing was a fraud But I remember when people there were months long it felt like news cycles. I mean just every day every day What's trump gonna do when he has to pardon evanka? What's trump gonna do when he has to pardon jared or donald trump jr Just going on the family and blue checks just to remind everybody We're celebrating this notion there they wanted trump They wanted the president of the united states family members to go to prison to rot in prison for decades for what didn't matter They're just spiteful libs so they hate people and they never think beyond that Notice that hunter by that there was never actually a federal criminal investigation of any of those individuals Hunter byden right now is the target of the us attorney of delaware. This is a real thing I think that the the apparatus will Find an off-ramp for him where he gets a little slap on the wrist You think he may find actual criminal charges, but it's real clay We can all agree that they're really looking at this guy. He got millions of dollars He clearly didn't pay taxes on it So why isn't the media entertaining this notion because clay? I don't think they know yet and we always have to remember you know that you should tell us in the cia Don't Underestimate or overestimate your opponent, right? Don't think that everything they do is genius Just like don't think everything they do is you know, they're a bunch of idiots Uh, I don't think the democrats even necessarily know How they want to handle this I think they're still working this out Well, they're frustrated because even to this point they're having to acknowledge that what they basically called a right-wing Conspiracy theory is the truth and by the way, can we start to stack up? All the conspiracy theories that have been proven to be the truth just in the last year Can we stack up things that we've been saying on this show that yes, you know the democrat media is like all the crazy clay Travers and bucks in show and it's like yeah We were when was it when we had to come on the show be like hey guys We got we were really wrong on this when we were totally missed by a mile World where we thinking and this by the way to circle back around on uh the discussion about kamala My theory is that the pressure that is being brought to bear now is being brought to bear on on hunter biden Because the expectation now is that he's going to get indicted and if he gets indicted the uh, the Walls are going to get closer and closer on joeb item and joebiden is going to announce this is my opinion Soon after the midterms which will be a shellacking. I have helped to restore normalcy to america I've solved covid. This is not true, but this is what he's going to say And given my age I do not think I have it in me to serve until i'm 86 years old and so I won't be seeking uh re-election in 2024. This is my prediction Or like early on I thought hey, maybe they'll try to elevate kamala because it'll make her more difficult to beat if she's an incumbent Now I think that kamala has been such a disaster that he will serve out his term And that he'll I think hillary is going to be the nominee and that hillary is laying in the weeds And uh, she is almost uh tanya harding Uh, nancy karrigan like she's going to come running out with that crowbar and hit him right in the knee and take out kamala And she will be she believes that she is the rightful first woman to be in the oval office She's coming back, baby And she is going to be in her mind the nominee We know the dnc has done all the dirty work for hillyry before And she she is everything is angling to me towards hilly clinton 2024 presidential candidate I think that's probably right. I I can't uh, I can't see the flaw in the in the logic. I think that it's it's Almost impossible to to imagine that given the problems that bide now has keep in mind There there's no option here where this gets better. I mean just work through the for for biden specifically then we can get more into the hillary thing Let's think this through let's say that i'm right and the charges are I you know, they're gonna make him pay a fine That's that but let's let's be very clear for everybody Nobody else would get that treatment. Okay. Yeah, you took millions of dollars didn't register as a foreign agent Hidden money wire transfer fraud didn't pay taxes. You are going to prison Okay, so and I have no there's no doubt in my mind that he broke the law and should go to prison This is about will the justice system treat the son of a democrat president differently and I say yes place is They actually may it may be overwhelming to the point where they actually have to bring a charge Okay And I think that's why they're using a grand jury by the way because that way that They can say oh, it's not us bringing the charges the grand jury I mean they put it to a grand jury. That's a little understood That's a little punch good, but it's a little bit of a fig leaf in terms of the government saying we didn't bring these charges the grand jury agreed to So so okay, so but let's assume for a second that my my sides my side of this Is correct in that he doesn't actually hundred doesn't face any real charges Then everyone's going to be like wait a second because they're gonna have to have They're gonna have to have a statement of what he did and it will be clear There was wrongdoing and essentially the republicans will be hammering the biden crime family for what member with hilly? And this may have cost hilly, you know hilly didn't go to prison folks But it might have cost through the election that there was the whole email scandal combi bail to route because people realized it was so unseemly It was so obvious. That's a huge problem So that alone and that's the best option I think for democrats If you're right and he faces criminal charges and gets and even if he takes a guilty plea Now it's the son of the sitting president is a convicted felon Does he go to prison if he goes to prison is his father gonna come 100% Joe Biden commutes the sentence in my mind does he because he's not gonna let his son go to prison Does he pardon him? I mean, you know that he get his question, but this creates a nightmare for democrats And it'd be one thing if biden was popular gas prices were low the economy was roaring the border was secure Then you can get away with it. You know, it's like the talent versus your baggage thing in sports, right? Yeah, if you're talent outweighs your baggage you're always gonna have a job. You're always be good to go in sports Biden's talent doesn't outweigh his baggage and the baggage is getting heavier the argument for all of life This is a good lesson for everybody out there. So long as your talent exceeds your problems You'll always be employed Biden's talent Is far exceeded right now by his problems and here's the question that I I know we got a lot of white house media a lot of media in general will Joe Biden testify if he is subpoenaed as part of the hunter-biden grand jury investigation because he should be He should be subpoenaed to testify about some of the emails and some of the stories involved in potential criminal wrongdoing Will he testify? I'd love to hear what the white house would say What percentage of households Still have phones install them them or landlines as they're commonly referred to can you believe just 40% That goes to show you how comfortable we all are with our cell phones We we rely on our cell phones and while you may not have a phone installed in your home You're likely to have at least one cell phone or another for the rest of your life All the more reason to have a great cell phone plan One that doesn't cost you a lot. That's where pure talk comes in rely on pure talk But the same 5g nationwide type of cell phone service Provided by the better known companies and save as much as 50% every month We've experienced pure talk in our own lives for nearly a year now And i'm here to tell you it's every bit as reliable as a cell a cell phone service connection You get from at and t verizon or t mobile That's very straightforward because pure talks service is on the same towers the same networks as one of those big three names So switch from them to pure talk today and only pay for the service you need and want Like unlimited talk text and six gigs of data for just 30 dollars a month from your cell phone dial pound 250 Say pure talk you'll save an additional 50% off your first month You can literally be switched over to pure talk service in less than 10 minutes dial pound 250 say pure talk pure talk is simply smarter wire Welcome back to clay and bok. Thanks for rolling with us on friday April fools so i'm i'm watching travis like a hawk to see you all know i you know Want to make sure that he doesn't try to pull anything here, you know tell me that uh There is no nfl there is no nba anymore. They've decided to call it quits or something So don't think you're gonna get any of that fancy guys stuff past me on april fool sir I'm watching this thing. It's a good day by the way If you have crazy stories that you want to just uh just try to get out there Friday april fools because a lot of people will be like, oh there's no way that's true You know, that's the way i respond to a lot of different stories that go viral on the internet at first Like if you had told me for instance buck what was yesterday national transvisibility day If you had told me today Hey, the biden administration has come out in favor of 12 year olds chopping their genitals off Uh and says that they need to have it happen. I'd be like surely that's april fools No, no, that was my 31st That's really this is this is actually remarkable. I mean joe biden is 79 years old. He's almost 80 And he has suddenly an ardent trans rights for children Activists think about the way the left actually functions many of us were warning any american who would listen in 2020 Yeah, they have oh joe biden out here. I am no joke I love the choo choo the amtech you can trust me. I mean and it's this guy. It's just a trojan horse for the left folks He's gonna do you're gonna get as much ao see style policy as possible through the the lens of joe biden or with joe biden as the veneer the facade for all of this and here he is Speaking about transgender americans member of all ages because they really this is really about the kids play 12 To everyone celebrating transgender day of visibility. I want you to know that your president sees you Jill common the dug our entire administration sees you for who you are Made an image of god and deserving of dignity respect and support But we know it's hard when there are those out there who don't see you and don't respect you for example The onslaught of anti transgender state laws attacking you and your families is simply wrong This administration is standing up for you against all these hateful bills. There are any transgender american who's struggling Please know you're not alone parents and children alike. Please ask for help and know this You're so brave you belong and we have your back Okay, I just want to know what are these anti trans bills exactly because if it's an anti trans bill to say that Men shouldn't play in women's sports. The democrats should own that they should say that is it That is it, you know joe biden mister I'm the moderate who's going to unite the country should have to tell the american people going into this midterm election That he is in favor of biological males also known as men or you know biological boys Uh competing against females or girls. He should have to say that instead of saying it's hateful Okay, what's hateful about it? Let's actually talk the more people learn about the democrat aligned trans agenda the more the american people go Hold on a second and real question for you clay. I mean Do we think that biden could get more than two letters of the lgbtq ia plus acronym because I doubt it I think you could get two max, but now he's a big trans agenda hero. Give me a break Well, what's happened is and first of all when you hear biden speak Is it just me or does it sound at this point like he's slurring every single word and I know I texted I think you buck the the The teleprompter that they have for joe biden now Is like a movie screen When he's reading off of this teleprompter i've never seen a teleprompter that massive in my life I mean it it is scary what they need to put in front of him So that he's reading it and he would who's been around a person who's also at that stage of that stage of life Look, there's there's people age differently at different levels and but one thing I I do know is that it's also not linear And you know the difference between 65 and 70 for a lot of folks, you know 65 to 70 Pretty you know, I mean I know this from members of my own family You don't really see a difference once you get into the difference between you know 75 to 80 and 80 to 85 Just human beings you age more rapidly at that point and you know energy and things change We're all going there. I'm going there. I mean god. You know god willing. I'm going there clays going there We're all going to be there one day This guy's the president of the united states. I mean this he's the commander in chief There's a big war in europe right now. We got a wide open border. That's about to get worse We're going to talk about it This is the guy calling the shots clay. This is the best the democrat party can do It's kind of stunning when you really take a step back It's also stunning how quickly because by and large There's not really much of a battle over gay issues anymore And so democrats are desperate to try to find a wedge issue I mean this is the truth And so they are arguing that whatever tiny minority of the population that is transgender is being discriminated against when the reality is Many people are saying What I think the vast majority of americans would say is look I'm not going to get riled up about what adults decide to do when it comes to their genders But when you are requiring When you are requiring me to accept that a biological man Is allowed to suddenly compete against women That's the very destruction of women's athletics. That's the difference between hey You can be whatever gender you want But as soon as you're trying to argue you're the greatest women swimmer of all time or bike list or whatever else it might be I'm not going to stand for that. Ask yourself this question everybody right now In states like new york in california as part of this agenda Do you think that the democrat base and maybe even a majority of democrat voters in those states Would support the state taking a child away from one's parents If the parents did not do gender affirmation surgery I think there are a lot of people clay in the democrat left who would say yes If you won't do gender affirmation for a 13 year old You should the state should be able to take your kid away. I think this is where it's heading. I really do It's madness that we are allowing children We won't let anybody buy a beer until they're 21, but you can cut your genitals off when you're 12 It's child abuse up next to the border. This is clambock You Clay Travis and bucks exton on the front lines of truth"
