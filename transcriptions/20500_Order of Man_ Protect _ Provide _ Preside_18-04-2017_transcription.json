    "text": " If you are anything like me, you are a recovering nice guy, or maybe you're still a nice guy. A lot of men may hear that and wonder what's wrong with being nice. And there's nothing wrong with being nice until it comes at the expense of your own well-being. My guest today author of the book, No More Mr. Nice Guy, Dr. Robert Glover, joins me to talk about the myth of the nice guy, common negative symptoms the nice guy experiences, how to implement the healthy male rule, and how you can eliminate the nice guy once and for all. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. You boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Men, what's going on today? My name is Ryan Mickler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast, Order of Man. This is a brotherhood. This is an organization. It's a group of men, all dedicated to reclaiming what it means to be a man. Gentlemen, I am sure that you recognize just as much as I have that the world is in need of more and more men, more fathers to step up in their homes, more husbands to fulfill that role in a marriage, more virtuous leaders in business, stronger men in the community, just better men in general. So if you have a desire to be that kind of man, you are in the right place. If not, stick around and maybe by the end of the show, you will have a desire to be that kind of man. I've got a great one lined up for you today, like I always do, but I just want to give you a couple of quick announcements and then we'll get into this. First things first, if you would, I don't ask this very often, but it really does help. Please, if you would, leave us an iTunes rating and review. This is a great, relatively painless way for you to say thank you and spread the message of the order and also let the men in your lives know what it means to be a man and how you might be making improvements in your life. Second, make sure you join the almost 26,000 men now inside of our Facebook group. We're having some incredible, incredible conversations about masculinity, including the topic of today, which is that of being a nice guy. You can do that at facebook.com slash groups slash order of man. And third, if you're looking for something more than just this show or a couple of surface level type conversations, if you're looking to find a program that's going to help you build the life that you want as a man, I want you to consider joining our mastermind, the iron council. This is such an incredible brotherhood of men. I've been blown away with the caliber of men who have joined us already. It's great accountability to help you get where you want to be. So you can find out more about that at orderman.com slash iron council. Guys, I was only recently introduced to my guest work just a couple of months ago, but after reading his best selling book, it's also a controversial book. And if you've read it, you understand why it's no more Mr. Nice Guy. I knew, I knew that I had to get Dr. Glover on the show. This book spoke to me. I am a recovering nice guy myself as is Dr. Glover. And the strategies that he shares in the book saved my life and also saved my marriage roughly nine years ago. This man has helped thousands of nice guys transform from behaving like these passive victims that we see all over society today to empowered. And the term that he uses is integrated males. He's got books, online classes, courses, groups, workshops, all of them are designed to help men take a more assertive role in their lives. And today he's here to talk with us about overcoming the Nice Guy syndrome. Robert, thank you for joining me on the show today. Ryan is good to be with you. Thanks for the invitation. You bet. This is a conversation, a long time in the works, although we've just been recently connected. But I know a lot of the guys that listen to this podcast and read the blog are very interested in the work you're doing. I want to set some context for the discussion that we are going to have today about being a quote unquote Nice Guy. When I use that term and when you use that term, what are you referring to when it comes to being a nice guy? Okay, Ryan, when I when I use the word Nice Guy with a capital and in a capital G, I'm referring to a guy who has a belief system, a paradigm, a roadmap that says I've got to do it right. I've got to make everybody happy. I can't rock the boat. I can't make a mistake. It's a passively pleasing person who doesn't believe that he is just okay just as he is. He's either got to become what he expects other people, what he thinks other people want him to be and or hide things that he thinks other people might react negatively to. And I think this falls in line with what you refer to as the Nice Guy myth, which you alluded to, right, is being good means that I'll be accepted if I understand that correctly. Well, the Nice Guy's, we'll just kind of dive into this. One of the core concepts that I write about around Nice Guy's syndrome is that every Nice Guy, as I define it, tends to operate by three covert contracts. And these covert contracts, I'll take the form of an if and a then. And so if I do a then b should always happen. And Nice Guys have three fundamental covert contracts. The first one, number one, is if I'm a Nice Guy, everybody will like me and love me. And we can tack onto that. The people I desire to have sex with will desire to have sex with me. So if I'm nice, people will like me and love me. The second covert contract of Nice Guys is if I meet other people's needs without them having to ask, then they will meet my needs without me having to ask. So Nice Guys tend to be givers. We give a lot, we do a lot, we give surprises, we think if I do these nice things for other people, they'll appreciate me and then they'll give me back what I need. And then the covert contract number three is that if I do everything right, then I should have a smooth problem free world. And Nice Guys think, okay, if I connect all the dots, you know, across all the T's, dot all the I's, then everything should always work out okay. You know, my boss shouldn't get upset at me, my girlfriend shouldn't dump me, I shouldn't get sick, my car shouldn't break down. And Nice Guys really do believe these three core contracts with the world, with the universe, with women, with everybody should work. But the problem is, they're all built on false assumptions. And maybe the biggest, the two biggest problems are, often the Nice Guy doesn't even know what his contracts are that he's operating out of these covert contracts that are all about giving to get. And nobody else around them knows that the contracts exist. So they don't even know what was expected of them. Right. You know, it's really fascinating. I'm listening to you talk about this and the fact that a quote unquote Nice Guy doesn't even know about these things. It's actually, I hear these covert contracts. And I think isn't this obvious, but apparently, it's not, I mean, you've been in this field of work for a long time. How do we get to this stage where we think this way, because this goes against all that I believe. And maybe I've just developed a certain belief system of my own over time, how do we get to this stage of being a Nice Guy? We all have internal belief systems and becoming a nice guy probably starts out the same way that the rest of us all develop our world paradigm. When we are young, we're completely and totally dependent on our caregivers. And none of us are born into perfect families with perfect parents or into a perfect world. You know, maybe there's, I mean, any number of issues that might occur when we're children and often, if nobody's fault, maybe you're born and you're sick or needy or you know, your mother's depressed or your dad's, you know, off working or dad isn't there or you have a sick sibling that needs your parents attention and you're kind of neglected or, you know, maybe there's addiction in your family. Who knows? Maybe there's rigid rela, relig, religiosticity can't even spit the word out. You know, but the thing is, we all are born to imperfect parents. And what happens with all children, all children are by nature narcissistic. They believe they are the center of the world. Now they don't think this, they're just wired that way. Sure. And a lot of this has to do with just human evolution that, human beings have a long maturation process, meaning that as, you know, some species of animals, you know, as soon as the baby pops out, they're on their own. Right. With humans, we need someone to take care of us for most of us, at least into our teenage years. And because of that, we are very dependent on our caregivers. And the state of our caregivers determines the state of our well being. So all children, when they have either a negative or painful experience, whether it's an abandonment, whether they're hungry and don't get fed soon enough, or they're diapers dirty and they don't get changed, or, you know, mom's anxious or dad yells or, you know, any number of things, children always internalize, I caused that. That's my fault. That's on me. Now they don't think this because the human brain doesn't, as probably most of us know, doesn't develop a verbal ability till, you know, two years old or so, and doesn't start differentiating self from others to around two. We tend to call that the terrible twos, which is, which is a terrible name. And maybe we'll talk more about that because it has to do with our ability to differentiate as a self and to know what we want and to go after that in life. But also the brain, say, in the average male, doesn't finish developing till around age 25. But what is online in our operating system is a very primal part of our brain centered around the brainstem called the amygdala. And when things happen to us, the amygdala is the part of our brain wired in for self-preservation is the fight, flight, freeze part of ourselves. So that part is completely online when we're born. So it gets activated by anything that feels like it could be a possible threat to us. And depending on our genetic temperament, some of us tend to fight, some of us tend to run, some of us tend to just cower and freeze. Okay, as children, we don't like these negative feelings. So all of us develop at least two types of defense mechanisms. The first one is to try to cope with the negative feelings that we're having. We try to do something to make ourselves feel better. Maybe we cry, maybe we quit crying, maybe we suck our thumb. Maybe, you know, we do various things to try to soothe and comfort ourselves. The second thing that we try to do is we try to come up with a strategy. Now, remember, most of this is before we can even have an analytical brain. We just have an emotional brain. Right. So we just want to eliminate that negative emotion and encourage the positive emotions. And we want to prevent those negative things from happening in the future. So everybody develops this two-sided roadmap of life. We do X to try to feel better when we feel bad. And we do Y to try to prevent the things from happening in the future that made us feel bad now. I see. And as I said, we developed this roadmap, this strategy, these defense mechanisms, before our analytical brain even comes online. So what happens, these responses are very much wired into that emotional part of our brain, that primitive part. And then as the rest of our reasoning brain, our prefrontal cortex comes online and continues to develop into our early 20s, that primitive part of our brain is wired into, is hard-wired into the prefrontal cortex. So it tends to influence all of our decision-making as children, teenagers, and adults. So we often don't know why we reacted to this when our boss had that look on his face or why a certain type of woman turns us on. Or why if we get rejected, we're devastated for so we don't know why, but it's deeply wired into our emotions. And then we kind of keep falling back to do those things that we learn to try to prevent the pain or soothe the pain when it's there and try to prevent it from happening in the future. One pattern for doing that is to be a nice guy, that is to try to never do anything that might upset your parents, to be needless and wantless. So you don't get negative responses to your needs, is trying never to rock the boat, trying to always perform well, so you'll get approval. I mean, any number of manifestations of that pattern. And if you look, if you grew up in a family and had more than one sibling or more than just you, you probably saw various patterns in your siblings of how they coped and some might have been similar to yours and some might have been very different from yours. You might have, if you were kind of the complacent, go along to get a long child. You might have had a brother or sister that was the rebellious raising hell. Fuck you, I'll do what I want. You can't control me. It sounds like you know my family dynamic growing up. I've seen a lot of similar dynamic. I'm sure you have. So how does a man go about recognizing this in himself? Because you talk about paradigms. And I think sometimes we subscribe to these paradigms or use them as coping or survival mechanisms like you talk about. And it would be very difficult for us to recognize that we can actually change the way we think and therefore behave. You know, most of us are not really good at looking inward at ourselves. I mean, whether we call this self evaluation, consciousness, present moment awareness, most of us are not real good at it. We're kind of on the inside being driven by impulses and thought processes that we don't evaluate. We just assume every thought and impulse and reaction we have is appropriate. And everybody would respond this way because we're feeling it. And so for most of us, it isn't until we get really stuck or something just comes unraveled on us or what we're doing isn't working and we've just been trying to do more of the same of it, get it to work. It usually takes some kind of just severe stuckness or crisis or something breaks. And then maybe we go looking for some answers. Without maybe even knowing it, we go looking for some awareness to help us understand what's happening or we go looking for more tools to put in our toolbox to help us handle. And what I found with the most of the men who find me, they tend to find me at maybe about one of three different junctures in life. One, and this is often true with the younger men, is when they're really frustrated with dating, when they just can't seem to get women's attention or they're just too shy or anxious around women and, you know, never get out of their comfort zone or, you know, what women, you know, maybe they do interact with, they end up in the friend zone. And so for some guys, it really is they just don't know how to find a mate, they don't know how to find love and get laid. So they go looking for answers. And that's where some men find me. Other men find me when their relationships just are not working very well. And that's really when I started discovering my own nice guy patterns is when I just kept trying harder and harder and harder to please the woman I was with. And she just seemed to be unhappy. I couldn't do enough. I couldn't do it right. I couldn't predict her moods and emotions. It was never good enough. She never wanted to have sex, even though she'd been highly sexual before. We got married after we got married. It was like, you know, we'd go months without it and she'd be hostile towards me if I wanted it. And I'm just thinking, you know, what's wrong with this picture? Right. Just as a side, it was when I started working on those issues of when I started going to therapy, mainly to figure out why me being a nice guy didn't make my wife treat me better. And I started getting some insight into my paradigm. I'm by training a marriage and family therapist. So in my practice, I started noticing a lot of men coming in with their wives or girlfriends saying the exact same things I was saying. I'm a nice guy. I'm so much better than the jerk she used to be with. You know, I treat her well. I raise her kids. You know, I don't cheat on her. You know, I, you know, I'm good to her, but it's never enough. She's never happy. She's always depressed. She's always angry. You know, she never wants to have sex. Man, I can finish these guy sentences for them. And that's when I started realizing I wasn't alone. Maybe we can talk more about that a little bit if you want of how that led to me writing the book. But then the third time, third kind of point in life where a lot of men seem to come to me is often at the end of a long term relationship. Maybe they're in their 40s or 50s, been married 20 something years. Maybe their kids are about grown or grown. And finally, they or their wife pull, you know, just, you know, pull the string on and get divorced. And here they are, you know, they've been married for years. They don't know what went wrong. They don't know how to go out and start over and start relationships. They know they could, you know, they know there's so much more open to them. So a lot of guys kind of when they, well, like a divorce or an end of a relationship and kind of mid-life stage, a lot of men find me at that time as well. Yeah, I mean, this makes sense because I know for me, you said we a couple of times as in you are maybe a recovering nice guy, which you've alluded to. And I can definitely fall into that camp as well. I talked with a lot of the guys that listened to this podcast about my separation with my wife, which was roughly nine years ago. And it was, and you can attest to this and because of the work that you're doing, it was literally the darkest time in my life. But I needed that to realize that I had placed so much emphasis on everybody but myself and was really fascinating to me is when I went to work on myself and quote unquote became maybe a little bit selfish. It was very fascinating to see how my wife responded to that. I'd like to get your take on this idea of being selfish because I assume a nice guy doesn't want to be selfish and he wants to be pleasing and serving to other people. But I think there's a healthy balance. Yeah, if you want to manipulate a nice guy to get him to do what you want, call him selfish. Because you know, oh, no, no, I'm not selfish. Remember those cobra contracts? I do this, I do this, I do this. You know, I'm not selfish. And we don't want to perceive of ourselves or be seen by others in a negative way. And in our culture, the word selfish pretty much only gets used when people want them to manipulate somebody else to do what they want. And I talk in the book that I tell guys, hey, when I look up the word selfish in the dictionary, I want to see your picture. Now, what I'm talking about, and I'm not talking about, you know, the asshole that only cares about himself and doesn't give a fuck about anybody else. I'm talking about a mature, individuated adult who has a healthy self interest in themselves. And they've surrounded themselves, I call them cooperative reciprocal systems. We've surrounded ourselves with other people, with professionals, with organizations, in which everybody involved get something of value out of it. With our friends, there's a give and take, we enjoy being with them, they enjoy being with us, and love relationship, we're both getting something out of it of value, or we wouldn't be there. You and I have a reciprocal relationship right now, you're getting something out of it, I'm getting something out of it, your listeners will get something out of it. Maybe my book sales will get something out of it. It's a reciprocal relationship. And we have these with our doctors, our accountants, our attorneys, our trainer at the gym, as long as everybody's getting something of value and it's very overt, that works well. That's being selfish. That's having a healthy self interest. And the funny thing is, contrary to the nice guy paradigm, see, nice guys seem to be pretty empty, because we're walking around with this covert contract waiting for somebody else to fill us up. We're emptying the bucket out for everybody else, but we're not putting anything back in. And maybe we haven't surrounded ourselves with other people to help put something back in the bucket. And here's a little secret. Nice guys are terrible receivers. We are not very good at letting people give to us or do things for us. We feel guilty, we feel indebted, we feel like people are going to be think we're bad, or I mean, all kinds of negative stuff comes up for nice guys when it comes to receiving. So but here's the paradox. If you are, I call it creating your great cake of a life. If you're out there doing good things for yourself connecting with men, pursuing your passions, getting to the gym on a regular basis, you have some kind of self awareness, self improvement, spiritual practice in your life, you're giving your gift to the world, you're going to be a really attractive man. And that has nothing to do with your physical features, even though it does affect your physical features and how your face looks, how you stand, how you walk out of how you carry yourself, people will find that really attractive without them even knowing you or knowing why they're attracted to you. Yeah, the other side of the things, if I can real quick is, I think this is a common thread within the book is this idea, because you go through a couple of case studies, quite a few actually, and it seems like the underlying thread is that the women in these types of relationships with nice guys feel overwhelmed, they feel swamped because it's not like this man wants necessarily to be in this relationship. It's like he needs to be, and therefore this woman in this case seems like she's now the caretaker of this child. I guess is how I would say it. Yeah, you've hit the nail on the head. And of course, every nice guy is different, every relationship dynamic is different. But one of the analogies I use, people that are closer to my age will remember this. I don't remember what year it was, but remember when Ross Perot was running for president, and he kept referring, he had this kind of characteristic thing, he said, you hear that big loud sucking sound, he said, that's the federal government sucking money out of your pocket. And I use that analogy for nice guys when they approach relationship. It's this big sucking sound, because they're so empty inside, it creates this vacuum, and like you said, we need to create this co-dependent relationship with another so that as we take care of them, we'll be taking care of. And I'm a straight guy, and most of the men I've worked with in counseling are straight, but I've worked with a number of gay guys as well. But so I usually refer to the male female interaction, but it's the same. If we're approaching somebody from this place of emptiness, oftentimes the other person can feel that, they don't know what it is they feel. And I know a lot of times women especially can be really perceptive to that, those negative feelings that comes from that big old sucking sound of the emptiness of the man. And what happens for a lot of nice guys is we develop this internal belief system, oh, women just aren't attracted to me. And we think it's something physical about us, or we're boring, or we're losers, and they can see it. But one of the core things is, we're just not bringing anything to the table, we're just bringing that big, empty sucking sound that most women or most people of the opposite sex, whether we're straight or gay or whoever we're approaching, it'll feel negative to them. And even if they think we're a nice person, they'll want to push that away. And then we think, oh, see, everybody can see what a loser I am. I don't know what your experience was with your ex-wife, but I found that a lot of guys after they split and start taking care of themselves, maybe go to a men's group, they start getting to the gym, they start rediscovering the path, they're getting to the passions they'd given up to be in the relationship, and maybe start spending more time with men, maybe take a little road trip or two. And then all of a sudden, they start looking like this really attractive guy to the ex, and especially if you tell her no a time or two. Then you look even more attractive to them. And then we're going, what's going on here? Why didn't she have this interest in me back when I wanted to be with her? Well, I can tell you, fortunately, my wife and I salvaged our marriage, and we have been married. 13 years. And congratulations. Thank you. Yeah, in large part to me not needing her, and her not needing me, and us being able to stand on our own two feet without each other. Yeah, that's healthy interdependency. That's way different than codependency, or another term for it is borrowed functioning. You know, where we just kind of lean on each other so much, because we can't stand on our own, and we just wear each other out, and we don't bring anything to the party. And so the other person gets bored with us, and we all get resentful with each other, because we think the other person isn't doing what they're supposed to do to make us happy, and then we just pick at each other. So yeah, I've been there. I've done that. Yeah, so I was going to ask you the question of how do you begin to bring something to the table, but after hearing you reframe this a little bit, I don't think it's about bringing something to the table. I think it's just about being yourself and filling your own cup. Am I understanding this correctly? Yeah, and as you do that, you've got something to offer other people, and not just intimate relationship, put to your friends and to the world as well. When you're filling your cup up, and kind of living in your authentic self, and doing what feels right to you, giving your gift to the world, leaning into challenges, it's going to make you an attractive person. Now I'm 61 years old as we talk. I try to take care of myself. I exercise, I'm good to myself, and I just got married in November. And it's my third triad, and I'm thinking I stumbled in finally to what I was trying to stumble into other times before. But for example, my wife is 22 years younger than me, and I didn't go looking for a younger woman. In fact, I wasn't even looking for her. She told me the first time she saw me, she saw me walking up the street, and she said she felt immediately attracted to me. Interesting. Just how I was walking up the street towards where she was standing, and she felt an immediate attraction. My experience has been, as I dated on and off over say about the last, I got divorced from my second ex-wife in 2003. It's over the last 14 years or so. I consistently heard women tell me, and by the way, most of the women attracted to me seem to be significantly younger than me. I don't go looking for them. I don't have an ego thing around that. Women my own age don't seem to see me, I guess. And these women always tell me they were attracted to just something, they just felt something the way I walked. They'll say, you're shaved head or your hands, and I'm thinking, wait a minute, you didn't just like decided you wanted to be with me because you like my hands and my hair. There's plenty of guys that have good hands and a shaved head, right? Or walk the way I walk. It's not really those things. I really think is more energetic than that, that when you're comfortable in your own skin, and you walk on the planet at peace with yourself, and you're bringing a gift to the world around you, and you've got an energy about you, people will be attracted to that. And they may not even know why. They'll put a name on it, but who knows? It's energetic. Gentlemen, let me take a quick pause to tell you briefly about our exclusive Mastermind, the Iron Council.

Now let's get back to the conversation with Dr. Glover. I want to jump back to the win-win conversation we were having a couple of minutes ago. One of the things that you had said inside of these, I think I'm saying the term correctly, the cooperative reciprocal systems. Did I say that right? Yeah, I turned it around every which way as well. Okay. I can never remember when I've written it. How did I write it? So yeah, so whether it's cooperative reciprocal systems or reciprocal cooperative systems or systems of cooperative reciproc... Yeah, we all get it, right? You got the word right. So I want to talk about creating win-wins and one of the things the terms that you used was over, just making sure that everybody understands and is on the same page. This is obviously a communication conversation we're having now. How does somebody who may be passive or even passive aggressive, which I assume nice guys are, both of those become more assertive in what he might need in a relationship, whether that's with a boss or a coworker or an intimate relationship? Well, I will say how it began for me and it began for me in therapy. Really, what therapy is, it's an act of going to another person and saying, I need something and I'm going to pay you to help me get that. And we may not even know what it is. Maybe we need understanding or insight or new skill sets or acceptance or the feeling of being loved and valued, you know, and maybe all of those things. And for me, it was actually a fairly slow process of basically beginning to show up and, okay, I'm paying good money for this hour or I'm paying good money for these two hours of a group that I'm in and starting to take up some space and make my needs known and accept what other people gave me, even though I was paying for it, as I said, nice guys are really bad receivers and I'm speaking from personal experience. So for me, it began in therapy and it began with me saying, I'm going to go pay somebody and spend time taking good care of me. And since then, I've hired personal trainers or the past personal golf coach, golf swing coaches or personal, I've hired accountants. And so basically, it really begins with you making your own needs a priority and starting to do good things for you and then consciously starting to surround yourself with people who are available to give to you, whether you're paying them or you just notice whenever you're with them, you and them seem to have a good time and enjoy it. For me, it began with just making a decision. I'm going to go pay somebody to give to me. And then I just started doing that more and more. And for example, in some of my online classes that I teach, one of the most common assignments that I will give people is to ask three people a day to do something for you that you can do yourself. Interesting. That's one of those breaking through type assignments you talk about in the book, I believe. Yeah. And is involved you doing something out of your comfort zone and then listening to those voices that scream at you and then pay attention. What are those voices saying actually? Oh, you can't do that or you can do it yourself or people think you're lazy or people think you're selfish or people are too busy. They don't have time. So then all of a sudden those deep emotional memories that got stored at when we're young will start screaming at us when we make a conscious decision to step out of the paradigm to do a very conscious act that goes 180 degrees opposite of our paradigm. So this is going to the notion of facing your fears, right? Doing things that are uncomfortable, doing things that are outside of your comfort zone, what you talk about as being a huge step towards becoming or I should say becoming more assertive or less of that nice guy, right? It is essential. One of the most life-changing books I've ever read, I read it when I was going through my first divorce and I say it saved my life. There's a book called Feel the Fear and Do It Anyway by Susan Jeffers. I mean, I have such fond affection for this woman. She passed away of cancer just a few years ago and I never met her, never talked to her, tried to find her address to send her an email, never could. But man, I give this woman credit for just shifting my life because she basically says in this book, she talks about three levels of fear and whether it's a fear of I'll be embarrassed or fear I'm going to get sick or fear that I'm going to lose something important to me or fear I'm going to die. She says at the core of all fears is a core belief that I can't handle it. I can't handle being embarrassed. I can't handle getting rejected. I can't handle somebody being mad at me. I can't handle getting sick or I can't handle, you know, the idea of dying. And there's enough in the book that, you know, she talks about how to work with that but a takeaway for me was just an internal mantra that no matter what happens, I'll handle it. And I've been repeating that for 30 years and a core thing that she talks about as long as you're alive and challenging yourself, i.e. growing as a human being, you're going to have fear. It's never going to go away. And one thing with nice guys, we don't like to feel afraid. We have a fairly low tolerance for frustration and anxiety. So we tend to play it safe and do what worked last time but nothing ever changes in our life. And the most significant changes come when we just start doing the little things that scare us. And I've made that my personal road map since I turned 40. So for 21 years now, if it scares me, I think, okay, what do I need to do to lean into this thing? I don't want this thing controlling me. It sounds like what I'm hearing you say when you talk about this is that nice guys probably tend to be very controlling and even attempt to control things outside of their control, which I'm sure causes a lot of frustration. You're talking about being more spontaneous and just letting things go in a way, it sounds like. Yeah, I guess you know me. That's how I'd work on that. Like I said, I'm on my third marriage, my third family, and for some reason, everybody that knows me, including my mother and my granddaughter, who's 10, tend to refer to me as being controlling. And I always say, no, I'm not controlling. I just like things the way I like them. But the big difference is I don't try to control anybody else. I used to. I used to with my covert contracts. That subtle manipulation or not so subtle, as you mentioned, leads a lot of passive aggressiveness. It can lead to something that my ex-wife used to refer to as victim pukes, where you think, hey, I've done my share of the contract you haven't been doing yours. I've been resentful about this for months. Now, I'm going to puke out every resentment I have, you know, and you're not going to even know where it's all coming from or why. So yes, nice guys do tend to be controlling, even though that's kind of like the word selfish, we think, oh, don't say I'm controlling. That makes me a bad person. Probably we're all controlling in some form or another. And yeah, I think that some of the important lessons in life are learning to let go of control of what we don't have control over and take charge of what we do have some control over. For me, that might mean, well, facing some fears. I can't control the outcome, but I can control my choice and how I deal with it. And even though some people may say you're controlling to try to manage you and get you to do what they want, the truth is when you live life on your terms and say, okay, I'm doing it my way. And it'll either work or it won't work. In my experience, it just goes a hell of a lot better than trying to, you know, lick your finger and hold it up and see which way the wind's blowing and try to do it everybody else's way. That never works. So even if that comes across is looking like, well, you're a little bit controlling or you know, you always got to have it your way. I'm actually a very generous, flexible person, but it begins by asking myself, what do I want? What's important to me? What feels right to me? And then doing it. And that's actually my definition of maturity or integrity or differentiation. I use the same definition for all those three terms is asking yourself, what do I want? What's important to me? What feels right to me? And then doing it, even when you get resistance from the outside, i.e. people telling you you're controlling yourself ish or resistance from the inside between your own ears of saying, oh, you know, you're being selfish or you're going to piss some people off or somebody's going to be disappointed with you. You got to do it on your terms. There's no other way to do it. And I think one of the things that I really liked about the book you talked about towards the end, and I think this ties into what we're talking about here is the healthy male rule, which is a very simple question essentially that I think will help you move forward with a maybe more of a clear path when you do come up against some of this resistance. Do you mind going through that? Actually, I haven't read my book in 15 years. I'll tell you what it says. There's almost no one happens. Okay, well, what is the healthy male rule? What did I say? Essentially, the question is, what would a healthy male do? That's the question. Oh, exactly. That's a great question to ask. What would a healthy male do? And I do ask myself that. And I usually ask myself one of two questions when I feel stuck or afraid, is I'll ask, what would a healthy male do? And I will ask myself, if I had no fear in this situation, what would I do? And it's amazing how simple and quickly the answers often come when you just ask. If I had no fear, well, what would a healthy male do in this situation? The answer is usually right there. It's just our anxiety, our fear, our shame is blocking us from just accessing it as easily as it is. Right, right. Well, Robert, this is a fascinating discussion. We aren't even, we've talked about a lot. We've gone a lot of different places, but I know there's so much more to this. And I've applied a lot of it in my life and still have a lot to go. As we wind down on time, I want to ask you a couple of additional questions. The first one being, what does it mean to be a man? You told me ahead of time you were going to ask that question. And I haven't even thought about it until you asked about the healthy male rule. I want to tell a story, if I can, to answer it. And it's not even what is a story about me peripherally. But here's the story. I'm going to guess 10 or so years ago, maybe a little longer ago than that. I was with a buddy and we were at a 4th of July celebration in Tacoma, Washington. I lived in that area at the time. And they closed off the main street along the waterfront. They had air shows, they had booths with food, fireworks at night. So about 200,000 people during the day and night show up for this freedom fest in Tacoma. And I was walking with my buddy. It was actually a warm, sunny day in July, which is actually kind of unusual in Seattle, believe it or not. And we're walking along, just talking. And it's just, it's crowded. A lot of people in the street that were closed off. And we came up on a group of teenage boys. I don't know how old they were, 15, 16, not real old. And there was two boys, kind of with their their 5th up, kind of circling each other, kind of, you know, squaring off with each other. And my friend and I walked up on that. And there were several, I mean, it was quite a quite a fairly large group of people standing around kind of watching this thing. And nothing was really happening. And kind of from my own internal point of view, I've watched and one of the boys looked a little bit tougher and more aggressive. And it looked like he had several buddies with him. The other guy looked somewhat more scared and anxious. But maybe it was a situation he just figured, okay, I'm taking enough. I can't back down. But like I said, they hadn't really come to blows, but they were circling each other with their 5th up. And I'm with my buddy. And I didn't even know what to do. You know, there's a lot of gangs in the area. You don't know what you're going to walk in the middle of. And so I was just standing there. And I can tell they really didn't want to fight. Otherwise, they probably would have already been fighting. And they're both posturing. And about that time, an African American man about my height, about six foot tall, with his like two year old daughter up on his shoulders, you know, straddling his shoulders, he's holding her hands and she's sitting on his shoulders. He just comes walking up as calm as he could be, walks right between the two boys and said, you guys break this up and get out of here. And just and just keeps on walking. And both boys had a look of relief on their face like, Oh, fuck, we don't have to fight. We haven't out now. And the guy just kept walking and the boys, you know, took off different directions. And I looked at my buddy and I said, I want to be like that guy. He just defined for me what I want to be like, what that healthy male looks like that. I mean, he didn't get aggressive. He had his little daughter on his shoulders, but he was clear. He was direct. He did exactly what needed to be done in that situation. And believe it or not, I think it tears in my eyes when when I relive that and, you know, talk about it, because to me, it's like, I don't know where he came from or where he went. Maybe he didn't even exist. I don't know. But he changed my life. And for me, to be a man is a person who in every situation is conscious, is present, takes action. And in some way, makes the world a better place for him having been there. Such a powerful story, such a powerful nation. I love it. I love it. Great. Well, Robert, how do we connect with you?
