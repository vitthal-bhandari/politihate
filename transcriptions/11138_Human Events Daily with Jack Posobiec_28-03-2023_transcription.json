Hi, my name is Chad Scruggs and I am a new pastor here at Covenant Press. My family and I are delighted to be in the Nashville area. I grew up just north of here in Hendersonville, Tennessee. My wife grew up in West Tennessee and Jackson, but many of our friends and a lot of our family are back here in Middle Tennessee. So we're thrilled to be here. We have four kids, four delightful kids, young kids. John Randall is 11 years old. Charlie is nine. Carter is seven. Howdy is five. Just thrilled to be here and to see what the Lord has for us and for this church family in the years to come. Rifle first. Rifle first blue go go go go go go. Go. Move move move. I'm with you. Go. Shut up. I got\u00fcow! Okay, go. And 2nd floor. No, no stairs, no stairs, don't... Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! Ready? Go, go, go, go, go! Keep pushing! Go, go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! There you go, roggi! It's coming in, that's right. Right, right, right! Push it out PBL. Push it out PBL. Go right. Move! Move! Our investigations tell us that she was a former student at the school. I don't know what grade she's attended or grades, but we do firmly believe she was the student there. She does identify as trained student. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard today's edition of Human Events Daily. Our show here is powered in the point you will say. Today is the third of March, excuse me, March 28, 328, 2023 on the top. We've just experienced, this country has just experienced, in what a Christian school down in Nashville has just experienced. It's known as the Trans Day of Vengeance. Christian school massacred in broad daylight by a deranged individual carrying out some kind of sick plan. The media is telling us that this was done in response to legislation passed by the Tennessee Governor Governor Lee, which then led to the targeting of this school. Libby Emmons, the editor-in-chief of the post-millennial and Human Events is here with us to help break down these horrific events. Libby, I'd like to ask you the question. How did we get here? How did we get to the point where Christian children are being massacred in schools on what we're told is the Trans Day of Vengeance? How has this come to America? I think that everyone wants to blame someone else. You have the leftists want to blame conservatives for what they call trans genocide. Conservatives wanting to blame the left for this insane gender identity indoctrination that's been going on our kids. Can I ask you about that? What exactly is trans genocide? Because I see there's a page for it. I see there's this comment out there. This trans anti-trans visibility, trans-visibility, trans-vengence movement. What is this trans genocide? Because I haven't seen this going on in the United States. Are there transgender camps of some sort that I must have missed? What is this? Yeah, you haven't really missed anything, Jack. In fact, trans genocide, the concept of trans genocide is actually a lie. Trans genocide is not happening. There are not hundreds of transgender individuals being rounded up and slaughtered. There is not a brutal movement opposing their existence. There is not a murderous rampage being done in society where these people are being rounded up and eliminated. That's just not happening. Instead, what we are seeing is that there are trans people who are murdered, just like there are lots of other people who are murdered. There is not even a high percentage of trans individuals who are murdered. Primarily, when you have murders of trans people, these are people who are engaged in sex work. A lot of these tragic incidents are a result of domestic violence. What they have taken are incidents of crime. We are coming up with a break. What they have taken is taking these incidents of crime that may have involved a transgender person that happens to every group in America. Crime is terrible. They have said that there is actually a political movement behind it. They created a conspiracy theory for incidents to say that there is a political movement in America that somehow supporting these crimes. That is now apparently as we are seeing it seems as though this horrific incident down in Tennessee, this massacre was perpetuated by someone who may have believed in this trans genocide conspiracy theory and then acted out in response. We are told that there were writings found in the car, a manifesto that was found in the home has not yet been released. There are reports that the FBI may have confiscated that from the local police. I think we should see that in full, obviously. We do know that there are children who were killed this week that were massacred and they were Christian children. This was not a massacre. Some TikTok influencers or something like that. No, it was Christian children who were completely innocent to include, by the way, the pastor of the school. That is what we played in the cold open there. His own daughter was murdered by this individual, potentially targeted by this individual. We are also told that this is one of the more conservative congregations, Presbyterian congregation that was targeted here. There are a lot of questions. There is a lot out there. Stay tuned everybody. We are going to come back right after this break. We are back to the news. We are calling for a transgender day of vengeance. In fact, there was a statement and I have got it here from the trans resistance action. No, no, no, no, no. Trans resistance network. I know Libby, you were looking at this statement as well. They have essentially put this out saying that while they denounce the act, they say we point out that today's incident in Nashville is not one tragedy, but two. The first tragedy is the lost of the three children and the adults, but the second and more complex tragedy is that Aiden or Aubrey, I think it's actually Audrey Hale, who felt he had no other effect. I'm going to make sure to use the right pronouns there, felt that he had no other effective way to be seen than to lash out than by taking the life of others and by consequence himself. So we'll check. Nowhere in this statement, do they mention a single name of one of the martyrs who was killed today in Nashville or killed yesterday in Nashville? Nowhere in this, they talk about trans, they talk about anxiety, depression, PTSD, etc. And they're also saying, we remind the last line. This is, this is incredible. We remind the news media to respect the self identified pronouns of transgender individuals who come across your desk, aid in Hale's self identified with he him pronouns on forward facing sites. We urge you to avoid pandering to those individuals on the right who will use this. How dare you? How dare you misgender a transgender terrorist? How dare you? That, you know, he, of course, may have killed all of these children, but don't you dare go in and commit an even worse tragedy than misgendering this terrorist. Libby, I'm sorry. I'm reading this thing. That's insane. That's completely insane. Yeah. I mean, you know about the person, what and, and, and, and how, how is this happening? Yeah, we know that Hale was an artist identified as transgender. I do think that it's a tragedy for Hale's life for Hale's family that this. Happened that this is what she decided to do. I do think that that's a tragedy for her mother. And I think that every mother can, can relate to that, you know, and I do think that that matters. But I don't think that her actions should overshadow the tragedy that she enacted on everybody else in Nashville and, you know, on these children specifically and their families. It's really a horror. And of course, this is not the kind of rhetoric that we ever see coming from. You know, when you, when you see the Buffalo shooter, that was a horrifying. You know, incident, could you imagine anybody coming out and starting to discuss the tragedy that he enacted on his own family and himself. You know, you would never see anything like that. It's ludicrous. Yeah, this bill that was passed by Governor Lee, as you mentioned banning drag shows for kids and banning the medical mutilation of minors in service to gender ideology. This is something that the trans movement is pushing so hard. They really want there to be trans kids. And whenever we speak up and politicians and people in the media and doctors speak up and say, Hey, leave these kids alone. Let them grow up whole. Perhaps they'll make choices when they're adults and those can be their adult choices, but children will not. What's that? Do we know? Do we know specifically if this person was, you know, was undergoing any of these procedures, the ones that you're talking about? We know that some of the harm. I don't think that's been revealed. I think that what are some of the phones that would be used and would just Osterone be one of. Yeah, so typically what happens if you are female and you decide that you want to try and appear as the opposite sex and be recognized. By, you know, by the public as the opposite sex, because you can't actually change your sex. All you can really do is try to appear as the opposite sex. And I feel fully that when people say that they want to live as a man or live as a woman, what they want is for society to treat them the way that they see other men and women being treated. It seems so aesthetic and an outside in process where these feelings come from. So what you would do is you would take testosterone. These could be shots, I think, is how testosterone typically is taken. There's also testosterone creams that can be used. These have a really detrimental impact on women at first women who take testosterone feel a great measure of confidence, which my guess is that lots of men relate to and say, yeah, testosterone gives a lot of confidence. But that doesn't last. And there are really, really deteriorating health effects from taking testosterone, including uterine and vaginal atrophy and problems with bone density. Well, in addition to that, testosterone and studies important this out, testosterone certainly increases aggression. And that men deal with through the early stages of their life, some better than others. But we also understand that there's a lot of fist fights, there's a lot of pushing and shoving. I got a two-year-old and a four-year-old, right? I'm going to grab that toy and you'll use that physical reaction to it, but then even throughout a lesson, getting into high school, et cetera. But as you get older, and something that even Jordan Peterson talks about, that men understand that all male-to-male interactions have a subtext of violence. That we understand that violence could be an option, yet it's something that we've learned to deal with. That's largely driven by this spiritual and biological urge that's within men to be the defenders, to be the physical aggressor in some cases, if needed. But on the biological side, that's obviously driven by testosterone. And so this idea that you can give this hormone to someone who already has some of these engendered dysphoria still classified as a mental disorder, that these imbalances that we don't even know what's going on. Hold on one second, Libby, we'll be right back. We've got to cut to a commercial break because I want to remind everybody that as the parallel economy continues to grow, we've seen a ton of conservative coffee companies. They've gone and look, I held off because I wanted to wait for one that I really liked and I'm so happy to tell you that I have found that one. It's called blackout coffee. It's not enough to simply taste green. You want to be proud to support the company knowing that they align with your conservative values. That's why I'm telling you to give them a try. Now, I've got my blackout coffee sticker. I got my mug. I'm telling you, I love this stuff. We can't even keep it in the house. That's why I'm so proud to personally recommend it to you. Blackout Coffee. It's a coffee company. 100% committed to conservative values from sourcing the beans to the roasting process, customer support and shipping. Blackout Coffee has got an incredible work ethic and will accept no compromise on taste or quality. How do you get some with the link in description? It's blackout coffee.com. You're not going to be able to get some of the best of your customers. You're going to be able to get some of the best of your customers. You're going to be able to get some of the best of your customers. You're going to be able to get some of the best of your customers. You're going to be able to get some of the best of your customers. You're going to be able to get some of the best of your customers. You're going to be able to get some of the best of your customers. There's a Wikipedia article that's like huge. It's like a 15,000 word Wikipedia article on this thing. And they've got, you know, Brazil and the United States, Nazi Germany, all sorts of craziness. And what is actually going on? That's what I can see on and then on Twitter, you also see this. It's like, I just propaganda. Stop transgenocide. Stop transgenocide. Pictures of rifles. Pictures of people getting armed. The Trans Day of Vengeance. But okay, that's essentially, I look at it the same way that I would look at ISIS propaganda. And then they tie these bills into it with Governor Lee. They tie the hormone, you know, the blocking of hormones for minors. And there's a hole, by the way, if we had more time, I'd get into this, this idea that because we as we have a spiritual and biological urge to reproduce, but if you can't physically reproduce, then you must reproduce through indoctrination and pharmaceutical cocktails like this. And so what they're the only way for someone to enact that is to indoctrinate children and put them into these procedures. They're actually, they're acting those inherent urges. But let me give us the facts. What's actually going on when it comes to, okay, so there have been transgenders murdered, right? And we're not going to shy away from that or say that it hasn't happened. But what happens in those cases with actually happening with those cases? So in 2022, I believe the number was 34 transgender individuals who were killed in the United States. And I took a look at all of the names that were put out by the Human Rights Campaign. All of these transgender individuals, just to check out and see what the local reporting was on these homicides. In many of the cases, it was a result of domestic violence. Other cases were the result of physical altercations, fights, things like this, drug use, play to roll, and also prostitution, play to roll in a lot of these deaths. And many of the deaths also were not solved. But it seemed like the person was involved in a kind of lifestyle that can contribute to more violence as sad as that is. Also, you mentioned Brazil and Brazil is hugely important in this conversation because many of the numbers that have come out about the prevalence of murders of transgender people originated in Brazil. And these were entirely sex workers who were murdered in Brazil as part of that occupation. These were men who were posing as women who were murdered while engaging in prostitution. So the numbers that you see coming out from Human Rights Watch and when you hear the President even talk about violence against trans people and trans genocide and all of this stuff, you have to remember very fully that these numbers are remarkably small. There is no evidence that these people were targeted due to their gender identity. And the numbers are still surprisingly smaller than numbers of women killed in the course of domestic violence, you know, and that kind of the violence against women. So as we see these, see this rhetoric spun out on social media, we have to realize that it is designed to elicit compassion. It is designed to elicit rage. And it is designed increasingly. It appears to create circumstances of violence. There's a group. I think they were in Vermont just recently. This was a report from NPR in February about a group called Rainbow something other rainbow road, something like this. And they were arming themselves. These were transgender individuals arming themselves because of the violence that they are experiencing against trans people. Another thing that I think it's really important to know is the big white men that you see out there who are claiming to be women. No one is going after these guys. These big Viking looking guys who, you know, you can see their five o'clock shadow and wear a bunch of makeup and claim that they are lesbians. No one is targeting these men and these are the men who are going out and engaging in violence against women who try to speak up for their rights. We saw this in New Zealand with Kelly Jay King who had to be escorted away from her let women speak tour directly to the airport and out of the country for fear of her life. We saw large men there beating up elderly women who were speaking up for their rights to have their own bathrooms and to not have to be in locker rooms at local swimming pools and things like this with men. I think it's really important to take a close look at this and to realize that we are being lied to for the purpose of eliciting sympathy for a cause that just does not exist and is as you say designed to capture children and bring them into that fold. Is there any information to discuss the actual perpetrators of these events. Are we talking are these are these right wing Christian death squads. Are these is this Christian priests. Is this a new inquisition. You know, is our other demographic profiles that would suggest any type of link or correlate whatsoever. These are a lot of these are a lot of men on the left. We see anti five militants guarding drag shows in Texas so that parents can't speak up and and say, you know, kids don't need to be a murder. I mean the the the the the the the murderers though. I haven't seen a whole lot to suggest who these murderers are but primarily these murderers of trans individuals are people who are intimately involved in these people's lives. It's there's a lot of domestic violence. There's a lot of drug crime and there's a lot of there's a lot of sex crime basically. I was in the end of the day, Libby. We're living in a country now where I had a text from a mom in Pennsylvania who said I dropped my children off to their Catholic school today and I looked at their uniforms and the uniforms of all the kids walking in. And I couldn't help but think of the uniforms of the kids running out of that school yesterday in Asheville. This was a Christian massacre. I'm not sure if you're going to be a Christian leader speaking out on this and that's something that I'm going to be increasingly vocal about, especially people that were charging people for that paid Christian prayer. Come pray with us for 899 a month. You know, call that out. People all Christian leaders absolutely need to call this out for what it is. Libby, where can people follow you?
