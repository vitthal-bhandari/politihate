Later today, we're going to get to these violent riots happening overseas. What a time for France. I just left there. I'll help Roque Loose. So we'll get to what it means and how it may dovetail into some of the things we've seen in our own country. Over the past few years, but we begin today with the fallout from the US Supreme Court's rulings last week. It continued over the weekend with some hysterical press reaction related to affirmative action. Asians were apparently never being discriminated against. According to the mainstream media, it was just the evil white people who led them to falsely believe that. It's always great to talk to my friend Mark Stein, host of the Mark Stein Show, which is available everywhere and on Stein STEYN online.com. Mark, welcome back to the show. Hey, great to be with you, Meghan. Great to have you. So it's so crazy when you read the reaction to the Supreme Court saying affirmative action will be struck down. Race-based admissions policies are contrary to the equal protection clause of the Constitution. And the left reacting with there was never any discrimination. It's just the evil white people who led the Asians to believe that. Before I play you some of the sound bites, let me read you what at least one honest writer in the New Yorker said explicitly. All right, so they've already given up the game. Some lefties have already admitted. Yes, we've been doing it. Here's the truth. Saying the evidence, the plaintiff said a mask that Harvard in particular discriminated against Asian applicants through a bizarre and unacceptable quote personal rating system is overwhelming. And indeed, that's true. I mean, the court laid it out a great detail how they'd been using personality scores to get rid of the Asians to say in the same way they used to do with the Jews. This time it was they had too many Asians who were above the grade. They had to find some way of telling them they didn't qualify for admission and they use their personalities to get rid of them. So, you know, if you'd replaced Asian with black, these same leftists who are now disputing that New Yorker piece would be outraged. But now, since it's Asian Americans who benefited and arguably blacks who didn't, they've got to push ridiculous narratives like this one from NPR. Listen to this mark. There is no evidence that there's a practice of anti Asian discrimination. The white conservative political forces are leveraging this experience of being racially marginalized among Asian Americans to say, yeah, and by the way, there's this policy that you're not benefiting from a field like Asian Americans have been used. The myth ignores the long legacies of systemic racism faced by black Americans. It ignores selective recruiting of highly educated immigrants. And it enforces a false story about Asian Americans who are not a monolith. That is their latest position that they were basically smart enough to get into Harvard, but too dumb to realize that they were just political pawns of the whites. Yeah, I can't get over the naked racism actually about Asians here because this whole personality thing is like, oh, yes, they're very brainy. They're awfully good at mathematics. If you hold a math contest, they train is approaching at 57 miles an hour and another one's coming towards it at 38 miles. Yeah, I got it. They're fabulous for that. But let's face it, they're totally boring. I mean, this is basically, I can't get over that. This is like the old racist gag from however many decades ago, you know, all Chinese look alike. All Chinese have the same boring personality that you can. It's amazing. They've gotten away with it. Quiet. They've gotten away with it in the interest of this absurd, complex, progressive apartheid that's been erected in this country. And the NPR story is fascinating where they say, oh, yeah, these, these Asians, they're all very brainy when it comes to these math questions at, you know, the grade school math question. But they're actually patsies. They're rubes. They're dupes, which is why the knuckle dragging white redneck is able to use them as a front for overturning affirmative action. I honestly, I looked it up actually. A professor at Duke University ran the numbers on how it would go if they had meritocratic admissions at Harvard. In other words, if they didn't grade you on your boring personality. 51.52% of the student body would be Asian and 36.54% would be white. That's how it would go on meritocratic admission admission. So this attempt from the rubble of the Supreme Court decision to reconstruct a coalition of the minorities. Actually, you know, Asians on a meritocratic business, according to this study from Duke University would have actually the majority of places at Harvard. Right. Of course. I mean, that there is something in the Asian culture, which is to be admired that dedicates itself, that in which parents rich and poor are committed to education, to studying hard to pushing academics. That's to be applauded. I mean, I've talked about this with Amy Chua many times who wrote Battle Hymn of the Tiger Mother. She's the original Tiger Mom about how she's committed to this. She teaches at Yale Law. So does her husband. She has two daughters who went, I think, to Harvard and Yale and same with respect to their graduate studies. And I'm just not willing to push my kids that hard. You know, I have a different approach than she does. That's fine. Right? That's fine. It leads to different results at the college level. If they're not coming up with these false justifications, as you point out, that the Asians are boring and therefore can't get into Harvard. But now the line has to be, it can't be that the Asians actually were pissed off about this, Mark. It has to be the evil white man exploiting them. Yet again, it's the white's fault. Yeah. The stupid white guys who would only make up 35% of the student body. Nevertheless, are wily cunning enough. This comes back to the Chinese personality defense. I was so bad that they don't even know moronic white men whose IQ is a fraction of theirs are pulling the wall over there. The thing about this, I find it my kids, you know, who went to a little New Hampshire grade school where they were between, in each year they were between like nine and 17 students, not a lot of them. But all the kids throughout Northern New Hampshire, whenever they took part in these, I think it's called mathletes, these math competitions, they'd all game it out beforehand. And they'd say, oh, wait a minute, we're playing some school down from Southern New Hampshire, where it's some fancy town where all the rich parents have adopted Chinese babies. So they're going to win. And the whole, the whole thing was that, oh, we haven't got, we've got somebody, we've got no Chinese people. So we're screwed. The school down the road has got a kid whose mother is Asian. So they're going to do better than us. They made joke when they're seven years old, they're making jokes about this thing. And you notice it, you know, this, I was walking down Wigmore Street in London a couple of months ago. And I suddenly noticed that on all the posters for the classical music recitals at the Wigmore Hall, everybody is playing a cello now in any capital city around the world appears to be Asian. And so as you say, that's one of those disciplines that Asian parents value teaching their kids to play chamber music. While we're teaching them that there are 57 genders or whatever it's up to now, it's not hard to figure how it's how it's going to go. You look at the international rank, there's a reason for this and the racism here, the naked racism, which appears to say, oh, yes, these, these guys have fantastic things. Yes, they can play the cello brilliantly. Yes, they're multiplication skilled, but let's face it, they all bore the socks off us. They've got away with that for the entirety of the 21st century at American universities. And it's absurd that it takes, you know, nine judges on some court to tell them actually this is totally racist and you shouldn't be doing it. Right, the answer now from the left is it's not our racism that was keeping them out of Harvard. It was their stupidity in not realizing they were being used by the white man to pursue a case that they lost when they brought it in the name of a white woman, which is true. They had a white woman who sued and she didn't get as far as they did in this case. The facts were all there. Here's the thing, it's part of a pattern as you know, it's not just the left trying to run cover in the wake of this decision by saying the white man is not the right man. You're saying the white man screwed over the Asians in the Asians didn't get it. You've got people doing this to blacks who are conservative from the dawn of time. We pulled this sound bite from Ellie Mastal, who writes for the nation and is an MSNBC contributor talking about Clarence Thomas, who he absolutely loves to hate because Clarence Thomas, he, you know, he's an Uncle Tom, he's been called that. And so they do the same thing to blacks if they're conservative. Here's an example. But he is such a mutilated version of a black justice that he is able to make these proclamations that this fly in the face of law and facts, right? One of the other things that you really realize when you when you read through his concurrence is just how angry he is at Katanji Brown Jackson for having the temerity to be another black person on the Supreme Court. He apparently thought that he got to be the only one. He basically throws a tantrum at Jackson and why? Because Jackson is making the actual originalist argument in the affirmative action case. And that's why he's so fabulous about all of the stuff that's in his concurrence. He just, he's just like plucked out his own eyes and he doesn't want to see anything that Miss Jenny tells him he shouldn't be in the face of the white man. He tells him he shouldn't be able to see. Oh, there it is at the end. His white wife is pulling the strings on this black justice. You get it? That's fine to say. Yeah, yeah. So, so like the black man is so stupid that it's his dominatrix of a white wife who's running everything. And that requires all these brilliant Chinese classical musician math students are actually no better than the Chinese laborers working on the transcontinental railroad 150 years ago. All the arguments that are made in favor of what is actually now a more complex system of apartheid than South Africa had, but it's progressive apartheid. So it appears to be cool with people. But they all basically make the case that these minorities are too stupid so that you can't have voter ID when you go to vote in an American election. Because it's racist. Why is it racist? Well, because blacks are too stupid to get ID. They can get ID if they're in Botswana. They can get ID if they're in Kenya. They can get ID if they're in Rwanda, but funnily enough in in America, it's they're too stupid to get ID. Or I have no idea. With respect to Clarence Thomas, I didn't read that as an angry judgment. In fact, given what he's been through in American life, he's actually one of the, I would say that one of the heart here, he has a calmness and an identity that is extremely rare given given what he's been subjected to. And this idea that once you're in your identity box, you can only be one kind of person is actually one of the most racially condescending and and revolting idea. It's a terrible thing. This whole apartheid thing. The 14th Amendment is a great thing. We should start treating people as individuals again. So that black guy may be a genius. And that black guy over there may be a totally disreputable slug, but the color of his skin has got nothing to do with it when it comes to the law, when it comes to go in a university or to anything else. They're citizens, which is a concept in almost terminal decline in this country. If the nerve to suggest that Clarence Thomas has to answer to Miss Jenny for his opinions as if she is driving anything Clarence Thomas does. I mean, it's absolutely outrageous. Anybody else would be fired for such a comment, but you're allowed to say that stuff about Justice Thomas. No, I mean, it's absolutely revolting. I was at some event with them a little while back. They seem to be actually a very nice couple. He's not the guy he's portrayed as. I mean, I, he's got this. You probably know this, Megan. He's got this fantastic, huge laugh. The laugh of a man who finds something genuinely funny. He's not applauding. It's not the laugh you hear from a late show. Tonight show audience where you're it's a phony laugh applauding yourself for holding the correct attitude. It's a great big bear laugh of somebody who is taking genuine pleasure in life's great comedy and the idea that he's bitter or angry or all the rest of it. I must always love having him in the audience because he's the equivalent of the guy holding up the cue cards saying please laugh. If you've got Clarence Thomas there, you can make something that it's not terribly funny, but he roars with laughter and it starts off the crowd and sweeps it all up to the back of the far balcony. He's he's he's the opposite of the way of the the the stupid cartoons that the left creates of its enemies. There are no relation to how they really are. It's that sense of humor that's probably gotten him through all these years on the Supreme Court. You'd need it. Third and also equally stunning example of the left doing this comes from Jen Psaki at MSNBC. She now has a failing Sunday TV show over there. No one's watching it probably because of drivel like this, but now she's saying that to the extent we've seen we've seen our minions out in California who tend to be Christian. We've seen Muslims in I think it was Maryland and another state come out now same as many white people and many Catholics and many Christians have in various states to protest the exclusion of parents from the agendas in these schools which are becoming more and more radical on the LGBTQ issue. And so Muslims most recently came out protesting in Maryland and you know you could go back a long ways to find out why Muslims object to the LGBTQ agenda the way it's currently being taught in particular, but that's not how Jen Psaki formerly of this White House that spoke for some for Joe Biden sees it. Listen to this drivel. The GOP is trying to recruit Muslim Americans, a community that makes up less than 2% of the US population against another tiny marginalized group of Americans transgender people. It's important to remember that back in 2011 during their Republican primary, the right wing had designated Muslim Americans as public enemy number one. No surprise given that conspiracy theorists remember the birthers I do had been trying for years to portray President Obama as a Trojan horse for Sharia law. Now fast forward eight years and the right wing has focused their fear mongering on trans people and who better to go after the new enemy than the old enemy. Let's be clear. This is the same old GOP playbook, another cynical ploy to tear at the fabric of our society and damage the idea that out of many we are one, all because they want so desperately to regain the White House. Whitey is at it again. It's the whites trying to pit the loving Muslims who have always been pro LGBTQ against the poor trans people. Yeah, I'd love to meet white men like this. They're so cunning. They can. They're one minute there, duping the poor old Asian math genius into doing their bidding. Next, next the fire breathing, M.M. from the local madrasa. They just seem able to hoodwink everybody. This is. They got the mom out of his out of his marching at the pride parade to instead go over to the school board protest. We know how did they do it. Yeah, no, it's I mean, I remember just a couple of years ago, Justin Trudeau up in Ottawa, he wore Muslim socks during the gay pride parade. And I said, whoopdy do, why don't you wear the gay socks at the Muslim parade. This is what you might call, if you were Karl Marx, the internal contradictions of diversity. Anyone who knows anything about Islam knows that it's not in the least bit keen on homosexuality and they pass laws in a lot of a lot of countries actually pass giving you the death penalty. If you're if you're corded it. And the idea that they would be this particular last pride month where it's all been sort of intensified and accelerated. There was a there's a fantastic clip out there on the internet of a that some young Muslim lad recorded in a Calgary schoolhouse where the sort of progressive teacher is rebuking them for not coming to any of the pride events. She said, well, we went to all your eye defense for Islam. So we were there for you. So why aren't you coming to all the LGBTQ events and the Muslim kids start laughing and she rebukes it. She goes, it's not a joke. It's a it's a fantastic moment because there is actually. And it's interesting to be that it's happened actually all across the map this last this last pride month. They're not going they're not going along with it. And if you know anything about like the most tolerant liberal cities in Europe Amsterdam. Suddenly they had an epidemic of gay bashing and all the gay bars started closed down the gay pubs in the east end of London have closed down. Now, why would that be? So, might that be something to do with the internal contradictions of the rainbow coalition. I mean, this idea that it's the white man manipulating it. This is, I would imagine that the average white guy, he's looking at the the Muslims in in Hamtrak in Michigan, where there's a fantastic hilarious piece where when the first Muslim council is in the United States. The first Muslim council in America was elected in that town. The Guardian ran a column saying, Oh, we were all there for you when you got elected the first Muslim council. We thought this was brilliant a great victory for diversity. And now you're saying you refuse to fly the rainbow flag. Oh, my word. I never saw that coming. So, in the in the big picture, diversity is just an interim stage. You know, and if you when you're up against people who are serious as opposed to believing all the the the pretty prancing unicorn myths, you understand that diversity is generally just an interim stage. And as we just discussed with the Asians with what they do to conservative blacks in America, this is another diminishment of Muslims in America as you're just too stupid to realize you are being manipulated. You can't have a genuinely held belief. In this case, I'll tell you what it's actually about. It's getting them to protest, but whatever it is, you're not allowed to have it. It's just the white man convincing you you feel that way. So let's dig a little deeper on what they're at what she's actually reacting to. You have hundreds of Maryland parents protesting in Montgomery County, which is very blue. Why are they mad? What actually drags a parent out on a weekend to protest? It has to be a lot. Parents are busy and they've got jobs. They've got kids. They don't really have a lot of time to protest, but they did it on Tuesday outside the board of education meeting. Because Maryland's largest school district will not allow them to opt out their children from books and lessons that have certain LGBTQ lessons that they find objectionable. Maryland state law doesn't allow the opt out provision unless it's a specific unit on sex ed. And this isn't technically sex ed. They've folded it in under English language arts curriculum. And these parents think it's inappropriately sexual and has messages with which they do not agree when it comes to trans people. And so they're going out there saying, you can teach what you want. They're not saying you have to shut down the lesson plan, but there are kids and we should be permitted to be able to opt them out. And the school says, no, you can't. Your kids will sit there. In fact, the quote from the president of the district's teachers union is as follows. Students must have texts that reflect the many identities people have. They must. You may not opt your child out of those texts or the lesson plans and so on. And so they came out to protest. Similarly, they did the same in Dearborn, Michigan, not long ago. And still, this doesn't get covered on its substance, a debate about whether the parents are right or wrong or what's in the text. It gets covered by MSNBC as the white man is evil and manipulative mark. Yeah. Yeah. And in fact, this is, again, this ties back to what we were talking about with why 52% of the student body at Harvard would be Asian, because this is a company. I'm really the last person to ask about this, Megan, because I went to an English boy school and we were expected to pick up all this sex stuff in our own time. You know, they didn't really care what it was we went to, but they didn't think it was something you needed to teach in a classroom. They thought the classroom was there to teach you arithmetic and Latin and biology and all the rest of it. And if you wanted to learn about various sex acts, which is a lot of what these so-called textbooks are about, you were supposed to pick it up behind the bicycle sheds during recess and not expect teacher to know anything about it. And so we have completely inverted the principle of education here to the point that it has become. I don't think it's an exaggeration. I mean, I'm absolutely astonished by the sexual explicitness of some of these books because it is teaching what used to be regarded as fairly abstruse sexual practices that anybody who is remotely interested in them, that interested in them, should be able to find out about on their own time. And the idea that you actually teach it to seven-year-olds, eight-year-olds, this is actually a form of child abuse. It's the sexualization of childhood. And apart from anything else, it's contributing to the great moralization of society. You know, we're wasting our, you have a, basically, if you, I'm relaxed about high school and university. But if you screw up K through eight, the kid up till 12 or 13 years old, it's virtually impossible to recover from that, even if you keep in school as Joe Biden wants to do until grade 27, grade 32, whatever it is. The fact is, if you screw up K through eight, which is what all this rubbish is doing, it gives you a huge divide. I mean, it's not difficult to figure out who's going to rule the future. We're teaching our kids about obscure, niche boutique sex acts, and the Chinese teaching them mathematics and chamber music. Not difficult to figure out who's going to win on that one. And you know what, in that Maryland, in that Montgomery County Maryland protest, indeed, these controversial books were for every grade level, including kindergarten to fifth grade. And that's where the curriculum was the most controversial. These parents are being told, you must let us have access to your kindergartener with this kind of material. And the parents are saying, it's a no. I'll leave you with this. And then we'll squeeze in a quick break. The sub headline in that NPR article we were discussing about all the poor dumb Asians. It's really smart and really dumb at the same time. Sub headline is, the promise of proximity to whiteness and power has radicalized some Asian Americans on the right. This is what they say about people. The same thing with blacks who are conservative. Your power adjacent and women who don't go along with the wokeness, that we're power adjacent. You see, because we're close, the men need us. So we're just basically pandering to the men going along with it. Like, there can be no agency for anybody who's technically in a minority or targeted group. No. We're all just rubes being forced to go along with the cisnormative hetero white patriarchy that controls our... That's you, Mark. That is you, sir. Give you the last word. Yeah, it's like a fancy restaurant where you can't... You're never going to make it to the best table. But they'll find one that's adjacent. You'll be like power table adjacent. That's right. And you'll sell out your friends who are backed by the bathrooms just to move up a little. That's the theory of life on the left. All right, Mark's dying stays with us. A lot, lot more to get to, including what's happening in France and what's happening with Hunter Biden. We'll get to all of it next. So Mark, what the heck's happening over in France? Because I understand it. It started with police pulling over a 17-year-old man. I think they... I'm trying to remember his exact heritage, but of Nigerian and Moroccan descent. New Moroccan, I think. And he was shot. They shot him and he infatly after he had run a red light and failed to comply, allegedly, when they told him to pull over. And the thing escalated. And now it's turned into several days of fiery, violent protest to the point where Macron had to bring up 45,000 cops in France, which is a big number there, to finally get some sort of peace going. But it's still been pretty violent. Now, I mean, they have protests in France a lot. The history of the country is to do this kind of thing when you're unhappy. But it's extraordinary even for France now. And this sort of gets at the heart of what's happening in France in some other ways with the immigrant and, in particular, the Muslim community there, that in large measure has not assimilated. And there are resentments over that, which are now taking part in some of the news coverage. So what do you make of it? Well, I love France. As you know, I had a heart attack in France and the French medical system saved my life. I was within 15 minutes of death. The very charming Proven\u00e7al Nurse said to me. So I'm very grateful to France and I would regret if the French state were to collapse. But you have these, what they call the lost territories of the Republic, which are these suburbs where they warehouse the immigrant communities, as you say, mostly Muslim, and basically the writ of the French state does not run there. And when these two sides, the French state and then Le Bon Lier, the immigrant ghettos, when they intersect in bad ways, as they did with this 17 year old boy, these guys are bust out of there. And they're now the totality of the French cities. I think we're just, I think that was the plastic like on court, we just said that. So that's the most part of tourist France. The Champs-\u00c9lys\u00e9es, the great fashion street, they're going down there, they're looting, those shops are all boarded up. The president has had to cancel a state visit to Germany. And the view on the right is that this stuff is spiraling out of control every time it happens and that eventually it will consume the whole country. Now the left, on the other hand, feel, it's all, you know, the stuff you hear, here, systemic racism and all the rest of it. I was interested in all the celebrities who jumped in on the side of this 17 year old who got shot in Annacy, which is just south of Geneva, about 40 minutes south of Geneva. Four toddlers were stabbed by a Muslim immigrant in a park there, a beautiful park. I was in it myself not so long ago standing there looking at the lake, looking at the Alps behind the lake on the far side and thinking this is about as far from the woes of the world as you could ever get. But it wasn't. Some guy comes in and he stabs two and three year old children. And it's interesting to me that that doesn't galvanize the media, that doesn't get the celebrity class wanting to weigh in on things. So we're awfully selective about what matters and what doesn't. And that in itself is causing a whole level of cynicism among the French people. Well, now the left is trying to use this incident to sort of say the French are racist and they've got a racism problem that they now finally have to address the UN. The UN weighs in Mark with the following calling on France to address its quote, deep issues of racism and discrimination in law enforcement. The UN is in no position to lecture anyone on anything relating to morality. But this is the new narrative that France and its cops are racists and not looking at, you know, actual behavior by, in this case, a law, a law breaker. I don't know why he needed to be shot or whether he didn't need to be shot. We'll figure that out. But that's a law enforcement investigation. And not so much as you point out about, for example, what happened with this, with these rioters who actually seriously hurt a suburban Paris mayor's home and wife. Listen to this. From the BBC, attackers and friends tried to set fire to the home of a suburban Paris mayor's home overnight, firing rockets at the officials fleeing wife and children. The wife, the mayor Vincent was not home, but his wife suffered a broken leg and a child was also hurt as she ran with her two children ages five and seven from the home. And then they were attacked by the mob with firework rockets. The mayor came out and called it called it an attempted murder of unspeakable cowardice. How this is not the headline anywhere is a mystery to me. Instead, it's about what a racist country Francis. Well, the French police are not in the least racist in that in the sense the UN means. I spent a lot of time in that terrible year, whatever it was five or six years ago. When the truck mode down all those people on Bastille Day in France. And when the priest was decapitated as he was saying mass. And it was a terrible year in France. And I went to places I wouldn't normally go to. And I was very interested in the police. A lot more of them of the police officers are black and Muslim than you would expect. That was one of my first impressions. The second impression is that they were completely stressed out at being on a kind of permanent red alert, trying to hold the lid on the powder keg. And there was a slightly absurd I went to a sad for pay and you know on the nude beaches there. There's all these I was there literally one week ago. Yeah, and it's all very nice and people are lying there on the nude beaches nude. And then there's guys in the full robo cop patrolling among them with machine guns. And that is the, and you know for me it's when I think of Santa pay it's like always 1967 and British eat bar dough. And so I'm trying to wrap my head around this new look sad for pay. And that's the problem. There's a con there's a contradiction here. The cynics at the top level of the French state think you can hold this you can keep these people in these awful bunch which are absolutely terrible ugly. The ugliest public housing I think even uglier than you know Cabrini green or whatever in Chicago terrible lifeless soulless places. But the French make the point well you know the Portuguese and the Spanish live there in the 50s and 60s and they manage to bust out of there and get themselves a better life. So it's not our fault and they can't and and and they can't hold the lid on this. Because as you as you say in that story of the attack on the mayor's wife and the mayor's children. When the bloodlust is up there are no restraints here. You know I it's just a part of a bigger problem right they've had mass migration in France. There is a large community of people that refuses to assimilate I on her C. L. E. is written an entire book about what's happening not just in France but other European countries. There's resentment at not the different color of the people coming in but at their refusal to adopt French culture if you want to move to France. Then act like a Frenchman you know you cannot force your values and morals about the way women dress and so on on us. And it's festering now and this is just one way in which it appears to be manifesting. It's dark we'll see I will say one other thing. Elton John who just publicly announced I guess he's not going to come to the United States anymore because of our LGBTQ policies here we're not left enough for him. He's fine partying with Macron he doesn't care like I guess the police shooting that that's fine he that's where he doesn't draw the line and Macron like a dope went out and had a hat was caught on camera partying without John while his country was burning, which is just stupid ass thing to do Mark. Absolutely pathetic he's the thing I quite like about back for is that he's not a man of the people he stands on his dignity he thinks he's. Miss you look busy Don de la Repu bleak and you have to treat him with the appropriate dignity and then he's just like this pathetic little fan boy. I think it was I like Elton God bless him but he has like a huge blind spot on certain on on certain issues. And I think this is who was any fell out with Dolce and Gabbana when he fell out with them. He had some big falling out with them and he kept it up for about two weeks and then he was seen in dark glasses so it's viciously slipping into the. Whatever it was whatever Italian store it was and I think that's how his boycott of America is going to be because. I'm sure. Yeah, that is his co writer Bernie Torpin lives in the United States and keeps writing all these songs like Philadelphia freedom. So half of Elton's catalog is going to be he's going to be singing show tunes for an hour and a half in the evening if you eliminate all the songs of his that aren't praising America. I mean I was at Rush Limbaugh's wedding where Elton John performed and Rush wasn't exactly a leader of the LGBTQ community. Elton seemed to cash the check and have no problem with it and I predict that's how his future activism in this lane is going to go as well. If there's a willing participant to pay for the tickets he'll be there. Okay, let's switch and spend a minute on domestic politics here in the States because. Everywhere over the weekend I don't know if you saw it everywhere was this ad promoting Ron DeSantis as this culture warrior fighting the LGBTQ agenda. And calling out Trump for being more sympathetic to the agenda. My understanding is this is not a DeSantis ad but his campaign war room retweeted it and thus it's been hung around his neck. So far it doesn't seem like team DeSantis minds here is we can play the whole thing. It's only a minute here is the ad the the the bit that's causing all the controversy. I will do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens. But Caitlyn Jenner would walk into Trump Tower and want to use the bathroom. You would be fine with her using any bathroom she chooses. Does that occur? In the future can transgender women compete in this universe? Yes. Make America's latest. Okay, so now for the listening audience they're showing clips of DeSantis comparing him to Christian Bale's American Psycho looking like Tom, Tom Cruz and Top Gun. The Wolf of Wall Street the real wolf is here. I'll do you the favor of not playing you the whole song because it is impossible to get it out of your head after you listen to it. And now Mark we have even some on the right like Rick Grinnell who's a Trump guy. Log cabin Republicans who are gay Republicans who have you know sort of formed a group. And I think they're also pro-Trump but they're calling this extremely and utterly homophobic team DeSantis doesn't seem to think so. What do you make of it? Well, I think it's Trump is vulnerable on this because when he's with an audience he generally wants them to like them. So if you put him in front of a gay audience he'll be saying things to them that are pro-gay. The Caitlin Jenner line about he didn't care which bathroom Caitlin Jenner used. I think that is a you know he didn't foresee that that was going to become the dominant issue so that we're all going to be talking about Franz gender bathrooms when the mullers nuke us. That's just the way our politics has become because the left has decided it's in favor of abolishing biological sex which is a huge thing. And it's actually bigger than whether you get a cut in capital gains tax or whatever. It is something that should be discussed politically. And the point for DeSantis is that he's had huge success with this in Florida. So he's perceived as someone who can be opportunist on woke issues and it gets results for him. What I find more what if I'm interesting about DeSantis is the last time I checked the you know poll of polls at real clear politics. He was averaging I think something like 21% in the the poll of polls which is 30 and 40 points behind Trump. Yeah, which is incredible to me because he is super I mean all the other guys that you know acesa Hutchinson and Pence these guys are jokes they shouldn't be running. But DeSantis ought to be a credible character and I can't in that sense it's it must be depressing to his guys that he's down there at 20% as you say 30 or 40 points. And he started talking about Mexico not sending its best is he was actually talking about. You know to people or you know if you go 50 miles in any direction from where I am right now we'll not 50 miles north because you'll hit the Quebec border and things are rather better up there but you'll see towns that totally depressed. The mills have closed the factories have closed those guys that you can't move out of there because you're underwater on your house because you bought your house for 300 grand and it's now worth 120 grand. And your daughter does the night shift at the quickie crap and your son is a runs a meth lab because frankly that's a lot more interesting as a career. And Trump spoke to all those diminished demoralized screwed communities the forgotten man as we would have said 90 years ago. And this what's happening he's best when he does that. And this other side of him which is basically the Metropolitan Manhattan liberal who went to Hillary's wedding and all the rest of it. Yeah, he doesn't care about gays he doesn't he doesn't care about race. I mean he he lives on Fifth Avenue. Do you think he's never met a homosexual. So obviously that's not a big that's not a big deal to him. But I know Rick Rennell is almost that Rick Rennell is the is open the game was the first time I've ever met him. Yeah, and actually I think he used to open in those days Trump used to open his rallies with Elton whom we were mentioning singing tiny dancer. And I said I was trying to work out to get Andrew Lloyd Webber from Phantom of the Opera and he had something else there. And I said I've worked out what it is I said to him backstage I said these are all this is all music by tenants at Trump Tower. And he congratulated me. He could be a true and who has the penthouse. And I think Steven Spielberg is on the floor below. And I and I that's just how he is. He doesn't he doesn't think about these things because he's in he's in man you can't walk down that street. And he's in man you can't walk down that street. You can't do business in that town without being relaxed about that stuff. And I think it's different for Ron. What Ron DeSantis needs to do. I think I'm surprised he's just at 20%. But he hasn't sort of fused all the wokery. Into some kind of larger vision. You know I'm concerned about the work. I mean basically I'm concerned because Western civilization is sliding off the cliff and we're all going to land in a big heap of rubble at the bottom. But you got it if you're going to go there you have to sort of connect. Did you see this wacky woke thing that's in the paper today. You've got you it's not enough to do that. You've got to connect it to a larger vision of what the underlying thing is. I feel like Trump hasn't really been asked about this. You know at that pointless CNN town hall. And I think that's a really good thing. I think that's a really good thing. I feel like Trump hasn't really been asked about this. You know at that pointless CNN town hall. She wanted to spend the entire time asking about the 2020 election and stuff that liberals want to hear. And there was nothing for the conservative audience that does have these concerns. It would have been interesting in news making for her to see where he stands now on things like transgender bathrooms. Trump hasn't really had that put to him. You know I haven't asked for Trump and I've been asking for DeSantis because I've never I've never talked to DeSantis. But I have talked to Trump. But I'm going to ask for Trump. I'm going to ask for Trump too because I'd love to go over some of this stuff with him and see whether his position has evolved as my own has in 2015. If you were going to listen to me talk about bathrooms you would have heard very different messaging than today for the very reasons you just to outline mark. Yeah no I think I well my view on my view on it has has also changed mainly because the only people I ever knew who were transsexuals as we said back then were in showbiz and it seemed like a it seemed to go with the kind of heightened reality of show business. And so I thought of it like that now when I see sad middle school girls transitioning to boys into boys and having their breasts amputated and putting up pictures of them with their scars on the Internet. I think we're witnessing some vast human tragedy here. I don't care about Caitlyn Jenner Caitlyn Jenner's rich enough to survive. Whatever is going on. But these poor middle school girls across America are not. Yeah and Caitlyn's been fighting on our side on these issues but I think Caitlyn would be the first to agree with you that Caitlyn can handle Caitlyn's own battles. Mark Stein is always a pleasure. Thank you for being here. Always a pleasure to see you Megan and happy Fourth of July. You're one of my favorite rebel canonials. I'm looking forward to it as well. Talk to you soon I hope and don't forget folks. You can see the full coverage of our Fourth of July celebration complete with yours truly and all our friends in costume reading the Declaration of Independence doing other wacky things on Wednesday. GB News Presenter. Those are our friends over in the UK trying to make great Britain a little bit more fair and balanced. GB News Presenter Darren Grimes is with me now for the very first time on the show. Darren welcome to the show. Megan it's an absolute pleasure to be with you. Thank you very much. Oh the pleasure is all mine. So let me just kick it off with a quick question about France since you're a lot closer to France than we are and your take on what is actually behind this you know what five days of protest here. I mean ultimately Megan the death of this 17 year old guy. If you are told by a police officer I'm sure even in America as well as Britain we agree on this that if you are told by an armed officer of the law not to drive off in your vehicle. Then you should not drive off in your vehicle and what's happened now I think this the death of this young guy is being used as an excuse to loot to destroy to burn and to save the police. You know what I mean by the death of this deal and there can be no justification for that much of a breach a breakdown of the rule of law because ultimately Megan if you live in France if you want to live in France you want to accept the French way of life it's the same if you want to live in Britain. And we have a southern border problem in the same way that United States of America does and it all comes down to this fundamental point for me. It's a fundamental failure of multiculturalism across the West because Megan I don't know if it struck you but it's an intriguing paradox that France is labeled as some kind of racist hellhole and that's why there is this level of writing on the streets today. But if France really is this racist hellhole that some claim it to be why do we witness a flood of individuals from North Africa and elsewhere. Flocking to France's shores to Europe and to Britain and elsewhere racial inequality is being used as I say as a convenient excuse to engage in criminal behavior want to act such as stealing burn and destroying property because Megan. I'm no expert but ran sacking Louis Vuitton in gonna solve the ghettoization of certain French communities. So this is an excuse we saw it in America and the BML riots that went on then the looting the stealing the wanton acts of criminality. It's been used as an excuse in France the rule of law has broken down but I'm afraid it leads to the same conclusion which is that in France the flood of mass migration into Europe and the so called multiculturalism and diversity that we're told is all so precious and the strength of our nations. It ain't working folks that's the be all and end all. And that's where most of the riots have taken place we showed video a little while ago of protesters out by the sham's delis\u00e9 but that's the exception for the most part this has been happening in those neighborhoods where those immigrants live. And you know you know these are not great neighbors and we've seen these as you if you come into Paris from Charles de Gaulle airport you'll see the it's crazy the way a lot of these immigrants are living but France is largely socialist in its policies it's like how much more help can there be. The safety net in France is pretty significant they want more they want more things from the French people in the French government but they're not assimilating into the culture there that's not to say anything about this particular 17 year old but the divisions are growing you know this is a failed experiment of taking just masses from other countries who have really no interest in living comfortably as French citizens. They want their own culture to start to dominate and the hostilities are brewing which is behind some of what we're seeing. Absolutely Megan I mean I've just watched a video with a group of fighting age young men at sea with Richard Gere now gear was arguing that we must support immigration to Europe mass migration to Europe. It's useful idiots I'm afraid and Hollywood love these like Richard Gere that are actually helping people smugglers and causing problems in Britain and in France and the rest of Europe. You know we here in Britain for example like in America that southern border migration is well won it's illegal but ultimately I don't ever think we should be accepting people and I think France many people in France feel the same way. It's why you're seeing a rise in support for the likes of Marine Le Pen because if you accept someone arriving illegally and say look we'll give you everything you ask for we'll give you your bedboard and benefits. It shows want and disregard for the laws of our land and frankly the ability to disregard law and order so I say no thanks and I make no apologies for that Megan the British media the politicians across the left most politicians are going to be able to do that. I'm not sure if you have any questions in Britain if you say things like this you are dismissed as being some kind of far right swivel eyed bigot but actually Britain has a severe housing crisis our health care system is allowing many unnecessary people to not cope with the sheer number and volume post lockdown. And we don't have enough teachers or school places you know Britain and France cannot be the end destinations for every single economic migrant and that's what they are Megan that want to come here and nor do I think actually does the West have or Europe have a responsibility to the millions upon the millions of people that would quite like to come to these economies over their host nations their whole nations. So we're seeing these tensions build up and I actually predict and this is an unhappy prediction actually but I predict that similar things are going to happen here in the United Kingdom as well because we already see disputes on the streets of London over issues like the Iranian regime. And in places like Leicester we see disputes between Muslims and the Leicester community for example who are basically importing disputes from India disputes from Iran and bringing them into British life and we're saying hang on a minute. If you come here you accept that you're a British citizen we don't want that kind of drama being imported into this country. We've got enough problems. The reason your culture has evolved to where it has thanks to generations of Brits who have chosen to live a certain way why would you just say okay we'll do it your way from your country where we never chose to live none of our ancestors chose to live. We've been living under totally different standards and with totally different cultural values. You assimilate to us or go back home. Exactly beautifully put. I mean where I to turn up in the United States of America tomorrow Megan and say look I'm applying for American citizenship. It's a beacon of hope and liberty to the world but actually folks I'm going to demand on July 4th that you guys accept the Supreme governorship of his Majesty King Charles III. I imagine you'd give me very short shrift Megan and tell me I can sling my hook and that's what we ought to be doing when it comes to this kind of issue. We're trying to do that. His name is Prince Harry. He attacks our First Amendment every week. And says that you need a king? Yeah well he hasn't gone that far but he says he doesn't understand. He thinks the First Amendment is bonkers. He's suing all the press. He's demanding our paparazzi return over their property. Their photos of him to him. He doesn't get it so yeah we definitely don't need more Brits. We love you. But we don't need any more Brits coming over here trying to change our country to make it more British. Exactly absolutely right and that's what this is the kind of rhetoric. That's what we should be saying sternly frankly openly honestly to these people that come here and don't have any regard for the British way of life or the French way of life and actually just want to stir up trouble and resentment and demand more and more. We have it pretty good and actually we'd like to keep it pretty good and we're seeing that those tensions start to tear away at the social fabric and actually the constitutional fabric in certain regards with certain respects. And if you basically make a look if I was in charge I would say you can't speak the language you come here illegally. You have no regard for the law and order for our way of life then sod off if I can use a British expression because we have absolutely no time and no place for you. And we're full frankly you know we have no places for your children. We have no places to for the translators required for you to you know come here and be able to apply for certain things because you don't speak the language. It's just a fast Megan and it's it's the really powerful lobby that say you know the UN do a lot of work in this issue try and berate people into being told that they're bigoted they're racist they're resentful. There I dare say that that famous Hillary Clinton line actually have been a basket of deplorables that's what you are if you actually argue that it's a really important key tenant of protecting nationhood and the nation state that people coming here to your nation damn well respect the laws and customs of said nation and I just think that's not happening right now when Douglas Murray wrote about this in 2017 he was writing about the strange death of Europe and I think those chickens really are coming home to roost and it's very depressing Megan. I feel utterly despondent about it. There's there's danger in you even speaking out about it because we have we have newspaper articles today telling us that somebody else who's been outspoken about these issues Nigel Farage is getting frozen out of his bank accounts. We've seen reports here and there of this kind of thing happening in the states though it's the exception not the rule there PayPal tried to crack down on certain groups that had the wrong opinions and they said it was a big mistake never mind. But this is a mystery was happening in Nigel Farage the leader behind Brexit Brexit happened a few years ago but he seems to be suffering some sort of retribution for it that's what he claims of the bank that's kicked him out. In terms of all of his commercial accounts which he says are the only ones that matter to him his personal account is irrelevant to him. Hasn't provided an explanation for why they suddenly cut ties not just with him but with his entire family Darren what's happening. It is extraordinary because actually the parallels between Brexit and the Trump revolutions are I think pretty stark because ultimately there are a certain very large very powerful part of the United States press and media that will never ever forgive. Donald Trump for securing victory right they will never ever forgive the parts of the country that voted for him you know i'm from a working class area in the United Kingdom. I dare say where there are President Trump we would have voted for him in the same way we voted for Brexit and there are certain pockets here exactly the same as there are in America that will never ever forgive us for that because it was the one time Meghan that we said to them look. We're not going to bend to the liberal left establishment demands to actually vote to stay in this sclerotic European bureaucracy and as you say Nigel Farrosh was at the forefront for many years as long as i've been on this planet actually at the forefront of that debate. Now the banking groups that he's been with since the eighties you know that cold hearted bombshell there informing him that they're closing his accounts as you rightly say even his family members have fallen victim to this this banking purge. It's not rocket science right both here and in the states without a bank account function in the modern world becomes as improbable as finding a straight heterosexual male on a television advert Megan. You know it's not just Nigel and his family that are feeling the sting we've had political parties and guess what they all have in common Megan they back Brexit. All struggle to actually secure bank accounts the podcast trigonometry meghan i don't know if you've ever been on trigonometry actually yes i have yet. And as you know trigonometry massively pro free speech a big platform that platforms people on the left and the right some people who may say things that go against the establishment class and speak things that they don't want to hear. They had their bank account yanked from right under their feet as well. And there's a union called the free speech union in this country I know America has a similar outfits fighting for a sentiment rights and free speech protections. We didn't have anything like that until the free speech union quite recently came across they've helped me out before actually for daring to air and interview against black lives matter that I was investigated for under the law for daring to air. Now they had their paper account held hostage essentially until the public actually said hang on i'm gonna cancel my services with you if you don't allow us to be able to fund this outfit that's protecting our free speech rights. We've seen bank accounts removed meghan for saying simple facts like women don't have penises so it's not just Brexit it cuts across all of the i guess what you would call culture war divides. Where if you're on the right if you believe in the nation state if you believe in the immutable fact of biological sex and of and reality and all of these things then hold on tight. Because you're in for one hell of a ride i mean there was a reverend in this country called Richard for the Gil and he had his just this week. He came forward in the daily mail and gave an account on how he offered his bank account his banking branch some polite feedback on the perils of modern day transgender ideology because for all of pride month of course they were flying. In these banks you can barely get moved it's enough to give an epileptic a seizure this bizarre clown flag everywhere in a banking society i mean you sort of think meghan i remember the days it is a lot i remember the days when banking societies used to care about giving us. Good mortgages good interest rates competing with each other on a track in our custom these days it's nothing more than walk virtue signaling now this reverend pointed out the actual really quite dark and sinister side of much of the trans element of this movement and for saying so he was told in no uncertain terms. We're closing your account he met the story story they open it is they decided to go to make political statements about cultural issues that they really should be opining on as a bank and he is a customer wrote them what he describes as a polite letter saying could you get out of this lane. And just cash the checks and cut them and they said as follows this is amazing they wrote that they have a zero tolerance approach to discrimination and that their relationship with the customer had irrevocably broken down they're not married there this is a bank what do you mean it's irrevocably broken down. Absolutely you know at this point i'm just saying let we're laughing about this meghan but it's actually incredibly serious you know wake up Britain because we are marching. Into a really dire situation where it's careening really towards a a chinese social credit system if you say something that hurts the gods of. ESG diversity and inclusion we have we saw that video in 2017 of the black rock CEO saying that actually we need to force behaviors financial institutions banking behemoths are saying that actually you lose your access to bear essentials required for survival. If you offend our ESG diversity and inclusion requirements and thresholds because they like diversity meghan but i tell you what they don't like the diversity of thought if you dare breach that and allow your free speech to run rampant. Well you're in for a world of pain you cannot function in day to day life for debunking you will be d banked and i say we've got to protect our speech i wish you know my heart aches for the kind of free speech protections that the United States of America has because dare i say meghan that's the only reason that nutty doddery old biden. Is undoing the same things that we're saying in this country today and that's under a so called conservative party we're at the tyranny of these banking behemoths and free speech is imperiled not just for Nigel Farage but anyone that dares go against the establishment consensus and offer opposing dissenting views. Is there an argument to be made that this is a necessary reset that these banks doing this are really just showing their hand and that capitalism will necessarily lead to the rise of competing banks who are more than happy to take the money of conservatives. Who exist in your country in very large measure the same as they do in mind you know there's something about it that. Is my only appealing to me like great thank you so much for telling me that i i no longer want to do business with you if my sincerely held beliefs which are mainstream they are that maybe not everybody's expressing them but the majority of americans agree and be Brits agree with what you and i are saying about gender. If you don't want my business i don't want to give it to you and then this set necessarily will get a conservative paypal will get a conservative key bank or whatever the bank is that's an issue there's something. Appealing and and sort of just more honest about that to me i understand could be probably can a problematic in the law in the short haul. It definitely because one is the idea that regulators are going to say you know what do you meet the sg requirements do you meet the the threshold to actually operate in the united kingdom or the united states even. You know maybe perhaps they'll say you can you can actually open something that discriminates against non conservatives which is perverse right because they're discriminating against conservatives but that's okay because you know. We are the basket of deplorables we are awful people we have horrible views like liking the nation state how terrible but that's what's crazy i mean that's the truth about conservatives is the conservative bank would happily take the business of lgbtq. They absolutely your thought process out of it they'll go old school like all are welcome to bank here what no we're not going to support. Quote gender affirming care for minors but that's your business we're freaking bank. Absolutely and i you know i hope with every fiber of my being that we actually get back to that but i think in in a large way. This is actually going to happen more perhaps more organically than that because i think we're already starting to see a pushback against the the trans insanity that's sweeping across both of our nations. And actually i think consumers are going to start to say well actually if my bank is pushing these things then i don't want to bank there if my bank isn't going to say to Nigel barrage. You know i i'm not allowing you here and he names and shames them i dare say there would be a hell of a lot of pushback against those things but i think the left is starting to eat itself megan. So you've got we had the pride in London on Saturday just gone and the just spoilt brats or the just stop oil brigade they were out and they were protesting against a pride parade because. It's sponsored by walk capital capitalism essentially who are all on board with this esg stuff and and actually. Wait let me just get to the right you got you got you got a gay a pride parade happening that has a corporate sponsor i think it was coca cola. And the just stop oil activists targeted the pride parade because not because they were doing anything to the environment but because they had coca cola as a sponsor yes that is left eating its own. And they were sponsored by that one of the pride sponsors was an airline so that was that was the argument that if you can take cash from these corporates. But i think that's that's where it's going to start to be torn down because a lot of the left i imagine the the the summer salts going through their minds mental arithmetic of which diversity box which identity box should i care about right now should it be the climate greta death cult or should it be the pride. You know i'm obsessed with getting into schools and indoctrinating children cult let me think about that it must have been incredibly difficult for these left wing is making. So let me ask you about pride because we've just been it did you guys have pride month in the UK. Oh absolutely i feel like it's been pride yeah but yes absolutely. Does that mean obviously that was a pride event but it was the full month so yeah we're just we're just now over pride month but there's a push up in north by just in trudot in Canada to make it. Pride summer of Admiral Rachel Levine who is a man masquerading as a woman says it needs to be pride season so it's going to go on and on. And i've been asking along like where i if you're a conservative gay or lesbian person. You're not in favor of this nonsense that's going out with the leather and the bondage and the children and getting naked like you know you're not. But like where's the gay community to stand up and say would you stop because you don't represent me. At all even if you're a lefty you know even if you're a liberal gay person or a lesbian person right and now we saw we saw a bit of it there was an lgbtq influencer. Name by a name of a.j. Sanchez who came out and had this a little explicit but you know i've got a potty mouth so i'm in no position to judge who had this message for the gay community on these pride events. And someone explained to me when i'm seeing all these pride videos people in the streets act like they ain't got no fucking home training but it'll see boochie cheat she's all out on display for everybody to see middle new york broad daylight miners present like when it says why does that okay says because it's not yeah i'm not giving royal family by any. Time in place and that was not it they already don't fuck with us like that and this is how you want them to perceive us. Pride is an event based around acceptance and equality not an excuse for your act of fucking fall. Yes go a.j. Well i couldn't agree more absolutely very well said i perhaps wouldn't have put it so eloquently as he did and using that colorful language shall we see. But yeah i couldn't agree more i think it we're seeing the chickens come home to roost here as well actually what the left are doing in. And it's described often as as being a little bit like st. Georgia in retirement so you know the the fable of st. George a great mythology and one that we hark back to often on st. Georgia's day in this country where st. George slayed the dragon but in retirement megan perhaps he he longed for the quest of another dragon but all he could find was sheep and had to kill the sheep instead now that's what these these. Continuity lgbtq plus two spirit penguins whatever they are these days alphabet soup clown car. I wish the clown car would you know go off into the sunset and never return again but that's what these movements are doing they want to keep the victim narratives going. Because that's what keeps them relevant that's what keeps them receiving dollars receiving pound sterling receiving checks and support from corporates and all the rest of it. And it's it's driving society apart if you consider the rapid progression of gay equality in both the United States of America and in the United Kingdom. But in both countries you're starting to see signs where people are saying a red flag a line has been crossed you have brought children into this debate. You are suggesting that the medicalization and experimentation on children where we're putting them on hormone treatments puberty blockers which we have absolutely no long term data. To tell us what the long term consequences will be for perhaps bone deficiencies brain development your long term prospects we have no idea. We also have no idea how many of these detransitioning episodes which we're already starting to see will become clear over the next few years to come. And parents not just parents but many in these societies in our societies are saying look. I was quite all right with Darren Grimes you know wanting to be free to I don't know have a boyfriend or get even get married as long as it wasn't in the church. But I draw the line at this idea that we should be teaching gender ideology this new ideology in schools where sex and gender are being talked to children. As being able to switch on and off like a light switch where young girls and this is what breaks my heart making actually and I dare say I don't want to put words into your mouth but I dare say you agree with me on this. Young girls who and there is evidence to suggest this may well have autism they're going through puberty they're not happy with their bodies as many young children who go through puberty. I mean I didn't like my body when I was going through puberty. Young people are being sold a lie and a promise that actually the solution to fix these issues is to get a mastectomy is to take these medications is to do generally irreversible things and then happiness is just one surgery away. And what happens then Megan when people do go through with these surgeries. I mean I don't know if you saw but the the Bank of England which is like you know I were fed they actually came out today and said that any gender can get pregnant this is our central bank in Britain saying that any gender can get pregnant and that they will help people with gender reassignment surgery. And you just sort of think this stuff is absolutely everywhere and once that starts to be. So offensive. I'm just I'm just sick of it. I don't want to see one more picture of chest feeding ever. Oh no. A man cannot chest feed or breastfeed whatever is being fed to that child is some bizarre unfortunate mix of strong hormones. It's not breast milk. Grow up. Stop. Don't work out your mental illness on a baby and to have that sort of state sanctioning of the notion that a man can carry a baby or get pregnant is offensive to women, actual women where it's one of the most miraculous things on earth and only we can do it. A beautiful thing absolutely and you know the protections for for women. You know I was raised exclusively by women Megan. I know we might get on to the breakdown of marriage and what that does to society but you know I was raised exclusively by women and it breaks my heart to see actually the destruction and denigration of what it means to be a woman the femininity and the beauty actually of womanhood and and femaleness and that's being rendered irrelevant. It's a deeply misogynistic movement but I also think it's a deeply homophobic movement perversely because actually it says sex doesn't exist and if sex doesn't exist then being homosexual does not exist. I mean we had to arrange. Absolutely. We had. They have been erased. They've dehumanized and erased me while they're doing the same thing to us. And if you say that you're a bigot. Absolutely. You say that you're a bigot. You know you're not a feminist. You're a bigot. You're discriminatory. Biggest. And I reject that but we had a liberal broadcaster here in Britain, a liberal television network called ITV. And ITV aired a package on the cost of living crisis that's currently reaping havoc in this country. And they actually chose to represent a mother, a trans woman. Now a trans woman cannot be a mother. Now they chose to actually. What do you mean? Prud. They do? Well so in a package in a television package on how this is affecting mothers and those raising children for example the cost of living crisis. It was an economy story. They, an economy story exactly. They chose to air a package with a trans person on motherhood on what the cost of living the economy. The fall in the rise in inflation and all the rest of it is actually doing to mothers. They chose to choose a trans woman to actually get a close this message. Yes exactly a biological man. Absolutely no doubt about it. And guess what Megan? This individual uploaded a picture of himself to his Twitter account in which he has a baby cradled in his arms and he is attempting to breastfeed this child. That man does not have breasts. If it is sick, it is sick. It's a sick delusion. And ITV, this liberal broadcaster has actually chosen to air to give a platform to someone that is trying to do this to a child. If you ask me Megan that is nothing short of child abuse. And I think someone should be seriously investigating that sort of thing. No it is. But that and it's exactly why Megan that this is so angry. It's bad enough that it happens at all because that's that's a man working out his own psychological issues on a baby who actually does need real breast milk or formula real food from a loving parent. So that's bad enough. But for a television station to highlight it and highlight him as a woman at representative of motherhood is completely hashtag part of the problem. It's we're up against so much like they want to look at us and tell us we're bad. We're crazy. We're the ones who need help. They are. I mean this is a sickness that we're fighting. And I don't know where it ends. I really don't. I'm I'm deeply concerned about all the ends in in see, you know, the Gallup poll which shows that actually there's a 10 year collapse in support for gay relationships in acceptance of gay relationships. That's the United States of America. Going back 10 years and saying, you know, we're not going to support this stuff anymore. If that's what it means to you. Are you saying Darren that the public support for gay marriage is going down? Is that what you're saying? Oh, absolutely. Yeah, it definitely is. And that's I think a direct consequence of the pushing of this dangerous and divisive ideology. Yeah, no, I wouldn't be surprised that this is the backlash, right? This is why the LG separate from the T. ASAP. There's there's a bunch of letters for you, right? It's like it's damaging gay men in innumerable ways. Lesbian women as well. The divorce has to take place, but it hasn't. Now, let me let me shift gears just slightly and ask you about something in our news here in the States, which is our Department of Defense has chosen to highlight a transgender major. It's a man who's going as a woman by the name of major Rachel Jones. And the US Army tweeting this story out that that that's entitled living authentically saves soldiers life. They talk about how major Rachel Jones, again, who was a man going as a woman, is quote, living her truth and goes on about how this person used to be really wrestling with the fact that he had to hold the fact that he really wanted to be a woman private. And now thanks to this change in policy under President Biden, he can live his quote, truth and let the freak flag fly. He's going to go around as a woman in an army uniform and the actual men are going to have to walk past the desk with the she, her label and presumably fight alongside this person and do all the things that our soldiers do without noticing or commenting on the fact that it's a man who is masquerading as a woman. Absolutely. And I dare say, you know, we're anyone hoping to be to be highlighted by the Department for Defense. And they said things like what we've just been discussing, you know, they said things that actually men simply cannot become women and vice versa. And actually a man will never be a mother. And all of these quote, unquote controversial things to say, Megan, they would never ever be given a platform because, you know, the movement that says it's tolerant and pro diversity love diversity unless it's the diversity of thought. And it just makes a mockery, you know, tomorrow you're celebrating your nation's freedom and independence. And actually that freedom and independence, you know, my grandfather served with Americans in 1952 in the Korean War. Now he was fighting for the values that the United States represent and the United Kingdom represent or freedom of democracy, freedom from communist tyranny, freedom from oppression, when actually now we're making a mockery of the sacrifice that brave brave men and frankly boys have offered to protect not the United States of America, but to protect freedom elsewhere too. The flag used to represent a beacon of hope, aspiration, freedom, liberty, all of these really important things that aren't just slogans. They mean something that tangible that they must be protected and they have been protected with lives with with sacrifice. And now we air people and say their brave Megan brave are they brave like those boys that froze to death in Korea, who had icicles hanging off of their fingers. They brave like the mothers who didn't get to see their children come home because boys were fighting in foreign lands for the values that the United States flag represents. How dare you say that these people are brave? How dare you give them a platform and use the word brave like that. It's not brave to say that you are Arthur one day and Martha the next. Don't be so ridiculous condescending patronizing. And think about the business books the others in that's the thing is like we're there they're given no choice but to sit there like okay yes we support we see we believe. Other things they need to be worried about this is such a distraction to any person who is part of the mainstream I mean the vast majority of Americans would be very uncomfortable next to this male one day female the next who now we have to call by a new name and ignore the lipstick on. And this is at a time when our military recruitment is at record lows. There was a great piece in the spectator today by Lou Aguilar. I recommend it to everybody I tweeted it if you want to get it but you can go to spectator org and Lou writes of course he says okay the following hold on. America's he says of course America bashing education alone because he reeled about that about how you go to school today all you hear about is about how bad America is has not dampened young men's pro military fervor. The current sad woke state of the Biden administration's Pentagon leadership is equally if not more off putting. Where's boys once idolize generals Washington Jackson Grant pushing Roosevelt and Patton and admiral Perry and Nimitz all a now see our pathetic losers like general Mark White rage milli and Lloyd where's my mask Austin now the Secretary of Defense not to mention the best known who is Rachel Levine formerly known as Richard who's you know now they're supposed to look up to this and see this is a reason to join the military. It's not happening and that's why we're at record lows now on military recruitment. The numbers are the army miss its recruitment goals by 25% and 22 and 23 it's projected to be 15,000 shoulders. Short similarly the Navy expected to miss its target by 10,000 this year. And how I mean how depressing was it to see the the same department actually put out the Navy changed its its graphics during prize month until we all said how ridiculous and they changed them back but they actually changed it to progress pride branding as if a con you know if America is going to stop bombing the nation abroad to defend its interests. Oh but you know it's got the pride flag on it so that makes it okay it's diverse so it's diverse bombing you know you're taking a progressive blundering so that's okay how ridiculous of course people are going to be turned away from this and dare I say at the most dangerous moment that we've known since since the Cold War to actually turn around and put out these kinds of images it says to China it says to President Xi it says to Russia it says to President Putin that the United States is a joke that the United States you know you're going to be fighting people that don't know whether or not they're Arthur or Martha they don't know you know whether or not you're calling them the right pronouns and that's what they care about and all the rest of it and it's ridiculous it makes the United States. They're they're they're but lighting the American military they're but that it's very true. Yes they're changing the brand of the very organization. Exactly you do and once you do that you actually make it more dangerous for the United States and its allies because of course the United States is still a key ally when it comes to things like NATO and actually you know Meghan I from here from abroad I'm actually saying I wish Ronda in all this might make me unpopular with some of your audience but I wish Ronda Santis would actually win because I want the West to look at the United States challenging this kind of wackery and walkery and standing up instead for flag and country and say we need to copy and emulate the United States of America. I hope to almighty God Meghan that we do not emulate the United States of America right now when it comes to the kind of things that the Navy the defense services are putting out. Right. Of course. And we don't know we'll see whether Trump has evolved on the issue as we speculated a short time ago. We know where to Santa stands. Absolutely. I look forward to you interviewing him Meghan. I mean to Darrant Grimes with pleasure so nice to speak with you. Thank you so much for being here. Absolute pleasure. Good to be with you. I want to tell you that yesterday we were in church here at the beach and you know there's always the final him and everybody stands up and sings it together and we did that and without missing a beat. We went right into the guy at the front who sings he plays an amazing acoustic guitar this guy went right into America the beautiful. And everybody started singing together we were standing. It was such a beautiful moment it gave me the chills it just filled my heart with pride with patriotism. And it was standing room only by the way at church standing literally there were people who had to stand it was almost like an Easter Christmas at church so just to hear that many people singing about our country and how beautiful it is. Oh amber waves of grain it was just so great. It got me in the mood. And that is one of the reasons why I really like that piece I just mentioned to you and the spectator and by by Lou Aguilar it's it's headlined the star spangled banner still waves. And the subhead is as the Supreme Court reminded us last week we're still the land of the free. And he reminds us Lou does of the story behind our national anthem the star spangled banner goes back to September 13 1814. I'll give you just a bit in case you didn't learn it or forgot it. British warships fired a seemingly endless barrage of shells and rockets on Fort McHenry in Baltimore Harbor for 25 hours. Just weeks earlier the British had taken Washington DC and burned the Capitol building in the White House. From the deck of an English ship eight miles away arrested 35 year old lawyer Francis Scott Key saw the US flag flying over the fort through the bombardment fully expecting the Union Jack to take its place in the morning. In the tranquil yet smoke filled dawn he watched the stars and stripes still fluttering above the embankment signaling an American victory. The choked up key turned his thoughts and observations into a poem which became a song and in 1931 the national anthem. Of course a different story a different song than America the beautiful but so beautiful and just stirring right to listen to it. You know anything that makes me feel good about the US I embrace and I'll be thinking about all of it tomorrow as I know you guys will be able to have a full review on Wednesday in the meantime please enjoy your fourth and God bless America. Thanks for listening to the Meghan Kelly show no BS no agenda and no fear."
