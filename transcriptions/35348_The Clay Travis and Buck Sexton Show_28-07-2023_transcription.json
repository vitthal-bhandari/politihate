    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show podcast all right welcome in second hour of clay and buck kicks off right now everybody and You may have seen or or at least come across a headliner to about it house hearing on gender affirming care is today and There are people who are speaking both for advocates for and people advocates against gender affirming care for Minor they're at a house judiciary Subcommittee hearing so they're talking about things like gender dysphoria title nine women's sports and parental decision-making About gender affirming care. This is a really big deal What's going on right now? I would first start with I Choke a little bit on this phrase that is used I'm reading it from the news reports, but Gender affirming care. This is a new or welligan construct and it is in fact in a sense Self-negating right or it is self-contradictory gender affirming care would be The gender that you are Right it doesn't make any sense if you were born a male and now you are going to become a female by gender then That's a transition and I think what everybody has to remember here is that we've had a term for this for a long time going back For many many years People used to say I'm not saying the medical term but the term that we would use in common discourse for this sex change Operation now say what you will about this. That's at least honest You know now there's also dishonesty baked into it because you can't actually change your sex a man cannot actually become a woman That is not reality, but it is at least an attempt at achieving that Really what they should call it if we're being honest is sex Modification surgery because if you have a penis and they remove your penis and try to create some kind of a wound That is going to be there that you you've modified your sex. I think that is fair. I Think you've mutilated your sex. I think it's generally for a lot of people a Point of regret will get to some of the testimony about this and a second You'll take my word for it You can listen to people that have gone through this but Clay they're doing this now And they're pushing this now for children and this is for this is what has become the red line We are not the ones who picked this fight We're not the ones who make an issue of this the Democrat left are the ones who have decided that this is now the new civil rights struggle Let's just call it what it is that is what they say and the fact that they're already lying about this And they're referring to it in ways that are meant to I think Distract people from what's really going on tells you a lot here is Testifying this morning a witness Chloe Cole talking about what happened with her quote gender affirming care play clip one My childhood was ruined along with thousands of detranisters that I know through our networks This needs to stop you alone can stop it enough children have already been victimized by this barbaric pseudoscience Please let me be your final warning play the more people learn about it And you know we have to speak about it very honestly or the more people learn about the long-term complications The the fact that a large percentage of people who have sex change surgery there By the way, they're gonna start saying you're not allowed to say that you know This is going to become like a lot of other words. That's what this is They're doing sex change surgeries on people they want to do them on minors now and you could say oh well It's just puberty blockers. Well, that's the trend that that's the transition to the transition if you will, right? They make people incontinent they make people incapable of holding their urine they make people incapable of having children This is as serious as it gets. Yeah, it's awful. I mean, I just keep coming back to I think we have to sometimes take away the sex change discussion for minors in particular and Just pivot it to something that's far less significant But I think would make a lot of parents current cringe and a lot of you who remember being 15 years old Are we talking tattoos again? Yeah, yeah Because buck I've got a 15 year old right now. He's getting picked up at he's getting picked up at camp right now Today by my wife up in Michigan if she picked them up and when she picked them up. He had a tattoo I would be furious. I Would be furious. He's 15 the idea that you would get a tattoo that is a permanent marking on your body at 15 years old is would be infuriating to me that somebody would have set him down in a chair and Allowed him to do this and I think most parents out there would feel the same way You shouldn't get a tattoo when you're 15 years old It's not because I think that tattoos are unacceptable Certainly when you become an adult if you decide that you want to get a tattoo you should be able to do it But we actually Criminalize in some states buck Parents who will allow their kids to get tattoos at 15 we criminalize parents. You don't send their kids to school Yes, you can get truancy you get it. Yeah, that's that's a function of law But you know you can get a tattoo removed and yet We still say if you allow a child to do this as a minor as a parent This is considered to be unacceptable buck. What's scary is that testimony? We just heard some blue states now are Trying to pass the laws that say when you're 15 years old You without parental consent Have the right to do this and if your parents try to stop you from doing it They are breaking the law. Yes, that's how expansive this has gotten you're going to see now and they're already making moves in this direction legislatively they are trying to make it so that there will come a time my friends when if your child comes home from school at age eight or age 10 or age 15 and says I'm not a he I'm a shear I'm actually you know, whatever the latest terminology terminology that's being they're being brainwashed with and you say no actually you're not and we're not going to do this and you're not and And that school finds out and the state finds out if you're in some communist blue state They might try to take your kids from you. Yeah, that's where this is going I just want everyone to understand that's if you're looking at the slope that has been so slippery up to this point The plan is to do just that and you can see it with the so they have They calling it like safe haven Legislative it's already passed and I think Colorado and I believe Washington state now as well Where if a 15 year old fleas to Colorado and says I'm actually trans and my parents won't affirm it The state has no duty in fact has a duty to shield the Child from the parents finding out and doing anything about it. Think about it. Yeah, it's crazy And I also would point out some people will say in response to this Well, if you don't allow these surgeries to happen if you don't allow this treatment to happen Kids are going to commit suicide. That's one of the top arguments This is important for mental health and I would just point out and I I believe as if we actually had honest studies This is what it would reflect the desire to change your gender at 14 or 15 years old Is not a is not causing mental illness if you're not allowed to do it It's a symptom of mental illness if you believe and and if you were 14 or 15 And you think the only way you can be happy is by being in a different body The vast vast majority of the time buck I think that's a symptom of already existing mental illness not a symptom of it's gonna suddenly be cured if you have that surgery Right all you have to know it reminds me of covet a little bit Whenever the studies come out and show what is true The activists attack they want it withdrawn. They want to shut down. They don't say the data's fake They don't say the study is flawed. They say this is this is going to create they come up with some narrative Famous example of this was the study that was pulled about rapid onset gender dysphoria among children That was published out of brown university, which is the most left-wing university I mean, it's technically Ivy League really it's just like a communist Den of lunacy But just around university coming in brown don't even Great the place is a joke. I'm just I'm throwing down the gauntlet. Oh, I had a great education there It's a beautiful school blah blah. I know not a serious not a serious academic institution says the emmer's guy I'm throwing down the gauntlet over this one Um, so anyway, the uh the reality here is clay Um, they're lying about this all the time and cloey cole Also said this about uh about her experience This was on fox news to your point about mental illness and what's really going on play clip two Do you believe that societal pressures toward transitioning are outpacing our understanding of gender dysphoria? It's a huge part of it. I mean a lot of these people getting caught up on this are kids who Have a previous history mental illnesses Many of them don't we have very many friends at school or have much of a sense of community in their own neighborhoods Within their fount their family even and they seek that somewhere else. They seek that through these communities online And and here's the other thing bok I guarantee you And this is just broad life advice, right? It's friday show broad life advice here If you feel like you need to make as a young person A drastic change to your life in order to be happy And I would say that trying to change your gender is a drastic change I think what happens with a lot of these kids and what she's testifying to buck is you make that drastic change And it doesn't feel it doesn't fill the void inside of you Such that you're actually still unhappy and now you've put yourself in a such more difficult position than you were in in the first place Well, this goes to your point about um, this goes your point about about tattoos. It's also there's a whole range of issues, right? Um, you know people can argue with what the drinking age should be but part of why there's uh, you know There's a drinking age legally is to take those kinds of drugs can Uh, you know, you're at a young age and it'll have more of an effect on you and you're less likely to be able to understand the implications and what addiction is Obviously age of consent laws You're you're young. You're you're not able you're not of an adult mind Right, you can legally say to somebody that you want to take on those uh those You know the mass of decision of of actually Uh, you know sexual relations with somebody so you know, there are there's plenty of precedent for this But the thing is clay the left. This is a civil rights struggle for them That that's where this they have created this whole other echelon of All these risks and everyone needs to understand this all the stuff we talk about the uh, Storility the you know the high suicide rate afterwards the fact that it's irreversible the gender hormones the same stuff that they give to sex Criminals in some cases. They'll give puberty blockers. They'll give to these young people that are having gender dysphoria Um All of this stuff that we see going on the left looks at it and says worth it for gender affirmation And that's what I think should be so terrifying to people they know they just don't care And they actually to your point on gender change the reason you can't use that phrasing is because they believe you're actually the gender that you're being Transformed into actually that's why they say which is a lot get it wrong now at at birth Which is which is not true, but that's that's exactly right. That's why the at birth thing This is the philosophy when people understand this and it's also why you've already started to see the If you're not attracted to a trans woman, you're a bigot. Oh, no, I'm just heterosexual like what are you talking about? It makes no sense Maybe you want to have kids also, you know, like I mean again the the fact that we are sterilizing minors Think about how crazy that is if you at 15 you might say oh, I never want kids when I grow up Okay, I mean, but most people change their mind. Maybe you don't that's fine too But the fact that you would take away that option For life from a 15 year old is I mean, I don't just think I mean I I think this is barbaric And and I would also point out luck another good analogy here is Remember how fired up left-o-winger's got and I think it's it's justifiably so with the idea of genital mutilation surgery in africa on women The fact that you would take away their ability to to live as fgms some women would get infections and die from it It's barbaric. Yes. It's horrific all that. Yes. And yet we're doing that to our kids in the united states now When we're changing their genders well your point is actually is particularly I think apt because That one of the objections the left has to that is that it's for religious reasons. Yeah, it's for religious reasons here too, everybody It's just not a religion that has to do with god It's the truth. Yeah, this has become an ideological fixation a cult like fixation of the left in this country And they're not honest. It's it's always one of these things too They're not even honest about what the you can't talk about what the procedures are Is I've always said so many times if you sit there and you say hey, I'm getting I'm getting heart surgery I'm getting orthoscopic You know orthoscopic knee surgery You can say doc what are the risks? And you can talk about it and no one cringes and no one says why are you talking about this when we sit here and we say all It shows you that you're probably gonna you're gonna have issues with sterility Phantom pain you're gonna have to treat if you're a man who tries to create a a female doesn't work It doesn't actually happen But you're gonna have to treat it like an open wound for years that you know you hope doesn't get infected I mean it's horrible I mean it's cringeable to eat cringe worthy to even think about it think about it If you're a guy you're just creating an open wound in your body for the rest of your life And you're calling that a brave and courageous thing to do It's it's uh and and the thing that they're going after the kids because once they've done it I think you said that was this a jordan peterson was pointing this out recently he's completely correct Uh once they get parents to do this to their kids then they're complicit Yeah, once the parents go along with it now you've created like shock troops for the gender movement because they're never going to want to admit that they've done This to their true their children in error.

I'm getting a lot of threats as all candidates would in this era in which we live And the white house looks at that request They know the legacy of rfk jr growing up after his dad was assassinated and they say no This is just cruelin and humane Well, let's get into this more on the on the other side because it does seem The biden white house got a lot of problems that are uh building up right now Look there are people out there who have made some amazing predictions in the past who think that a change to the us currency system Could come sooner rather than later in fact the announcement could come later this year According to former wall street insider tikka tiwari the government could soon announce a mandatory national recall in the us dollar Her tikka he thinks that our physical dollar bills, you know the money we use day in and day out could be replaced with a new digital version It's going to be very different from what you're used to tikka is suggesting the official announcement could come in the next few months He's exposing this government plan and easy to understand new video that's online now The video also shows you the three steps that you need to take to prepare it You don't want to be caught unawares with it You should at least hear them out hear this message and see for yourself Put a dollar recall dot com to watch this video again. That's dollar recall dot com dollar recall dot com paid for by palm beach research group Play Travis and bucks exton on the front lines of truth rfk jr Making a lot of waves on the democrat side already Or from the democrat party i should say i think is his main base of support is probably among republicans who really appreciate much of what he has had to say um the the biden white house for now at least is still it seems uh planning To have joe biden be the guy And they don't want any any noise they don't want any distractions from The rest of the party is going because they need the democrat Uniparty at least to be united on this one and rfk jr. Still running he doesn't care He's still in the mix given the factors at play here with joe biden's age and infirmity and everything else It's entirely reasonable and understandable why some democrats might want to have uh some other options out there and and other people that are discussing what's going on but biden doesn't like this clay just brought up that rfk jr has said um, and i would just note we have to always Say rfk jr Because of what happened to robert f Kennedy we all remember historically, right? So that's why we don't just refer to mr. fk and we know that bringing up rfk is uh A moment in in american history that uh, it's it was a a tragic and an awful day And rfk jr. Clay not getting secret service Protection from the white house is there you know, i'll be honest I don't know what the technicalities are of this but my assumption is if the biden white house wanted to give him secret service protection They certainly could what do you think? Yeah, let me read the tweet that he put out this morning Which is one of the first things i read when i got up. Um, this is what he put out Since the assassination of my father in 1968 candidates for president are provided secret service protection But not me typical turnaround time for pro forma protection requests from presidential candidates is 14 days After 88 days of no response and after several follow-ups by our campaign The biden administration just denied our request Secretary mayorka says i have determined that secret service protection for robert f Kennedy jr Is not warranted at this time Our campaigns request included a 67 page report from the world's leading protection firm Detailing unique and well-established security and safety risks aside from commonplace death threats That is from rfk jr To me buck this just further epitomizes What is at its base a very cruel white house now? I would suspect this is political in some way Uh, and this is an attempt by joe biden in the white house To claim that he doesn't have serious challengers If i'm working through and trying to rationalize why they would make this choice It's that oh If we give secret service protection to rfk jr This gives him some sort of green light to the argument that he is a legitimate challenger for the presidential nomination of the democrats We refuse and again. This is me talking as if i'm them We refuse to acknowledge that that might be the case and therefore we are not going to provide it now buck this should be to me pro forma Because If something now happens to rfk jr on the campaign trail, my first thought is going to be this is on the biden administration So i don't understand and you can say well cost like there's only three really seriously announced contenders and in some polls Rfk jr has gotten as high as 20 support I don't know what exactly you want the threshold for secret service protection to be I don't know that asa hutchinson needs secret service protection running for the republic in nomination. Maybe he has it I don't know i'm not trying to take a shot at him just You know is 1% the threshold to justify that you need support I think most people would have no idea who asa hutchinson is rfk jr is driving a lot of attention He has massive crowds when he speaks all over the country He is certainly a bonafide in my opinion presidential candidate The fact that the biden white house according to rfk jr would make this determination is frankly unacceptable I think it just goes to the level of sentence to your point about the the optics and the perception of it The level of sensitivity that this biden white house has that it's a little bit like If there starts to be a growing sense that there's a challenge to joe a real challenge to joe biden Then that perception will become the reality then the reason real challenge to joe biden And they know that the only way I mean the reason I thought all along here that biden is is going to be the guy Who runs for the democrats that I don't mean he's gonna be the guy who wins the presidency I just mean he's gonna be the democrats nominee is because he's president. There's huge advantages baked into that and You know, they're just kind of using the machinery and hoping they can just Pull them over the finish line, right? I mean really a replay what they did in 2020 If democrats start to feel like hold on there's a real possibility of something else going on here I mean look clay. I'll say it. I still think the democrats in terms of the the democrat establishment Some of them are very uh very surly about the whole bernie thing with theory, you know, they they You know that they like they want those super left wingers voting democrat obviously But the whole thing is like the the socialists get a pat on the head while they get to run the Demi, you know, they get to run a more standard democrat candidate like joe biden So they don't want to need this nonsense They don't they don't like anyone stepping that a line and messing with the power base This is also buck why when the whole hillary clintony email hacks scandal happened for those of you the campaign hack i'm talking about And everybody was so fired up about it. I actually think That was important for the american people to know If one of her idiot campaign advisors hadn't managed to get hacked by responding to i think it was like a one of those You know unfortunate spamming emails where it says hey your password's been stolen I mean never respond to any of those by the way Uh, but if someone hadn't responded in that way Buck we would have never known that the dnc fix was in for hillary The only reason we found out about that they would have kept it quiet They would have gone to their graves never admitting that they were engaged in a Uh in a conspiracy to make sure that hillary clinton was the nominee in 2016 instead of bernie sanders The only reason we found out about that was the russian email hack Uh, which i would argue is 100 in the American political interest. I think you should want to know that if you're a democrat voter or if you're a voter in the united states I mean if I found out and I bet you would want to know too If I found out that we've got a ton of people running for the republican nomination for president If I found out that the rnc was trying to rig it for one of the candidates and not treating everybody fairly I think that would be totally unacceptable. I bet i bet you do too And I would want to know if it were going on because I want it to be a fair race to see who's going to be the republican nominee going forward Um, and so I think that is super significant Um in terms of that information that came out, but just I mean I used to say that A lot of big organizations need a director of common sense Just someone who looks at the overall decision and says yeah, this is a bad decision And I feel like the biden administration in particular But if you or I Reasonable people if the biden administration came to us and they said hey rfk's given us a super documented Request for secret service protection. Uh his own dad was was killed Assassinated which is why candidates now get protection from secret service Should uh, what do you think should we deny this? I would say no you should give him secret service protection But this is a hard call just from a common sense reasonable rational Decent human being perspective. I want to pull up the last Uh the last polls that I could hear just to give everyone a sense of where the where the democrat race stands and we know We're just a few weeks out. Uh, haven't been it's kind of funny like we haven't really been talking about the upcoming debate that much because I I think that as long as there's a the Consensus seems to be right now that trump isn't going to show up for that debate which means that it's almost few and almost feels like It's that it's a little bit like the t-ball or the uh, you know, the you agree with that decision by the way for trump If he doesn't show up, but what would you advise him if he was asking you? I think that trump does not have to show up at this face to the debates given the numbers But I do think that trump does need to show up at some point in the primaries Um, when I say needs to should is a better way of putting it even if he could win without doing it I think it's important for people to see Where he stands among the republican field before going up against the democrat machine Right and I think it's important for him to flex those muscles so to speak and To you know have to take that incoming and show everybody remind everybody If they're you know, maybe they're all set on trump I think people should still be reminded of why they if trump is their candidate Um, and and we'll see it does turn into a strategic decision Of course based on whether or not anyone's getting close to them. I'm looking at the polls right now Meaning you know if if all of a sudden rondis and disor vivake You know, I hear I hear people reaching out to me from just from life not from politics who know me Who are it's funny too. They're like hey, you should check out this guy vivake. I'm like Yeah, no I've known him for years. He was on the show last week. He's a friend of mine I just texted him the other day like trust me. I'm like, I'm aware of vivake They're like there's this fellow that's very smart in the republican You know if you want to talk to me more about asa and why i should look at asa, that's one thing But trust me, I'm very aware of the vick But uh looking at looking at some of these numbers right now Uh, oh, I'm sorry what i'm saying was just that if it gets close enough if it gets to like a you know I think within 20 distances 20 points rather is striking distance within 10 is a race That's kind of what it feels like the most people uh in a primary Um, then I think trump will probably have to right now. Uh, the latest numbers show biden at 63 Kennedy at 15 Yeah, now Okay, that's a big lead But biden is the president and for registered democrats 15% of them that's as of uh this past week or a week ago Um To be in favor of of rfk jr in that way is it's no worthy there's something going on It certainly is meets the threshold to me of yeah, you should get secret service protection And the fact that they're not willing to do it to me makes my eyebrows raise and it's a sign of weakness Not strengthen the biden administration. It's that they're terrified of admitting that there's actually a democrat primary race Yeah, I think that they're there's a recognition that They feel like if they start to allow people to think That maybe uh, this isn't there that there is a primary to be had here then there will be one right? It's almost like they've just got to control the mindset of the democrat base and all of this Interesting. I haven't actually seen how I haven't seen the breakdown of this and one thing that we know is so important For a democrat primary and this is what delivered it to buy in the last time around um is black democrat primary voters In states like south carolina for example, I don't I haven't seen what rfk's breakdown is of support I'd be curious to see You know who is I know it's democrats But which democrats are supporting it because if you did think that and just to be clear I still think it's going to be Biden and they're going to shut this down They're going to burn his sanders and they're going to do whatever they have to do to make sure that he doesn't have a real Doesn't have a real chance But I would be curious to see where supports coming from clay No doubt We talk all the time about the biden white house making poor decisions We don't talk enough about the biden white house also having no Actual testosterone and maybe that's one of the reasons they keep making poor choices on all facets Look several weeks of travel coming up for me. I got the book coming out I'm going to be on the road a great deal trying to meet as many of you as I can I'm going to need a lot of energy going to be in a dozen cities in three weeks Kind of energy I need for the coming months What chalk is all about chalks the maker of a great all-natural nutritional supplement that helps you with energy Stamina and focus their best-selling product male vitality stack combination of ingredients designed to give you the all-day energy You need to maximize each day leading ingredient in chalks male vitality stack proven in studies to replace 20% of the diminished testosterone levels Most men out there experience especially as they age you're going to love how you feel every day When chalks male vitality stack is a part of your routine You can get a 20% increase in testosterone remember these things have dropped your testosterone levels have by 50% over the past few decades About 20% rebound all natural you get signed up today at chalk calm that's ch oq.com use my name clay Cla while you get 35% 35% off any chalk subscription for life Not just one time for the life of the subscription CH oq calm is how that website is spelled ch oq calm chalk calm Sunday hang with clay and buck a new podcast find it on the iHeart app or wherever you get your podcasts Welcome back in closing up the second hour of the program appreciate all of you hanging out with us Uh and buck told me something during the break And I got to be honest with you. I refuse to believe it's true But you said that whoopi Goldberg and I I think it happened once that we were in agreement whoopi and I That now we're basically just a couple that we're agreeing on everything you found something else that we agree on You and whoopi in lockstep. So now we got to in clays, you know clays Chardonnay table in nappa. We're gonna have nousam and whoopi Maybe joy bahar is gonna make it appearance here is the views whoopi goberg. She said that um Oh, wait. We've got it. It's number 17 clay. You can listen to it for yourself play it Well, I knew I don't know why everybody else is so surprised. We're not the only ones in the universe We're just not I wasn't surprised that we're the only ones universe It's that never the two world should meet I just the crossovers what gets me because are we talking e t or a la Very different It is an alien babe. No, but he like the He's not real He's a nice one Okay, so just the point here clay is she's saying Aliens are real and they have it and they have visited this planet and she knew that beforehand so clay Is on team whoopi definitively on this one? I just want ever to know so all the vip's right again saying i'm with buck on this one Well, you're gonna have to explain to whoopi that you know just his clays on her team doesn't mean she's right Look, I've always said that whoopi bok goldberg esteemed daytime talk host she has a lot of really brilliant insightful Airdight opinions and i'm glad that she is uh got the form to be able to share him every single day In this particular moment We got to find out if gab have we gotten an update recently on the gavin nousam invite on this show Like there was a lot of momentum we were having for a while What do you think gavin nousam is do you think he's team aliens or is he team clay or team buck here? Oh gavin nousam Whatever his consultants tell him the latest poll say is what he'll be down for so well It's basically 50 50 that's the chat and also you have our audience If you had to pick a politician who is going to rip his face off like a ruffa rubber mask And and all of a sudden you'd realize he is The space alien lizard overlord that we've been worried about this whole time I think gavin would be high on the list man. He's too smooth. He's too smooth Gavin would be a little bit high on the lizard man list There's no i'm trying to think as you've asked me that question Who else uh and and he's i mean again while i would like to share a glass of chardonnay with him interlock arms like cross over there for the drink Um, maybe whoopi can join us too. Uh talk aliens at the french alandry Uh, I think adam shift may be a cyborg, but that's not quite a space alien That's just well have a ship i was going to say because I think he really is there to destroy things and he's such an unbelievable It's like at least gavin nousam is a smooth wire Because it's not as noticeable like ship is a really bad liar and just a bad dude overall. I think in jeff right? Though there's nothing there's nothing encouraging about anything that you see from adam shift If you want somebody that you're gonna hang out with or or talk to or spend time around Um, I did just think it's funny also that they lost it for a second They're on the view with e t versus alien like that comes out of the stomach and that's the monster that eats people and whoopi just like same thing It's like well like not really Yeah, I mean, I I definitely think she's crazy Uh, but Really right on that we'll come back final hour of the week next"
