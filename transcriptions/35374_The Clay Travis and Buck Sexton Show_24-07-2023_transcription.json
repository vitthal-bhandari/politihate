We've all witnessed the radical left taking over America's institutions for decades now. Sometimes it seems hopeless, but then other times hopeful when you see companies like Target, Disney and Bud Light taking hits. So where does this all stem from? What are the origins of this radical takeover from the left? And how do we win the culture war as Republicans? Chris Rufo is going to come on the show. He's out with a new book about all of this. It's called America's Cultural Revolution, how the radical left conquered everything. I can't think of anyone better to fight this fight, to write this book, to guide us through this than Chris Rufo. He's the one that exposed Disney for trying to push an LGBTQ agenda on children. He's exposed so many institutions really fought on things like critical race theory, diversity, equity inclusion and all these different companies. So we're going to talk to him about his new book, this roadmap that he's paving for us to win and also get to the roots of the left's radical takeover. Here's Chris Rufo, writer, filmmaker, and activist and author of the new book, America's Cultural Revolution. Well, Chris Rufo, it's awesome to have you back on the show. You're out with a new book. It's already number one bestseller on Amazon, so congratulations on that and great to have you back on. And it's great to be with you. The book's about a really important topic, America's Cultural Revolution, which I think everyone at this point realizes that we're undergoing something like that. Can we as conservatives win the cultural war? Yeah, I think we absolutely can, but it must begin by understanding the culture war, understanding its origins and then understanding how it works. And so the opening idea in the book was to take this question that was really vexing the public after the George Floyd summer of 2020. What happened to all of our institutions? How did they seemingly all at the same time become captured by critical race theory and other ideologies? And so the book answers that question, tracing back the development of these ideas and these institutional changes over the course of 50 years. And I think that that's really the beginning point for conservatives to start winning. You first have to start understanding. And I think that the book really is designed to do exactly that. Well, take us to the origins. The origins are in a single year, the year of 1968. And in 1968, you had this tremendous ferment and change and the initiation of what radical left intellectuals called the Cultural Revolution. Of course, using a play on words relating it to Chairman Mao's Cultural Revolution in China. And all of the ideas and tactics and aesthetics that were established in 1968 still define the modern left that we see today. And so you see analogs everywhere. The Black Panther Party suddenly becomes Black Lives Matter. The weather underground, the white intellectual terrorists of the time, their ideas are suddenly in the K-12 curriculum. And then the violent riots that you see exploding in 1968 re-emerged in 2020 using a lot of the same chants, slogans, arguments, justifications. And so I think in some ways we are in a loop. We're looping over and over the politics of 1968. And conservatives have not figured out how to get out of that loop. And unfortunately, so many conservatives haven't quite understood that we're even in the loop. And so what I think is important is that once you gain an understanding of the origins, you can defeat the movement intellectually. And then you can start to defeat the movement institutionally. And fortunately, what we're seeing around the country is exactly that. People are starting to get organized for the first time. And starting to decide that, wait a minute, in a republic and a democracy, we get to decide how our institutions are run. And we want to make sure that they're run according to our values. Do you think enough people are awake to what's happening? I do, absolutely. I mean, if you look at this huge rise in grassroots support for the fight against critical race theory, for the fight against gender ideology, for all these great classical K-12 schools that are popping up everywhere, conservative parents especially, I think are the focal point of this movement. You look at Moms for Liberty, this incredible grassroots group. There is a lot happening on the political right, and people are starting to feel, and the wake of 2020, that their interests were being jeopardized, that they could no longer trust institutions, that they had formally trusted, such as the public school system, and that they need to actually build alternatives. And so we have to support people in that effort. We have to support them through public policy, through legislation, but also through intellectual and artistic work, literature for them to read, curriculum for them to share with their kids. And so there's so much work to be done. We're just at the very beginning of this process. But I, for one, am optimistic, because I think that people ultimately have not given up hope, even though they see that the forces and the odds are stacked against them, they're starting to mobilize. They're starting to realize, if I care about all of the institutions that matter to me and my local community, I have to step up, I have to start working for it. Is creating our own institutions enough, or do we have to recapture existing institutions? We have to do really three techniques. The two that you mentioned, we have to recapture public institutions, such as public universities. We have to raise or destroy certain institutions that are antithetical to a good society, like, for example, the teachers' unions. We have to abolish them. And then we also have to build alternatives, like parochial schools, religious schools, home schools, classical K through 12 schools, our own media companies, our own newspapers and other publications. I mean, throughout the whole, every sector of society, we have to be creating alternatives. But we can't give up the fact that public institutions, for example, state governments, state universities, state-run schools. We have to also fight for those. Just creating alternatives is not enough. We actually have to contest the institutions that have been captured and corrupted, and a big part of that is recapturing them. And we also need Republican governors to step up. I think there's something like 23 states with GOP trifecta, so there really is no excuse that governors and Republicans in those states aren't doing everything they can to recapture these institutions. We've seen it in Florida, which you've been a part of with governor DeSantis. Why do you think more governors aren't stepping up and getting involved and demonstrating a little bit more muscular conservatism? Fear. I mean, it really boils down to fear, first and foremost, because it's actually really hard to recapture institutions. As the work that we've been doing in Florida demonstrates, it's not an easy fight. People resist at every turn. They have strategies of subversion of lawsuits, of all these different tactics to resist any change, any improvement, any transformation. The media will go absolutely ballistic. They'll swarm and they'll attack and they'll vilify and they'll distort the record. And so a lot of these governors have decided that it's not worth fighting for. They're not willing to take the heat. They're not willing to stand up. They're not willing to do what it takes to win. And therefore, they actually view their job. And I've learned this with some, there are some great governors out there that know how to fight, of course, the governor DeSantis being the best example. But a lot of these governors, for them, it's about the prestige of office. Once they get into the governor's mansion, for them, they've won. That's what they were setting out to do. They have the office. They have the title. They have the jet and the motorcade. And so they're good. They're just going to stop there. And that's what their idea of victory is. They view the office as a symbolic rather than an administrative position. But we need governors that understand that you have to actually fight. You have to be willing to get into the arena and that winning the election is just the beginning. That's step one. You have to govern. You have to reform. You have to recapture. You have to make the institutions work for the people, not work against the people. And too many of them, however, don't seem to understand that or they understand it, but they're too scared to do it. Quick commercial break. Stay with us. Okay, round two.

That's really one of the great questions that I addressed in writing and researching this book. And I think a large part of it. It's not because their ideas are better. It's not because their outcomes are better. Their outcomes are certainly worse. It's not because they're smarter or better looking or whatever. In eight qualities they might have, I think one of the things that it boils down to, crucially, is that they want it. They desire it. They're willing to take risks for it. They're willing to fight for it. They're willing to put in the decades of effort that are required because they truly believe in what they're doing. And even though I find the politics of the figures that I profile in the book totally abhorrent, I'm in total disagreement. I developed a respect for many of the people who were leading the radical movements of the 1960s because their tenacity, their passion, their risk-taking capacity, their faith. Even if it's in something that turns out to be wrong, there's an element of respect because they know what politics is. They take it seriously and they're willing to put out and take risks for their beliefs. I think conservatives in a lot of ways, unfortunately, have developed a complacency. They've retreated to the private sphere. This is my family. This is my household. What's immediately around me, and that's enough. I protected my own interests. But we have to revive a sense of public spiritedness among conservatives to actually go out there and be willing to fight and to be willing to do what the founding fathers of this country did. They risked it all for the country, for their principles. And while I don't think that we should declare war against the British, probably not appropriate at this time, I think that we should absolutely have some of that spirit as we look to reconquer the institutions and to fight these nihilistic ideologies that have captured so much of American life. They are nastier than we are. They really do adopt the philosophy by hook or by crook trying to get their way. That's absolutely true. I don't think we should do that. I think that that actually compromises the principles that we have that are better than theirs. But even if you look at the early Christians as they were in a sense peacefully conquering the Roman Empire, what was really attractive about the early Christians is that they lived differently. They gave a different energy. They radiated a kind of happiness and other worldliness that was very attractive. I've been thinking of that in the context of conservative activism. What I would counsel people against is having an angry tone, having a menacing tone, having a pessimistic tone. I think that we need to actually demonstrate to people through how we live and how we act and how we speak. We have a kind of secret knowledge or the keys to a happier way of being. We need to have optimism and courage and all of these great virtues that are conservative virtues fundamentally and demonstrate them to people. I think where I see that just incredibly is in these classical schools that are popping up everywhere. The people who run them, the people who teach at them and the students who attend them are just different in a way that I think is so attractive when you compare it then to the kind of genderless, nihilistic teachings and cultural expressions that you find in many public schools. I think there's a sense of despair and ugliness that we can create contrasts with that I think would be a powerful tactic and technique for us. Chris, I'm not going to lie. When you're talking about people not being angry on TV, I was guilty. Especially during Kavanaugh and COVID. I probably lost my temper a timer too. I'm not perfect over here. None of us are perfect. Certainly I'm not. But we should clarify too though. Anger is important. You shouldn't resist or you shouldn't always squash anger can be actually extremely motivating. But there's a different tone of anger. I think you do this actually really well. Even if you're angry, even if you're in a critical mode, you don't see consumed by the anger. You seem to be angry at whatever's happening, the object of it. But there are some people on our side and in our movement that seem to let the anger actually seep into themselves and starts to change their character. I think that that's something that we have to be on guard for because there's a lot of things to be angry about and we should be angry about many things. It's a powerful emotion and tool and rallying cry. But we have to be very careful, those of us in public life, to not let that anger consume us or warp us or start to contaminate how we think and how we feel as we're doing what we're doing. That's a good point. I appreciate that. COVID was definitely a challenge for me in not trying to control my frustration and anger at the way government was treating us. But I appreciate that kind of comment. I was on TV the other day and while I was waiting, I heard someone else. I'm not going to name names because I'm not a jerk. But they're talking about Bud Light and saying, hey, look, message sent. We got to let up. There's people impacted by it. But I was thinking to myself, I just think that's so wrong. I think that Bud Light needs to be crushed and they have to be crushed not because I want anyone's job to be impacted by it. But we have to send a message, right? 100%. Yeah. I mean, it's like we're on the verge of victory. Let's give up now. I mean, it's like, wait, what? That can't possibly be the right strategy. And I agree that you cannot let up. You have to make an example. And you have to have a strict and in some cases a severe set of consequences in the interest of some notion of justice. And so I think that Bud Light should become a symbol of what not to do and therefore become a disincentive for companies to do it in the future. And if you let up and the consequences ease, you're not winning. You're not changing anything. You're not actually succeeding. And so I think that there's a time for mercy, of course, but there's also a time for justice. And I think Bud Light needs to be put through a swift and relentless process of justice. And I think that it's a really exciting example of conservatives finally coming together rallying in a decentralized way, making their economic power an actual political force. And I think if the numbers continue the way that they're going, we'll make every CEO in the country think twice before reflexively regurgitating the most kind of gross, nihilistic and destructive elements of left wing culture war. And you've really been at the forefront of exposing institutions like Disney, which is why you're the perfect messenger for this book. To your point, what we were just talking about, do you think companies are looking at Disney and the hits they've taken the hits that Bud Light take? Do you think they are on notice or do they just not care at this point? What's your assessment? They're absolutely on notice. And I don't have to take my word for it. The Wall Street Journal did a really great story where they talked on off the record or rather anonymously to Fortune 100 CEOs and in the aftermath of Disney. Basically, all the CEOs in America are talking to one another and strategizing and adjusting their kind of risk profiles, adjusting their policies in order to avoid becoming quote the next Disney. That fight was significant. I think it changed a lot of minds in C-suites. But the problem for those CEOs, but also the problem for us in some ways, is that of course a corporate executive doesn't make all the decisions. Those decisions are decentralized. Those decisions are in the hands of people that are our age, that are in their 30s. That love it. The brand manager in charge of influencer marketing for Bud Light is like some 30-something elite college graduate with a marketing degree probably. That is like, oh, yeah, we've got to step on trend with Dylan Mulvaney. The people making the decisions at the execution level are probably not as attuned to the risks as the executives. I think that it will require some good management in order to change the culture in a more deep way within these companies. Certainly, the leadership of these companies is already thinking about this. I think we've already changed the culture to an extraordinary degree with really a limited number of test cases. It's Disney, Target, and Bud Light. Those are the big three. I think that this is a promising avenue for conservative activism. And conservative activists can hopefully build up a more sophisticated infrastructure for punishing companies that step out of line. It's a quick commercial break, more on America's cultural revolution with Chris Rufo. The left really uses race and gender ideology right now to accomplish their goals. They're seemingly probably the two big ones that they're using right now. Why race and why gender ideology? There's a famous formulation, a trio, a famous trio of race, class, and gender. This is the subject of Angela Davis's books. It's the subject of ad nauseam of all the left wing social theories and universities. And class has disappeared entirely because it's not effective. Working class and middle class people in this country do not want what the left is selling. But race and gender are vulnerability spots. Race for obvious reasons, historically in the United States. Gender, which is of course, as it's related to sexuality, is obviously a place that has extremely strong emotions. And if you can manipulate people's emotions around their sexuality, you can turn people into political objects or political tools to do your bidding. And so they use these areas that are highly emotional, highly irrational in a philosophical sense. And if you can learn how to play the buttons and the left plays the buttons beautifully, you can really move societies on these issues to an extraordinary degree. And so our opponents understand this and really it's their, they have to their credit some tremendous insights into these questions that they've turned into political strategies. And the right, I think, you know, for little self criticism and family criticism here, we don't even know the arguments anymore. We don't know our opponents arguments in a deep way. We don't know our arguments. You know, we're just starting to maybe start to formulate them again. But, you know, we're 30, 40 years behind on these questions and we've got to catch up quickly. Well, there's also dispute over how important fighting the culture war is on the right, it seems. And I believe which, you know, you share the same belief is that the culture war probably is the biggest fight we're facing. I mean, obviously the weaponization of government is up there as well. Our cultural defines who we are as a society. And if we lose our culture, then, you know, we're essentially going to live in a society that looks like China where we're shut out of the economy, where we're shut out of these institutions and we're controlled by social credit scores and we're not really, we're not free anymore. We're not living life. Yeah, that's right. I find it astonishing that Republicans have an aversion or a distaste for the culture war. We shouldn't fight on these questions. You know, we should just let everyone do whatever they want. We shouldn't never contest the left wing institutional cap. I mean, it's like these people are libertarians to the point of nihilism. They believe that the only thing that's good about America is our GDP. And of course, I support a rising GDP, an increasing standard of living. But the purpose of an economy is to serve the higher ends of the society. And that includes in a deep way the culture, you know, culture comes from the word, you know, to cultivate, meaning that culture is the soil that we all grow up in. It's the soil or the formation for our kids, for example. And so by somehow saying that that's not important, I think it's just a nihilistic libertarian idea that is just so wrong-headed. We have to correct it. We have to get everyone on our side lined up on this because the culture is everything. I mean, the culture is really of all the things is the war worth fighting because it defines who we are, defines what we believe, which values that we transmit from one generation to the next. It defines our identity, our emotions, our thinking. I mean, it's who we are and the profoundest sense. And so the idea that we should scoff at the culture war and look down on it, and I just find it so disqualifying for anyone on our side. Anyone who believes that should be immediately reprimanded and brought into line or really just cast off into the wilderness. Good luck. You know, you can live in, you know, gulch with Ayn Rand or whatever. You know, good luck to you. You know, take off. That's what I would say. Well, it's also just totally blind to this moment that we are in right now as a country, you know, to the point of your book. I'd love for everyone just to be left alone and, you know, we can live our lives and what have you, but that's not the way it is. I mean, they're going to keep trying to shove this stuff down earth roads. They're going to keep weaponizing government against us, weaponizing institutions against us. They wanted to bank us. I mean, they're not going to let us live our lives. So we have to fight back. We have new choice. Of course. Yeah, 100% agree. That's a really good point. And, you know, I did a story a week or two ago that I uncovered some evidence and video and documents that proved and demonstrated that there is a publicly run hospital in Oregon, in which doctors and surgeons are using robots to castrate children and turn their genitals, their male genitalia into an artificial vagina. And it was the most horrifying story that I could, that I've ever reported on in some ways. And it's like, oh, well, that's just culture war nonsense. It's like, no, no, no. They're using robots to castrate kids. I mean, if you can't summon up some moral feelings on that, if you can't understand why that's an important thing to shut down, I mean, who are you? I mean, what happened to your conscience? And I think that you have even presidential candidates, asa Hutchinson, saying, oh, no, no, no, we can't mess with that. We got to let them do it. I mean, these are litmus test issues for people. And I think we have to reawaken the moral conscience of people, even on our own side, in order to let them know that these issues that have been, that are really ravaging through the country and really hurting, in particular, young people and kids, are worth fighting and are worth standing up for. And that's really what it is, is a loss of a moral compass as a society when you support abortions up until the moment of the birth, or you support a child mutilating his or her body, castrating a young man, a double mastectomy for a young girl, puberty blockers that are going to leave a child infertile. I mean, this is deeply sickening and really evil stuff that is happening to kids. And it really does underscore the point that we have seemingly, or I guess very obviously, we've lost any moral compass as a society. Absolutely 100%. And it's sad to say that even some people who are, you probably think of themselves as moral conservatives, family values, whatever, whatever kind of terms that they think of themselves with. Somehow, don't register it. And I think that that is the kind of saddest part of the story in some ways. And on the other hand, what I would say that's optimistic, and the reason why I'm ultimately optimistic is that more and more people are waking up to what's happening and waking up to the necessity of finding a solution. And they're also waking up to the fact that they're going to require that their politicians fight on their behalf on these issues. And so ultimately, I think maybe it's kind of a kind of corny, democratic sentiment, but I think that most people, most average people, middle class people, most families in this country have the right moral instincts. They have the right set of principles that they live by. And it's time for us as intellectual leaders, and then certainly it's time for our political leaders to start listening to them and to start channeling those sentiments into public policy, to start making changes on their behalf. And so that requires leadership. And I think that the book and why I wrote it and what I think people are responding to by sending it to the top of the charts is an outline for why we must fight, how we must fight, what we must fight about. And I think that I hope that it's a blueprint or a guidebook for people who care about the culture war, to actually give them all the information and narrative and argument that they need in order to be successful in their own communities. And that's the vision, that's the hope of the book. And I think that so far in the first couple of days, the response has been just overwhelming quite good. You've been out there just fighting, exposing all of this and just tenacious and actually really putting points on the board in a way that other people aren't. And it's been so important in bringing this all to light and also just showing us a path forward of how to fight. So just appreciative of you and the work that you've done.
