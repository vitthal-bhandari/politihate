    "text": " Gentlemen, my guest today needs no introduction. Now most of you might know him as survivor man. His name is Les Stroud and he is a legend in the nature, wildlife, and survival communities for good reason. You're gonna hear all about that. Now, I thought we'd be talking all about survival strategies and techniques today, but we immediately took the conversation deeper and covered everything from our disagreements on the boy scouts new ruling, allowing girls, why women sometimes tend to be better survivalist and what gets in men's way, our responsibility to contribute to society in the three ways that we can, what the quote unquote joy of completion means and how to harness it in our lives, and ultimately how to become our own survivor man in every facet of life. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred and defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day. And after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Man, it's gonna be back with you again today. My name is Ryan Mickler. If you're new to the podcast, this is a show designed to give you the tools, techniques, strategies, conversations and resources you need to step up more fully as a man. Whether your father or husband, a business owner, a community leader, whatever facet of life you're showing up, I want to give you what you need. It's my job to empower you in this really strange and crazy and frankly insane society that continues to undermine and dismiss masculinity, manliness and what it means to be a man. We are celebrating it. We are honoring it. And most importantly, we are fostering it. So I've got a great conversation lined up with less drought today. Before I get into that, I just want to make a very quick mention that we've got our free battle ready program available to you. It's been available for a while. And we've had tens of thousands of men go through it at this point and have tremendous success in improving their own lives. You're going to learn how to create a vision, identify four key objectives in your life, start to narrow it down to the tactics you can employ on a daily basis to move you towards your goals. And then my after action review process that's going to help you stay on target. So if you go to order of man.com slash battle ready, order a man.com slash battle ready, sign up with your name and email. You're going to get an email directly from me. You're going to get a series of other emails and tasks that you need to do to get you on the path of life and excelling as a man. Again, order a man.com slash battle ready. All right, guys, with that said, let me introduce you if you need it to a gentleman by the name of less drought. He's very, very popular for his award winning TV show survivor man, but he's dedicated his life to understanding nature and wildlife and the outdoors and frankly our relationship with them. And he's been featured on just about every imaginable channel from discovery to Nat Geo and appearances on Ellen and Jimmy Fallon and Larry King live. He's been everywhere. He's incredibly capable in the great outdoors. He's a deep thinker as you're going to hear in our conversation and also an avid teacher of all things nature and how to survive anything life may have to throw it your way. So I enjoyed this conversation. I know you guys will as well. Less what's going on, man. Great to see you today. Hey, thank you very much. Yeah, I've been looking forward to it. I've been following you for a while and admittedly, I'm not in the survival outdoor space. Although I see a huge need for it and I'm constantly trying to improve my abilities as a man and being able to survive and being creative and all of these things that you do as a crucial component of this. Well, thank you. I think it's I don't know how much manliness I like to ascribe to it. I think it definitely gets kind of lumped in, if you will, with that sort of ambiance of thought, I suppose. But yeah, you know, it's still it's a good rugged, outdoorsy thing to be involved in. That's for sure. Well, what makes you say that you don't know how much manliness is associated with it? Because when I here's my perspective, as I hear it, and I think our job as men is to protect and provide and we run into natural disasters and violent encounters and situations like this and being capable of doing that to me is a very manly or masculine attribute. Well, you know, what you really have to do then is to find manly and define masculine. But I think as far as the attribute itself is not limited simply to those of us with lots of testosterone. Sure. In fact, in fact, as a survival instructor, I can tell you that, you know, taking people out in the wilderness, the majority of the time, any women that I would take out often did much better than the men. What do you what do you ascribe that to? Because I've talked with professional shooters, for example, those who train firearms, firearms instructors, and they will actually say similar things. So what do you attribute that comment to that women often do better in some of these situations? Well, it's tricky. I think if I look, if I look think back on my examples that I might have, I think maybe there's a bit of an expectation on us as the guys in the scenario to be, you know, wildernessy and we're all little Jeremiah Johnson's kind of thing. And whereas the women show up on a course like this, they don't that that burden is not laid on them. If anything, they're they're they're outliers. And what are you doing here kind of thing? And so they come with a, I think, maybe a sense of calmness. And of course, when it comes to wilderness survival and perhaps sharp shooting as well, a sense of calmness is really vital. I've heard some say, Oh, maybe it's their ability to, you know, women can, you know, because of childbirth and so on. They understand suffering a little better than others. I don't know that I'd agree with that particular version of it. I think it's more that they just seem to be a little calmer about it all. And men have an ego that may at times be difficult for them to separate their own ego from the miserable, cold, rainy night in a shelter with bugs biting and realizing that if you're calm, cool and collected, you can you can survive this with a capital S survive. But if you're going to be all caught up in your own self about it, then yeah, you're going to be freaking out about everything and women don't seem to do that. Yeah, I would agree. I would agree with that. I think that's generally true. How would in a survival situation? Well, let me back up. Here's where I see ego getting involved with men. If there's other men involved, right? So you've got another man involved in somebody's vying for leadership or some sort of perceived authority and they're trying to, you know, beat their chest and do this thing at the expense of themselves and the group. But even in a survival situation, when men are alone, how would the ego get in the way of their own ability to survive the situation they're dealing with? Well, yeah. And I'm just sort of thinking about what you're saying, because really what you're, I'm going to, there's two points there. And I'm going to kind of relate there to one, which is what you really just described with sort of the same thing as when women say, Oh, I don't dress up for the guys at the bar. I dress up in the other girls, right? Same sort of thing. Right. Exactly. You were just saying. And I would counter that and say, from my own experience, I don't know that my ego comes into play too much because of other men, if anything, I'm probably worse off if there's women around because then my, that part of my machismo might cause me to overrise to the occasion, if you will, or sort of thing. Yeah, so I forgot where I was going to go with the, with the final sort of answer to your question there. But I just wanted to make that distinction that there is that comparison to women doing what they do for women, men doing what they do for men. I don't think I do. I think, you know, when I'm, I actually find myself saying any kind of situation with a lot of men, which by the way, I'll tangent for a second, and I say, which can be a lot easier in some situations for me personally, you know, to be around other men, is that what you're saying? Or should be in a challenging situation solely with men? Now, we could dig deep into this, right? So why does less feel like that? You know, is it because I feel a cliched stereotypical sense of my protectionism for the women that might be in that scenario? So I would say sometimes it's, I also have a sense of frustration because, well, if this was just too much of you guys, we'd be fine. But because we have, you know, a woman along, we have to find the extra bathroom and we have to do it, and it, it, it, it, it, it, it, right? So there's also that too. I'm being really candid here, you know, I mean, I've been in many, many survival and search and rescue and wilderness situations, challenging adventure situations with both men and women. And on some occasions, having the coed version is phenomenal, really phenomenal to have those mixed personalities were really achieving. And other times it's detrimental, it's detrimental, you know, I can think of a time, one time I was in the papa nugini in the jungle, and there was only one woman on the crew. And she was phenomenal, usually in all these situations. But, but her desire to make certain that we were all comfortable and that we take breaks and that sort of thing, given the situation was very frustrating because what I really wanted to do and really what everybody else really wanted to do to was be a guy and bear down and suck it up for six hours. No, no lunch break, no, no drink break. We got it like, because this is the worst part is getting over this damn hill, this muddy steep mountain that we got to climb is the worst part. No, we're not going to break for lunch halfway. Right. So, so that was a there's a there's a true life example of a time when I found having a woman in an adventure situation was detrimental. But I will say before any women listening to this get mad at me that the majority of the time, absolutely, I would prefer to have women men and women in a co-wet situation. Yeah, I mean, this obviously requires a bit of discernment. And it seems to me that discernment and critical thinking are increasingly lacking in society today that you make a statement and everybody just applies it broadly and says, well, less, you know, he's a sexist or he, you know, because he, he said, you know, in this one situation, it would have been better. But based on the situation, it's going to call for different things and your ability to lead is ultimately what's going to, I think, move the needle the most and get people out of this encounter. Perspective, right? Sure. You know, you're right. And this is, we could probably go on forever on this, but I mean, this is a strange era. And it's an era where, you know, an innocent slip of the tongue. Now, one might argue, is it ever innocent? So let's just for the sake of the argument, say an innocent slip of the tongue and you're damned, you're damned for life, sort of thing. And then there are situations where you're damned if you do, damned if you don't, right? Yeah. Which I find myself in most of the time. Right. Or if it's misinterpreted incorrectly, you meant it one way and somebody takes it out of context and it gets spun and then people go, yeah, well, thank you, Tangerins. Yeah. And thank you, social media for that. You know, now it's, it's a whole world full of misunderstandings and misquotes. Yeah. Well, you know, I am glad we're talking about this because one thing I saw in preparation for this, and I know a bit about you is that you're a big proponent of boy scouts. And over the past several years, I've actually been openly critical about some of the decisions they've made. And one of the things that you talk about is the value of women being included. And I actually think that is not a good thing in the aspect of boy scouts. Co-ed, sure, opportunities where, where young boys and young girls work together. But I also think there's a huge need for boys to learn exclusively from men and be surrounded by exclusively boys. I'd love to hear your take on it. I agree with you to a limit. And here I've been thinking about this, you can tell. I, and, and I, because I, I work with scouts and I'm very honored to work with scouts in many, many occasions. And so I'll state right out that first of all, I fully support the integration. I think the co-ed situation, just as I've taught co-ed so when I go out and do my wilderness survival, it's always been co-ed. You know, sometimes it's maybe there is just all men, sometimes it's mostly women, but lots of times it's co-ed. And the value in that is, is far exceeds locking it down to men and women. So what are we talking about here? If we're talking about the mentorship of young boys, where I think the lacking is, is not in this big group situation, but the father son, the uncle son, the mentor boy, the older man younger boy. This is coming from a guy who had zero mentorship growing up. And so when I look at the, you know, not a controversial dilemma, but certainly a topic of conversation here, the changing of the scouts. I think, you know, what are we losing there? Because part of me in the beginning, absolutely, I'm like, wait a minute, but I want to be with the boys at some point and make fart jokes all night long and, and, and, you know, be goofy and, and, and, and go skinny dipping, you know, at 14 years of age, not worried that there's girls there sort of thing, like those kinds of things, because we have to be appropriate, right? So, so are we saying, well, were you inappropriate when it was a bunch of boys? We weren't inappropriate given that it was only boys, right? It's different. For example, going skinny dipping, let's just say that, let's say as a 14 year old, I want to go skinny dipping, well, I'm not going to do that at high school, right? That would be incredibly inappropriate, but would it be appropriate with my family or with my dad or my buddies at the cottage? That would be appropriate. And as soon as there's a girl, it's, it's now inappropriate. Now, maybe it's also inappropriate with just the boys, but you, you, you develop this understanding. I guess you have to go in knowing you have to go in understanding that our group of guys, me and my six buddies, yeah, we're going up to the cottage and we're going to hang out and, you know, we're probably going to skinny dip, you know, and if you're a man or a boy in that situation and you find that uncomfortable, then you can bow out and say, that doesn't make me comfortable. And I don't, I don't want to do that, right? So back to the boy scouts and the scouts situation. I, again, I think that the real lacking and the real thing that we're missing out in the argument for only having boys is but why it's this mentorship thing. Now, well, boys, mentor boys, well, you were a boy wants do we really? No, we rip on each other and it's not always fun and it can be very hurtful. And, and so boys, but it can also be productive, though, right? I mean, I think about boys, the way that we communicate with each other and even as grown men, you know, if you and I are friends, I'm going to be poking on you and picking on you a little bit and making fun of you. And they're probably an element of truth to that. But if we take it with the way it's intended, I think men push harder on each other as a form of accountability, which is positive, I would, I would say, you're yes, the way you just said it. Yeah. The way it really plays out in life, I don't, I don't agree with you. Because, you know, the way we poke on each other in high school is always painful. I was, you know, I was with the in crowd and I was with the picked on crowd. I've been in both both and I can tell you it really hurts. Now, people might push back at you. I'm not pushing back you, but, but the, the, what's the, the phrase for the sake of debate kind of thing? Someone might say, well, hey, that's great if you're all a bunch of Neanderthals, but that's old school. You know, what we don't do that anymore. Right. And I would probably side more on you with you and say, well, I, first of all, I agree, there is definitely a need for stronger sensitivity. I think there's definitely a more sensitive culture that's coming up right now than the culture I grew up in. On the other hand, you know, there's a lot of things that I teach where at some point, my, my line is, look, I'm really sorry, but at this point, you just got to suck it up. Okay. You got to suck it up. Like, I got it. We can all be really sensitive in this moment, but what we really need to do is suck it up and get the damn job done now. So as boys, so I think, I see what you're saying. I think, as men, we have that opportunity to be men around each other and we can, as men, we tell far jokes. It's ridiculous. But the boys, I'm not, I think, I guess what I'm saying is, and I'm not trying to ride the fence here, by the way, I'm trying to think it through myself. So that's why I enjoy conversations like this, because I can see it from both sides. It's an important one. And I think that really, honestly, there's room for all three. What are the biggest complaint we hear from the girls about why they wanted to join the scouts, because the girl scout sucks. Because all they're doing is knitting and needlepoint and baking cookies. So that's what they hear over and over again. And then you hear a counterpoint to that, which is, well, then why don't they just up the girl scouts? That one is actually something I get. I'm like, yeah, why didn't they? Why didn't they, you know, up the girl scouts? Why didn't they, why don't they hear those complaints and get the girls out there surviving and building shelters and make everything like identical to what the boys do, but all girls and then all boys. And then in the middle, we have like ventures, for example, but I think in the middle, there's room in the middle for simply co-ed scouts. I think there's room for all three, to be honest with you. One that we understand, this is about boys. And so we're going to be all boys here. This is about girls. And for the sake of the girls, we're going to be all girls here. And this is in the middle. This is about co-ed, and it's about learning from each other as boys, as girls. But so all of this is spinning off of the original question. And my original point, which is, what do we miss? What were we afraid of losing with the boys scouts, with having them in? I don't think really much of anything. I think just the boys camaraderie, which you're saying is beneficial. I'm suggesting if it's only the boys, it's like, what's that movie? Or they're on the island and it's all the boys, the famous movie. Anyway, it can get pretty painful pretty quickly. Yeah. And I think, you know, well, I think you're right. So you have like, Lord of the Flies is wanting to come to my place. That was a wagon. That's the one. And let me just finish by the way, I just want to say that. So that the point was the thing that's missing is the adult male to young male mentorship. That's what I don't want to see go by the wayside. Yeah, I'm really glad you say that because I see that as being an issue too. And that's a large part of the work that we're doing is ensuring that we as men, whether you're a biological father or in a fatherhood type role, you said uncle earlier, or a big brother, or some sort of a community leader, or a member of church clergy, we have an obligation to take our knowledge and information and turn around and impart that wisdom on our boys who we are going to expect to step up and lead and be productive members of society. But if they don't learn it, they're going to be like the Lord of the Flies. You're absolutely right. Where it's very destructive and damaging because they don't know how to use their masculine virtues correctly. And we should. I have not, I tell you, you know, I mean, I train and do all the rest of it because I like my masculine virtues. You know, I'm pretty sure my wife likes my chest, you know, and she's only up to it as I hold her close, you know, and, and, you know, you, you touched up something you said, you know, responsibility. And so as I said earlier, I grew up with absolutely zero mentorship, zero guidance, nothing. And so one of the downsides of that is that not necessarily that I got involved in a lot of nefarious things, though I did. The downside is time, you lose an incredible amount of time in your life, if you have to figure it out on your own. But if someone is going, can I talk to you about this? And someone is guiding you, you just shaved a year off of what you want to try to accomplish. You just shaved a month off, you just shaved five years off, you can shave off so much time with good mentorship in getting to live an effective life as an adult with that mentorship there. But without it, like in my case, I'm a late bloomer and absolutely everything I've ever done because I've had to figure every my first bit of advice I ever got, I was 23 years old. So the first, and I, and I'm not being facetious, I'm not exaggerating my life. The first adult oriented calm, concise, good advice I got, I was 23. You know, that's too long. That's too way too long. I should have gotten it when I was 10, you know, and I was 23. And so, you know, and that was one bit of advice. And after that, I became kind of a junkie on self help books and, and, and, you know, motivational listening and all of that, you know, just to, I had to teach myself. Do you feel like your lack of that early mentorship from other men in a way drove you to what you're currently doing with, because I don't think anybody would doubt that you're a manly man or a masculine man now, right? Because you're in this arena, you're in this world, you're doing these things and you're, you're surviving and you're teaching others about this. Is it that lack of that that drove you to this direction or not at all? I'm really curious about your perspective on that. You know what? It's a far more complicated answer, but the short answer is yes. Yes. I, you know, as you say that, because I'm thinking of pudgy, non-athletic me in grade 10, smoking, drinking, you know, all that. And I reversed all that around. And I mean, to this day, at this point, I, well, being a little facetious right now, I didn't peak in high school, you know, and now I can look at all those guys who did peak in high school, who went and picked on me and who were the stars of the football team and the stars of the hockey team and they all got beer guts out to hear. And, you know, many, you know, failed marriages and problems, in some cases, failed fatherhoods and, and they just don't seem very happy. And so yes, this, again, the short answer being, yeah, I, I think being pudgy me and non-athletic me, when I hit my 20s, I'm like, no more, no more. I want to be a, I want to be a man. So what turned that for you? Was it a moment or a series of, of events? Because I know there's a lot of guys who are listening to this right now who are feeling like the 20 year old version of you. They may be 40 years old, but they feel like that guy. What is it that changed for you where you said no more of this, here's where I'm going, and then we can talk more about that. So what is it that changed? It's an interesting way of asking the questions question. I guess my internal drive, earlier than that, coming out of high school, I just looked around at the neighborhood I grew up in, which was very, they were gangs, and we had lots of drugs in the neighborhood. And I mean, look, the bottom line is I should be, you know, basically a little bit of a weakened alcoholic watching the game on TV and working at shipping and receiving. That's what I should be doing. That's what I was meant for coming out of Mimical Ontario. But I looked around in no offense to that scenario. Many of my good friends are in that scenario, and I still love them to death. But I looked around and whatever it was, whatever it was in me, you can call it ego if you like. I just thought, no, no, there's something more. There's got to be something more. And this I know there is, I know I can be more than this, and I don't care what all my teachers has told me. And I don't care what my guidance counselor, how they humiliated me and told me. I was one of those kids that was told by the principal and the teachers and the guidance counselors, you know, you just get a jobless. You're not going anywhere. You know, and I just like something inside me said, you're wrong, you're wrong. And I'll, and I'll show you. I don't know what that is. I, to this day, I don't know what that is. But I do know that I didn't know how to manifest it because I didn't have the mentorship. If I had the mentorship, I could have manifested that sooner instead of having to read self-help books for 10 years. Yeah, that's an interesting point. It's, it's interesting as you say that you talk about, I do know that they're wrong and I'm going to prove it to you. I've talked with about 350 very, very successful men in all realms of life. And there's one thread that seems to under, underpin a lot of these guys. And that is a bit, and maybe this isn't the right way to say it. So you can correct me if I'm phrasing this wrong for you, but a bit of a chip on the shoulder, like, I'm going to show you, I'll prove it to you and let me go out and do this and prove others wrong. Do you feel that way or am I mischaracterizing that? I think the only slight mischaracterization is that a chip on my shoulder seems like it's, it's out of bitterness. There's some bitterness there, vindication. No, maybe an edge. I don't know. No, you know, it was a, it was a belief, my friend. It was just a belief in myself that I shouldn't have had. Even my background, I should not have a belief in myself. But somehow, I just kept thinking something in this being's got something to give. And I don't know what it is yet, but I, I know, I'll find a way. And it's like, and that's my whole life's been like, okay, I used to say like, there's no roadblocks for me. There are always just speed bumps or hurdles. I have to crawl under them. I'll crawl under them. But one way or another, I'm getting around these, these, you know. So I think the chip on the shoulder, again, that sort of intimates a little bit of, of, of, bitterness. And I'm not, am I bitter? I'm disappointed in my parents, you know? I'm disappointed in my, my adults, the adults in my world, when I was a teenager or younger. But bitter, well, maybe I'm just old enough not to be bitter. I probably was bitter at times, I'm sure it was. But I'm not, not in, at the moment of this conversation, I'm not, I'm not bitter. I'm just more remembering, you know. Right. So I know that your, your transformation into this realm, if I understand correctly, started with canoe excursions. Is that right? You were, you were, you were in music and you were pursuing that. And then you started taking excursions in the canoe. Is that right? Is that how this kind of chart transpired and transformed a little bit? Is that the start of what we're talking about now? Yes. Yes. And so why, you know, it, it, gave me something that I could do well. I could do nothing well in high school. Sure. I tried out for the hockey team, did make it, tried out for the football team, did make it, played hockey, you know, house league and all the rest of it. But, you know, sucked. Actually, I was pretty good when I was 21 for, but a year and a half, I was really good. You know, you have those moments. It's really weird. It's like, especially when men out of high school, they start to sprout and get stronger. And right out of high school, and like, man, if I could only have that three, four years earlier, I would have been golden. Exactly. And that's, I certainly sprouted after high school in many, many ways. But I think, so the canoeing thing, it was, yeah, I think it was just a, it was like a church group. It was a church group trip. And we went to, tomorrow, we may Ontario, place up in Canada, and it's a beautiful pristine canoeing country. And, you know, it was just this little one, one week or two week canoe trip. But in my head, it could have been the greatest adventure ever. I might as well have been in the Amazon jungle, which I eventually went to, obviously. It just, it was such a break free from what I associated it with my neighborhood. And so, some of the stuff that I hear you asking and that we're talking about, and I know that we are speaking to a lot of other men right now that, that maybe want to break out of where they're in sort of thing. And a big thing for me with the canoeing, which was new friends, right? Because my friends in high school did, that was not a thing. But through church and these people, I found this thing and off we go canoeing. And I'm good at it. And I'm like, quickly, what it did was, it told me with this new opportunity that I did not have to go back to my toxic friends. I did not have to, there were not just the six or seven guys I could call who, some of them I love to this day, but, you know, let's face it, at the time their attitudes were more toxic. And I mean, toxic with a small T. I don't mean that as negative, as dark as it sounds. It's something that's something that we, I think, overuse a lot of times or so, you got to get away from your toxic people. And it's the right word, I think, to get the point across. But it's not necessarily as dark. Sometimes it's not very dark at all, but it still withholds you. You know, I remember through the canoeing, you know, and I had quit smoking and I was becoming more healthy. One of my best buddies from high school said, what do you mean? I can't smoke in your house. I said, come on, Ronnie, I just don't want everybody smoking in my house anymore. Well, I'm not coming over there. Right. And so, but, you know, and God love them, but okay, then don't come over because you know what, like, we're past that, like, sort of thing. And so, yeah, the canoe trip, the canoe trip taught me that there was another world out there. And when I finally discovered it, it was much bigger than I ever could have dreamed. And so when you, when you started to see in that other world started to unfold, you know, before you and you started to move closer towards it, did you have some sort of an idea that you were going to turn this into a career that you were going to turn this into a money-making venture that it was going to support your lifestyle? Or was it, this is a hobby I enjoy doing it. And, you know, that's what it is. And period end of discussion. Never hobby and never about the money. I finally found my first goal in life. So, for example, one of the things that I learned later in life was what I call the joy of completion, which is actually finishing something you started. And I didn't know that. I was a long time. But I found, even before that, I found my first goal. My goal? I love this so much. I want to become the best guide in Canada. I want to be like an outdoor guide that people know about, because I saw some guys that were like that, right? Like, oh, if you ever tripped with him, oh, yeah, he's a canoe guide, you got to go learn from him. I wanted to be that guy. And so, that's what I did. I had a goal. And how do I get to that goal? Easy peasy. Take some courses, get a bunch of certificates, be a an intern, you know, be an assistant guide. I did all that. That's what I did. I just, I want to be one of the best guides that Canada has to offer. And I don't know if I can, I can ever boast that. I do know that I became an excellent guide. Yeah, that's it. I wrote that down. I've been taking notes, then you probably see me taking notes here. I'm not checking my text or anything, but I wrote down that concept of the joy of completion. I've never heard it put that way. But that is a really, really powerful way of looking at it, because I think so many of us, myself included, fall into the trap of getting excited about something. You know, we see that bright and shiny object or something we want to pursue. And we're so fickle in general that we do it and we get started. And then at the first little slight of challenge or hardship, like, oh, yes, see, this wasn't meant to be. And we use it as an excuse to throw in the towel when we could have built all that confidence and credibility if we would have just stuck through and completed the dang thing. And you know, I was quite older in my, in my late twenties, no older than that, when I first finished something creatively. So I did accomplish my goal of becoming a guide and a strong guide. So, but I never, I didn't see it as such. I didn't see it really as a completion. The joy of completion, I discovered, which was based on my original desires in life, which was to be a rock star. I wanted to be Neil Young. I wanted to be Jimmy Page, right? I wanted to be that. Well, that didn't work out. And it was the canoe trip that showed me that, you know what, and I was actually doing pretty good at it. I was producing for much music up in Canada. I was, you know, I had music being shot to Bruce Springsteen, like I was in a good place. So let me dance around this a little bit here. Just to catch this up, it was in a good place musically. So what was wrong? I still had no guidance, no mentorship. Nobody said, less, you're, you're sitting there right now with this in your hands. Okay. You need to bust a move and make this happen. Instead, I went and played hockey. I went and played tennis. I went jogging. You know, I just said, oh, I should write another song. Well, tomorrow. Right? So the music came up against that. And then I found the canoe trip. And then I became a guide. So after a few years of being that guide, and now I'm going to get to the joint completion here, and why for every man listening, understand that the joy of completion is vital to achieve. Well, here, I'll just use the word. Here's what I want to say what it is. It's euphoric. From a guy who'd never completed anything, he really started. Okay. I then endeavored to get back into music. Oh, no, write a bit of, you know, acoustic songs, singing about nature, stuff like that. I produced and I went and I lived out in the woods with my then wife for the film called Snowshoes and Salted. All right. So I lived in the woods for a year and I filmed it on camera. And I was recording, writing some songs. But there's no completion there. Right. That's just I'm just doing. So any hard knock that could come my way, I could just have stopped that and knock that off and said, okay, well, you don't need to finish the film. You did the year in the bush, you're fine. You know, you don't need to record the songs. You've written them. They're fine. You know, no, I knew that there needs it to be an end goal with this music I was doing and and this film that I had made about my adventure in the woods was soon. So I finally, it took me five years. Somehow I'd bared down, got the CD done and the DVD. Now that was the day that I stood there with a CD in my hands and a DVD in my hands almost virtually the same day that I had done. And that's when the euphoria of the joy of completion hit me. And I thought, Oh my God, why have I not been doing this my whole life? No one told me how good it feels to finish. That's a important line. No one ever told me how good it feels to finish. And when I discovered how good it felt to finish, dude, my whole life since then has been about finishing what I started, which on a tangent note, doesn't mean you don't, you shouldn't quit certain things that you do start when they turn out to be wrong. But that messiness aside, I finish what I start, even if it hurts, I finish what I start because that's my word. I've got a film I need to finish right now. I don't really want to. But I'm going to because I gave my word that I would finish this particular film that I was in. And that's that's something I think men need to to learn and understand. And if you're 45 and you still don't know this, okay, finish that thing. Actually, you know, there are, sorry, I just ramble out a little bit more. There are at least men that age, my age, younger than me, I meet them all the time. Yeah, you know, I was thinking about this and I was thinking about that. And I'm just like, yeah, you're 47. You just gonna keep thinking about it. Yeah. And I have a point to make on that, but I'll set up for a second. No, I'm just listening. I'm taking notes. I'm just listening. You said something interesting. You said finish is my word. What did you mean by that? Is that something that you that like it's a mantra or something that runs in your head, like finish, finish, finish? What did what did you exactly mean by that? No, it's it's just an obvious, you know, that description to finish something is obvious. And what we take it for granted. All right, man, let me just hit the pause button very, very quickly on my conversation with less. You know, I often receive compliments on my ability to converse with some of the most incredible men on the planet, like less. And as weird and strange as this is for me to say, I am damn good at it. But I tell you this not to toot my own horn, but to let you know that my ability to communicate effectively has been a very, very long time in the works. And I also know that it's something a lot of men struggle with. And because of this, we've decided to cover effective communication and more specifically, how to communicate like a leader inside of our exclusive brotherhood, the iron council. So if you want to learn how to better communicate with your peers, your wife, kids, friends, neighbors, strangers, whoever, join us inside the iron council this month, where you'll get access to the exact tools and information and strategies that I personally use to speak to others powerfully. You're going to also unlock access to other extremely successful men who will teach you, who will guide you, who will mentor you, and also hold you accountable to progress in your life. You can check that out at order of man.com slash iron council. Again, that's order of man.com slash iron council. Do that after the show. For now, we're going to get back to the conversation with less. Do you think that this concept of finishing and there's a, there's a theme here that I keep hearing you say, which is I didn't have that mentorship. Nobody showed me. Do you feel like you are, I don't know, called is the right word, but called to do that for other people. Does that where a lot of the teaching and the instruction and the desire to help improve other people comes from? Does it come from that? I don't allow myself to think that. I, I want what I want to do is to contribute. So there's a lot of tangents we can go on here. I think there are three ways in which we can contribute. And I will say you talked earlier about the responsibility of an adult to be that mentor to a young person. That's a responsibility we have. I think as human beings, we have a responsibility to contribute in some way, especially those of us here in North America. I mean, I mean, you know, looking at you and looking at me, you know, we're not hard done by, you know, we're, and hopefully we're decent men. But we, we, we are not disadvantaged in my, in my scenario. I was disadvantaged as a youth. I'm not now. So the three ways that we can live are the three ways that we contribute are, or the three ways to live us, you either contribute globally, you contribute to your community, or you live selfishly. Usually what I say is the three ways to live selfishly for the community or globally. All right. Now selfishly, selfishness has to happen. That's why we go to university. That's why you train in the morning. That's what whatever you do for yourself to improve us. That's called, you gotta be selfish about it. My daughter is a triathlete. She needs, she's in a selfish mode to be a triathlete. And I fully applaud that. It's like you gotta focus on you right now. You know, you can be altruistic later. Right now, be selfish, right? Learn what you need to learn. So that's one mode. But the problem is some people, if I'm being a little critical, get stuck in that mode forever. That's the only mode they live in. And selfishness is their life, right? And you know, come what may the world and I'll just sit here on the dock with my beer and not worry about anything. And it's like, to me, that's, you know, why wouldn't you want to try to contribute now? So now we have globally or community. And Godspeed to the soccer moms and the soccer dads and those people that have the community center things and the programs and all that stuff, they're fantastic. I can't do that. It's not me. It's never been me to do that. When John Lennon said, I don't want to reach 10 people. I want to reach 10 million. I understood what he meant. I'm like, I know what he means. I know exactly what he means. So I went globally. So I see the work that I do as a creator, right as a filmmaker and mostly as a storyteller, more than anything. I see it. I like, I like to get it out there in a global way and just release it to the wind, if you will. And I like that because it could be helping people I'll never, ever meet. I know that's the case. We're never here from nowadays with social media, I get posts tonight. And I see the thank yous and things like that. Okay, that's great. But that's not, I just like to put it all out there. It's kind of awesome to wonder what it might, what it, you write a song and put it out. What it's going to do. Well, you know, and then I'll see a post from some guy who says, you know, that song of yours, Dark Side? Well, I'm bipolar and I suffer from suicidal thoughts every now and again. And when I go down that road, I listen to your song, Dark Side, and it brings me out of it. So I was in tears reading that, you know, there's that's one thing, right? Or because of you, I wanted to get back out in nature. Obviously, survivor man was a big thing for stuff like that. So there's three ways to live. And if not globally, then community wise and doing things with the community. And then there's hybrids too, you know, they're sort of mixing and doing a little bit of both. But selfish is good, but not forever. So I'm not sure I didn't answer a question, but anyway, there you go. Yeah, no, it's great. So you define yourself, just barely as a storyteller. But why is, why are the stories you're telling? Do they revolve around survivalship and the outdoors? I mean, obviously that's a big part of your life, but you could tell any story, you could have any conversation, there's all kinds of experiences you could have. Why does this speak to you? And why do you feel like you want to share this in particular? It's the thing that keeps me most alive that drives me the most. But I don't know why. Why does someone obsess over playing piano? Why does an engineer obsess over coming up with a new way to determine angles and build a build? I just can't not be in love with nature. I can't not be passionate about nature. It's just so easy for me to just to dream and think about nature 24 seven. And so that's what comes out in the work that I do pretty obviously. Now, I'm not a one trick pony. I have other interests and other things and they slip out as well. So I don't know the why, but I do. But the end goal of it is to take someone like you and say like, okay, maybe you're a gamer. Maybe you like living in the middle of Chicago. Maybe you're afraid of bugs. That's fine. But if I could just get you to walk in a forest just for a day on a manicured trail where maybe they've even, God forbid, but maybe they've even sprayed it with paramecium, so there's no mosquito spiting you, whatever. If I could just get you on that trail under a bunch of trees in the park at the end of your road, maybe that's like the minimalist part of my goal is just to get people to reconnect with a tree, if you will. Yeah, and I wish more of us would do that more often. I know that every time I'm out in nature, whether like you said, a walk around our field, looking at the trees and the wildlife or being on a hunt or a camp out, it just grounds us and it's becoming increasingly rare. We live in these concrete jungles and we're always in cubicles and we don't talk to each other or we don't connect and we aren't where we've evolved to be. I wish more people would do this and take advantage of it. It wouldn't make it. First of all, science is behind it now. I mean, the science has been going over that for quite a while. A human being in the hospital suffering requires less painkillers and heals faster if all they could do is see a tree outside their window. Interesting. Now, let's expand that into if they could be in nature. I mean, when you go, you forget aromatherapy, you walk in the woods, there's a billion chemical combinations that are bombarding you. What I love about nature is whether you like it or not, it's working on you. Whether you like, you could go in there with the worst mood of all, vindictive and angry, you know, because like I have to take down my tent platform because the building inspector says it's too big right now. I'm mad about that. If I go walking in the woods just 20 feet to the right of my tent platform, I feel better. So, you know, it works on you whether you want it to or not. And I want to just hop back on one point we made about about this idea of finishing and accomplishing goals. So, a point that I like to make a lot and it's for all the men and women out there listening and whether you're 65 or 25 or everything in between, just remember this about your big idea, your concept, the goal you want to achieve, the thing you want to do, it's yours and yours alone to complete. You can walk in a boardroom and say, here's my idea, everybody, let's all work on this. But if you walk out of that boardroom, it's going to, it most of the time those things just die right on the vine. I mean, I'm not saying if you're a boss and you're giving directors, directors and orders, I mean, if it's your idea, you're the one who has to complete it because you could sit in a room with some people that are really good at the thing that you want to do, it's still up to you to do it. And this is the thing we forget, we think, oh, you know, oh my, and here's what I want to say. Here's how I want to put this and I won't be vulgar, but I do want to put it this way so that we, so that I make my point. Your mom, your wife, your brother, your sister, your kids, your friends, your mentors, they're going to support you, might even lend you a hand, they're going to encourage you, but they don't really give a crap whether you finish it or not. They really don't. They have their own lives to worry about. They have their own goals, their own things to do. They're working on this on that. Oh, you still, yeah, no, you should do that, Les. Yeah, no, yeah, let me know if you need a hand, but they truly in the end, yes, even your mom and your dad, they really don't give a, well, I just want you to be happy, dear, right? It's, it's, it's, it's, that thing that's bringing you that you want to accomplish, it's just you, it's just yours. So, if you're not going to do it, it'll die on the vine. Forget about it. Your minds will just throw it away because with all the good talk around you and everything, that's all lovely, but it's still up to you to get up in the morning to bust a move and to make and to complete it, to finish what you started. Most people, nobody else out there cares whether or not you finish what you start. I have an amazing wife who I adore and who is the most supportive human being I've ever been with. But she's not going to brow beat me into finishing what I started. She's going to just be disappointed when I don't. Right. Right. That's true. It's interesting you say this. I just had a, an exchange, an amicable exchange on social media from a gentleman who seemed to be the way he worded his, his comments that he was, you know, complaining that nobody was in his corner and nobody was happy for him or supported him. And, and my thought and response was why is your action contingent upon whether or not somebody's happy for you? What does that have to do with anything? You try to satisfy yourself. That goes back to the selfish contribution that you were talking about earlier. At first, I think it needs to be that. I want to feel happy with myself. I want to be fulfilled. I want to feel good about being a man in my word, which you alluded to as well. Absolutely. I would say the same thing. I'd say, dude, it's again, it's not about them. And they don't really care. Yeah. That's, this is okay. So here's my insensitive moment where I say, yeah, suck it up. They don't really care. Right. So do you want this thing or don't you? You do really want it. Okay. Are there mentors you can talk to that know how to get this thing? Is there a book you can read? Go listen to Tim Ferris. I don't know, you know, but, but, but suck it up. You know, and again, I can be accused. I don't mean that so harshly. I can be accused of being insensitive that way. But I just think there's a time and a place to say, yeah, no, nobody else cares about this. But I do. And that's how my life was. That's how I was going back to our high school talk. And nobody gave a crap about me and nobody gave a crap about my ideas. But I somehow had enough depth of ego, if you will, to care, to say, but I do, I do, you know, I'll find a way and it took me 30 bloody years, but I found a way. Well, you know, you say, you say that might be the insensitive side of me speaking. But, you know, I'd counter that and say that somebody who's going to tell you the truth or frame an idea or concept in a way that you need to hear it at just the right moment might actually be the best thing that you can do for an individual. Like, I don't necessarily believe that you're being sensitive because you're being soft on somebody or you're sparing them of their feelings. That to me might not be that you're sensitive to what they need at all. That's a very, very good point. And thank you for that, actually, because that's one of my things in life is I'm I'm I love if somebody is blunt with me. I love if somebody is candid and straight with me. I hate beating around the bush. And so by virtue of that, I am that way. But sometimes I fail to recognize that this person would rather beat around the bush. They need some beating around the bush. And I'm like, well, just do that. Right. Yeah, true. You got to read the room a little bit. It's be I was just discussing this this morning, actually, about being situationally aware. You know, and this would be on an interpersonal level being situationally aware. It's like, yeah, this guy needs to hear something straight right now because he's, you know, he's whining. So, he's whining. So he's going to have to hear it. Like he's a whiner. And here you go. Here it is. Or this person is really seeking and they're a little fragile. Okay. Let's let's move a little slowly on this one. That's, that's, as I said, be a little more be a different version of sensitive, I suppose. You I like your point. I like your point a lot. One of the things that we talked about before we hit record is you were talking about the, the children's book that you're writing. And I'm really curious about where this pivot comes from, because this is a new angle for you. Is it was this a goal of yours? Did this pop up? Have you always had an interest in teaching kids and introducing them to the outdoors and survival and all this kind of stuff? Like where does that transition or pivot come from? It's not a pivot at all. Not a transition at all. First of all, as a guide for the aforementioned guiding work, I mean, hundreds and hundreds of kids. I guided out in the wilderness and taught skills and taught canoeing and everything else. So I always had that. I always get along with kids. I adore most ages of kids actually. What's ones don't you adore? That's actually I'm very curious about. I think that's sort of 11 to 15, 16. I could do without that era. Two to 10 is like those little bare feet in their pajamas and they're curled up and they just want to snuggle and you read. I love that. And then as they become older and they're starting to spread their adult, young adult wings, they become, you know, so so that. And then, but with survivor man, you know, I had kids sending me Facebook pictures of them dressed up as me for Halloween. So if that isn't an endorsement, I don't know what is, right? So I knew all along that my manual called survive still available. Still out in the book serves now. Bound for bound. I will put it up against any survival book out there, including the SAS survival book. We can we get in that on another conversation, but I did that book and it's owned by thousands and thousands of kids. So I knew kids just adore nature. They love nature inherently as we all did at one point. And they're much less afraid of it, especially when they're young. So this book gave me the opportunity to speak directly to them, to tell them my stories, to teach lessons through the stories, to give them some things they can do at home, all in the form that I'm not talking to your teacher or your mom or your dad. I'm talking to you. And so it was an opportunity for to do something that I've always been doing, but just direct to them. Right. And it probably goes into that, I don't want to reach 10 people. I want to reach 10 million people, or in this case, 10 million kids. And I can do it this way through this medium and this outlet and technology that we have access to. Absolutely. And, you know, Anac Press out of Toronto. Originally, I approached them because I wanted to write fiction. I wanted to write fiction and adventure stories. But you know, that my, I guess, the stigma, if you will, of survival man is that, well, but you've written all these nonfiction books and you're a documentary. How about a nonfiction book that I'll stay in your life, stay in my life. Right. Sure. And then one day I will write my novel and I will write my nonfiction books and I'll prove them wrong. Yes, I like it. I'm anxious to see, you know, it is interesting with kids too. I've noticed this specifically in my oldest son, because he's very enamored with nature and wildlife. You know, children are not so busy. They don't, they don't come up with excuses. They don't get as bored. They can, they're creative and they're thoughtful and they see things differently than we do. My oldest son yesterday said, dad, there's a turkey in our field, which isn't uncommon. And I said, okay, you know, that's yes. And he said, well, he's injured. I'm like, well, how do you know? He's like, I walked down there and I saw him hobbling around. And so this morning, even before I got home and I get home early from jujitsu, about seven o'clock in the morning, I got home and he wasn't in the house. I'm like, where's my son? Where's Brecken? And he was out in the field trying to find this turkey, you know, because he's injured. And he actually saw him and he saw him hobble off. And he just spent an hour out there wandering around chasing this turkey. And I think you're hitting on it right now is that they just love it. And if we could just hone it and refine it and instruct it and foster it, man, the world would be a different place. Well, I would go heavy on the last word, foster it, you know, because true to for me, you don't want them doing things that are destructive out there inadvertently. So you want to teach them that way, absolutely. But fostering it. Yeah. And that's that whole discount. So I have to hold your oldest son, if I'm asked 13 is 13. Wonderful. Okay, we're going to get that horrible age you hate that horrible age. You said wonderful, but you already told me earlier, you hate that age. Well, you're in for it for the next few years. I do hear and I would agree in my case, boys are easier than girls. And when you're the guy, when you're the dad, so you can, because you can be the buddy, right? And I'm best friends with my son. My son is 23 now, and he's a wildfire fighter and a paramedic. And he and I are as close as two high school friends, which I absolutely adore. And I got him out in nature a lot. So but fostering it, you're getting them out there. And allowing them to experience it on their terms. You know, empowering our kids to do things on their terms is a really big thing for me as a father, always has been a cycle. Okay, you want to do it that way? And it's like, I can see no harm is going to come of it. It's the wrong way to do it. But it's the way he wants to do it. So I've already suggested another way, but he wants to do it this way. Okay, go for it. You know, obviously we're being we're being the protectors, we're making sure that there's no danger involved and stuff like that. But I think that's wonderful that that that you said did that. We'll have to make sure we get you a copy of what outside for him. Oh, yeah, he'd be all about it. Well, you're you're also touching on something I wrote down here that I want to do address with you. One thing that I think you do a great job with is making sure that you don't show only and exclusively you doing everything right and correct and accurate. You seem to be so well rounded and confident enough that you're willing to show some of the things that don't work out or the things where you maybe made a mistake or stepped in the wrong place. And I really respect somebody who can show that well rounded picture as opposed to just the just the highlight reel. Just to hear our moments. Right, exactly. Well, thank you for the for the wonderful comment compliment of well roundedness. And I think and confidence, yes, they're there. That is there in my skills as a wilderness individual adventure or if you're well or survival guy. However, the motivation behind it, because if you watch the survivor man episodes, all I'm really doing in every single episode is teaching. I'm just teaching. So we had to leave it, you know, without survivor man, you don't have the rest of the industry and it comes to survival TV. You don't have alone naked and afraid members as well. Right. You don't and without the man. When they happened because they saw how successful mine had become, they didn't endeavor to teach anything. Not really. They were looking for sensationalistic things in the different survival books and say, you guys do this one now, entertain us, right? So their goal was not to teach. My goal was to be from the beginning to the end and still is to teach. And we all know that failure is a great teacher. And so if I had something like, if you said to me, Hey, Les, have you ever heard about starting a fire with, you know, a pop can and a piece of chocolate, you know, I've heard that you could polish it and do it, get started a fire, you know. So I did that on one of the episodes, for example, I did not practice that ahead of time. Anything that I could do that I only just heard about, I'm like, I'm not going to practice it. Because if I practice it, who am I? I'm guru guy. Look at me. I'm good at everything I do. If I don't practice it and I fail, you see it basically live sort of thing, you see it live right there and then I go, Okay, I blew it. And I have my shelter burned down. I've made some crappy shelters, things like that, to show that, that you know, that's what you're going to do. You're not going to get a fire going every time with a little twig and some thread. You're going to fail. So you might as well see me fail. Because if I fail, now you can see me get out of the mess I'm in. Okay, I failed. I don't have a fire tonight. And I've spent all my time on the fire. I didn't make a shelter. What am I going to do now? Right? And that and and now we have what is real drama? What's really going on? And that's that's why I love I love showing failure that way. And and quickly, I'll just say that with the father son conversation and father daughter conversation. When my kids ask me any question, I always answer honestly, even if it's painful. Obviously, there was a time when I filtered it for age a little bit. Sure, right. But for the most part, if they asked me dad, did you ever do this? Or did you ever do that? And I knew the answer was yes, I'd say yes. And then that would become a two hour conversation. Right? Because then I could explain myself and why and this and that and and and and so yeah, I think it's at the same sort of philosophy. It's like as a father showing my kids that yeah, I'm a failure too. I have lots of failures in my life, but I'm still going, you know? Well, and you know, one of the other powerful points of sharing the truth and sharing the failures and the setbacks as well as the victories is you're setting up realistic expectations for those you're trying to lead. So the people who are following you and watching who may want to get it more closely connected with nature or get into survival scenarios, they're going to see that and have a realistic expectation versus just assuming that everything goes right. And then when they find themselves in a dangerous situation, they either don't they don't keep themselves protected or they think shitty of themselves because well, you know, like everybody else I follow along with is just perfect. So what's wrong with me? And it creates, I think, a confidence issue that doesn't need to be there. Unrealistic expectations. Absolutely. And I think that goes all the way back to one of your very first questions, which is why women versus men in a wilderness situation. I don't think women have those big expectations, but as men, right, I'm going to have the best fire, the best shelter. I'll probably even catch a gross. Well, we're all these students on this weekend of survival, they're going to see, they're going to see how I do, you know, and I don't think women go into it like that. Do you find that along the same lines that women are more willing to ask questions than men are because of the reason you're explaining right now? The reason why I'm pausing is because the short answer is yes, but my my hesitancy is because I'm not that guy. I ask everybody everything. I have no ego saying, Hey, I really I'm not getting this. How do I do it? Like I have no problem asking. You know, I roll as well. I do jujitsu. Oh, do you? Oh, good. I didn't know that. Yeah, I'm up to up to roll sometime. And you got to be great. Pin me in four seconds. I'll tap out in four seconds. And same thing there, you know, a good case in point, for example, my personality is such that so I'm there and let's face it, they all know who I am. They all know that it's survival man's in our club. Right, right. Now, of course, the bad part is I've got like a lot of 30 year olds who are ripped and and you know, blue belt and they want to, you know, they want to make survival man taps like yes, you target at this point. I have a tie back. But I'm never afraid in those classes to go. Can you show me that again? Because I just I'm not getting where my arms supposed to go. I keep why, you know, and so I have I've just never so anyway, I'm being me and even bottom line is I'm not that guy. I have no problem asking questions. I'll ask for directions. Here's here's my my this is not going endear me to any women who might be listening. But my my my one, I think I only have two moments in my life where I'm just blatantly sexist and I kind of I'm very sorry, but I don't apologize at the same time. And one of them is is asking directions. I just like I'm done it a thousand times and I will I will actually not pull over to ask a woman directions anymore. Every woman that there's just so mad at me right now. I know I'm sorry, but I've tried so hard and just like, of course I will have men be pretty bad at too. But if I'm gambling, I'll look for a guy. Yeah. Yeah. Well, look, yeah. I think we all have those moments and those things that that that we're we're dealing with. So again, I appreciate the transparency and you sharing all of it for sure. Yeah. Well, I'm transparency is is, you know, the thing about the transparency in myself and the candidates is it enables me to be me. It means that I never have to come come back at you and say, oh, did I say that before? Oops. I never I don't ever want to be in that position. You know, we were early on, I was asked to cheat survivor man. That's how these other shows were created because I refuse to cheat my show. What do you mean by cheat? Have a crew build the stuff, sleep in a hotel every night, fake the whole thing. Got it. Make a show. Right. And I remember the first time I was asked and I looked at the guy, the producer guy, and I said, listen, the way this show is going, I may very well end up finding myself sitting across from Jimmy Fallon, you know, which I did, by the way. Yeah. Or Ellen or somebody like that, which I did. I don't want to be sitting there and have them say to me, so what was it like that that night when the tiger came in and that, you know, and I'm going, oh, it was all a bunch of crap. We made it up. I said, I'm not going to be that guy. No way. I don't want to ever have to be because you guys can all walk away. I'm the guy on the television screen, sitting, talking to somebody, supposedly being an honest man. I won't do it. You know, so that's what the transparency comes in. I think it's easier to be transparent as far as I'm concerned. Definitely over the long haul because you're not having to trip all over yourself and stumble all over yourself or get caught and all these other things. And then not to mention the real motive, which is just being truthful to yourself and being able to look the man in the mirror right in the eye and be okay with that. Yeah. And listen, none of us are saints. Every single one of us has regret and regretful things we've said, regretful things we've done. And I remind myself of this fact all the time, if I were to be critical to someone else, is to remind me. So if yeah, don't forget about you, Les, don't forget some of the crap you've done. And honestly, I don't think that'll ever change. I think to my grave, I'll be someone tiptoeing around the temptation to even just fib, you know, the temptation. And I will again, I will fib again. I don't think I'll lie again right now. We're now we're getting nuanced, aren't we? We're really slicing it down. But you know what I mean? Like, you know, I just, I think everyone should understand that is we're none of us. Okay, I'm a fan of the Avengers movies. And so one of the great lines I just I just heard from Loki was, if there's one thing that I've learned in all of this, is that nobody that is bad is truly bad. And nobody that is good is truly good. And I thought, damn, I wish I'd said that. Maybe you can rephrase it or something like that. But the point is well taken. Well, Les, I really respect you. I appreciate you coming on. I know you've got some projects you've got Wild Outside, which is the children's book coming out. You've got the surviving disasters, which is the that's a PBS is that a documentary or a series? What exactly is that? So it's actually a pledge special. So you know, on America, public television, they do the pledge specials you can phone in and you can. So they highlighted it for that it'll be back on in August for a couple of weeks. And then they keep putting it on every few months as a pledge special, it's called surviving disasters with less drought. And this is a documented instructional piece, if you will, on how your aunt and uncle who live in Florida can handle the next hurricane. It's it's not about preppers. It's not about having your bug out bag. And it is, of course, that's in there. But it's about what all the regular people need to know to prepare for earthquakes, hurricanes, tornadoes, windstorms, flooding, blackouts, freeze outs, all of that. And really proud of that. So that's a 90 minute documentary that's on PBS and it's a pledge special. And then I also have on the PBS stations, it's all presented by American public television. It goes on the PBS stations with less crowds, wild harvest. And this is a bit of an extension of surviving man in a way. It's focused entirely on, I take you out and I show you all the local wild animals stuff that's on your lawn right outside the room you're in right now or wherever there's a closest bit of anything growing. I'll take red out there. Plus we go further afield, show you all the local wild ingredients that you can harvest. And then I'll bring one or two or three home. And then I give them to chef Paul Rogalski from Calgary, Alberta. And he turns them into a five star meal. And so you really, it's nothing but it's not about survival. It's it that's one of my points is I it's a lot of these plants all I know them for it's surviving. Now Paul turns them into this amazing dish, you know, whether it's dandelion or fireweed or sometimes we go we we've had some some meat in the show as well here and there. We even did roadkill. Oh, you did interesting. What was it? Well, the longer story is simply we went out to go harvest mushrooms pine mushrooms, Masutakis. And we did that day a huge amount. It was amazing. We just pulled out of my driveway in the middle of the road laying there unbloodied, unbroken just obviously been clicked on the head while Turkey. Oh, yeah. So I brought it home still warm brought at home and we showed and I and I said, look, I know roadkill sound it sounds repugnant, but look what we made honestly was the best Turkey I ever had in my life. So right. So anyway, that's less jobs while harvest on public television. Surviving disasters with less drought on public television, my new book Wild Outside for Children ages anywhere from seven to 15. And then and lastly for anybody who actually doesn't mind my music at all. I might my big sort of rock progressive rock album that features slash and Steve Vi called Mother Earth. I'm putting it out on double it's a double vinyl album coming out very soon. Oh, cool. Busy busy for sure. Always. Well, you know, I and all fairness here and truth is that I thought this conversation would go completely different than it did. We didn't talk hardly anything about tactics and strategies and survival and all that stuff. But this is an important conversation. We went way deeper into some things. Yeah, next time. But the conversation we had was great. Suffice it to say, guys, if you really want to know about survival and the tactics and the strategies, less is your guy. So there's plenty of information out there. And now you get to see a different side of him and some deeper conversations and thoughtfulness that we had today, which was good, I think. Well, my friend, I mean, you led the questions and you can see if you leave me down those. There's things that I love to talk about and you brought a lot of them up today. All right, man, there you go. My conversation with the one and only less drought. I hope you enjoyed that podcast and that conversation as much as I did. I'm really trying to be better at this conversationalist thing and almost in a way allow you to be a bit of a fly on the wall or even feel like you're participating in these discussions because I've got access to incredible men like less and others. And I want to make sure that I'm empowering you with what you need. So please let me know what you think about the show. Good, bad and different. Also reach out to Les shoot him a message on Instagram or Twitter or Facebook, wherever he's doing the social media thing and wherever you are and let him know that you heard him on the Order of Man podcast. Because you know, I like to get the credit for that. But more importantly than that, I want these guys to know that you listening value what it is they have to share and say. So connect with Les, check out his YouTube channel where a lot of his videos and information is and resides. And I think you're going to learn a lot, not only from him regarding the subjects we touched on today, but also deeper into the survival world, the tactics and strategies, which is something all of us should be working on to some degree or another. All right, guys, with that said, please leave the rating and reviews goes a long way. I don't care where you're listening.
