    "text": " And now from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN, the AX files with your host, David Axelrod. Fred Hotberg has a great story and there are a lot of chapters to it as an entrepreneur, as head of the Small Business Administration, as chairman of the Exporti Import Bank, as a Democratic activist and as one of the country's leading advocates for gay and lesbian rights. Fred Hotberg is currently a fellow at the Institute of Politics and we sat down to talk about his life and career and the issues on which he's played such a big role. Fred Hotberg, it's great to see you. I want to thank you on the front end, as I will on the back, for being a fellow at the Institute of Politics, this fall. You've been a great asset to us here and to these students and good to see you here. The great benefit of doing this podcast is I learned about people who I thought I knew and the thing, I vaguely knew the story of your family. It's really an impressive story and your mom's story is an impressive story. Tell me about your family. Well, my mom was born in Leipzig in Germany in 1927 and she had an older brother named Zigfried whom I named. I thank my parents every day, they did not name me Zigfried but just Fred. It's not Fred, because it's not Alvigos, it's just Fred. In 1933, my mother's brother was a few years older, she was like nine. Kind of got roughed up by some Nazi Hitler youth and pushed down a flight of stairs and I think that was the last straw for my grandfather and he said we have to get out. They moved to Holland. They probably wouldn't have survived. They probably wouldn't have survived. What's remarkable is one third of the German Jews left Germany. If you think about it, if you're living in the community and one out of three franges leaving, this is not like a, you should be asking the question, what did they know that I don't know? So it was a sizable portion got out in advance. They went to Holland, they went to Amsterdam and they figured that bought them time and they looked at, they went to a trip to Palestine. My grandfather came to Havana and actually it was when President Obama opened up in Cuba that reminded my mother, she says, you know your grandfather went to Havana, I remember that now and she had forgotten. And then New York and then decided on New York. I could have been a Cuban American for all I know, it was almost. Yeah. That was later in the day. It was 1937. So actually my grandfather was already in America and my grandmother went to get her visa extended and the consular officer were not extending visas but you still have a week, you should get on a boat because if you get on the boat they'll let you get off the boat and they got on a boat. They packed up within a few days or a week. My mother, her brother and my grandmother and some furniture and sale to America. Yeah. What I was going to say was as you pointed out it got harder and harder and people were turned away. Obviously St. Louis is a historic and tragic story of Jews being turned away and sent back to Europe. My grandfather clearly was a smart man that he had the foresight and he had some enough cash to get out. So tell me about your mom because she was really a pioneer in business. You know, so she got here in 1937, went to Hunter High School, went to NYU and she got married at the age of 22. So in those days she got quote unquote her MRS, she got married, she never finished college and she always said, well I wanted to have a little extra money. My dad had a dry goods store and she wanted a little extra cash. So her father manufactured pocketbooks, belts, wallets, small leather goods and my mom would actually go to the better stores in New York and she had a good eye and she would buy them and the crash word is knock them off. The polite word is I said they tastefully reinterpreted them for them. And she so they would. Is that on advice of counsel? Yes, they tastefully reinterpreted them. So she'd go to Lord and tailor and places like that. And so he made these leather goods and she was sort of the designer and then she got the idea of selling them in 17 magazine and she put an ad in the magazine, took 2000s and 1000s of their wedding money, which was a lot of money in 1951 and bet it all. And that ad was probably the best ad the company ever ran in 60 years. You still have that ad? You still have a copy of the 17 magazine that have the ad and that launched the business. Because the Lillian Vernon line became a catalog and quite a business. So it actually started as it was called Vernon Specialties and then it turns out, not surprisingly David, there was a plumbing supply company with the same name in Mount Vernon. So it became Lillian Vernon Specialties and that was like a mouthful. So they just dropped the specialties and became Lillian Vernon. And how did the business grow? So it started with just ads and ladies home journal, red book, cause you know, teen magazines, like things like that. And then in the very late 50s came out. So they would have the ads and people would mail in there. And in those days they mailed in cash and my job was to take those singles and put them in packs of 50, take the quarters, nickels and dimes, and roll them and you know roll them. And I would go to the bank of my mom and we didn't have an ad in machine and I would sit on the bank to manage his desk and I would actually add up the checks. So we had a deposit slip and how many people said it's like it's a wonderful life. It's a wonderful life. So it was, it was, you know, it had very simple beginnings, you know, and I don't think had the great ambition that developed over time. And my mom and dad got divorced in 70, 69. So I think she then sort of more fully devoted herself to the business. And then I joined it. And I joined the business in 75. Was it always your intent to do that? Was that your? Pretty much so. Your ambition? And just as an early day, in those days, color printing was really expensive. So we would take one page in the catalog would be all the copy and the color would be only photographs on the following page because that way you had waste color by having copy on it. Right. So, you know, but that was a different era of printing and production of anything else. Now she says that you're joining the business was a kind of a watershed event in terms of growing the business. What did you do with that business that turned it into started off as a successful business. But I think when you, I read somewhere when you came, it was a $5 million business that ran into a $200 million a year business. She had the creative spark. She had, you know, her book is called The Knife and Winter. She had a great eye for spotting products and trends early on. One of the keys in the business was we did a lot of things monogram. We put your name on anything and anything and everything you can imagine. So I think when I came, I came out of business school and I was the only person with a college degree at the company. And we, you know, I felt it was like a high school student who had never exercised. This was, the raw material was there, but we hadn't really analyzed the data. We didn't really expand it out. I think when I got there, took her from 51 to 75 to get to $5 million, I think we thought, well, God, if we double the business to $10 million, that'll be a lot. And I applied, and this is a lot of things. You had gotten an MBA at Columbia. So, yeah. So I applied, you know, some marketing, polling, market research, some financial models, stuff I learned in business school. And we were able to figure out what we actually did in a minute is we would calculate sales per square inch in the catalog, the way a store calculates still per square foot. And we started products that sold a lot. We put more of those in, sold the didn't per square inch. We put less in and we started really managing the enterprise. And I got there in 75 by 86. We were well over $100 million. It is Forbes described as one of the great success stories of American entrepreneurship. You went public in 1987. First time a company founded by a woman went public. So that's quite a legacy. It was very heady. She really wanted, I think she wanted that acknowledgement. I remember once you J.A. wanted to honor her as like, you know, leading business woman, she goes, no, I can be a business person. I'm not going to be the woman business person. I acknowledge we've- She's ahead of her time. She was way ahead of her time. Yeah. I mean, we had more. We had so many women executives. They said there's not enough men in this company. Now you, but you guys had some sort of falling out, right? You over succession. Yes. Like she didn't want to leave the business. She didn't want to leave the business. What happened was I turned the, it was partly the tyranny of the calendar. I turned 40, the year she turned 65. And I had a lot of people saying, okay, you know, you're present. You're going to, when are you going to really run this place, going to be the CEO and take over? So I'm getting, I'm like revving and people are saying to her, you're going to retire you're 65 now. She's like digging. She's revving in the other direction. I almost think there are times I wonder if our birthdays did not coincide in the same year. Maybe that we would have been a little more relaxed about it. But it, yeah, it came to a head. I turned 40 and 92 and I left a year later. And was that- Was it a painful thing? Oh, we didn't talk for about a year, year and a half. That's tough. That was, I mean- Not exactly an advertisement for going into business with your family. It's a challenge to go into. Family businesses are a challenge. I've talked to other people about it. I mean, it, because one day in the same, in the same 20 minutes, you're a business partner, you're going to subordinate and it's your mother. Or father. And that's a lot of different roles to try and keep meshing together. Yeah. Maybe we could have found somebody who would have been a, there are a number of consultants now who do this kind of work, work with family businesses. Somehow we didn't deploy that. But I don't, you know- Let me say, and I think I can, I have leave to say it, the dynamics of a Jewish family has its own complications. Has its own complications. And, you know, to be honest with you, being open the gay, I'm sure, added another whole dimension to that. Yeah. Well, let me ask you about that. Talk to me about, you, you, you came of age in a generation, we're in an entirely different time now and good that we are. But how, how was it for you as a kid in claiming your own identity? It was very tricky then. I sort of, I came out, I called it sort of the PSPA post-Stonewall pre-AIDS in the 70s. And, you need to start, Barney Frank has sort of come out retail. First, you start coming out to yourself and, and figure out what's going on here. And I actually, as it became more clear to me, I actually decided to go to therapy and I, I was on the couch for 20 plus years. Just try and just come to terms with it, which would be very different today. Yeah. It was a much more hostile environment. When you say come to, yeah, come to terms with it, tell me about that. Well, I mean, I remember first I got to the therapist and I never forget I get there. After the first session, he says, maybe you want to lie down on the couch. I was that anxious. And you know, it took me within six months, I'm talking about being homosexual, not gay, I really said, so should we like do shock treatment? I mean, what do we do? You know, I, because you thought that was somehow, that was, yeah. So it was, it was a very, you know, it was, it was a very inhospitable time. And did you, and did you talk to your parents about this? Not for, no, I didn't talk to my, so when I came out to my mother, I had a, I met somebody and we were living together. And in those days, it was pre-cell phone. He had his own phone and I had to be at two phones in the apartment. Just to keep up of a fiction for those who you want to. Right. So, so I remember she co-found somehow got his name, calls the phone. No, doesn't say anything. He picks up, hangs up. One minute later, my phone rings. Hi, sweetheart. Are you home? Are you home alone? Anybody, really? So I ultimately came out to her because I said, all right, I'm living with a guy and I, this is, so in those days I started the conversation saying that I was bisexual. I figured that was a way of easing into the subject. Which I wasn't. I mean, I had sex with him, but I, I figured that was- Plus, that'll make it easier for her. A little easier for her to come accommodate to it. But she had a really rough time. She had a rough time. I mean, she talked about, she was going to exile herself to Europe and move back to Europe. Really? Yeah. I'm going to move to Switzerland. I don't think I can tell with this. That's, that's painful. Yeah, it was pretty intense. And we were working together. Yeah. It had a lot of drama in it, in that regard. You know, and you can tell suppliers of what a company, people in the company say, or people to business with. So it took a lot of, I'm very fortunate I found a good therapist and worked through a lot of that stuff. Yeah. You feel it would be much different today. Oh, it's totally different. My generation, everybody of my generation has a coming out story. You know, there's some passage that you've come out to your family, to your friends. Today, a lot of kids don't come out. They're just, they're out. It's not something they have to, it's not a migration. So and it's also, and it's younger. And there's acceptance. Yeah. Much more acceptance. Much more every day. Yeah, I've met a number of students here who are fellows who talked about it. And I remember when I was at the Small Business Administration jumping ahead, you know, I'd have parents come and talk to me because it's all right, my boss is gay. Maybe you can help me. How do I talk to my son or daughter? So yeah, I mean, we as a country made enormous strides. You know, I had a conversation like this with Barney Frank last year and he described his own very difficult journey and how painful it was to have to kind of hide who he was and how lonely it was for him. It was very poignant. You know, as he described going to fundraisers and people would come as couples and he'd go home alone. So now did you- And finally Barney did come up with the concept of don't ask, don't tell, because that was Barney's life. I know it's that a lot of that policy that happened to him because Barney was influential. This is also partly, you know, that's how Barney navigated the world. Yeah. You were part of the Clinton administration. What was your thought when the don't ask, don't tell policy about the military was developed? Well, I actually was the finance chair of something called the Campaign for Military Service, which was sort of a coalition of different civil rights organizations that was working to build support for what we thought President Clinton wanted to do in terms of integrating the military. So I left Lillian Vernon and literally within 10 days I moved myself to Washington and I worked here for Washington for six months as the finance chair working in finance and strategy with Tom Stoddard and a number of other people on that. And we thought- And that was Clinton's intention to integrate gays into the military. Totally. Ran into a political buzz saw and then kind of retreated to the don't ask him. Sam Anand was no help. Yeah. Who was chairman of the armed service committee. And he got passed over for Secretary of Defense so whether he had his own personal peak with the president about it, but he certainly made it difficult. And what was your reaction when that became the policy? Well, it was enormous disappointment. I mean, we all, you know, we raised something like $10 million, which was a lot of money in the 90s to try and raise for- I remember when that used to be a lot of money in politics. Yes, exactly. That was a lot of money those days. And so it was, I remember listening to the speech, and Bill Clinton was genius at this, you know, we're listening. And as we're listening to that, I think he's going in our direction. You know, he was so smart at honoring both sides. Yes, salamonic. Totally. So we're sitting there and then at the end we say, all right, we got the rhetoric, they got the policy. It took another 17 years and President Obama did it, but it took 17 more years to get there. Yeah, I was in the room when, and you were too, I'm sure, when the president, President Obama signed the policy of repealing that. That was one of the most moving days. I have a choice. That was one of the most moving days. And you know what's the most moving thing about it? Was the ovation that Admiral Mullen God, who was chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who started off not necessarily that comfortable with the change in policy and ended up being one of its great champions. I remember the initial meetings in the administration when the president said, I'm not, Mullen, Secretary of Defense Gates. There were some others there. General Cartwright, who was the vice chair of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and the president said, I didn't ask you here to discuss this. I asked you here to tell you that I want to change this policy. We're going to change this policy, but I want to do it in a way that's not disruptive, and I want your cooperation. And it was really a process. And as you know, he came under a lot of fire from the community for not doing it fast enough, but he wanted to do it legislatively. And that was the right way to go. Totally. I mean, we're seeing now the problem with executive orders. They have kind of a short life. Right. Right. So, tell me, you started off reluctantly, and then you really became an activist in the community. So that was quite a transition. Yeah, the way I understand that David is, I think, I don't want to be a victim. And one thing about building your own sense of self and self as a self esteem is to actively do something about it. So I think I got involved in the late 70s on LGBT issues. I think it was just called gay issues then. Yes, yeah. With Lambda Legal Defense and others. To me, I think it was a healing process. I think a way of healing that pain is to do something about it and to work on it. And that actually made it, I was actively fixing something versus just feeling bad. And so it was as much a personal journey as it was a political journey. We're going to take a short break and we'll be right back with Fred Hotberg. Very scary people. The podcast is back. I'm Donnie Wahlberg. And in season two, we're diving into the story of Paul Bernardo and Carla Humulka. It seemed like they were the perfect couple, the Ken and Barbie Dream marriage. We expect our monsters to look like monsters and they don't always find out how the couple next door became the killers known as Ken and Barbie. Listen to very scary people, the Ken and Barbie killers wherever you get your podcasts. As you point out, we've made tremendous progress in this country on this issue. Obviously the marriage issue was a huge, huge, huge step forward. But we still have these issues still linger with us. President Trump has now rolled back the rights of transgender Americans to serve. This is now a matter of legal contention. So these battles still go on. The battles still go on and the progress is fragile. It's very fragile. And I think the transgender issue has just been harder. In many ways, there's some aspects of it are better and easier because some of the best advocates on transgender issue are mothers and fathers who have children who are trans. I saw one of the Human Rights Campaign Dinner just last weekend. It was so moving. It was a nine-year-old son. But for many parts of society, we're very binary and so it's confusing to people. There's a story I never will forget with Ted Kennedy. I was with Ted Kennedy in 2004 during the Kerry campaign and he was doing a press conference on hate crimes and he asked me to comment so I came and at the end of it he leans over and says, Fred, I don't know what to do with these trisectuals. I just don't know. I said, Senator, they're transgender. They're not trisectual. And here was one of the greatest advocates for LGBT issues the Senate had ever seen. And he was trying to, one, I think emotionally square it and also politically, because I remember him saying, I got all these senators to agree on gay and lesbian. I have to now go back and get them all to rethink and add another dimension to be cosponsors of an employment bill. So, you know, he, and now granted that, it's over a decade ago. But so I think that it's been harder. And society's made, I think, made remarkable progress on the transgender issue in very short time. I mean, that comment with Ted Kennedy was 13, 14 years ago. You know, one mark of the progress that we've made generally on these issues is the fact that your appointment to run the SBA was a matter of some controversy back in the 90s in the Clinton administration. Talk about that. Well, so I worked on President Clinton's first campaign, worked on his, and then worked again in 1996. And it was the day after election day, and he had a receiving line at the building museum in Washington and said, you know, he's getting well-wishers. And I remember I walked up to him and shook his head, and I said, congratulations. And I knew him at that point having worked on 92 and things in between. I don't think I rehearsed it. I simply said, Mr. President, I want to come work for you. And he turned around. He said, well, call Nancy Hernreich tomorrow. So she came to your business car, and I go, would you do what the President says, call someone in the morning? Call them in the morning. Yes. So there were a couple of jobs open, and ultimately the SBA seemed like the right place. Well, it makes you, you, you were a star entrepreneur and a small businessman. Right. Actually, I really understood those, the people we were serving. But that nomination ran into a buzz saw. It took over seven months. It was been part held up. I got direct confirmation of it being gay. You know, it was like, oh, well, clearly this is one more quota filling, incompetent, unqualified person that President Clinton is sending to the Senate, and we're going to just stole them. Yeah. There were other appointments. Yes. Robert Achtenberg had a challenging time. Jim Hormel had to get a recess appointment. It was very different than, you know, when President Obama came through, and that was not an issue in the confirmations. Yeah. So that's really a measure of the progress we made. Talk to me about your tenure at the SBA. You know, up until working for President Obama, that was the greatest job I ever had. It was a great job. I was there for the second half of the Clinton administration. I'm always proud of the fact we almost quadrupled loans to women and minorities, and at the time we didn't even double them in total. So we did it, and we speeded up service times. We automated many parts of the agency. And I really got to learn about a lot of businesses. And most importantly, I learned how to work in government. Yeah. I always thank President Clinton for having given, having the confidence that gave me my first job in government, because, you know, it's very different than the private sector, than the public sector, and some people have a reference to president. President's learning that, right? Yes, he's learning that, Leon. Well, talk to me about small businesses in our economy and what the challenges are. I mean, there is a concern about small business creation today, and the pace at which businesses are being created. Some, you know, if there were Republican here, they would say, well, this is the result of burdensome regulation. But what do you say about all of this? Well, we are in a period where small business formation is at a low point. It's not clear. You know, it's hard to determine exactly why. How much of that has to do with, you know, access to capital, which is what the SBA really provides, access to capital price, a guarantee to induce a bank to make a loan. So there is that. There are a lot of, there are a lot of sort of, whether it be a person having a two person or one person computer tech company that does, you know, programs, you know, laptop at home. So there are a lot of those kind of businesses. A lot of them are one person businesses. We're also in the gig economy where that may also be overshadowing some of the aspects of it. Does it worry you? Oh, sure it worries me because a lot of innovation comes from small businesses. And we still in our head have that as part of the American dream that you're going to start a business and build a business and give it to your kids. Right. You know, one of the things that strikes me is that we see a lot of consolidation going on in businesses, in business. The internet has created an opportunity for large scale enterprises to overwhelm smaller business. It's also given an opportunity, you know, we dealt with a number of small food companies, you know, at Exim Bank that there's a barbecue sauce company or a small winery that actually can go online, have a web presence, ship anywhere in the world and either access if they need to, SBA or XM financing if needed. So in many ways that's true, but it's also opened it up and made that much more possible. So there's an alternative that just say, well, I have this great barbecue sauce. I've got to find supermarkets to sell. I can sell direct. Yeah. The other side of the equation is the Amazon phenomenon where you can order almost anything from Amazon and the small retailers are facing enormous pressure. You know, I mean, walking around Hyde Park, you just see this still more and more empty storefronts because it's hard and harder to make that work. Yes. I wonder whether there's going to be some pushback against all of this consolidation. I mean, you can't stop technology and there is a certain ease to sitting at your kitchen table and ordering stuff and having it show up at your doorstep. On the other hand, you know, it's tough on communities. It's tough on communities. It's tough on the tax base of communities because, you know, I mean, what we're going to be seeing with a number of shopping malls that are going to be vacant because once they start to, you know, once a certain percentage become vacant, then everybody wants to walk into a mall where a third of the stores are empty. And what's going to happen to that? What's how we're going to repurpose that real estate and what that's going to do with the tax base for a lot of communities that rely on real estate taxes? I don't think we've figured all that out yet. You took a break in between your public service at the New School, the Milano School of International Affairs Management and Urban Policy doing somewhat the same sort of things we're doing here at the Institute of Politics. But you came back to public service under the Obama administration. As head of what is, it turns out, a pretty controversial agency, the Export-Import Bank. I think a lot of people don't know what the Export-Import Bank is. So, uh... Sure. So, well, one reason I took a pause at the Milano was we had a Republican in the White House. I would have much preferred to worked in Washington, but that wasn't an option. So, your students benefited from your hiatus. I met with a Harris student saying, talks about it a little bit. So what the Export-Import Bank does very briefly was actually started by FDR. And interestingly, the very first transaction ever done was actually selling currency to Cuba. The Exem Bank took US American silver and minted into coins in Philadelphia. We sold them their first currency, or maybe not on first one of the early currencies. So what the Exem Bank does, it exists for one purpose only, supporting US jobs. So, if you're a small business, there's a company here, Darlie, that makes fire trucks. They have to some of them here in Illinois and the rest, I think, is in Wisconsin. Yeah, in Wisconsin. So, they sell fire trucks to places like Lagos in Nigeria to China. And they have to compete with German companies, Dutch companies, and Chinese companies. And each of those competitors come with financing when they're selling their firefighting equipment in those countries. In other words, excuse me, financing for the people who are buying their equipment. Exactly. You know, it's a little bit like here at the University of Chicago. I mean, no one applies to college. And after they get in and said, oh, now how am I going to pay $300,000 for the next four years? You have to think about it in advance. So if a community or a country's buying firefighting equipment or a jet airplane or whatever, the financing is integral to the sales proposition. So we would provide, for a fee, a guaranteed loan so that JP Morgan Chase, Citibank, HSBC, any bank, any U.S. bank, would make a loan to the municipality of Lagos. We would guarantee it for a fee. And with that fee, that was enough to give comfort to financial institution to make the loan because there are concerns about credit worthiness, but frankly, with a full faith in credit backing of the U.S. government, the bank will make the loan and the buyers don't like the default on the U.S. government. I always say it's not a good idea. It's a fault on Uncle Sam. But so basically you're providing financing for people overseas and that has come under attack for a variety of reasons. And so the other thing we would do, and a company with it is Charlie also, sometimes needs working capital so they can buy the equipment and so forth. And sometimes local, their local bank may not be comfortable because they say, well, all of our sales are overseas and they go, well, what if you don't get paid? So we will provide a guarantee to the bank to make a working capital loan so they can buy the inventory and do that. 90% of the customers at the Exynbank are small businesses. So sometimes people think, oh, Exyn is the bank of Boeing and bank of big companies, but let's remember that it's not 90% of the dollars, but it is 90% of the transactions are small companies. Yeah, but the buzzsaw that you ran into is that the Koch brothers and some others of a libertarian bent viewed the Exynbank as intruding on the market. In other words, greasing deals that wouldn't otherwise happen. Ted Cruz called it crony capitalism or whatever and said he would do anything he could to stop it. And the continued operation of the Exynbank was very much in doubt. Right. We had a tough reauthorization in 2012 and then we actually lapsed our authority to make new loans in 2015 for over five months. Because they wouldn't approve members to your board and you needed a... Well, two things. We're one of the... Exynbank is one of the few agencies, the expert input bank, that is a sunset agency. So the ability to make loans and do work actually the authority sunset. It's very unusual in federal government. So the authority lapsed and then shortly thereafter the board we lost our quorum because terms were up and then nobody wanted to be re-nominated while we were a lapsed agency. And then by the time we got re-authorized in December 15, one of the terms only had a year to go. So that board member said I'm out. And then frankly, Senator Shelby. From Alabama. From Alabama who chaired the banking committee then refused to have a hearing. In fact did not have a hearing on any nominee that went through banking for two years. But Fred, I want to ask you how that limited what you could do. But just respond to the substance of the criticism. Oh sure. I mean, the criticism is that we were crony capitalism or corporate welfare. Our critics were really focused on... Some of the beneficiaries weren't small business. Like Boeing was a big beneficiary of the Exynbank. We're here in Illinois, Boeing, Caterpillar, many companies of substance. The problem is Boeing is competing against Airbus. So an easy example is... We did a lot of work... French company. French company. Well it's actually French. It's backed by France, Germany and Britain. And to a little less of a small extent Spain. So there are three export credit agencies that support Airbus. So when Airbus and Boeing are in a competitive bid to sell aircraft to Ethiopian Airways or L.O.L. or Cathay Pacific, each side comes with financing as part of the package. Because if you're buying 500 million or a billion dollars worth of aircraft and you need 12 year financing, you have to come with a financing package. That's been... It was really hard to do during the credit crisis and the global financial crisis. It's eased up a little bit. But during that crisis we had to provide financing for large transactions like that. Airplanes are hard to finance. They're big, they're expensive. So I would say at XM we would do difficult products or going to difficult places. So Ethiopia was a combination of both. We did a lot of satellite financing. We compete with France as the only other country that really makes satellites. We compete with France, Russia and China on satellite launches. They all backed those country companies to the hilt. So we need to have a level playing field. Our critics, they would say, well if other countries want to go down that path, that's their mistake. We should not do it too. But we're going to lose sales and we're going to lose jobs by following that kind of strict or not safe. What are the metrics on that in terms of jobs? We actually worked with Bureau of Labor Statistics, part of the Labor Department and actually calculated jobs by industry sector. They generally ran, and this is interesting about technology, when I got to the bank they were over about 7,000 jobs for a billion dollars worth of sales. And by the time I left they were just over six. So we've seen that. Because technology replaced some people. So I mean, and frankly it's a good thing. Another parable about the few makes companies more productive but it also. And it made us more competitive if we didn't, we'd be less competitive. But it has put great pressure. I mean, President Obama worked to double exports in five years and we made, in many countries we did, we've done it through in every country. But we didn't know as many manufacturing jobs because there are more and more technology that's replaced a lot of manual labor and building things. Yeah. Which is something that we're going to have to adjust for in the future. One of my big beefs is that we don't really have a national strategy for this revolutionary transition that's coming down the track. Fast. The train is coming down the track and a lot of people aren't going to be on board when it comes. So it's a concern. So what did you do while you were stymied by the Congress? Well, you know, we're not allowed to lobby. So obviously you could not lobby. And I didn't do press. But one, we had a number of commitments. We'd already been doing that five month period for the last half of 2015. If we had made a commitment to lend money on a particular project, but we hadn't actually executed all the documents, we closed out all those documents. Sort of like you're going to contract on a house, but you haven't closed yet. So we closed many things. We, not surprisingly, had a record amount of Freedom of Information Act requests. They were more like double of previous years. So we deployed people there. We deployed people on inspect the general projects. So I kept everybody fully productive working because we had the budget and I didn't want to lose people because we didn't know what any day now we could have reopened. Now this is still a debate. This is not going to the president Trump oppose the ex exem, bless you, oppose the exem bank as a candidate and did kind of a 180 on this. Did appoint people at bank, although there were controversies connected to that as well. And the bank is going to come up for reauthorization again, I guess in 2019. 2019. Yeah. Well, just yesterday was the Senate confirmation hearings for the next chairman and for the board members and the inspector general because there's no permanent board and there's no inspector general at the bank. The person he appointed, Scott Garrett, former congressman from New Jersey, was not a fan of the export import bank. I would say that would be very kind, David. He was one of the arch opponents of the bank, was part of the leadership that tried to close the bank not only once but twice. And Senator Heidkamp sent out at the hearing, you know, Mr. Garrett, if you had your way in 2012, about half a million jobs would not have been supported and about two and a half billion dollars would have not gone to tax, not back, gone to taxpayers, which are the profits that exem made in that period of time. What do you have to say to that? Yeah, no answer. So if he's confirmed, what does that say about the future of the exem bank? Well, it's a concern. I mean, you know, we've seen this at EPA. We've seen this at other agencies. We have someone who's really opposed to the agency, goes to run it. And in particular with the reauthorization, as you mentioned, David, which means the authority to make loans will lapse again in 2019, they need to get started, frankly, by no later than January, on working that reauthorization. That's certainly that's what we had to do. So I don't know if it'll be confirmed, but his job then will be if he's going to do his job, which is to reauthorize the bank. Or wind it down. I mean, yes. Obviously the Trump, I mean, the odd thing is President Trump wants more manufacturing jobs, believes we should be selling more things abroad. We should be reducing the trade deficit. The exem bank is an acts as the one of the key tools to get that done. Yeah. Although from a demagogic standpoint, you could see the argument, well, we don't want to use our money to be helping people overseas. We want to use our money here. Well, of course, the money does go here. Right. Someone buys this stuff. Well, I understand. I understand the counter. But no, exactly. And that was part of the criticism of the bank. Why are we sending money overseas? We're going to take another break and we'll be right back with Fred Hotberg. This week on The Assignment with me, Adi Cornish. My name is Yahya Aburazana. Yahya is one of the people at CNN tasked with finding contacts in Gaza who can connect him with Palestinians who want to share their stories. Yahya asked people to send him voice memos of what they've been seeing and feeling now that Palestinians have been told to evacuate their homes. Listen to The Assignment with me, Adi Cornish, on your favorite podcast app. Obviously related to very much central to your mission is the notion of trade. Trade too is a really controversial issue. And the president rode that issue very hard in the election. He's withdrawn from the Trans-Pacific Partnership that the Obama administration had negotiated over a period of years with more than a dozen nations. What are the implications of the new policy of this administration? I agree with concern. I think frankly David coupled with Brexit, the United Kingdom was also very like-minded to the US. In the U.E.U. arena we had a very like-minded partner in the United Kingdom at the table. And frankly it was all from the thorn in the side because both the United States and the UK were more entrepreneurial, less status, less state control of the economy. We've lost that. And then on top of that we have President Trump withdrawing from TPP. No one talks about TTIP, the Climate Accord, possibly Iran. The US has had huge-people look to us for the answer or leadership in all those things. I will remember when I would meet with my counterparts during the Iran issue, we led the fight about making sure all the other export credit agencies didn't lend money to Iran. I brought that up at every single meeting. Well, we keep withdrawing, we're not going to be doing that. And I think- Well, we want to have the leverage to do it. Yeah. And we're going to have a world out there that's going to not look like the world we would like. The President, as I said, made this a major issue in his campaign and the power of it is pretty obvious. There's this general sense that, particularly in some of the heartland of the country, that a lot of these manufacturing jobs did go overseas. Many of them in the 90s. Today, it's automation that's taking many more jobs than trade. But you travel around the country. You've seen these communities and where manufacturing once was the bedrock of these communities. So you understand the power of this argument. It's not just Republicans making it. Obviously, Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and others have made these issues. I mean, what's the future of trade? Grim. I certainly, under this administration, I do not see us having any, certainly no new trade agreement. And I think the prospects on NAFTA are very much up on the air. Republicans have for renegotiation and it doesn't seem to be going very well. It's not going very well. And it's got a very tight timetable, which doesn't always help. And we could find ourselves withdrawing from NAFTA. But it would be very disrobe. As a matter of politics, if you polled on NAFTA, you would find it's probably unpopular. There was a sense that a lot of jobs were lost to Mexico and so on. It seems like one of the most difficult issues to have a debate about because there are such visceral feelings about it. The odd thing is, David, we are the second largest exporter in the entire world. We have been huge beneficiaries of trade. We have been huge number of jobs created in this country due to trade. And on the North America Free Trade Agreement, you know, American cars with American components and American cars are more competitive globally because of that. Could it be better? Of course. I mean, I would say the other things that the benefits of it are not evenly shared. It has spread all over. I think one of the political problems is I don't think politicians of either party have really ever leveled with American people to say they're going to be winners and losers. Some of you will be worse off. Some will be better off. And here's what we're going to do for those who are worse off. We've never really said that. Well, we've said it, but we haven't acted on it. There's trade as this assistance, trade adjustment assistance. That really hasn't answered the problem. That's right. Because I think we haven't been as forthright to say they're going to be losers and this is what we're going to do to help service those people so they can get back on their feet and don't have a dislocation. You mentioned you've had a long relationship with both Clintons. Were you disappointed when Hillary Clinton changed her position on the TPP during the campaign? Was that a mistake? That's a great question. I remember watching when I heard that and I didn't think it was credible. My feeling when she changed, I mean, I understand the politics around that. When you think about it, we had 41 Democrats between the House and the Senate supporting the trade promotion authority, sort of the pro trade bill. The entire Democratic caucus was opposed to it. So I understand the box. And she was in the middle of a potential primary then, Senator Sanders, obviously on the other side of that issue. So I think the politics of that were razor sharp. And I don't know if she had said I was pro trade whether that could have sunk. Questions to whether people believed her. Right. One thing you and I have talked about, authenticity is just so essential and key. Whether people therefore believe you. And if they don't believe you, then you go down a rat's hole that they don't believe anything anymore. So I never will forget Anne Lewis, Barney Frank's sister said to me, you're not going to agree with anybody 100% of the time. You don't agree with your spouse or your kids 100% of the time. So if politicians could find a way to talk that say, you're not going to agree with me on everything, but I'm going to do the best I can and be authentic about it, I think we have a different politics. Yeah. Well, that's certainly the way Barney survived all those years in Congress. He seemed to revel in telling people exactly what he thought. But nobody ever doubted that he was leveling with him. And he had a really successful career. Well, and people think President Trump is leveling. Yes. He's very authentic. Yeah. Nobody ever says, I wish he'd speak his mind. Right. Occasionally people say, I wish he wouldn't speak his mind, but clearly say. But yeah, on the Hillary piece, she had been a very, very articulate and powerful proponent of the TPP and had made what they said 45 speeches on its behalf. So it wasn't a very credible switch on her part. It looked like what it was, which was a tactical maneuver. And then when the speeches to the business community came out, she privately voiced strong support for trade. There's a lesson in that for people. You sort of have to be what you are and say what you believe and take the risk that people won't agree with you. On this subject, what about the Democrat Party itself? In addition to everything else, you're an activist within the party. Where's the party going on these economic issues? And what do you think the profile, when you're looking ahead, you've picked some winners in the past. When you're looking ahead to candidates for 2020, what are you looking for in a candidate? What kind of candidate is going to be successful? And overall, what kind of candidate can get through a Democratic nominating process? Well, first of all, I think we have a big divide in the Democratic Party. Sort of being crass about it, sort of the Bernie wing, which is a little more purist and maybe more centrist wing of the Democratic Party, that we're going to be teething through for quite some time. I think we need, if I looked at 2020, it's probably got to be someone who's somewhat of an outsider, I think. So not someone from Washington? I think it's really hard. If you look at President Obama, President Clinton and Jimmy Carter, where three had real credentials being outside the system, all of them. So... You know, difficulty with that is that there used to be a cadre of Democratic governors who were a wellspring of candidates. There are only 15 now, there may be some more by the end of 2017, beginning of 2018 because of elections this year. But still, that's why you see mayors stepping up. Business people stepping up. But you feel like being too deeply enmeshed in the Washington scene is a disqualifier. Certainly, I think Democrats tend to have to be somewhat of an outsider, somewhat of a reformer. I think that's... I mean, I'm just thinking about the three I mentioned who velocity Democrats who won the White House. And Al Gore was as inside as you can get. Hillary, although a woman was perceived, I think, as a part of the political establishment. Kerry. And Kerry. Some of these names have surfaced again. I think Vice President Biden is actively talking to people about running. He spoke yesterday at the Chicago House. It sort of sounded like someone running for president. Yeah. And Senator Sanders is thinking about running again. Are you concerned about the generational... I'm hugely concerned. I thought Vice President Biden gave a great speech yesterday. As he often does. As he often does. Downtown Chicago. But I just think I would like that generation to step aside. So, you know, we're going to step aside. We need the next generation to come up. We want to support them and do whatever, but we need to let... So whether that's Elizabeth Warren and Bernie and I'm not being controversial and Hillary and... Right. Sanders, I just think it's time. And no other field would it be acceptable for people in the mid-70s. And David, you know firsthand, this is a very demanding job. Yes. Of intellectually, physically and everything else. It's a killer. It's a killer. I sat next to the president of the United States for two years. My office was right next to his. And the unrelenting pressures of that job are like nothing you can imagine. And most people don't see a lot of what a president has to contend with because they're either classified discussions or issues that are, you know, in formulation. Well, look at the picture on your wall there. It's got not a gray hair in sight. Yeah. I mean, eight years. But it takes a few years. But those gray hairs are... Every president leaves with gray. I don't know if this president will leave with gray hair. He may still have that golden locks. But those gray hairs are well-earned. So you'd be looking for someone else? Yes. I mean, it was like I could also change my mind. And as I said, I was really impressed with Vice President Biden. Yes. But I just think... And if you took a poll today, my guess is that he and Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren would probably be at the top of those polls. Right. But I just think we have to find a way to, you know, when both Bill Clinton ran and when Barack Obama ran, it was like there was a freshness. There was an outsider that was an idea of optimism and hope. And I think being a leader is about a lot of that's true of being optimistic and hopeful. And so I think that's... And it's got to be someone who really can connect with people. Yeah. Which those three people did. Yeah. Yeah. And what about you? What's your next act? Well, I'm having a great time here at the IOP. So I'm... It's going to be ending in two... It's ending almost two weeks. I'm fortunate for us, too. So it's been great. I met with the Harris School today. So I'm looking at what the next steps are. I haven't charted a particular path. I'm following a couple of leads, but I'm not taking a rush. This has been a great opportunity. And the students here are so extraordinary. That's been a great part. They keep you... Tell about keeping you hopeful. They do keep you hopeful. And when they ask you if you would consider public service again, would you? Oh, without question. I think it's one of the most rewarding... I was watching those hearings yesterday. I mean, it's still some of the most rewarding work, partly because the leverage you have, you know, I'm very proud of 1.4 million jobs supported in my time at EximBank, 3.8 billion dollars in profits. We reduced costs by like 30 percent. You know, those are... And importantly, the people who work at Exim, when I left more than half the management team, with people who either were developed while I was there and moved up, will be brought in. So that's very gratifying. It's hard to find that kind of gratification. Well, thanks for your service. And thanks for being here at the IOP. And it's always great talking to you. Fred Hotford.
