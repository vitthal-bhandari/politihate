    "text": " All right, we have a packed show for you today. We are going to get into what was the reason behind the Mar-a-Lago raid and was it perhaps the Spygate documents? Does President Trump have the original documents or copies of why the Spygate investigation into his campaign was launched? Next, we are going to talk about the grand jury that has been impaneled in Washington, D.C., where Merrick Garland is seeking an indictment of President Trump. It is a preemptive coup. First, I want to remind you guys, College Scam, the new book by Charlie Kirk College Scam, How America's Universities Are Bankrupting and Brainwashing Way the Future of America's Youth. Go to collegescam.com to secure your copy. All proceeds from Book Sales, go to TVUSA. Well, ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard tonight's edition of Human Events Daily, powered by Turning Point USA. Today's August 11, 2022, I know, Dominique, today's headlines, the Biden Department of Justice has impaneled a D.C. Grand Jury to indict President Trump. Yeah, that's right. I said it. Next, Spygate, what's really going on here? The DOJ secretly thwarted release of Russia documents that were declassified by Trump. Interesting. Third Denmark ending COVID-19 vaccinations for anyone under 18, and then finally, the Florida Board of Medicine moves to ban transgender treatments for minors. Oh no, all this and we're head human events daily. I see this as really wrong because, okay, if this happened was strong, why has no happened before was Hunter? Everybody know what he's doing when he's like that. Why is not doing with big guy, like somebody knows where he's not doing something to him? Why is not doing to Nancy Pelosi? Why is not doing to her too? Because her husband was the other day he was oppressed for DUI, and she went to Taiwan and the same day that he's supposed to want to go. And what happened is ow, he's ready though. That's something wrong. All right, so here's the situation. They're telling you that this was just a routine matter that it's nothing to worry about. Yeah, don't worry about it. This is just like a little thing. The Mar-a-Lago, no. Remember August 8th. This is now, and we are in the August 8th movement. Remember Mar-a-Lago. I'm going to say it again. Remember Mar-a-Lago. So Biden's Department of Justice hasn't handled this D.C. grand jury. Their role, and I'm telling you right now, this is directed by Merrick Arlen. It's directed directly from Maine Justice right there in Washington, DC. Just on the street war. I'm sitting, by the way. They want to indict President Trump, okay? Just put that on the table. Because guess what? It is. And I'm not here. Anybody else in all of media point this out. Now, there was this piece in Newsweek that dropped yesterday, very mysterious and strange piece, very strangely worded piece, where you noticed that the way it looked to me as if the DOJ and the FBI were kind of arguing over who actually was in charge of the raid, who actually pushed for the raid, who wanted the raid, who was the one that actually had authorized it. Okay, but obviously, we know you guys are working together. We're done with it. But you may see, and Charlie Kirk's got some interesting theories on this, you might actually be seeing a little bit of a disagreement, a little bit of conflict, a little bit of friction between the various entities of the administrative state, of the Leviathan, which I think the post is very, very mad at me for calling it the Leviathan. They're calling me the leader of the movement, the leader of calling for war and everything else. Like, no, no, no. Let me tell you something right now. I'm not the only one calling for political war on the deep state. I'm not the only one calling for political war against Leviathan. The entire people of this country are calling that because this Newsweek piece confirms our thesis that this is a preemptive coup against the America First Movement before any elections have been held. Do you understand? So the grand jury is there. The grand jury is the one that pushed for this raid to take place. They're the one that got the warrant in, but here, or got the search warrant in, but here's what's even more interesting. And John Solomon, the great John Solomon, over just the news has this. Questions grow about Trump weighed after the revelation that there was a subpoena and extensive cooperation. They were already cooperating with the National Archives, with the Department of Justice, the DOJ National Security Division. This is, I'm telling you, you have to understand the situation we're living in. We're in regime politics, regime politics. If you don't get that, and if you think, oh, well, what about, you know, President Obama, what about the, you know, the double standard, guys, just put that aside. Listen to what we've told you for two and a half years now. You're in a situation where you're dealing with a regime that will use whatever false veneer, the thinnest imprimatur, right? The thinnest excuse they have to go after. Show me the man and I'll show you the crime. So listen to this. Prior to the raid, they had already had people holding meetings at Mar-a-Lago. There is a secure documents room. There's a padlock on it. Just the news tells us secret service agents were present facilitated this earlier visit. President Trump signaled his full cooperation telling the agents and prosecutor look, whatever you need, let us know. The federal team saw his invitation after immediate favor to see the six foot by 10 foot storage locker where his clothes, shoes, documents, and mementos from his presidency were stored at the compound. Given his instruction, the president's lawyers complied and allowed the search by the FBI and the entourage left cordially. They asked to see this. They asked for a lock. They asked for a robust security. Going through here even more, even more. The question then becomes, with a 40 FBI agent raid, did this magistrate judge who's not actually a federal article three judge, did he even know the president Trump had been cooperating on this aid to begin with? And it's simple. All right, it's simple. Do you understand? You're dealing with a corrupt regime. This is the deranged unit class. Garland is part of that. Milly is part of that. We read, we did a dramatic performance yesterday of his letter. They will stop at nothing to launch and to finish their preemptive coup. Food is not forever. Friends, we are facing unprecedented threats to our food supply. Do you realize the world is still living on last year's harvest? And now we're dealing with a fertile crisis, insane government policies and runaway inflation. Farmers around the globe are hurting. That means more painful food shortages are coming.

Surprising that a lawful order from a sitting president doesn't get followed by the justice department. Yeah, I think probably the biggest concern for a lot of people is they want to get to the bottom of it, John. And you've done a lot of reporting on this. And there's only been a few people that very early on said that this whole Russian narrative that something didn't add up. And indeed it didn't add up. Do you remember the fact that the FBI, we're going to Department of Justice, the CIA, British operatives, you know, all that, all that stuff that we were talking about for such a long time. Do you remember that they spied illegally? We've now found out using false warrants and lies to the FISA court to spy on President Trump's campaign back when he was candidate Trump. Here's the question though. Everybody out there is asking, what's the deal? Okay, so what's the deal? Do we have anything in these documents? What are the documents that the FBI is looking for? And there's an interesting theory that's been running around. There's an article that a lot of people sent me yesterday. And the theory goes like this. Could it be that the documents that they're looking for that they say are classified are in fact, President Trump's copies of the original spy gate documents? What do I mean by this? There was a story also on just the news. Again, the great John Solomon, John Solomon coming in strong today. Make sure you watch his show on Real America's voice as well and check out his podcast. There was a story that in the final days, even the final hours of President Trump's administration that he was working with Mark Meadows and filing a meadow and John Solomon's got the meadow got the memo. So the meadows memo, see that five times straight says that President Trump declassified the spy gate documents. But then the Department of Justice also asks for a copy on their own. Why? Because they wanted further redactions. And there was this big fight between the Trump White House, the Trump administration that was outgoing and the Department of Justice, the same national security division that we're reading in the Newsweek piece says was behind the raid on Mar-a-Lago. You see what I'm putting together here? So if it was the spy gate documents that indeed is what they are after, it could be a fight over whether or not the president actually declassified them. Because in this article that the John Solomon wrote a few months back, it says that the documents were then sent to the Department of Justice for further redactions. But then the Department of Justice, they never released the documents. The DOJ, because I'm sure you're sitting there thinking, wait, what spy gate documents? I've never read the spy gate documents. We're all these original spy gate documents. They were never released. The DOJ never put them out, even though the president signed them off to be declassified. And there's a memo from Meadows, memorializing right point of the memo, the fact that the president had done this. So do you see where I'm going with that? It then stands to reason then, did the DOJ think or were they quote unquote tipped off by this so-called informer or a mole, clandestine human source at Morilago that perhaps President Trump did keep a copy of the spy gate documents? Could this whole thing, right? Could this whole thing be the DOJ trying to clean up their tracks to find the receipts? Because of course, President Trump, look, I'm gonna say right now, I would totally believe that President Trump would not trust the same DOJ that had been spying on him. Wouldn't trust the FBI and would say, sure, I'll send you guys a copy of the documents, but did he keep a copy for himself? Maybe it was, you know, photographs, maybe it was electronic cop, whatever it is, right, whatever it is. Do you think he would have kept a copy for himself? I would say that wouldn't surprise me. And let's just say, look, you know, I'm not gonna say I'm not gonna betray any competences or anything, but I will just say this, that of all the people that I've been talking to this week since that raid took place, a lot of people have been pointing to the idea that the spy gate documents may be involved in this in some way. Now, if that's true, you're gonna see a fight then between and that we're talking tons, tons of documents, right? All the documents that memorialize the lies of the FBI, the lies of the CIA, the lies of Christopher Steele, the lies of Jake Taper, the lies of all these people going into this false dossier, the Steele dossier, fusion GPS, the Clinton campaign, and the lies that led to the spying on Trump. And could it be that's what this is about? The three week rule might be the best financial advice ever. A three week rule. What's that three week rule post? What are you doing? I'm out. Look, it's simple. Wait three weeks to buy that new car. Wait three weeks to refire home mortgage and wait three weeks to finance any major purchase. Why three weeks?

But I have to say it's wonderful to actually see all of you. It also sounds and looks like you and your families have been staying healthy. Oh, I have a way I've been staying healthy, Dr. Sanjay. Look. Oh, does Rosita go to the pool? Oh, oh, no, I mean, this is from my COVID vaccine. My mommy and my puppy took me to get it this morning. Rosita, that's great. Getting the COVID vaccine is a great way to stay healthy. See, my mommy and my puppy said that it will help keep me, my friends, my neighbors, my abuela all healthy. Your parents are absolutely right. You know, COVID vaccines are now available for children five years and older. And the more people who get them, the better we're going to be able to help stop the spread of COVID. I was so confused when I saw this headline. I just, I didn't, I didn't know how to take it. I'm reading it. Postamalenal.com has it up here. And it says, I know this is going to be very strange. So I want everyone to just, just, I'll read it very slowly. Denmark, for something inexplicable reason to me, Denmark has ended COVID-19 vaccinations for anyone under 18. What does this mean? Well, and it says there's a strange, just bizarre statement on the Danish health authority website. So I said, all right, let me read it to see if I can get some more clarity on this. And it says, children and adolescents only very rarely have a serious course of illness due to COVID-19 with the Amacron variant, which is why they offer a primary vaccination for children between five and 17 will not be a general offer, but can be given after a specific medical assessment. They're phasing out the vaccination program in mid-May. They don't want this anymore. It's, it's, it's just so strange. Why would, can anybody out there, can anybody out there understand why you wouldn't be giving the jab to people under 18? I just don't get it. I mean, of course, when you look at myself, my family, we now look, I know some of you guys out there, you might be thinking, well, I'm going to take the Pfizer and other people saying, I want that Novavax, but still other people saying, no, no, no, it's Moderna for me. And then there's people who let's just face it, they can only afford the Johnson and Johnson. And you know, it is what it is. Life just is what it is. But for me, my family, let's keep my kids safe, keep my voice safe, keep myself safe. We've taken all the vaccines. Every single one of them multiple, I put that stuff in my coffee in the morning, shoot with my pancakes, just, just lather it up in there, all the vaccines, and you know, we switch out different flavors, you know, pour in a little, you know, for example, my son, Jack, and he was, of course, he was up watching the show last night with with Dada because he sees me watching. He said, he said, Dada, what are you doing? What are you doing in that chat room with all the, all the getter people and the RAV people and everybody else? What are you doing in these chats? And I said, wow, I'm, I'm working on a, I'm working on the, on the show, trying to, you know, reach out to the audience, reminding people, Liberty at tposa.com. And I'm looking at him saying, why aren't you sleeping on your my pillow? He did see point as my pill last night. We say good night to Joseph, Mary, baby, Jesus and sheep. Then he went through with the Noah's ark pillow. So we've got the, we've got the biblical pillows for him. And he was going and saying, good night to every single one of the animals. So he was like, good night, your ass, good night, monkeys, good night, Noah, good night, ark, good night, God's rainbow, good night, dove. And we just went through everything. But I looked at him and said, I said, Jack, Jack, are you eating a chocolate rice cake? He's like, yeah, I am. Did you brush your teeth? Yeah. We're gonna have to do it again, aren't you? He's like, Oh, so I made him brush his teeth again. But of course, as you all know, just like any good father, I got vaccine toothpaste so that when he brushes his teeth, he's actually vaccinating himself again. Right. So don't even tell me about boosters. I want to be as boosted as possible. We take daily boosters. This is what we do. So Denmark, I mean, completely, first of all, look, Denmark, the idiots over there in Denmark, first country to lift all the COVID-19 restrictions. And that's why everybody there is basically dead right now. It's pretty much a zombie state over in Denmark. You want to go conquer it, take you five seconds, Vladimir Putin could take all of Denmark in like a half a minute. And then by the way, you get Greenland too. So you might as well go for it. Conquer Denmark, take over Greenland, give vaccine toothpaste to your children. That's the American way. And make sure that after they've taken their vaccine toothpaste, you'd let them go to sleep on my pillow.com promo code, post so and say good night to everybody out there. Okay. For any of you who don't understand sarcasm, I just want to make one thing abundantly clear at the end of this segment that the last piece of topic that we discussed here was 100% true. These very young kids getting gender affirming care, what they don't tell you what that is, is they are actually giving very young girls misdubble, mastectomies. They want to castrate these young boys. I think these doctors need to get sued for what's happening. So look, guys, I've got another just crazy, such a strange story. This one's from the Epoch Times. And I can't seem to understand. Can you help me? Audience help me understand these stories, help PoSo understand the news. Send us your emails, kind of your comment, your suggestion, your tips, Liberty, at TPOSA.com. And I'm racking my brain last night on my my pillow. By the way, we'll sit in the pillow, the topper, the sheets. Now the all season pillow or excuse me, the all season slippers are available to you. You go to my pillow.com promo code, PoSo, get the all season slippers. Tell you one thing, if the FBI is coming to raid the PoSo closet, you're going to find pillows, pillows, pillows, pillows, maybe some sheets and some other accoutrements. But I'm dead serious. We actually do sleep on all that. That's no cap. But I understand the story. Can you guys help me? The Florida Board of Medicine has moved to ban transgender treatments for minors. Why wouldn't you want to give puberty blockers to children under the age of 18? Again, you have these, you have these governments, whether it's Denmark or whether it's Florida. And it's very strange. And so I'm going to have to go and we're going to we're going to bring in. Okay, we're going to bring in now, Klaus Schwab. He's he's calling into the show. You know, Klaus Schwab, you may now you may be asking why is PoSo and Klaus Schwab on the same side? Didn't this wasn't a guy who tried to get entertained while he was in at the World Economic Forum. Total misunderstanding where buddy's now we're friends. Let's get from home. The governments of Florida and Denmark are not allowing us to experiment on the children. You must allow the medical experiments on the children whether it is hormone therapy or blueberry blockers on the youth under the age of 18. These youth must receive their transgender treatments. They must receive their puberty blockers. They must receive full vaccinations vaccination toothpaste. This is the way for the children to receive their experimentation. This Florida Department of Health Secretary, those of Dr. Joseph Lapado. I'm sorry, class out. You know, we just lost the signal. Yeah, apparently the doctor is saying here that there's strong feelings about the issue, but argue that there were current standards or substantial departure, the level of evidence. You know, the data is uncertain to say, what guys, come on, we don't need evidence and data. We've got feelings and emotions. I want a four year old comes up to you and says, you know, I like that girl or I like Mama's dress. Well, guess what? That means that you need to start injecting him with powerful hormones immediately at the same time that he's getting his vaccination toothpaste. So in addition to the vaccination toothpaste, what we're going to have to add, what we're going to have to add, all right, is the hormone blocker shampoo, the puberty blocking Cheerios and a little bit, just a little, just a little tad, just a little tad of the estrogenical oatmeal. So make sure that you're feeding your young boys estrogenical oatmeal, their vaccination toothpaste, their puberty blocking shampoo. And then just maybe you will be able to raise a well adjusted little boy or girl or zer in today's America. And this this doctor down in Florida, what a complete fool. Don't you understand that science and data and research are subservient to civic religion, civic religion and scientism must be the way forward for America. All right, that's all the time we have here. Human events daily. Thank you so much for watching us on RAV, Ghetto, wherever you're watching.

What do we talk about today? The Biden Department of Justice has impaneled a DC grand jury to indict President Trump. Next spy gate. The DOJ secretly thwarting the release of Russia documents declassified by Trump was this what the raid was about. Third, Denmark ending COVID-19 vaccinations for anyone under 18 for some crazy reason. And finally, the Florida Department of Medicine, Board of Medicine, moving to ban transgender treatments for my, you know, I got to say one thing. In addition, now some people were asking in between the segments, they said, Poso, all right, you're giving your son, you're giving your son the estrogenical oatmeal. But what if you have a daughter, right, who wants to be a solder, a son daughter, right? What do you what do you do? I said, well, that's the testosterone T obviously you just give them the testosterone T or you could do both testosterone T and the estrogenical oatmeal and then create an omni gendered child. This will be the new power Rangers show going into the next season. But before we go, one segment that we'd like to do here on human events daily is time for today's history break on this day, all the way back in 2016. A Greenland shark was declared the oldest vertebrate animal in the world at 392 years by an international team of sites. Just imagine 392 years. Imagine what you've seen the empires that coming fall. And of course, the oldest in vertebrate animal is none other than Nancy Pelosi. Ladies and gentlemen, as always, you have my permission to lay short."
