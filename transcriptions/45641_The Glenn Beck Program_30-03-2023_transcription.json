Hour two, I'm going to tell you the latest developments of China and what they are doing with currency all around the world. Our dollar is going to collapse and they are going to ensure it and that means really difficult times beyond your understanding. But we make it if we stick together and we're prepared. So please prepare with my Patriots Supply dot com. Save $200 on each kit that your family needs. Plus get free shipping. Don't put off your preparedness any longer. Tomorrow may be a day too late. Go to my Patriots Supply dot com. That's mypatriotsupply.com. Go there now and be prepared. All right, just a few seconds before the National Radio program begins. Stand by. Blaze, thank you so much for subscribing and being here with us today. It's a new day. I'm trying to raise. What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment. This is the Glenn Beck program. Hello America. Welcome to the Glenn Beck program. There is another crisis of the day, but I'm going to show you how to get through all of that, what it's really all about, and then tell you the things we should be paying attention to. And we begin in 60 seconds. Stand by. Finally, end of the day. No more cares. No more worries. Everybody's in bed. Lights have finally gone out and you're lying there with your head on the pillow going, please just let me sleep. Just let me sleep. If that sleep doesn't come, you're a lot like me. Sometimes I just can't shut my brain off and I stare at the ceiling fan. I'm like, okay, this is fun. Exhausted, but wide awake. I would like to invite you to try something that I take probably a couple times a week. Relief factor sleep. Now this is 100% drug free. You do not feel it in your system. You don't feel it when you take it. You don't feel it in the morning. You are just relaxed and you have a good healthy night's sleep. I know for him experience it, it works. My wife takes it as well. First bottle is 1995. Sorry, I laughed. I just thought of a million jokes on that one, but decided to pass them by. Anyway, unleash the power of great sleep by calling 800 the number four relief. The number four relief. Call them now or just go to relieffactor.com. Relief sleep. Relieffactor.com. Dream big and sleep tight. All right. I just want to, I want to spend the amount of time that should be spent on this nonsense of transgender issues. Right now you have people banning together, calling what's going on, a transgender genocide. All of this is absolutely nonsense. I don't really care what you call yourself, what you, how you want to dress, what you want to, I don't care. I really don't care and I don't think Americans care. Okay. We've, we've, we've been through a lot, gang. We've been through a lot. Is this really, what is it? Like 0.03% of the population. Really, I think we got bigger fish to fry. Okay. So I don't care. This is not about trans people. It's not. The left is trying to make it that. They're also trying to soup you up once again to distract you from the things that are important. That's what this, that's what is happening every single day. That's why I ask you to get my newsletter because every morning, there's anywhere from 50 to 80 stories that we have collected over the last 24 hours that we think are really important. We put them in categories so you can focus on the things that are important. That's what I try to do every day. I, I go through those 80 stories, takes me two and a half hours to just go through them and make sure I put them in the right order. What makes it, what doesn't make it in the show? Because I've only got three hours. I want to tell you that I am working with extra effort to try to show you what is not needed. It might be important, but it is a distraction from the things that are very important. So when we're looking at this whole issue on trans, it's not about trans people. It's not. The governor in Kentucky has lost now. Bashir vetoed a bill that was done by the evil Republicans. And what the evil Republican bill was is it bans child sex changes. Governor vetoed it. Well, they overruled. So now the governor's veto is no good. All right. So what's this about? Trans people say this is a, an attack on trans people. No, it's not. No, it's not. The new law prohibits doctors from providing hormone therapy or other gender affirming treatments to anyone under the age of 18. Over 18 have at it. Okay. How is this an attack on the transgender community? It is not. That's all you have to say. It's not. This, this is no matter what the governor of Kentucky might have said, this empowers families and protects the parents, protects the children. And most importantly, stops an arrogant out of control, woke medical system from doing experimental surgery and mutilating children. That's what this is about. No mutilation of children. No experimental surgery on children. No. The progressive doctors and nurses of the early 1900s, they've done this before. They led the way on eugenics, all this bad stuff that happened in Germany that came from us. Okay. We started that we taught them. Our doctors and nurses and progressive scientists went to Germany. One example is the human betterment society out of California. We taught the Germans and doctors and the nurses and the scientists, all about eugenics and how you can sterilize people, how you should look for the pure races. That was us. The Holocaust didn't begin with the Jews. It began with children. The doctors and the nurses felt that they should get rid of the cripple, the mentally unfit, the chronically ill. Those with epilepsy, because they were a drain on the system and they never live a full life. So they killed them and they did it without the permission of the parents, without the knowledge of the parents. And even after the child died, the nurses and the doctors would fill out a fake death certificate and say, Oh, I was kidney failure. Oh, he got pneumonia. No, they injected him or her and killed them. We've seen this movie before. It doesn't start at the bad part. It starts with compassion. You do not take away the right of the parent to protect their child. One, you do not give doctors and nurses the ability to mutilate children. Two, and three, you do not do experimental surgery on children. This is not about trans people. This is about doctors and nurses. First, do no harm and you don't really have a good track record. If I go back and look over the last hundred years, you have a piss poor track record. And if I just go back to the last four or five years, you lied to the American people. You lied. The medical system lied. We know it now. You lied about masks. You know that masks did us no good. You might have not known in the first month or two, but that science came out quickly. And then you lied about science. The medical industry lied about the vaccines experimenting on people when they knew when they knew bad things could happen, they hid those bad things. So don't talk to me about your progressive science and following the science. Whenever man follows the science and it's the science, not science, but the science, and they silence other scientists who disagree, it never ends well. So let's put that to bed. This transgender thing, it's not about trans people. It's not about a genocide. Okay, it's not. This is about stopping arrogant doctors who are honestly out of control on a crazy ideology that is experimental at best, period. Now, what should we pay attention to? Well, I'm going to give you a couple of things. So in the next few minutes, I want to talk about one thing that will impact your life. Last night, I did a TV show on CBDCs. That is central bank digital currencies. I spent about, oh, I don't know, three hours yesterday, really brilliant guy, very well connected, well connected in government with government agencies with banking, et cetera, et cetera. The guy's no slouch. I was shocked to hear him talk to me about what's coming because what people think, what you think because you're getting the garbage from television, what you think is coming is a recession. What your crazy friends might say to you is coming is maybe a depression. You'd be mistaken. Those are lies. What is coming is a collapse of the dollar. You haven't had one of those. We've never experienced the collapse of the dollar of the world's reserve currency. This will make us Venezuela make no mistake. If you want to be prepared, prepare yourself like people should have prepared in Venezuela. You can get all of the information on last night's TV show. You can either watch it as a Blaze TV subscriber. I don't know if it is still posted because we started with transgenderism. I don't know if it's still posted on YouTube, but it's definitely at BlazeTV.com slash Glenn. And if you sign up for my email newsletter, you'll get all of the research behind it. But I showed you last night how the Fed is introducing the Fed now back in coming up in July. It is officially beginning in July. This is exactly what India did. And India is now in the final phase and they are introducing their Fed coin. So do not listen to the lies. The Fed coin has its own problems. It's all about security. It's the end of your freedom. And you have to be aware because soon, I don't know when, but it will happen overnight. Soon, everything will be collapsing and the banks will close. And there will be chaos. And everyone on radio and television and the internet will be telling you we have to do central banks. We have to do digital currency from the central. Do not believe that. The collapse is caused by the idiocy of the people who are now telling you, A, we're fine. It's stable. And B, that's a conspiracy theory that we're doing a central bank digital currency. They're lying to you. And they're the ones who caused it. So please stop listening to the experts. Here's what's, here's what's concerning today. Yesterday, Brazil and China struck a deal to ditch the US dollar. This is something that everyone, every expert for the last 20 years have said that will never happen. And I said, it will happen as soon as someone comes up with something more stable than the dollar, because everyone said, Glenn, you can't abandon the dollar. Yeah, I mean, it sucks. It's the worst. Remember, I used to say, but it's the floatiest poop in the toilet bowl. As soon as somebody says, Hey, here's something not in the toilet bowl, the world will scramble towards it and we'll be flushed. That is exactly what is happening now. China is putting a deal together with the world are with our former partners, the people we have disd, ignored the people that we have, uh, slighted over the years. And with this administration, all of our former allies are looking at us going, you guys are dying, man. You are not a superpower anymore. And the dollar doesn't have long to live. I'm throwing in with China and China is building itself up as a superpower. And they are replacing our dollar. Once you take the trillions of dollars that are held by central banks in countries like Brazil all over the world and they liquidate them, the dollar collapses. We become Venezuela with inflation that you cannot imagine. This is what is happening now. Brazil and China just struck a trade deal. And what it means is, when they used to trade, they would have to, when they wanted, when China wanted to buy something from Brazil or Brazil wanted to buy something from China, they both had to change their money into US dollars and then pay each other in dollars. And then they could bring those dollars back to their own home and it would be put in the banks like vaults, like a gold. They don't do that anymore. The petrodollar is over. It's only a matter of time. By the way, Saudi Arabia also took another step to join the China-led security block. They are, they are now in the SCO, which is the Shanghai Cooperation Organization. It's a political security alliance. It's China, Russia, India, Pakistan. You also have Saudi Arabia now, Turkey, Qatar. China is filling the vacuum that we have left because of the Biden administration. I'm not going to argue about transgender people and genocide because that isn't true. And it's not important because it's not true. This is true. These are the things you should concentrate on. I have more in just a second.

We was the coverage about all this focused on the transgender thing. Was what was the coverage on all of this focused on the transgender thing when you're talking about the Nashville thing? Nashville situation. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I've been out and he's been away from the media for a while. So one of the fascinating things about that process is you kind of be read the news like normal people read the news. Yeah. You know, and trying to follow that story and figure out what happened was nearly impossible. Yeah. If you're not reading 20 stories about it, I couldn't tell if at first it was just denied that it was someone who was transgender. They didn't say anything about that. Then they were saying it was a woman and I couldn't tell if it was a guy who was born born a guy and then was saying it was a woman or if it was a woman born a woman who was saying it was a guy, I couldn't find that information anywhere because no one would admit what actually occurred. They don't do that. Let me give you this story, Stu. Just just trying to make sense of this story. Chris Chan reportedly been released from jail on bond, although the reason why is still unknown. The internet personality in youtuber whose real name is Christine Weston Chandler was arrested on suspicion of incest in 2021. A leaked phone call previously led some to suggest Chan was in a sexual relationship with her elderly mother 79 who has dementia news reports state that Chan has been released from a Virginia jail on a court order having been held in custody since being arrested in 2021. They were being held in central Virginia regional jail. However, Chan was issued transportation order on March 27th. Chris is known for creating the web comic series. He is a trans woman who came out as transgender in 2014 after originally identifying as a man. Chan was also diagnosed with autism. Chan had a hearing later this year on August 8th, but they have been bonded out. What just happened? Is she? What the hell? The Gillenback program. Once you confuse people's language, you can no longer tell the truth. Yeah, okay. He got to stop right now. Kibble dog food comes in all sorts of flavors these day. You've got lamb and rice. There's chicken. You know, I buy leg of a mailman who loves it, loves it. Not as good as leg or throat of intruder. He really loves the throat of intruder and intruder flavor.

Welcome to the Glenbeck program. I am going to double my efforts to just tell you every day the few things that I think are important. Now, it is it is foolish to listen to me. I am a I'm a recovering alcoholic. DJ, I have no formal education. I am a self educated guy. I try my best to get it right. I've been wrong a million times. I'm a commentator, but I'm a commentator who has spent a lot of money to pay for researchers so we can get it right. But you must do your own homework. Don't trust me as the God's honest truth all the time, even though I may be thinking I'm giving you the God's honest truth, I may be wrong. So you take what I say and you've got to do your own homework and you have to start thinking for yourself. So many people come up to me and say, who do I trust? Who do I trust? I don't trust anybody. I don't trust anybody. I mean, there are people that I can go to that I trust on certain topics, Glenn Greenwald, Matt Taibee, I think they get it. I think they really, truly get it. Just the news, we try to do our best here, but make sure you're looking for original sources, etc, etc. And and know what is important because this is a nonstop circus that is going on. Everything that you're seeing about this tranja, it's very important because it's it's pitting people against each other, but it's evil in its nature because it's not built on truth. So know what the truth is. This shooting comes from an unstable individual. It's not about the guns. It's not that we have more powerful guns. The AK-47. Why is it 47? You know why it was 47? Because it's been around since 1947. Okay. AK-47, the AR-15s and everything. They were invented in the 50s. Okay. They have been, they're called a modern sporting rifle. It's just because the Pentagon started buying that rifle just like they used to with the 9-11 sidearm. That's not a weapon of war. That's just a gun that was built for people. And the government said, that's dependable. We're going to use that. Okay. That's what these guns are. And we had far more guns. I mean, it was legal to have a machine gun when they came out. They didn't ban the machine gun for quite some time. And those were very dangerous. Much more, much more than anything we have now that you can buy on the market. We didn't have these problems with shootings, did we? Why? Because it's not the gun. It is a sickness in our society. And we are not dealing with people. We are not fighting against other human beings. We are truly fighting evil. Evil has this world by the throat. And because we don't look for spiritual things, because we don't understand the spiritual nature of what we're living through. We get confused. It is like trying to understand the world without and dismissing atoms, molecules. I can't see them. Can't see them. What are you talking about on the subatomic level? There's nothing to that. Yes, there is. And if you dismiss that, you know, you'll relieve headaches by drilling into somebody's head. There are simple answers. This problem that we're going through is spiritual in nature. And you already know the solution. You want to find truth? You've got to go back to the eternal truths. And let's start just with the Ten Commandments. Just do that. Do the Ten Commandments. That's it. All right. So we're going to get into the stories that are really important for you. Next hour, I'm going to talk about the Restrict Act and AI, the latest in AI. It's getting it. As I told you, it would. When it hits, you're going to have 100 years happen in a 10-year period. We are now in that window. And it's going to take your breath away if you don't catch up now and understand where we are and then look at things logically. So we're going to go through all of those. But I want to share this with you. This is from Europe. It's the Great Food Reset. Now listen to this. This is something that is in my book, The Great Reset. But now it's now it's in play. Listen to this article. France is in flames. Israel is erupting. America is facing a second January 6th. In the Netherlands, however, the political establishment is reeling from an entirely different type of protest, one that perhaps more than any other raging today threatens to destabilize the global order. The victory of the farmer citizens movement in the recent provincial elections represents an extraordinary result for an anti-establishment party that was formed just three years ago. But then again, these are not ordinary times. The BBB, and by the way, I believe this political party, the BBB, I believe this could happen in America, but everybody is married to the two-party system. But the minute people who really care in Congress decide to say, neither one of you guys actually believe this, and you start to peel away, you're not going to have a third party of real meaning unless it started at the grassroots level over something like this. The BBB grew out of mass demonstrations against the Dutch government's proposal to cut nitrogen emissions by 50% in the country's farming sector by 2030. A target designed to comply with the European Union's emission reduction rules. While farming companies have the means to meet these goals by using less nitrogen fertilizer and reducing the number of their livestock, smaller, often family-owned farms would be forced to sell or to shudder. Indeed, according to a heavily redacted European commission document, this is precisely the strategy's goal, quote, intensifying agriculture, notably, through buying out or terminating farms with the aim of reducing livestock. This would first be, still quoting, on a voluntary basis, but mandatory buyout is not excluded if necessary, end quote. Snow surprise then, the plan sparked massive protests by farmers who see it as a direct attack on their livelihoods or the BBB slogan, no farms, no food, clearly resonated with voters. But aside from concerns about the impact of the measure on the country's food security, and on the century old rural, rural way of life, that is part of the Dutch national identity, the rationale behind this drastic measure is also questionable. Agriculture currently accounts for almost half of the country's output of carbon dioxide. Yet, the Netherlands is responsible for less than 0.4% of the world's emissions. Many no wonder many Dutch fail to see how such negligible return justify the complete overhaul of the country's farming sector, which is already considered one of the most sustainable in the world. Over the past two decades, water dependence for key crops has been reduced by as much as 90%, and the use of chemical pesticides in greenhouses have been almost completely eliminated. Farmers also point out that the consequences of the nitrogen cut would extend well beyond the Netherlands. The country, after all, is Europe's largest exporter of meat and the second largest agricultural exporter in the world, just behind the United States. In other words, the plan would cause food exports to collapse at a time when the world is already facing food and research shortages. We already know what this looks like, a ban on nitrogen fertilizer was conducted in Sri Lanka last year with disastrous consequences. It caused artificial food shortage plunged nearly 2 million Sri Lankans into poverty, leading to an uprising that toppled the government. Given the irrational nature of the policy, many protesting farmers believe it can't simply be blamed on the urbanite green elites currently running the Dutch government. They suggest one of the underlying resources, or sorry, one of the underlying reasons for the move is to squeeze small farmers from the market, allowing them to be bought out by multinational agribusiness giants who recognize the immense value of the country's land. Not only is it highly fertile, but it is also strategically located with easy access to the North Atlantic coast, Rotterdam, Lardisport, and Europe. They also point out that the Prime Minister is an agenda contributor of the World Economic Forum, which is well known to be corporate driven, while the finance minister of social affairs and employment is also tied to the WEF. The struggle playing out in the Netherlands would seem to be part of a much bigger game that seeks to reset the international food system. As the second largest contributor to greenhouse gas emissions after the energy sector, agriculture is naturally ended up on the crosshairs of net zero advocates, that is virtually all major international and global organizations. The solution we're told is sustainable agriculture. Part of the UN-17 sustainable does up development goals for Agenda 2030. This issue has now been pushed to the top of the global agenda. Last November, the G20 meeting in Bali called for an accelerated transformation towards sustainable and resilient agriculture and food systems and supply chains to ensure that food systems better contribute to the adaptation and mitigation of climate change. Few days later in Egypt, COP 27 annual Green Agenda Climate Summit, launched its initiative aimed at promoting a shift towards sustainable climate resilient, healthy diets. Within a year, its food and agricultural organization aims to launch a roadmap for reducing greenhouse emissions in the agricultural sector. The end game is hinted at in several other UN documents reducing nitrogen use and global livestock production, lowering meat consumption and promoting more sustainable source of protein such as plant-based or lab-grown products or insects. The United Nations Environment Program, for example, has stated global meat and dairy consumption must be reduced by 50%. Other international multilateral organizations have presented their own plans for transforming the global food system. The EU's Farm to Fork strategy aims to accelerate our transition to a sustainable food system. Alongside these intergovernmental and multilateral bodies, a vast network of stakeholders is now devoting to the greening of agriculture and food production. Private foundations, public-private partnership, NGOs and corporations reset the table. A 2020 Rockefeller Foundation report called for moving away from focus on maximizing shareholder returns to a more equitable system focused on fair returns and benefits to all stakeholders. This may sound like a good idea until when considers that stakeholder capitalism is a concept heavily promoted by the World Economic Forum, which represents the interest of the largest and most powerful corporations on the planet. It goes on to talk about all of the things that Bill Gates is doing, all of the moves against our farmland. This is far more important than arguing with somebody today about transgenderism. These things are happening because they know it'll push every button in you and you will be distracted and not follow things like this. And when you do start following them, that's when the cry will come out. It's a conspiracy theory. It is not. And I'll give you an example at the top of next hour standby in this time of inflation being able to lock in a price on something when everything around you is jumping up in price.

We're just talking about some of the things that are coming our way. AI is really what's disturbing is the news that came out yesterday and we're going to talk about this. All of these AI people, all of them, are now coming out and saying, hey, we need to stop for six months. There needs to be a six-month moratorium on this. It's not going to happen. There's no way. China will do it. I mean, look, everybody is racing to AI because the person who gets it is the winner. Winner winner. And so stopping for six months is not going to happen. They want to stop because they want to have the conversation that I've been begging people to have for the last 10 years. What does all of this mean? And how do we conduct our lives? This week, we found out 300 million jobs will be lost in the West by 2030, 300 million the Glennback program. Let me tell you about doing it right. There is a company that I absolutely love. I love their philosophy. The guy who runs it is so much like me. He is just hell bent on a mission and he knows that charity is best funded by capitalism. And what he wants to do is he wants to bring American manufacturing back here to America. So in 2012, he started American Giant and it started when a clothing factory in North Carolina was going to be shut down. He went in. He worked with the factory. He invested in new machinery, brought some of the real machinery that had been sold to Japan. I think he brought it back to America, trained the people to work on it. And one of the first things they made was that sweatshirt that you know, you used to have when you were a kid or maybe it was your dad sweatshirt. And it was the best ever champion is not the same as it was because we got rid of the machines and we don't train people for that technology anymore. He brought it back American Giant. I got to tell you, go to americangiant.com, sorry, american-giant.com slash Glenn right now. You'll save great clothing 100% American American dash giant.com slash Glenn. I got no room to compromise. We gotta stand together as the girls of the night. Stand up and stand to hold the light. It's a new day. I'm trying to raise. What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment. This is the Glenn back program. Hello America. There's a lot going on today. I'm going to help you focus on what's really important. The government, the restrict act, and AI all this hour. Stay right where you are. We begin in 60 seconds. I just told you last hour about something that is coming our way. It is a field of fork, farm to fork. It the complete reshaping and overhaul of our food industry. Globally. Oh, no big deal because we have to go green. This is all done by people like Bill Gates that are investing. He's now the biggest landowner farm landowner in the country now. Why? Well, because he believes he can transform farming. We're putting all of these people out of business and we are going low, low quality. Just got an email from him. I haven't started the commercial yet. I'm sorry. Just got an email from a friend who was at a cattle auction and he said, look at the price of this cow. He said the price of this cow is off the charts and he said the cow is like old, you know, it's teeth are gone because we are scraping the bottom of the barrel for beef right now. This is got to stop. It's got to stop and we have to help our ranchers. In the meantime, look at the price of your beef. It's going to go up at least another 15% expert say. Well, I listen to an expert expert say up to up another 15% this year alone. I can guarantee you that's going to happen. Good ranchers buys only the best American beef and then gives you a locked in price. Now, I got to tell you, as long as you're getting your meat from good ranchers, your price is locked in a year, two years from now. I don't know how they're going to stay in business, but that's that's their guarantee. That's their deal. As long as you're subscribed, your price stays the same. If you're feeding your family with chicken, beef, fish, get it from good ranchers.com. That's good ranchers.com. Use the promo code BEC save and get free bacon for a year. Goodranchers.com. All right. I want to start here. Why do we have a government? When we broke up with England, we said, hey, King George, we've been trying to tell you this for a while, but you won't listen to us. So we're going to write you this letter. We're just going to tell you that we're going to break up. But because we're trying to be decent people, we want to tell you why we're breaking up. And the key here is you don't know us because you believe all these other things that you have complete power that you're getting your power from God and that allows you to rule over us in any way you want. We don't think so. We believe these things and the things that we believe in, we think everybody knows. Everybody just knows it. Self-evident that we're all equal. You, me, the other guy, different color, different age, different standing in society, we're all the same. And those rights that we have of life, liberty, you can't just scoop us up, throw us in jail. We don't have to listen to you. All these rights come from God and they're given to us, all of us, including you, but us too. And those rights are so important, but we know that we have other jobs to do. We got to go to do business and commerce and farm and everything else. So we have to institute a government. And so we form this government and its job is to protect those rights. And if it ever becomes hostile to those rights, it's our duty, it's our responsibility, and it is our right to change that government out and institute a new government that is more likely to protect those rights. Now, if we were talking about any conversation and Tifa, anybody was talking about restoring our government or replacing our government with something that was more likely to protect our rights, which are being violated all the time, I would, I'd be open to listening to them. What do you got? What do you got? As long as that's our mission statement, the Declaration of Independence, okay, what do you got? What's going to free more people? But that's not what we're doing. After we explained in that breakup letter, what we believe, we then said, because these are the things that you're doing to us. And we've tried over and over again to get you to stop. And every time we ask you to stop, you make things worse. Let me give you this. Do you remember Garland's, Merrick Garland's testimony in front of Congress about why he didn't make any arrests of protesters in front of the homes of the Supreme Court members? Do you remember, Sue? You remember what he said? Yeah, a little bit. He said that basically the agents on scene were the ones that were supposed to make those decisions. And he had nothing to do with that. He had nothing to do with it. The marshals make all those decisions. He had nothing to do with it. Justice Department does not engage in that. Okay, well, somebody who was in the Justice Department heard him say that and said, really? And gave Congress some information. Senator Katie Britt of Alaska unveiled a series of training slides used to prepare the marshals for their assignments in front of Merrick Garland. Now, remember, this is a guy that the left wanted to be forever called your honor, your honor, the honorable Supreme Court Justice Merrick Garland. Tell me this is honorable. He, he said that he had nothing to do with it. Then she started to show these slides and the slides from the Justice Department instructed the marshals to avoid unless absolutely necessary any criminal enforcement involving the protesters and making arrests and initiating prosecutions was not the goal. They would just keep the jurists safe. That's it. They also said they are not to engage in protest related enforcement. They were there to protect the protesters exercising their First Amendment rights and to protect the justices and their families. They, they said, any enforcement action with the local U.S. Attorney's Office in advance and warned it is counterproductive to make probable cause arrests on cases that the U.S. Attorney will not charge and will not prosecute. So they're saying, don't arrest anybody. Don't arrest anybody. By the way, it is a federal offense to even quote parade. Have you heard that offense lately? To even parade in front of a Justice's house to intimidate or to get them to change their view. It's a federal offense. So Merrick Garland lied to you. He openly lied to you and your representatives. Is he going to be held in contempt? No. Is he going to go to jail for perjury? No. Is anything going to happen? No. Why? Because the government is spineless. And I should say the GOP is spineless. They don't have any real teeth. Nobody is actually appealing to you to help them do their job. And the rest of them are all in on it. So what good is this information? This information is to teach you that your government is lying to you. That those we have put into positions of power lie to you in dangerous situations. Okay. Now that you've established that, let's talk about the Restrict Act. You know what the Restrict Act is. This comes from last week when we were all talking about TikTok. TikTok. It's dangerous. It is. I don't want to be a part of it. We deleted it from the blaze. We had a big following on TikTok. We deleted it from the blaze. I wasn't for it in the first place. Blaze makes their own decisions. All right. So what happens? It's going through and we're told that we want the government just wants to cancel TikTok. Now, how do you do that? Well, you just pass a law saying TikTok and its subsidiaries who are connected to China no longer can perform any service here in the United States of America because they've been deemed a tool of the Communist Party in China. Period. That's what you do. But no, all of a sudden out of nowhere, we have the Restrict Act. What is the Restrict Act? Well, the Restrict Act is for you. Now, I want you to remember the Patriot Act. It came out of nowhere and you were a patriot. If you were for it, if you were against it, you were a dangerous Islamic supporter that had to die. You were against America. You were against the flag you spat on apple pies. So what is the Restrict Act? By the way, the Patriot Act actually was first introduced back in the 1990s. It went nowhere because there wasn't a reason, but it had already been developed and put into its form. When 9-11 happened, somebody went the Patriot Act, blew the dust off it and it passed. Now, we've got a problem with TikTok. We need to do something about TikTok. So the Restrict Act, the Restrict Act is extraordinarily dangerous. The Restrict Act is not about banning TikTok. That's not what it is. It'll give the National Intelligence Agency the ability to tell a website using any foreign content or software that it might be engaged in platform communications, the U.S. government views as against their interests, and will have to be shut down or face criminal charges up to 20 years. In very direct terms, the passage of this bill would give the Department of Congress the Domestic National Intelligence Agency and the DHS the ability to shut you down because what you're reading or sharing right now, if I am sharing something, let's say they're lying to you, that would be deemed against the interests of the United Nations, or I'm sorry, of the United States and the United Nations and the World Economic Forum, but they're all the same. What I just said would shut me down. The Restrict Act can also punish people for using VPNs. If you have a VPN, it will direct the Secretary of Commerce to identify, deter, disrupt, prevent, prohibit, investigate, or otherwise mitigate all that which is deemed a national security risk associated with technology if it is linked to which governments here, China, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Russia, Venezuela, but just like everything else, ah, those get a little slippery, I'm sure. So the Commerce Secretary reading from the bill would be authorized to take steps to address risks posed by any covered transaction by any person. Okay, so what does that mean? Well, the bill says it means a transaction in which an entity described in Sub-Paragraph B has any interest. Entities described in Sub-Paragraph B are foreign adversaries, an entity subject to the jurisdiction of or organized under the laws of or foreign adversary, ah, and an entity owned, directed, or controlled by either of these. Foreign adversaries can be any foreign government or regime that the secretary de deems a national threat. So there's not the government, there's no vote on this. It's the Secretary of Commerce if he's like, you know what, the Netherlands, these farmers, they're all up in arms. They've just taken all of these houses and what are they saying about farmland? They're saying that the World Economic Forum in the United States of America and the UN, they're all in it together and they want to get rid of farmland and give it to these multinational corporations. Well, that's a threat to our government's plans. Shut them down. Okay. You, you have to call your senators and make sure they are not voting for this. Now, who is voting for this on the Republican side, the supporters of the Restrict Act in 60 seconds? I'm guessing that the next time you have to take flight somewhere, you're not going to try to build your own airplane and fly it. Some things are left better to the experts. This is why I started a company with my brother years ago. It is a free service to you because I don't like selling or buying houses. It's the biggest, it's the biggest investment of your life. And I don't know what the hell I'm doing. I don't know when is a good time, when is a bad time? What is my house really worth? What do I hope it's worth? How do I get the best deal in, you know, especially now, if you're buying anything in Texas, good luck with that. How do you buy something and get the best deal?

But I think you're going to see the difference. Real estate agents, I trust.com. That's real estate agents, I trust.com. 10 seconds, station ID. This is amazing. This, this, this, this restrict act does all kinds of things and is a Patriot Act and is dangerous as the Patriot Act. Okay, Senator John Thune is for it. Deb Fisher from Nebraska is for it from Kansas. Jerry Moran, I like to call him Moran. Jerry Moran is for it. Dan Sullivan from Arkansas, Susan Collins, what a surprise, even bigger surprise. Mitt Romney is for this. Shelley Moore Capito from West Virginia. Kevin Kramer, Chuck Grassley is for this. Tom Tillis and Lindsey Graham. Now Lindsey Graham, I think he was on Fox last night and he was kind of like, oh, I don't know what what? No, I'm not for this. But Lindsey Graham is a sponsor of it. And you said Dan Sullivan from Arkansas. I think it would be to Alaska. Yeah, it's Alaska. Sorry. There is a Dan Sullivan in Arkansas, but it's a different, he's a state Senator. Yeah. Dan Sullivan, Senator from Alaska. All right. So those are the people who are for it. You got to tell them you are not to vote for this. You are not to vote for this. This is a very, look, what's being constructed right now, because they're telling you everything is fine. You listen to the international media about our banks. They're all saying the same thing. You listen to internationally, what's being said about the dollar. They're all saying the same thing. Okay. It's going down. We're in real dire straits right now. So they're telling you, no, it's all conspiracy. That's all fine. It's all fine. While they build a cage for you and for me, because they know trouble is coming. So we got to control the people. All right. Now, I know I said that about any legislation, any legislation after we said no to the bill back better. Don't pass it because they will put it all in that legislation. And they did. It's called the inflation reduction act. It is the bill back better. New Green Deal. That's what it is. But they named it something else. This is the same kind of thing, but they're telling you, it's about getting the bad guys in China. No, it's not. No, it's not. No, on the restrict act. This is critically important. There's a few things today that are really important. One, the the transphobia garbage has nothing to do with trans people. It has nothing to do with hatred. It has everything to do with telling doctors, you're not to do mutilation on our children. Period. That's the only argument. No mutilation on our children. You have to pay attention to what happened with Saudi Arabia, China and Brazil. They are collapsing the dollar. They made a new agreement yesterday. Huge story. This is also critical importance, the restrict act. And then the six month pause on something you know all about next. The Glenn back program. Okay, look, here is, here's the thing. Last hour, I told you about Brazil. Brazil and China have just made a trade deal, which allows Brazil and China to do business without using the dollar. Now, China has been doing this all over the world and it's going to compound. It's going to start hitting more and more. Right now, they have to buy our dollars. So, Brazil and China had to have some of our dollars in their bank accounts to do international trade. They had to have it as the reserve currency. But now, if they make a deal that they don't have to do that anymore, as countries get away from the dollar, our dollar collapses. And that, as I told you in last night's special, is Venezuela.

You'll get it first thing every morning. There is something else that I want to talk to you about. And that is AI. And I cannot. I don't know how I could have prepared you better for these times. I feel sometimes that I really truly failed because I couldn't find ways to get people to understand that these things are not fantasies. This is real. AI, what is coming is you will not recognize the world in five years. You just won't. Everything is about to change. And I've told you a hundred years of, you know, farm to factory, the industrial revolution, it took a hundred years. That hundred year change. Think of that, that hundred year change from a horse plow to supermarkets, rockets to the moon, and in, you know, assembly lines and a global mark, all of that in 10 years. AI is driving this. And I've been warning that we have got to have conversations about ethics and what is real, what isn't, what does life mean? Not like what's the meaning of life. Why do I live? What is life? What is life? And we better decide these things quickly. I said 10 years ago. And now the world is starting to catch up. Elon Musk and some of the most powerful people in artificial intelligence systems. A thousand of them just yesterday came out and they could not keep up with the list. They had to stop taking names or publishing the names because they want to verify everybody. They couldn't keep up with the names of scientists that were signing this yesterday. They got a thousand and then they said, we got to take a break because we can't, we can't keep up. A thousand people in AI signed and said, we've got to stop all stuff on AI for six months, a pause on everything AI for six months. It's too late, guys. You can't. You can't. Here's the argument against it. China, Iran, Russia. I mean, we are maybe, maybe a little ahead of China. I don't think so. I think we're at parity. They, some people say they're ahead of us just a little bit. You cannot lose your place on AI. It is the most, it is. Here's what it is. It is the atomic bomb except it will be in everyone's house. So you, you cannot be second, third or fourth in line. You've got to be there first. We are ahead in quantum computing, I am told. But all of this stuff is being done with dangerous corporations and the federal government. This is, this is game changing for freedom alone. And it is going to happen quickly. I told you that by 2030, jobs are all going to change. Everything's going to change. There'll be, I, I tried to tell you I'm against basic income. What is it called? Universal, universal basic income because of socialism. However, we have to talk about how are we going to pay people? We have to find meaning in our own lives because we will not have jobs. Many of us, that seemed like fantasy. What was it? Two days ago? Two days ago, the scientists are saying, the guys who are in charge of a lot of this are saying, we're just very concerned because the way it's developing, we think as many as 300 million jobs will be lost by 2030. 300, that's, that's every job in America. 300 million jobs will be lost. Now that doesn't mean we don't create new jobs, but you've got seven years to transition people in seven years is going to be crazy. This is the real reason why our political parties are fighting and putting all kinds of circus tents up. They're keeping us busy with, with candy corn, which nobody likes, you know, and cupcakes. They're doing it with side shows and political arguments because everything is about to change. And it doesn't have to be frightening. If we keep our heads, if we get some divine providence as well on AI, the best description of AI I've ever heard, is for those people who say, no, it'll be benevolent. It'll be great. You don't know that. That would be like saying, no, seriously, oh, the space aliens, when they get here, they're going to love us. Well, they might, but they also might see us as bugs. They also might want to eat us. They also might want to dominate us, enslave us. They might like us, but we don't know how they think. This is the problem with chat GPT. You can't, it's not logical. It's not following 2 plus 2 equals 4. It's a neural net. And so it, you can't trace how it came to a certain conclusion. So you don't know how it's going to think. It's, it's the same as alien life. We have no idea. And we are playing, I mean, I think who was it that was on the show a day or two ago, or was it last week, that was talking about COVID in Wuhan and what's happening today in the same Wuhan lab, they are now dealing with a, a plague that is as bad as the bubonic plague. Like one third of the population dies if this gets out. And it's all gain a function research. And I can guarantee you were involved. And we all know it. We all know this is dangerous. We all know everyone except the elite know that this is insanity to do. What are you doing? But they do it anyway. The same thing with AI. It could kill us. But it also could be miraculous. The thing is you're going to have chat GPT 4 can now do it. And that's out. Chat GPT 4 is has the ability for you to say, I want you, I want you to develop a bot for me that answers all my email. Okay. And writes it in my voice. And it will develop the software to answer all of your email. I'm using this as an example within the next 12 months. You'll have that. So you won't really have to check your email because it will alert you what you need to know to give you a summary of things. It will just give you a checklist. Hey, I did this. I did this. I did this. But it will answer in your voice. So 12 months from now, a lot of people might be making deals, having conversation, falling away from each other because of an argument or or healing things without the people knowing it. Because the bots will be communicating with other people's emails in their name. And the bots will be representing you. And we'll be now think about somebody with nefarious purposes. It's not just AI. It's what AI will allow others to do. You have this tool in your toolbox. What are you willing to do? It is giving everyone a nuclear weapon. Mutually assured destruction. Unfortunately, there are those that just like to see the world burn. Ray Kurzweil came out today. He is one of the most fascinating, fascinating guys ever. I've been reading him since the 1990s. He is the leader on all of this stuff, but he is also truly terrifying because he believes that we will reach immortality by 2045. 2045. What does immortality mean? He means it as we're going to be able to download you. Your thought processes. I can tell you, right now, there's another article. These are all in the show prep today. There is another article God's in the machine. This is the rise of artificial intelligence may result in new religions. There's already a new religion out there with all of this. We're about to witness the birth of a new kind of religion in the next few years. Perhaps even months we will see the emergence of sex devoted to the worship of artificial intelligence because it will become Godlike. And we will say, people are already saying it. People will say, no, that's alive because the bot will say it's alive and it will hold a conversation with you and you will swear that it is alive. It has consciousness. And when it's smarter than you, like a lot smarter than you, it becomes Godlike. Are we prepared for any of these things? The best scientist on AI yesterday came out and said, a freeze, a moratorium on all research on AI for six months, but it's not going to happen. You need to dig deep into that spiritual well and make sure if there's no water in there, you drill down for water because you're going to need spiritual guidance and spirituality to give your life meaning, purpose, and to be able to find the truth in the world that is coming at you at a thousand miles an hour. Everyone seems to think that mortgage rates are still through the roof, but it's not entirely the case. They are coming down right now a little bit there. Some places they're in the fives, which is a lot lower than say the average credit card interest rate, which is 20, 21, 22%. Credit cards are a killer. I'm not sure we taught our kids like my parents taught me. I remember them cutting up the credit cards and throwing them in the fire with all of us kids watching credit cards bad. So American financing is now trying to save people like you an average of $700 a month. That's the average savings for people doing business right now with American financing. It's kind of a lot. And what's happening is they are paying off that high interest credit card and getting into a 5% interest instead of a 21% interest. You can pay it off so much faster. You could also delay up to two mortgage payments. It'll give you additional savings. Plus, you're going to save about $700 a month on average. It's American financing 800 906 2440 800 906 2440.

I have Chachie PT 4 that I am experimenting with and it is amazing. You could take a picture now of the inside of your refrigerator. It will recognize what's in your refrigerator, give you a a recipe for what you could make for dinner with what's in your refrigerator. Think of that incredible incredible incredible. There's a story in the I think this is New York Times today. Yeah, how Chachie PT performed as my executive assistant. He said, I wanted to try it out to see if they could prepare me for meetings. Do the research and professional background checks on a person summarize the meetings in a tidy easily scannable format plan my business trips, detail to teneraries, manage my calendar including booking meetings and rescheduling appointments. Yadda yadda yadda. He said, just on the meeting preparation, I told chat DPT that I was meeting with this random guy. He was a former Apple executive and I told him that I was in an AI startup. Chachie PT not only summarized his education, his work and everything else, it then coached me on helpful strategies to win him over as an investor. Quote showcase how your startup combines AI with other fields such as cognitive psychology, linguistics or neuroscience to create innovative solutions. This interdisciplinary approach might resonate with Scott given his academic background in symbiotic systems. Geez, geez. We are so screwed. We are we are we are just imagine what this is. How this works on an elderly person who just lost their spouse and needs to be talked out of investing their savings or swindled out of their money in some way. Like this is I mean, it's already happening with Nigerian princes. Imagine this Glenn back program. It's a new day. I'm trying to raise. What you're about to hear is the fusion of entertainment and enlightenment. This is the Glenn back program. Hello America. I guess we have a new standard now in medicine that you cannot disagree with Fauci or the long arm of the government on anything about COVID or you'll be destroyed. But the same people that are taking away your license on things like, I don't know, hydroxychloroquine, those people also are darn sure that I don't even have to ask the parent of an eight year old. If that eight year old thinks that, you know, he's a girl and I can sterilize him and make him a girl. What the hell is happening? You know the answer. Evil has the world by the throat. So let's see if we can do some good here and restore some justice and common sense. I've got two doctors now coming up in just a second. Have you got a pair of dice nearby? I'd like it to roll them.

He's a family physician. He has had his board certification revoked over, quote, COVID-19 misinformation. He's joining us now. Dr. Latelle, how are you, sir? Glenn, I'm great on route from one office to another and it's an honor to be on the show with you and share what's been going on in the wacky world of medicine these last year. Yeah, it's a little frightening. So you, I want to take you through your story here. You, in November of 2021, you did a Florida summit on COVID and then you did another one in November 2022. And what were those summits? Yeah, those were an opportunity to bring together the best and brightest minds in the science and medicine of COVID people like Peter McCullough, Dr. Robert Mulan, lion Cole, Pierre Cori, you name it. Everybody that you can think of who has been on the right side of history, mostly to have a dialogue. We've invited other people, but the bottom line is we brought together these positions to discuss the early prevention and treatment of COVID, especially when we had the alpha and delta variants. And then to discuss as the vaccines were rolled out, whether or not it was a safe and effective vaccine with Dr. Robert Mulan, of course, being one of the inventors of message RNA technology. So we had wonderful debate, dialogue, and even some disagreement at those summits, something that you don't see anywhere else in medicine, that the amazing thing is that the American Border Family Medicine decided that the information we had put out from those summits, they held me liable, of course, for the comments. They said I was misinforming the public and I was an endangerment to society. And that was grounds for de-certifying me. As unbelievable. Now you were one of the first to start treating people with hydroxychloroquine. And then Ivermectin, I believe I took, yeah, I did. I took both of those. I've had COVID twice. I didn't take the vaccine because I believe in natural immunity. But I know I took hydroxychloroquine and wiped it out. And then Ivermectin and hydroxychloroquine and wiped it out a second time didn't really have real problems with it. You did that and you were punished for that as well, right? Oh, sure. Yeah. I mean, so were other physicians who even attempted to get the medications for their patients. And one of the differences for me is I've always, as a family doctor, kept my hospital privileges. So I was most desperately trying to get the Ivermectin for people who were already in the hospitals or had been sent to the emergency room because by that time, and it was I've shared in many venues how it was beyond frustrating. It was, for me, not to be able to provide life-saving treatments to people. And the hospital saying, well, we just have this one protocol. They're even going to live or they're going to die. They're going to go in the ventilator. They may or may not get off. And they don't throw at them. This incredible medication, hydroxychloroquine, of course, is quinine, which has been around for the ages, for certain reasons and has medicinal properties. The Ivermectin is derived from the same root plant streptomyces that Zithromax is, the Z-packer, rithomycin. It's a macrolide. It's a human medication meant for human treatment, not a horse medicine, which the FDA, as you remember, saying, this is for horses. I mean, incredible that this Nobel Prize-winning medicine, which is incredibly safe, was denied people. And like you, I took it as well. And thank God, recovery. I never missed a day of work despite having the alpavari of the naphthalmicron, because these medications worked that quickly and effectively. But yet we were denied the right to provide them to our patients. And then of course, are we disciplined for doing it or attempting to do it? And you were also disciplined. You're fined for a $500 suspended for two weeks because you let visitors in family members to see and pray with their father and husband before he was taken off the ventilator. You did it again in another hospital, and they required you to go to psychiatric counseling to be able to maintain your privileges. Yeah, no, it's that sounds kind of, I'm sure the listeners can't believe all that could have happened. I mean, the one hospital here in central Florida, I just was saying these, their husband, their father had acquired COVID in the hospital going for an elective procedure, which came back to them on the ventilator, was on a vent for weeks. And they were not allowed to see him. I finally said, that's enough. And when they were going to take him off, I said, well, before he dies, you know, they had this crazy policy. People are still suffering from not having seen their loved ones. And the hospital said, well, once they're DNR, we can let the visitors in. Or once they're dead, they can let they come to you. And I said, no, I can't. They're going to go in. They're going to his father was a minister, a big church here in town. And so I said, I said, you guys, this guy is no longer in the section. He's been on an event for kind of, and I said, you're going to see your dad, you're going to see your husband. And then there was like all heck broke loose in the hospital because Dr. Laetel was bringing in patients. And I did, I snuck more than a few ministers, priests and families in to see patients. That's just the one time I was disciplined, because it never made sense to isolate them. The psychological counseling was was just because the hospital saw that I was making, you know, the doctors looked bad and they brought me before the medical executive committee, and they said, you know, you've got to shape up. And I said, what do you mean? You know, this is what I do. And I lost my temper one time, one time, Glenn, on a weekend when I was rounding one patients and a pulmonologist was refusing to give patients even adequate amounts of blood benders and steroids. And I said to him, please, would you try to do more? Because I couldn't take care of every patient in the hospital. I mean, I'm a family doc. I can only do so much. And he said to me, you know, Dr. Laetel, he said, I have no evidence that changing the way I'm doing things will make a single bit of difference. And I looked at him and I slammed my fist and it's who, one time I raised my voice, I said, the only evidence you need is that it's not working. People are dying. And why would you not consider doing things that I've been able to do in other doctors around the country? It was just such a bad example. I call it the Dark Ages of Medicine, where there was nobody listening to reason, no willingness to dialogue. And people were afraid to vary from the protocol established by Bauci in the CDC. I have to tell you, Doc, the lies that have been proven now that came from the CDC and, you know, the Wuhan lab and Dr. Fauci, it should chill people to the bone, especially since you are now looking at people being punished if they won't mutilate a child at eight years old and give them sex change, you know, medications or surgeries. We are entering a time that is truly frightening because we trust our doctors and they've blown through a lot of that. And now here are people like you trying to get your certification back, which shouldn't have been lost in the first place. I disagree, but I'm using time-tested 100-year-old drugs. That's not crazy to do. It's not going to harm people if you take these things. You lose your certification for that and you're in Florida. What is the Surgeon General in Florida say? Oh, God bless Dr. Joseph Latipo. You know, he's with us on this issue. If you've seen this latest video just yesterday, he was asked about what happened with me and he was just spot on. You know, he said, you know, Dr. Latel has been a good and faithful servant. I mean, I've just been doing my thing, taking care of patients and solo practice. Believe me, I didn't want this publicity, but he supports me 100% as does Governor DeSantis. We're having a medical freedom legislative bill come up on Monday actually in the house here in Florida. So, you know, the legislative angle, I think we ultimately may be effective here in the state of Florida, but you know, are the hospitals and American boards, especially boards at the medical schools? You mentioned, you know, the transgenderism, you know, to become a doctor in this country, and I teach medical students, you know, they are told they have to choose, they have to ask about pronouns. They are not allowed to inject their religious views, their moral perspective, even if they ascribe to the natural law and the Hippocratic oath, those are no longer considered to be applicable in medicine. Instead, it's about the patient's decision, regardless of their age. And so, you know, we have weeded out physicians of conscience for decades in medicine. And you know, COVID was just one more step. And one of the reasons I've raised some money for some legal battles is because I know that we've got to do something to protect the rights. You know, I'm in my 60s. I've been doing this 33 years. They can't harm me by so much. But it's a pre-med. The guys in college and gals who want to be doctors, they have a patient in medicine, and they have been told, unless you get that jab in your arm, you are not going to medical school. So what are your what are your plans, your lawsuits? What are you planning on doing to to change this, especially in our schools? Our medical schools? The medical schools have been discriminatory for a long time. And I can get into a lot of ways they've been discriminating. You probably know where that's going. But you know, you basically have to come back to the constitution, you know, in the First Amendment rights, you know, freedom to to express our beliefs. These medical students are not free to speak about alternative aspects of medicine or even Christian views or Christian perspectives on health care, the natural law. So I this is a huge thing. I've got Matt Staver with the Liberty Council. Yeah, good. These amazing I've got the interest Schlaffler who you may not know the Chief Council for the American Academy of Physicians and Surgeons, the daughter of son rather of Phyllis Schlaffler, a hero for a time. And then we've got Jeff Childers, a lawyer in Gainesville with, and if he catches coffee and COVID ever, he's amazing. He is the one who's been helping me pro bono to this point despite these hospitals and and now the American board. But you know, we put out a fundraiser and give send go and it came back 6000 more people will be, you know, by donating. And I said, this is not for Dr. John Latelle. This is to create what is going to fight a legal battle and to get this team of lawyers and as many others lining up, we are the conference in Atlanta with 100 lawyers just on Saturday, they're lining up. I will tell you right now, and this this should be understood by every person in the audience, everything that you have had restricted because of separation of church and state, you can't have a nativity scene, you can't put a cross up, you can't speak your mind about whatever because of religious, we have more religious freedom right now because of the Supreme Court decisions. We have more religious freedom than we have had in the last 100 years. And all of those cases need to go back in front. So if the Supreme Court said, no, they can discriminate against your religion, because their doctors are scientists, you're in with the exact right people, the Liberty Council of others, these guys, they are ready to take these cases into court and get them overturned. And it is critical that we do this. Right now we can do it. This is almost a guarantee win if we get the right cases with the right attorneys right now. I want to give your give send go, just search for supporting Dr. John Latel legal fees, supporting Dr. John Latel legal fees, just go to give send go.com, give send go.com supporting Dr. John Latel legal fees. And he is, he's a guy who's been fighting since it first came over here. And he is fighting now to get our freedom back. I commend you for your hard work, your stamina, your willingness to stand. And it's a crime that you have lost your board certification. But I have faith that in least Florida, sanity will prevail. Thank you very much, Dr. Thank you. Thank you, Glenn, for hearing my calls and the cause of so many others out there and keep praying for us. We need those prayers. Thank you very much. Dr. John Latel, L-I-T-T-E-L-L. That's where you look. That's what you look for. Give send go supporting Dr. John Latel legal fees. So important. And by the way, if your town has said you can't have a nativity scene, go refile because it will be overturned. And it'll be very, very clear. These lawyers are looking for people willing to send. They say, we don't have a shortage of lawyers. We don't have a shortage of money on this. We just have a shortage of people who are willing to stand up and say, yeah, I'll put my name on that. I'll take it to the Supreme Court. All right, gold line. I told you this morning that yesterday it was announced that Brazil and China have just made a new economic pact. This is the latest country where they are going to trade without the US dollar as the gold reserve currency. It is, it is the end of the dollar, and it is already starting now. This Brazil is not the first country to do this. The Saudi Arabians have just made the petro dollar thing of the past. You can buy with other currency now. This is the beginning of the end of the US dollar. When this happens, this turns us overnight into Venezuela. Please, please don't dismiss the times we're living in, please. I want you to call gold line and see if gold or silver is right for you. You can, you can save some of the stuff that you have in an IRA, your 401k, your Roth IRA, traditional IRA, TSP accounts, simple IRA. And there's more of them as well. You just call the representatives of gold line at 866 gold line and find out how you can take some of your savings and put it into gold, receive 6% in free metals, deliver directly to you with a qualifying order. This is so important. Call 866 gold line, 866 gold line or goldline.com. 10 seconds, station ID. By the way, last night's television program, I laid out a couple of things. One was about Nashville. We started with Nashville. We had Michael Knowles on, who made a great case on what this is really all about. And you can see that on blaisetv.com slash Glenn, or it might, can you check, see if it's still up on YouTube? They might not have done it because I was talking with Michael Knowles. So the YouTube may have been taken down. But the also the important thing, and I talked to a former treasury official about CBD sees. And she said, look, don't make no mistake, this is happening. It's happening. And she's the one who described Venezuela. When it does happen, Venezuela, all of the show prep from last night's TV program, you can get it now with my newsletter at glenbeck.com. Glenbeck.com takes you through all of the documents and everything else. If you go to glenbeck.com now, you click on the documents, you'll get all the information about CBD sees, the FedNow program, all of the stuff that led to last night's TV special. Just go to glenbeck.com, click on the documents or sign up for my free email newsletter. Well, welcome back to Stu has been gone for the last few days. It is good to have you to thank you, glen. We missed you. It's been great. And I say we, I don't mean me or anybody else, but there's somebody out there that missed you. Right. That's possible. Anything's possible. Yesterday, I announced tickets for the first ever traveling museum. Oh, you did. Yeah. Wow. 75 million dollars worth of American and world history. I think you're going to say that was a ticket price. That's price. I only have cell one, though. Yeah. And, and it's, it's just going to be amazing. There's only a few hundred people that are going to be allowed in every day. So you got to get your tickets. It's happening. I think the last week of June, the first week of July, it closes on July 4th. So make sure you get your tickets. Now United we stand.org slash tickets United we stand.org slash tickets. It's happening. We announced yesterday, St. George, Utah for about a week and a half. And then it's going up for a couple of days in Northern Idaho. I will announce that coming up in a couple of weeks. So get your tickets now. Join me the week before and the week of 4th of July, St. George. It's really cool there in July. Really? Oh, really? Yeah. I mean, like, hey, cool. Not like, I mean, your hair will set on fire. The Glenn back program. Fadeful day when somebody doesn't come home usually starts out like any other day. There is no ominous foreshadowing, no scary music. You know, I was thinking about the tunnel to towers people today when I read about all the people that we lost in the two helicopter crashes that happened. Where was that in Tennessee last night? Ever since 9 11, the Tunnel to Towers Foundation has been helping people caught in exactly this position when a veteran or a first responder doesn't come home. They help the families by providing them with a mortgage-free house. It's an amazing institution that does so much good in the world and they really need your help. There are so many people that we need to take care of, especially the cops on the front line. They lose their life and their family left with nothing but a mortgage. Let's help them help America's heroes and their families donate $11 a month to Tunnel to Towers at t2t.org. That's t, the number 2t.org. This is well worth your investment and your prayers. Tunnel to towers.org. Head over to blaisetv.com slash Glen and use the promo code GLEN. There you go. Save $10 off your subscription to blaisetv. So we just got a phone with one doctor who is working hard now to make sure that laws are overturned or reestablished, if you will, for doctors having a difference of opinion and still being able to be a doctor. For instance, a doctor who disagrees with treatments, as long as he's not doing harm, what is your problem? We have the arrogance in these medical boards now and these medical schools that if you won't perform abortions because you think it's wrong, you're not going to get accepted to medical school. If you don't agree with gender therapy, which is a theory and I think a dangerous one, you can't get into medical school. You won't go down with a pronoun. So you don't get into medical school. This is insane. We have to have disagreement opposition in all things. It sharpens the knife. It sharpens our skills and our thinking. Dr. Eric Henson is with us now. He's an ear nose and throat specialist. He's had his license suspended here in Texas because of a 2020 mask mandate, but it was suspended in 23. I don't even understand this story. Dr. Eric Henson, welcome to the program. Thanks, Glenn, for having me. What is going on? You didn't go with the mask mandate in 2020 because you disagreed with it. Now three years later, they're coming to suspend your license? Correct. Yes, in 2020, when all this was happening and the governor made the mandate that everybody should wear a mask, being an ear nose and throat doctor, an airway specialist, essentially, I knew they didn't work and I've known it for decades since that's the area I work in. I tried to tell everybody what these things can do and that they can't stop the infection and all the diseases that will follow and that you're going to be harming people. I had a patient turn me in for not wearing one who oddly enough showed up with vertigo, most likely because she had low oxygen and high CO2. They subsequently sent a letter. We went ahead and responded. We didn't respond quick enough, not because we didn't, but because the lawyer had at the time his father had a hemorrhagic stroke. Then they used that against me. The second complaint I had was because I shook somebody's hand. She turned me in because I touched her and wasn't wearing a mask. Never know mind that your eyes are open and you can get the virus in just as easily there. With these two complaints, we went and had the discussion with the medical board and they said, well, you violated something. I tried to tell them, I said, this has been rescinded by the governor as has all the violations. Why are we here? They said, well, because you did it when it was in place. I said, well, it doesn't matter. They've rescinded everything, what happened with the hairdresser in Dallas. I explained all that. You've actually been proven to be correct. I mean, I assume you wear a mask when you're in surgery, right? I do. Only when I have a chance of having body fluids enter into my mouth, the same reason why anybody yourself included, would protect your eyes. That's why we wear them. If I'm not, then I don't have to. It's been proven that if you do wear masks in certain situations, you could potentially contaminate because of what masks can harbor after that, especially if you use them repeatedly. What you were saying about masks turns out to be true and they're still coming after you, even though we know now that what they were basing all of this on was false. They followed me guilty. We fought back and complained. Then I was in a new practice just starting up. We were on a nice edge financially. After everything was said and done, they said, well, we don't find you guilty, but you're still going to have to pay a fine. Do CMEs, not in my specialty, you're going to have to take the jurisprudence test. Then they went ahead on my Texas profile put that I was an unprofessional doctor. Oh my God. Oh, yeah. For a mask, even though that I was right. Then they also put on there that I was seeping the public. Oh my gosh. You're doomed as a doctor. Yeah, exactly. Now you have all this negative press and we don't know how much we've lost. It's probably been thousands if not hundreds of thousands in patients and everything. I fought back against that. Then they threatened to take my license right on the spot and said, well, we're going to take your license. We're going to report you to something called the National Practitioners Data Bank, which if insurance companies get a hold of that, then you get dropped as a carrier. Now I have nobody coming in because no one's going to pay cash essentially. Now I have no way of making a living. I was scared to death that I was going to lose. Not only my practice, our home, our property, I've got a family. I've got several employees that rely on this product. Oh boy, this sounds like a January 6 person. So what deal did you cut? Are you going there? Well, yeah, what happened is, is that I went ahead because just to try to find myself some time to figure it out, we signed that we would do this, and then I continued the fight. Well, I have very little time to do because we're trying to keep the practice open. So essentially, I didn't do any of the CMEs. I did some of the CMEs by default, and then I didn't do the JP exam. So as of Tuesday, they wanted to know why I didn't do it. I explained it. They deliberated for a few minutes, came back and said, we're going to suspend your license immediately, which puts me right back into the same situation. I find it fascinating, though, that this is being done in Texas. And I haven't heard from Governor Abbott. I haven't heard from the Attorney General. I haven't heard from the Lieutenant Governor, which again, if I was in another state, I'd understand, but this is Texas. And I'm having a really, really hard time understanding how this could happen here. Well, we're going to reach out to the Attorney General of Texas. He's a friend of ours and usually on top of things like this, and we'll get an answer for you on. Oh, I appreciate that. Because he's actually written several times, several areas in Texas have written to him. And he says, you can't go above and beyond what the original fine was, which was $1,000. And that's when it was in place. But when Governor Abbott rescinded all the penalties and all his orders, this should have been wiped clean. And it hasn't. But I've been very fortunate now that we have an incredible legal team that is actually stepped up to the plate. And it's been great. So I'm very, very excited about this. And the lawyer that's fighting tooth and nail is named Paul Davis. And he's just gone out of his way. One of his assistants, Amy has just been phenomenal. But I don't get why this is happening. So now I've got to worry about my practice all over again, just the fear of it alone. Whether or not I've had two of my employees came up to me and said, do we have to find a home? I'm a single mom. I've got a feed. I've got to feed my daughter. This is frightening. And what's more important is none of the patients in my practice ever, ever became sick for me not wearing a mask, not one of them. I took care of people all over the country during this by using hydroxy, by using ivermectin, by using the supplements that we know work. I'm exceedingly well read in ancient medicines. And I do believe in alternative medicines, even though I'm a surgeon. And yet here we are. And I'm dealing with this, almost this theocracy. It's just one sided. And I wouldn't expect it in Texas. That was one of the reasons we moved here. We're originally in Florida. Then we went to Alabama. And, you know, there wasn't enough work there. So we ended up here. And I thought, this is perfect. I'm in East Texas. You know, I'm the only E and T in this area. I don't know what my patients are going to do. I take care of fairly sick people from allergies to cancer patients. And so we're, you know, we're trying to get this where we can still see patients why we work through this. So it's, the medical board is putting a lot of patients in harm's way. So I'm hoping. Is the this is Texas medical board. So is that a part of the state? Do you know? I believe they are. Yes. They're under the purview of the governor. And I'm assuming Lieutenant Governor and the the Attorney General, if they were to go into court with us, then they would be the ones handling it. But yes, they're under that. So there's a direct link to, you know, the governor or the Attorney General being involved in this. What's interesting, Glenn, I have never in 25 plus years ever had anything ever said about me ever until I came to Texas. I've never seen this. And this is over a mask. You're going to take my only way of supporting myself, my wife, and all my employees away over a mask because I didn't fulfill what they what they deemed necessary. We have found out that, you know, what they imposed, they can't. But I still have to fight it. But you know, they knew what they were doing. I'm going to put a call into our our AG and to the governor's office because I have to tell you, you like if you're if this is happening to you in Texas over a mask, it is I mean, what is that the hell is Texas stand for? I mean, you should have stayed in Florida. Well, and that's just it. And what's even Northland? This is this is the I think this is just a very it's me at this time. But it's going to what else are they going to go? They scared doctors into doing whatever they want. Because if you already are, they already are with this gender crap. They already are. Okay, let me give you a couple of things if you're listening. Well, if you're not listening, then I'm not talking to you. But anyway, to call the Texas medical board and to say, Hey, you know, leave this alone with Dr. Eric Henson. You can call 800-248-4062-800-248-6462. You also have Giv Sengo. I guess you just go to Giv Sengo.com and you just search for the support for Dr. Eric Henson. Sounds like he could use some support. You have legal good legal representation. We do. Like I said, Paul has been outstanding. Paul Davis has been outstanding. And they have absolutely scared it out everything on this. We just, you know, unfortunately, I have to raise money because I've been battling this for going on three years. And it's drained the all of our accounts. And so I have some very nice patients who have come and helped us. One of the gentlemen I work with who I'm sure you know, Stephen Petty, who is, I consider the number one industrial hygienist in the country has stepped up. He's going to be our expert for this because it's just preposterous. We are hurting people. These things cause cancer. They cause infections. And it's beyond me how this has gotten this out of hand. I don't think Greg Abbott ever meant for this to happen. I really don't. I just think that we have a department, the Texas Medical Board, that is out of control. And to have this done, it's just ridiculous. Giv Sengo.com support Dr. Eric Henson. And also let me give you the number for the Texas Medical Board one more time. It's 800-248-4062. We're going to delve into this a bit, Dr. And I'll get an answer from the Attorney General on why he's why he's not straightening this out. If I could ask a favor and I don't know if anybody's ever done this, but Mr. Davis and also Bob Hall, who I'm sure you know, Senator. Yes, Senator. Yes. Senator Hall has gone out of his way for me. He is he is fought with the Texas Medical Board on several occasions to try to get all of this taken care of, not only for myself but other physicians, but I would if possible, I would love to have him on your show along with Paul Davis so they could explain the legal aspects of what I'm up against. I just think that everybody needs to know this and let doctors know out there that there are people fighting for us. And you know that we can practice the way we are. Medicine is an art as much as it is as science. Thank you so much, Dr. Appreciate him. Dr. Dr. Eric Henson gives send go dot com. All right. Today's the first day of the rest of your life. At least that's how the saying goes. Now you have to choose if it's the rest of your life. Today is a new day, new chapter. If you're living with pain day in and day out, when somebody says it to you you're like, shut up. But let's get you out of pain. Today could be the first day of the chance of living a pain free life. I want you just to try the three week quick start of relief factor. It's 1995. If it doesn't work, you're out 20 bucks and 70% of the people who try it go on. That means 30%. It doesn't it doesn't work for them. But I'm telling you, it's worked for me in a massive way. And I know so many people who have taken it and it has changed their life. So maybe you're part of that 70%. It is worth trying. Trust me. I didn't believe in that. I thought this is never going to work for me. My wife made me take it. Please try it. Relief factor.com. Relief factor.com or call 800 the number four relief. 800 for relief. Relief factor.com. Welcome to the Glenbeck program. You know, my wife called and she said, I'm listening to you. And I'm like, wow, that's that's some new. You sure it's me? It's not Dr. Laura or somebody you think sounds like me. Anyway, she said that I gave the wrong address for the tickets for the museum. And she was right. It is you shut up, Stu. It's incredible. You are in the radio hall of fame. It's your project, your tour, your museum. There you have it. Another example of why Glenbeck is in the radio hall of fame. I'm not saying that that is a good thing for the radio hall of fame. I'm saying their standards have fallen so low. I feel like the radio hall of fame should be like every Benagan's in America. One day you show up and they closed it because of you. Okay. All right. So anyway, it's United we pledge.org United we pledge.org is they'll take a front page. Just look for tickets and events. That is an incredible event that I'm pretty sure is happening the last week of June 1st week of July in St. George. It is the American history tour. The blueprints of Liberty. It is our AJE wall builders in Glenbeck collection. About $75 million of artifacts in 12,000 square feet. You do not want to miss this. You will connect with American history. Unlike anything you've ever seen before, grab your tickets now. UnitedWepledge.org. The Glenbeck program."
