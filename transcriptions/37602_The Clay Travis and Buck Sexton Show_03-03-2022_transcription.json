    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sexton show podcast Welcome in clay Travis bucks sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us this Thursday edition We are down in the great state of Texas This week they are celebrating Texan independence Which I believe is mark I'm an antxians are gonna be angry at me for not knowing this 100% I believe it's March 2nd right buck indeed going back to 1836 which was the year of the alamo We are here at KTR H in Houston. You ever been to the alamo before buck. I have not actually I Was a nerd as a kid's probably not gonna surprise people listening right now And one of the things that I was obsessed with was the alamo So when I was six years old I went to San Antonio, Texas what I wanted to do for my birthday my dad took me to the alamo and And if you haven't ever been before in San Antonio is an incredible town, but if you haven't ever been before The alamo is just right in the middle of San Antonio And you have this idea if you've watched the movies if you've obviously paid attention that there's gonna be some massive Pasture of land all around it because of the way the battle was fought back in the day right smack dab in the center of San Antonio But is a really really cool historical experience if you are like me I try to hit every Civil War battlefield and Obviously if you are interested in American history back in 1836 That was a it was a heck of a time to be studying so clay my life's one of my life's goals Is to fly to the tiny island of Malta in the middle of the Mediterranean. Oh, yeah You see the siege fortifications of the great siege of 1565. So yeah, no, you're good. You're in good company I'm surprised you haven't been to the alamo before I've even been to the Statue of Liberty in a live in New York City Is that true? Yeah, you just weren't willing to get on the boat to go out to see we're gonna take it as a kid And everyone that I know has already been and I don't want to go by myself You know what this is actually amazing at some point this summer I might have my kids up in New York City now that they're getting back to normalcy in New York City And maybe you can join us on the trip to the Statue of Liberty with my kids I will tag along for the great Travis statue of Liberty extravaganza. No question on a beautiful day It's quite nice. I've I've been to Staten Island. I haven't ever been to the the state. Why were you in Staten Island? Why was I instead? Yeah, I got friends is that all right? I'm just wondering. I know peeps. I just wondering just saying um all right so The Ukraine situation continues to evolve we're seeing a lot of different companies take action Against everything having to do with Russia The sanctions are still not having the full impact that they could if we were willing to stop paying for Russian oil I saw Marco Rubio tweet out this morning that we are buying 600,000 barrels of oil from Russia every day Which is madness because we're just putting more money into Russian coffers that Vladimir Putin is then using to fight his war in Ukraine But I had an interesting conversation yesterday my wife is in law school she is finishing her law degree and One of her law professors is at Vanderbilt University Vanderbilt University of Law School, which is also where I went Has done an interesting study. He did a lot of work in international affairs back When he was in the military and he's done a lot of work with war crimes named Michael Newton He's on the faculty at Vanderbilt. She brought me an editorial that he has written arguing that what the United States should do from now is Obviously, we're not going to commit resources in terms of putting actual Soldiers on the ground and it's not smart to get involved I don't believe in this idea of whether or not you're patrolling the skies whether you're going to try to restrict the flow of Russian air Superiority what he says is something where I think the conversation is going to get involved And that is Vladimir Putin is clearly in This expert on international War crimes again Michael Newton and there are many other people making the argument alongside of him That this is clearly war crimes and what the United States should do is Joe Biden should Allow all of the people who are international war crimes experts to officially begin war crime investigations Now I want to play you this audio because I think it's a really interesting argument that the best way that America could put more Pressure on to Vladimir Putin now is by Investigating war crimes because it seems quite clear that those are going on now Joe Biden was actually asked about this Yesterday and I want to play cut to because he won't say right now Putin is committing war crimes Even though it seems quite clear he is listen to this Too early to say that all right well president Zelensky says this is clearly genocide He's on the ground right there in Ukraine play cut three listen to this. This is jinnis genocide and Nazis And I am ashamed that we are in the 20 Century in 9 in 2022 and we are seeing acts Where people are told Forget forget my predictions of the end of the world. This is the end of the world if there are such Actions this world is at an end for people like that The issue is that we are The boards are the fence between them and civilization All right, and then in America there are some politicians who are now picking up this argument including Ukrainian board Congresswoman from Indiana Victoria Spart who says this is genocide This is clearly a war crime listen to what she said this question and how it should be answered About Vladimir Putin and whether he's a war criminal Hopefully, you know, we can have more pressures for things happen because people need to have you know Responsibility for the genocide for killing people for war crimes. It's not a war. It's killing extermination of people All right your thoughts on this argument buck Well, first of all Russia is no longer a signatory to the International Criminal Court They pulled out in 2016 after the annexation of Crimea now does that really matter no because You can still bring charges technically in the International Criminal Court against somebody for war crimes even if they're not a Signatory, but it does complicate matters a little bit. You'd also have to have a state willing to arrest Vladimir Putin and Putin is not leaving Putin is not touching down anywhere anytime soon where you would have anybody willing to recognize that jurisdiction You would have Vladimir Putin also arguing that Coalition US actions. I'm saying what he would argue. I'm not saying it's true But he would argue the coalition US actions in Iraq and Afghanistan in different contexts also would constitute war crimes, right? So there's This is not going to it's not going to stop the conflict now This is more of a when the when the conflict is no longer ongoing Would you have a conversation about this? There's no way you're going to be able to get Vladimir Putin when he still wants to have the Russian war machine Engaged in this invasion of Ukraine No one's taking them down with a legal challenge, right? I think it makes people around him nervous because Putin may feel like I'm protected. I'm above the law I think it's quite clear that Putin himself would say that the argument I think that is interesting is are there people that don't have Putin's protections that are also Closely allied enough with the decisions that are being made in Russia that it might give them pause and or make them nervous and start to Unwind a bit the legitimacy of Putin's reign. Yes, but you also have to remember that even billionaire oligarchs in Putin's orbit Will be fed to the tigers sometimes? I mean he doesn't really care right? So so as if you're not getting at Putin who can you get around him that would actually? Put enough pressure on him to make him change his decision making here and also I think you ask perception of who and to what degree of support Who supports Putin and to what degree inside of Russia? We just don't really we don't really have a good sense of that I mean the intelligence community Journalism people that are looking at this issue. I think are having to engage in a lot of guesswork over Who would actually get this guy to stop what he's doing right now, and I think there's a greater recognition Today certainly as you have the loss of The first city although there's some debate or some conflicting reports But you have kerson on the black sea which has fallen you have mary upple which is on the sea of Azov So these are so at the southern part of Ukraine that is looking like it's about to fall You've got car keev still getting shelled you've got keev the capital on the way to being encircled The Russian war machine is showing no signs of slowing slowing down and just because they didn't get a Blitzkrieg or a lightning fast victory in them getting you know It's if you think about it in chess there are some moves you can make that'll end the chess match I forget there's you know terms for all this but in Less than five or less than ten moves you can actually end a chess match poodin may have tried that But that doesn't mean that he's not going to keep going even if that initial salvo so to speak failed So I think that this is going to get Play this is gonna get a lot worse. I think that we're very far from seeing Russia feel like and poodin feel like there's enough pressure being brought against him that he would change this Once he creates a reality that one of the problems we have here is you can't North Korea eyes Russia. It's never gonna happen right? So you have a lot of people with tremendous influence and assets Globally in Russia talking about the the oligarchs who? When when this is done when the ceasefire happens or whenever this conflict comes to a terminus and hopefully it's you know Days, I think it will be months But whenever this actually happens You you're gonna have to deal with bringing Russia back into the full there there is no future in which and poodin knows that He knows people want the gas to flow. He knows there's a lot of ways to Continue on with this so that then makes everything more challenging all the pressure we bring to bear clay feels I think from the Russian perspective poodin perspective as though it's temporary and is set up that way I Think it's an interesting question. How long are Americans gonna care and that may be the balancing act They've Vladimir Putin in his mind is trying to consider right? It's very easy to be pros Olensky and pro Ukraine When the story is fresh and it's new and we're the first seven days first ten days in but to your point if this drags into Let's say it's June. Let's say it's July is American news still going to be leading with the latest news from Ukraine Because I think that's it's an interesting dynamic because the longer Ukraine holds on the more it challenges Putin but also The more difficult it becomes I think for American interest to remain does that make sense? How long is the lead story in every newscast going to be the minute by minute updates of what's going on in Ukraine? There were over a half a million people and I should see what the most recent estimates are who died in the Syrian Civil War That went on for years. There was no US military engagement on the ground Obviously no nuclear powers involved there. Oh, well, I shouldn't say that Russia became involved But I mean the the warring factions inside of Syria were on a very different scale than the Russian war machine By the way, that was another place where Russia essentially got its way through the application of force You see the last ten years or so in Georgia Russia got what it wanted Crimea and Eastern Ukraine got what it wanted Syria propped up the Assad regime got what it wanted a lot of help from the Iranians too So there hasn't actually been a real A real slapdown if you will of Russia's imperial ambitions if anything it's been really building to this point I think people have been ignoring it. So will Americans continue to care? Yeah, I mean, it's I keep telling everybody this because I just think you need to psychologically be prepared for it clay Everyone needs to be prepared for this to get a whole lot a more horrific and ugly because that's though That's the trajectory of these conflicts when they go on like this the first week is never the worst week and extend for months Potentially in terms of the way that you're balancing out. I think there's this idea Among many people who are following this story that on any given day there may be a resolution to this story And that's unlikely This is much more likely to be a marathon than it is a sprint the way that it's being set out right now There's also a cognitive dissonance. We're talking to Larry before Larry Cutlow about this before and They haven't put on the full scope of sanctions on the energy market because it would be too economically painful So on the one hand you have a lot of people going on TV. You have the analyst class you have You know that the Democrats and a lot of Republicans who are essentially saying we will do anything to stand for democracy in Ukraine Not troops, but also not make energy too expensive You know you can already see there is a price that has already been put on this I agree with the red line about troops and about us fighting the Russians It is interesting though that the people that are the loudest Sort of chess thumpers if you will about how our principles are at risk in Ukraine Unless the oil prices get too high in which case let's not get that's right. That's what's that is reality folks That is going on right now So I think everyone needs to remember that as we continue to follow us We'll have more for you on this too. Obviously a very important complicated topic and and then we've I do want to hear a clays take on Where we're going with the the transgender swimmer issue because this crazy sports media is finally I Was gonna say diving into this and I didn't I didn't that's what happened.

Yes, we want the Ukrainians to defeat the Russians and have control their country for sure But we're also under an administration that says all that and this is what we're not gonna sanction their energy because it's gonna be too pricey And that's exactly right and ultimately this is a political calculation Because right now we've got seven and a half percent interest buck and we know that the price of oil is going to go up Your gallon of gas over five dollars a gallon now I believe in San Francisco area the first community to go over five dollars a gallon if I'm not mistaken And if this battle is going to continue and we're going to stop paying for 600,000 barrels of oil Which is what marco rubio tweeted this morning. We're doing on a day-to-day basis Then there's going to be a cost and that cost is going to be paid at the pump as the price of oil is now over 110 $114 may go to an all-time high which would drive inflation even higher And one of buck you know this one of the number one indicators for how you're going to do in a midterm or in any election price of gas Maybe the most important uh michael indell he's got an awesome Series of products out there.

We got a big event going on tomorrow Uh jesse kelly michael berry and more of the crew that is on this great station ktr h down in houston We appreciate you making uh this show number one in the city of houston we're excited to be here for the next couple of days so buck Uh, this is a crazy story that i think is going to continue to get crazier And it threatens the very foundation of women's athletics and it also Points to the cultural fault line i would say that exist right now Where so many people are afraid to say basic 100 percent certain truths, which are these men compete against men and women compete against women in all athletics The nc double a swimming championships are going to begin in less than two weeks And there is a big sports illustrated exclusive with the transgender swimmer at the university of penceylvania Who is poised? to potentially despite the fact That this swimmer swam with the men for three years before deciding to become a woman Has been setting all sorts of and i'm using quotation marks here women swimming records all over nc double a sports this spring and uh, well i guess this winter And this new swim uh swimming competition Now this uh women swimmer who calls herself lea thomas is going to compete potentially set all time records in at george attack down in the atlanta area for the nc double a women's swimming championships and also is now saying that She he whatever phrase you want to use to describe this swimmer wants to be on the women's swimming team in the olympics in 2024 So if you think it's already a crazy story that a man Can swim for three years as a man in men's swimming and then change teams And become a woman and become the greatest women swimmer potentially in the history of college athletics That now this swimmer wants to become a member of the women's swim team Now, let me just give you this as a let's take it outside of the world of men's and women's athletics Every single boxer out there anyone who's ever been a fan of boxing Knows that there's heavyweight boxers buck big strong dude six, you know, six foot more you weigh over 220 pounds big the biggest guys out there do not fight against the smallest guys Uh, if you look at literally I coach a little league baseball. I coach a little league basketball I don't get to bring in a 17 year old to play in my 11 year old basketball league or my 11 year old baseball league Guy would be a lot better because he's a full grown man This is a direct attack on women's athletics It would in theory create The end of women's athletics because as soon as you allow men who are bigger stronger and faster than women To identify as women and compete against them and beat them It is an absolute destruction and we're not getting and this has got me so fired up buck All these people out there who claim to be big feminist All these people who claim to be care so much about title nine and women's equality They're all silent and they're complicit in this craziness This was all predictable And what was fascinating was as this played out. I'd say over the last 10 years in particular the trans agenda As it comes to as it relates to uh sports issues. We were always told in the early days I'm sure remember this. Oh, that's not going to happen exactly what we were told No one's saying that just be polite just be not this is about being nice About being decent to people use their preferred pronouns Agree with them just do this because you're being a nice person I really hate and this is used often against people on the right in this country because I think that And I know people to argue with this over the uh, they'd say well, Trump might have changed that in some way But I think conservatives have a culture of politeness and consideration I I think that that I just believe that I maybe people could argue with me And this is now about trying to Take what started out as courtesy using someone's preferred pronoun And just deny objective reality. That's that's what has that's the transition if you will That we have been witness to here And there's a lot of the the same way that they were making arguments play about masks Oh, come on. It'll make people feel better You know, it's fine and ignoring the downside Let's just talk about that for a second here because all you ever hear from the media is this is about someone's affirmation And this is about you know who they are as a person all this sort of Which is the way the entire sports illustrated article is written not surprisingly as if this person is a hero what about the Olympic hopeful on the us or any team for that matter who has Lived like a third of her life in a swimming pool to be at the absolute top of that uh of that sport who will possibly now go to the olympics and Lose out on a gold medal lose out on any medal lose out on a spot on the team entirely What about the lack of kindness and courtesy for that person? This is just like we're talking about oh let the transgender Youth, you know in high school use the the girls locker room. It'll make them feel better uh, well, what about the 12-year-old girl that now has to get dressed next to a A biological male also known as a male This is why you know it started out with just use the preferred pronoun just be nice to people and we all look We want to be nice. You want to treat everybody well But at some point you can't live by lies and lea thomas is living by a lie here lea thomas You can change your name. It's fine. You know call call this person lea But even in all the news coverage of it. It's always it's always a situation Where lea thomas is referred to as a she lea thomas is not a she And once you start with the basic I'm gonna I'm gonna make this concession that gender gender cannot be changed. That's not reality It's not scientific reality But but also just on the on the on the on the losses that will occur because of this to people lea thomas not the last person who's gonna do this and think of all the people along the way Who feel like not only are they missing out on metals and spots on teams clay But at some level their sport is being made a mockery of now. This is absurd Women's swimming is being made a mockery of by this by the reality of not actually segregating any more by gender This is absurd. Well, what's also wild about this buck is we talked so much about improper benefits in the world of athletics And so take it outside again of transgenderism and if you are taking steroids for instance Uh, we're living down in houston where roger climmons was right for a large part of his career if i remember correctly If you're able to be bigger stronger and faster through using drugs You aren't allowed to compete they test you for the olympics right to see whether or not you're using prohibited substances How in the world is changing your gender Not considered to be a prohibited substance just follow me on this on this logic If you can get you know berry bonds let's use berry bonds example most people know him Uh great player Decides that he's going to use steroids becomes the home run king of major league baseball gets caught using steroids and Congress investigates What is going on with steroids and baseball? You can argue whether or not congress should get involved But the idea was the inherent fair play Of athletics demanded that congress investigate and also because we didn't want to encourage 15 year olds 16 year olds out there to shoot themselves up with drugs Back in the day that east german women dominated in the olympics because they were using steroids same thing happened with russians Right they were doping they were using all sorts of illegal substances How is that impermissible? But you are going to say a man can decide to turn himself into a woman by using drugs And then that man can dominate women's athletics And that's considered to be okay. And i'll give you an example what you were just hinting at but My guys did a great job and girls covering this at out kick and still are Uh because most people won't touch it in the world of sports One of the girls on the pen swimming team who didn't want her name to be used Said that when she grows up and gets married and has her own kids She hopes that she has boys Because if she has girls her fear is Transgender men who have decided to become women are going to end women's athletics She said what you pointed out right now. It's one person who is dominating in women's sports But what happens when there's 15 people dominating women's sports what happens when the sprinting Uh at the olympics is all Dude who have decided to be girls and who thinks who thinks that there's not going to be in Increase in this once you we're talking about the olympics You you me college swimmer Obviously you don't make a dime and and swimming is not In general a big a big money draw for anybody until you're talking about being a gold medalist Yes, medalist is they've done analysis to show it's worth seven figures Right? It's worth a few million dollars especially in a sport like swimming where people pay attention at the olympics There's there's actual endorsement value to that Well now now you get to be a hero To those who are on the ideological left for doing this because they remember they don't they don't think this is bad The true hardcore left in this country Thinks that this is to be celebrated and if you don't celebrate it you're a bigot That is the official party line ask a oc Ask anybody who's a democrat on the left who is prominent in the movement and they'll say this is great I celebrate this lea thomas is a hero a civil rights hero They're completely insane but put that aside She called herself reportedly the jackie robinson of women swimming I mean that is so offensive on that Crazy right now that she there's been a dispute about whether that quote was out there But that report has been out there that one of her teammates said that she is referring to herself as the jackie ronson of women's Unbelievable and and yet here we are. This is once you have people that are going to become millionaires Now your choice is become transgender be a multi millionaire and a hero to the left and or be an obscure You know just an okay male swimmer an okay male swimmer. What what's what's the choice going to be for a lot of people I think we all we all recognize by this is going to be increasingly normalized too That's the whole point So this won't even be a thing that gets a lot of attention That is the true goal of the movement here is essentially you can't make any gender Gender distinction when it comes to sports competition, which can we all just remind ourselves? We all know this is crazy right everyone listening to this knows it's crazy democrat party nancy Pelosi will not denounce it joe biden will not denounce it top to bottom they'll go along with it No woman Buck would ever win an olympic medal again if we only had a unisex sport Right if if you ever sprint or here's a great example. We're down in texas right now Every single high school boy who said a texas state sprinting championship record Was faster than the fastest woman who's ever existed in the most recent Uh most recent state competition It's a big difference women would never win.

They'll have our houston listeners. Thank you so much for making us number one in our time slot in this Market the fourth largest city in america. Interesting clay. I was checking this out because I want to make sure houston is number four in terms of population Then you get into some you know san antonio is now listed as being bigger than dallas which i found i feel is that even possible There are so many lies out there. So the way they do that is And I think we're on I know we're on in jacksonville Jacksonville if you have you've been to jackson will forward it. No. Okay. So if anybody who's in jacksonville right now knows what i'm talking about You can drive in the city of jacksonville and city is in quotation marks here kind of defined like woman Uh in quotation marks. You can drive in jacksonville for like three hours and still be in jacksonville So the definition of what the market is is so expansive Uh, but the four biggest cities no matter how you define it new york l a chicago and houston And uh, it's awesome to be number one in this market phoenix gotten really big too population phoenix is right up there san antonio Dallas these are some of the places, you know dc is Only 600 000 for the the washington dc, but when you add It's really the city extends way beyond what is technically dc that would also be a bigger place But anyway mike in wisconsin. He's with us now. I wanted to get some of the lines here. What's up mike How you doing? Excellent My question is if lea thomas is competing basically as a different person can he petition the nca a for three more years of eligibility It's it's kill us absurd question the answer is no Uh because no matter you only get basically now covet is kind of mix this thing up But you get essentially most of years Five years to play four right so if you're a college athlete once you start your ticking clock You can't you get five years. So He or she only has five years to play it sounds like a ridiculous question But it is an intriguing one if you're totally changing your gender do you get more years? You can't be Uh, you know a 30-year-old freshman who's in their ninth year of uh of swimming All right next up we have A sherin and here in houston texas. We got a houston caller. What's up sherin you coming to the party tomorrow night? Howdy welcome to houston no, I will not be at the party I'm sorry, but I do listen to michael berry show and I listened to eib network. I've been listening since 2012 With the in ben gazi was bombed and I needed to find real news and thought i switched over to eib network So anyway, I wanted to say today sindhala in texas that I want to Reiterate what our senator from texas has said ceneter tag cruz He said about ukraine He said that poutin is wanting to gain control of the energy in the world And that's why he's making this move into the new uh ukraine and he said under the uh vidapest memorandum of 94 We have a um moral obligation in Commitment to help defend ukraine and he said to do that. We we need to give them arms To defend themselves and cut off the north stream Pipeline to russia and and of course we all know That it would like um Larry cuddler said earlier right here on your show drill drill drill right here in texas in all over our united amen Amen your 100 right thank you, sherry. Yeah, look I would say this We are giving them and have been giving them uh ukranians arms along with other countries I mean when you know you've upset the international community when the Swedes are sending your enemies Missiles and when the swiss are willing to freeze bank accounts So there there has been a lot of movement from not just the u.s from other countries too But if we're gonna talk about ukraine we also have to be very Realistic and arms alone of the kind that we can send are unlikely to be unlikely I hope that this assessment is wrong unlike to be enough to stop the russian military juggernaut from what it is doing Right now. We'll come back into some of that because gen saki play was just asked about it Um, so we've got that cover the next hour. What are you? What are the top? We got zuby coming up with this in the next second Right zuby fantastic. He's been a great voice on covid on freedom in the era of covid and how we get out of this madness Uh looking forward to talking to zuby a man only needs one name zuby. We'll be with it shortly Clay Travis and bucks exon on the front lines of truth"
