    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, but strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? I'm Ryan Micler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast, The Order of Man. I want to welcome you to what I would consider the best podcast out there available for men. Of course, I've got a little bit of a biased opinion, but the show is growing each and every week. In fact, just this last month, we had our highest downloaded month to date. That's in over three years. So the message that we're sharing is growing. It's reaching more men, and of course, I'm glad that you're here with us today. This has been an exciting week for Order of Man just two or three days ago. It was on the 30th, so that was Tuesday. We released our book, Sovereignty, the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of Men. Guys, it has just blown up since we've reached multiple number one categories in a very short period of time, and we actually reached as high as number 35. Some were right in there in all of self-help. So that's out of tens of thousands of books. So first and foremost, I want to say thank you. If you've bought the book, Sovereignty, the Battle for the Hearts and Minds of Men, I do appreciate that. If you've not done that yet, go ahead and get that taken care of. You can go to orderofman.com slash Sovereignty, and that'll take you right to the Amazon page where you can pick it up there. We've been getting a lot of great feedback on the book, and then of course, if you would also leave a review on Amazon that goes such a long way in gaining visibility and getting the book out to the masses. So I appreciate any and all help that you guys have given there. With that said, guys, I don't have a whole lot of announcements for you today. I do want to just get right into this show, and what I thought I would do is actually read you an excerpt from the book, Sovereignty, the Battle for the Hearts and Minds. That way, if I haven't convinced you just yet that you should go out and pick up a copy, hopefully you'll listen to what I have to say and think, that actually sounds pretty good, and it will convince you to go out and pick up a copy of the book. Let me just warm things up here for a second before I get into the chapter that I'm going to talk about, which is that of providing. Guys, it is our responsibility as men to be providers. Now, a lot of times when I say that, people will think financial provision, and of course, that has something to do with it, but it's not everything. And at the end of the day, there's so many different ways that we as men will be required and obligated, I believe, to provide for our families, our businesses, our colleagues, our coworkers, our neighbors, our community in general. So again, today, I'm going to read an excerpt from the book on being a provider. I hope you enjoy. Chapter 5, Provide. A man who becomes conscious of the responsibility he bears towards a human being who affectionately waits for him, or to an unfinished work, will never be able to throw away his life. He knows the why for his existence, and will be able to bear almost any how, Victor Frankl. As long as we've been on this planet, it's been up to men to provide for their families and communities. Traditionally, this has been the way of physical provision, whether that means hunting for food, provide life-giving sustenance, or financially, to pay for the roof over our heads, the clothes on our back, and the food in our bellies. Modern times have challenged the status quo as more and more women enter the workforce and more and more men choose to stay at home in what was traditionally the women's role in the family and society. Let me be clear, because there seems to be some misunderstanding when I bring up the word provide. Does a man have a responsibility to provide for his family financially? At the end of the day, I believe that is his responsibility. But I also realize the dynamics of who brings home the bacon and who tends the house and children can vary from family to family. If something other than the traditional roles men and women play works for you and your household, more power to you. That said, there is more than one way to provide, which I'll discuss in the following sections. Financial, mental, emotional, and spiritual. A man's ability and capacity to master each of these areas represents the second point of his mission, provide. Financial. Let's cover the financial topic because, as it stands today, the overwhelming majority of men still provide the financial support to the family. If this does not apply to your situation, I would still encourage you to read this section as it may become your responsibility in the future for any number of reasons, death, disability, layoff, and or divorce. There is a growing and disturbing trend that the number of welfare recipients is increasing and the number of programs available is expanding. More on this in chapter 8. Let me be the first to say that I recognize there is a time and a place for these programs, but I also recognize the fraud and blatant scandal that has ripped through these social welfare programs. One of my stepfathers is a private investigator. He was hired by large corporations to investigate workers' compensation fraud. He would routinely come home and show me surveillance videos of quote unquote injured men fraudulently collecting workers' compensation. These were men who had, for example, broken their backs, yet found the time, energy, and physical strength to mow the lawn, do some chores around the house, go on shopping sprees to the mall, and many other activities. Now, I realize this one particular example may not be a social welfare issue, rather an insurance issue, but it illustrates the way one man can take advantage of the system in order to live inconsistently with the way in which he was meant to live. Although I do not agree with any man who fraudulently mouches off of any other working man, I can certainly see the appeal. After all, what sounds better than collecting a paycheck while sitting in your basement playing video games and watching all my children in commercials and the price is right, or whatever shows air during the day. But as nice as that may sound, the reality is that a man's desire to get something for nothing is at direct odds with his sovereignty. Programs change or go away altogether. The money runs out, and or you get caught. A man must resist the urge to get something for nothing. There is nothing more damaging to the heart and mind of a man than knowing he is not providing for himself and those who rely on him. I remember times in my life where my wife and I were living on credit to make ends meet. We were robbing Peter to pay Paul. Those were some of the most stressful times in my life and times I wished never to experience again. On the other side, we've experienced times of extreme financial abundance in our family. There is nothing so satisfying as coming home from a long week of work knowing that although you're tired, your family and loved ones are benefiting from the result of your labors. To provide financially is the work of men. Unfortunately, there seems to be some confusion about our relationship with money. Money is simply a metric of perceived value. It's not the only metric, but it's A metric. When a man goes to work, his employer pays him based on the value he will provide to the company. When a client hires an advisor, that client is paying based on the perceived value he will receive. This is why it feels so good to make money. It's not necessarily the money itself. It's the value a man brings to the marketplace. If there's one thing we want in this life, it's to be valued. Mental. Outside of the financial provision, a man must also learn to provide mentally for himself and his family. A man's ability to develop the mental fortitude and resilience to lead in times of feast and famine is of the utmost importance. Let's face it, life is tough. Life can be a challenge. You and your family are likely to run into any number of problems that could derail the plans you have set for yourself. Disability, injury, lawsuit, death, divorce, bankruptcy. Without the mental fortitude to plan for and overcome the events you are likely to experience in your lifetime, you and your family could find yourself in ruin. There have been many times in my marriage when all seem lost. Mortgage payments went unpaid, tempers flared, anger and resentment welled up. It's times like these that people will turn to the man for mental guidance and support. Will you break down when all seems lost, or will you step up to the challenge? One will never truly know until that day comes. But if you do have a desire to lead your family effectively, mental provision, fortitude and resilience are musts. What knowledge have you required? What experiences can you draw upon? What is your ability to effectively articulate the vision you wish to cast? These are all ways in which a man provides mental clarity and strength as the head of his house, his business and his community. Emotional. When I talk about masculinity, the last thing most men would think about is emotion. The lie we've been fed that men are not emotional just isn't reality. Think about the last time you felt something. Pride in your son for scoring the game-winning touchdown. Fear that you weren't going to be able to make a payment on time. Sorrow as you thought about the fight you and your wife got into last night. Emotions are something we all experience. Rather than run from those emotions, a man should strive to understand and regulate them. Unfortunately, most men operate at the mercy of their emotions. As a coach to my children's sport teams for the last four years, I can tell you that I've seen some horrendous behavior on the field by men whom I would otherwise completely respect. I've been guilty of those emotional outbursts as well. But tell me, how does suppressing your emotions at the risk of blowing up at some unknowable future date add to your ability to live in sovereignty? What if instead you chose not to suppress your emotions, but rather to understand them? And just as valuable, understand the emotions of those closest to you. Emotional intelligence is a cornerstone of masculinity. If a man can understand why he feels the way he does, does that not arm him with the ability to do something about it? After all, if sovereignty is the objective, any tool that allows us to achieve more of it is of the utmost importance. People are going to be sad. People are going to get mad. People are going to feel offended and hurt. You will experience these emotions as well. It's okay. It's part of being human. The more you can understand the emotions in yourself and the emotions in others, the better you are able to adjust the way in which you approach any number of challenging scenarios. You are a rock. The rock that many will look to in times of struggle, fear, and sorrow. That does not mean you aren't allowed to display emotions. It means you need to use those emotions as a display of love, guidance, and direction to those who look to you. The less we try to eliminate our emotions and the more we start to decipher and decode what it is they're trying to tell us, the more likely we are to be driven towards action that serves us and others. Spiritual. Whether you're Christian, Catholic, Muslim, Hindu, or Buddhist, I think we can all agree that there is some unknown, unseen force that is greater than the dimension in which we live. It is my belief that unless we learn to tap into this higher power, we severely limit ourselves on the inputs available to live life as a sovereign man. Call it your conscience, your intuition, your gut, Jiminy Cricket, the universe, God, the Holy Ghost, the Holy Spirit, or a combination of them all. This extra sense has the ability to warn you of impeding danger and illuminate a successful path. Most of us, however, live life too full to recognize this power. Think about it. When was the last time you took a break? When did you last have time for any level of reflection in your day-to-day activities? When's the last time you really thought about how your time is meant to be spent? Tell me, where in your day do you have the time and margin to tap into this higher power that will allow you to escape the rat race you so desperately want to escape? More than likely, the answer is that there is no time for that. You're always in go mode, so you continue to live life the same way, day in and day out for the rest of your life. If we have any hope of tapping into this higher power, regardless of what you choose to call it, we must create space for ourselves to listen, to feel, to hear, and to see. In 2005, I found myself walking into the dusty building in the middle of a compound that was once an Iraqi detention facility. It was my first day on the job, and to say most of what ensued in the following months is all a bit of a haze would be a massive understatement. I already mentioned the 14 soldiers who lost their lives who were represented on the entry wall of that building, but what I did not mention was that when we returned from our tour, we learned that the unit replacing us had lost 10 soldiers in the first week they were there. A suicide bomber drove a truck to the front gate, maneuvered through the barriers, and detonated his explosive vehicle, killing 10 soldiers guarding the gate to the base. With the loss of life from the unit before us and the unit that replaced us, how was it possible that our unit did not suffer a single loss? What was the difference? What separated us from the unit before and after? We prayed as a unit morning, noon, and night, our families prayed for us back home. We read scriptures together, and we lived our lives and carried out our duties in accordance with the guidance we received from that higher power. The fact that I can't clearly articulate the difference or prove beyond a shadow of a doubt the existence of such a power seems to be a problem for many men. We tend to believe that if we can't physically feel it or see it, it must not exist. Instead, we choose to lean only on what we can prove. In addition to that, many men feel like tapping into a higher power makes them subservient to that power. Prayer, meditation, divine guidance, and scripture study, however, do not make you subservient to those things, but rather give you the ability to tap into a power far greater and more powerful than we can understand. That does not weaken your independence. It only strengthens it. The mindset, I am a source of creation, resources, and provision. Men provide, period. We are useful. We bring ideas, thoughts, inspiration, and knowledge to the table. If we aren't willing or capable of doing so, what good is it having us around? Now, some people will hear that and think it's too harsh or doesn't accurately reflect our value in this world. Wrong. Our value in this world is in direct proportion to the value we provide and create. It's what we do. Think about your tendency to offer solutions and solve problems, even when unsolicited. If that doesn't highlight our natural desire to improve our station and the station of those we care about, I don't know what does. Sovereign men don't mind that others rely on us per provision either. Some may think that if the man is the sole or weighted provider of all that is required to sustain a family, business, or a community's way of life, it's somehow unfair. But it's not unfair at all. It's not unfair because we too gain from this arrangement. We gain this sense of pride, satisfaction, and fulfillment that comes from looking at our tribes and knowing they're thriving in large part due to us. I've known men who have been laid off for any number of reasons. It's damaging to a man's psyche. I can see it in his eyes. It's written on his face. I can sense it in his demeanor. When a man is incapable of providing all that's necessary to lead, he loses his sense of purpose and direction, and as a result, the battle for his heart and mind. I've been there. I've been in situations in my life where I knew I was doing and providing less than I was capable of. It's the most demoralizing experience in the world. Being fully capable of providing and producing results in my life, on the other hand, is the most rewarding feeling a man can experience. There's nothing more liberating to the heart and mind of a man than knowing he is enough as evidence of what he alone has created.
