    "text": " Well, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls, you know that something is a little off when I'm starting this ordinary podcast for all of you on the free feed. But I'll take the opportunity, first of all, to say you have to subscribe. It's getting ridiculous. You got to just pony up and subscribe. It makes our life a lot easier and you get extra podcasts and you get all sorts of other goodies that you'll find out about. If you go to wita5.substack.com, but the reason I am joining you before Camille Yell's greetings is I come to you as the rosemary woods of this particular episode, because there's a 20 odd minute gap that, you know, we, you know, we take the gap out, but in the middle of just a rollicking conversation, which starts off very grim. I'm sorry. Things happened in Texas, a terrible, brutal, gruesome massacre. We talk about that and, but when we shift gears and the podcast gets a little less depressing, our equipment. And if you're a podcaster, by the way, the roadcaster is your enemy, because it ate up about 25 minutes of our recording, which, you know, kind of, you can kind of hear it, but it's all snowy and awful. So we cut that bit out. There's some really great stuff in there about, you know, Aquaman and, and Amber heard's a new character that we created for her. You get a bit of that. But just to tell you why, in the middle of it, you'll hear that transition music and all of a sudden, Matt's halfway through a conversation about what happened in Georgia. But I assure you what happened before that in the conversation was amazing, but it's actually, we did agreed it was the best part of the podcast, but a technology company called Roadcaster decided to stab us in the back and take 25, 20, 25 minutes away from you and away from us. So without further ado, let's just get to the podcast. Sorry. We know of new methods of attack. The Greetings and welcome back to another exciting installment of the fifth column podcast. This is your weekly rhetorical assault on the news cycle, the people that make it, and occasionally ourselves. I am Camille Foster. I do various things at a place called Freethink and oftentimes it takes me from one place to another unexpectedly and I just roll with the punches. I'm a man who is in demand and who's needed in many places. I have various talents and skills and ability and they're really unparalleled in many respects. In certain ways, I'm kind of like, no, I think I think they're a parallel, the Mike Tyson of podcasting. And I mean before like the incarceration when he was just knocking people and find out. I'm the guy knocking out Mitch Green in the street and runs from the Dastard Douglas. The buster Douglas of this podcast, Matt Welch, at her at a large recent magazine. And the Joe Frazier of this podcast. Yeah. I think that's it. He sings as good as Joe. Like a Moynihan advice news. Gentlemen, they would just have him sing in the national anthem. Yeah, he couldn't sing. He couldn't sing at all. They're like, oh, let's go get the guy with brain damage to a single national anthem. I think I'm more like the Joe Lewis. I prefer to be Joe Lewis. I do have a manual Joe Frazier glove at my mother in the house. I met Joe Frazier at yeah, I met him at a conference many, many, many, many years ago. You love conferences? I mean, this was this was a telecommunications conference where you get about 40% of your meals. You eat mostly at conferences. I don't go to quite so many conferences these days. You're going to a conference today calendar year. Yeah. That's what you're saying today. It's called a summit. So I can't tell anybody any details about that. Well, this is the thing. And then I go to the conference and then I find out, Oh, wait, this thing I'm doing. This is not a secret meeting. This is on C span. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I'm telling you is asking questions about the shit that I just said. So you were hanging out with Clarence Thomas. I was like, you're hanging out with Clarence Thomas. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, you know, I mean, you know, it was a shot with David Suter. What do you expect? But you guys were hanging out recently. You went to a baseball game. Yeah. I'm doing everything I can to keep from talking about the school. So Christ, dude. So that just wanted. Yeah. Can I make a pitch for why actually I said we should talk about this? And can I make a pitch for why we shouldn't in a way? Okay. Is that this horrible, horrible tragedy, I mean, like unimaginable, particularly when for some reason, it's not for some reason, it's you kind of know that when you see the reporting that everyone died in the same room is somehow so brutal and gruesome. I mean, even, I mean, it always is, but even more so in that with that context. You know, I think that one of the things about it is that watching everybody on Twitter do the instant recriminations and trying to find a political angle and like it doesn't, you know, listening to some blue check, it doesn't solve anything. It doesn't move the ball. It doesn't prevent this from happening in the future. It doesn't, you know, assuage the horrible feelings of the people affected by this. I just think, you know, I know everyone says almost a cliche at this point, but just back off for a little bit. Is that okay? And, you know, particularly when I say, well, no, I mean, if you if we actually have this conversation, by the we've been having this conversation very long, we always do it right after. We always do it from Columbine, even before Columbine, but there are, you know, 350 odd, 60 odd million guns in this country. Well, that might be there not going away. That might be an avenue to talk about, I think the person or the report that I've seen, the writing that I've seen that's been most useful was David French over at the dispatch on surprise. Often valuable. Very, and it doesn't matter if you agree with him or not. He's a big, you know, he's a conservative constitutionalist. And so a strong supporter of the Second Amendment and his reaction was first of, you know, the same, although very kind of a literary almost expression of outrage, which I think is absolutely proper. But then also it was like, hey, there is a thing that we can do. And his argument is that we can do red flag laws. And he goes in and before he gets to that argument, again, it's not important if you agree to murder not on that. Yeah, I'm saying that this is this is a useful piece, even regardless of what your position is, because he goes down through a thing and points out, which is something that reason always points out in these cases, that a lot of the, you know, the bills, the background checks, or whatever the things that people call for in these moments, as applied, probably wouldn't have done a damn thing to this or many other similar things. I mean, New York has red flag laws, and we had Buffalo shooting. Right. And last week, but I was, I find myself a little bit somehow different. Maybe it's the kids in all in one room. And, you know, people are putting them up on Twitter, their pictures and their, you know, their cocos age. It's so it's, it's, it's, it's impossible to deal with. And I find myself less satisfied than usual with the, with the, with the, with the usual and correct retorts of just saying that like, Hey, look, there's 350 million guns, we can't seize them all. So come on. Hey, look, there's this, Hey, look, there's that. There's always sort of a nitpicky argument. I think it's okay to have, I don't think it's difficult. I think it's a good starting point. Right. And that's what he does. That's what he does. That's what I'm saying, is that he goes through and says, right, this is, I'm not saying throw up your hands because there's this many guns in the country. Right. You know, no, I want, I just flagging that for later because I think that's kind of an interesting point to, to get to. But he walks through the various things, including linking to a piece that Glenn Kessler, the fact checker for The Washington Post, who's pretty good. It's like probably best in that class of a, of a questionable use of a journalistic power. He went three or four years ago, forget when, and just in a fact, checky way, looked at common, you know, bills or proposed solutions to, to massacres like this, and tested them out per massacre. And he's like, wow, I came into this as a strong, grunt control proponent. I come out of it having to look at facts, which says that most of these things don't work. So this is the, the march that David French walks us through. And then he gets and he explains his red flag laws, why he thinks that this is different and that, you know, this, they would have applied in this case. It's worthwhile if you're interested in having, you know, changes in the law based on this moment, this feeling of outrage and helplessness that you have to set yourself through that instead of just, you know, Steve Kerr banging the table, like, do something, there's 50 senators, like, that something doesn't matter. There's a lot of do something. The something does matter. And if you're serious about it, find the people who are also serious about it. Those things, those expressions are helpful more than, as I've seen in places, like praying for conservatives to die because they have blood on their hands or that usual reaction when people say I'm praying for this and they're, you know, right wingers who love the Second Amendment and the, it's just so boring. It's the same response. It's like, we don't need your prayers. We need this. And it's like, nobody has a response to thoughts and prayers is like, so is so maddening. We just once clever one time. We literally just have this podcast in some respects because we just talked about the, the, and also a normal boy. And I'll say again, like the thing that I always find most distressing is just the abuse that we heap on one another after these things happen. Like it, the carnage, the human loss, like the families that are suffering, like that's brutal. And that's part of it. In terms of our response, like the most awful thing is just the way that we just, we just tear each other down in the most ridiculous ways. Like I don't think you can actually believe that there are any conservatives who are thinking themselves. Yeah, you know what, you're a couple of kids, but I just love my guns and just the price of doing business. Or as someone I saw tweet out earlier, you know, there's some conservatives who are perfectly fine with a little bit of bloodshed in these schools because it helps to bring about the end of like public schools. And it's just maybe there's an asshole like that that that exists. I just don't, I can't say I've ever met him. I don't know who that monster is. There's some there's some not recording as a result of this stuff. But I see like, they're not all Paul Gossar, who is a real piece of garbage. But I saw like Matt Iglesias tweet something. And I was inclined to like like it straight away where he said, you know, for all America's problems, like this is still a place where people want to come where they want to be. They want to live here because it's a it's an amazing country. And people were going after him for expressing that sentiment after the shooting happens as if he's trying to dismiss the horribleness of the shooting itself. I think it's also that they're trying to I here's wise because they can see the machinery going on or they think that they see machinery going on his head, which is that big tragedy happened. Everyone's freaking out. They're going on Twitter. What can I do right now to inject myself into the conversation? I think that's what people feel like he did in that moment. I think that a lot of people are doing that in that moment. And I can't stress this enough for those of you who are still stupid enough to look at Twitter like me. The first thing you do, make sure that you're not seeing top tweets, make sure that you're seeing it in chronological order so that you don't have the algorithm feeding the average into your into your face. But also I don't it makes it makes one focus too much on that stuff. But also recognize when people are when you could see the the opportunism, the the meme lords like saying, this is a moment I can make an outrageous point and and try to attract attention to myself from my cause. That is such disreputable behavior into your point, which is the point. It is designed to make us feast off each other. That's I just find that to be such an inhuman response to a thing. The thing is difficult to respond to, especially in terms of policy and a bunch of other stuff, and then just the emotion of dealing with it. But those people who are who are leaning into that sense of performance, and including outrage at people who are doing that, just it's okay to step away. It's okay. I mean, it was a weird tweet for sure. Timing was I was I was I mean, but I always think his tweets are weird. It's a lot of weird. I'm like, how about it? Go on. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, I mean, right as the right message for that moment. I suppose at a moment like that, I am like looking for silver linings and I am looking for something to make me feel better. Like, honestly, like, I watched the basketball game yesterday, like before Steve, there's basketball game where Steve Kerr gives this speech and he talks about how he doesn't want to play basketball tonight. He just he just doesn't feel like it. And he's not there. And you know what? I get that response. I also get the response of, you know what, play ball, like, play ball, like, let's get lost in this for a moment. Like the tragedy happened and it doesn't mean that I don't take it seriously. And I'm not interested in doing something about it. But I also happen to know that the kind of grieving, the sackcloth and ashes routine that's playing out on Twitter and the like Lynch mataglacius. And I know I like to use that word because I know that it's loaded, but it's appropriate. Well, e-glacius. Like, exactly. That word is that word of glacius. I know that that isn't going to produce any meaningful results and will save no lives. And I'm I keep I have a very strong inclination to share stuff about this experience that I had recently that you guys know about that is very much adjacent to these like mass shootings. Oh, yeah. Yeah. In the sense that I have someone in my family who was quite close to me, who very nearly became one of these people. And and you were personally the red flag law. You you I yeah, you raised the red flag never talked about it publicly. But yeah, yeah, yeah, people can't and people who have never been through it cannot imagine like what is required. Yeah, like what it what it demands of you personally to get involved in the situation like that, to get law enforcement involved to the extent that's necessary. Oftentimes to run a foul of the sentiments of your many family members, not merely the person who's directly involved, the actual jeopardy that it could potentially put you in because there is a dangerous person who in that particular case, actually already perpetrated acts of violence was just unknown to most people that this was the person who was responsible. And many respects even talking about it now, it's not completely resolved. Like there is some peril that is still remaining. And this been it's been four years, actually more than four years. So if we were having sophisticated conversations about the things that actually contribute to mass shootings, the the actual, like the the mental health crisis in this country, I think that's a legitimate word to use in that particular context, the the difficulty of actually getting help to people who need it, of assessing whether or not someone is genuinely a danger to themselves or others. And the actual just especially for young people and young men in particular, perhaps, the difficult, like angst of just growing up in the kind of society that we live in today, of feeling isolated, not having someone you can turn to. In a very isolating moment, too. Absolutely. So much more isolated. Absolutely. It only makes sense that we're seeing these things be super challenging. Yeah, I wonder if that is if there is a, you know, correlation, this is not causation. But you know, I think that if people ask more questions rather than being on Twitter and making these very certain pronouncements about what would have prevented something, I think it's very valuable for people to say, preface everything saying, I don't know the answer to this because if anyone did this stuff wouldn't happen, nobody wants this to happen. I would hope that nobody wants this to happen. But you know, looking at it and you're saying, God, again, this is happening, you know, and there is something going on here that if let's pretend that we say that this is not a practical thing. This is why it's so performative. And you say we need to get rid of these assault weapons, because you know, you can get these are not guns that are terribly different than any other semi automatic gun. They just look different for the most part. So if we say that let's we want to get rid of those, let's pretend that we want that we can actually do something about this. And these are a class separate. And there's just a thought experiment and we could get rid of them. We still have the issue of people wanting to do this sort of thing. Right. And you know, we do have a societal problem still if people want to do these things, and they don't have access to the tools, that would be great if they didn't. I mean, I would pray that that would be, I'm not allowed to do that. And I'm also somebody who's religious. So I don't play. But you know, yeah, I mean, that kind of thing like, if we could get them out of hands of people like that, we still have to then, you know, that's why when you say I'm forgotten control, I'm against control. Second amendment, fuck the second amendment, repeal the second amendment, and saying, well, it's just mental health is not mental health, it's access to the gun. It's like, you know, it's a lot of things. And then when you take that gun away from somebody, you still have a kind of moral poverty that has overwhelmed a number of young people, and they seem to be 18 years old, and the kind of disaffected child of the 1950s strikes me as very different as the disaffected child of 2022. And if you look back, if you look at something like, you know, there are gun laws and gun things and blah, blah, blah. And I leave that to people who actually know about that stuff. That's one thing I, you know, try to maybe, you know, be speak about things I know about a little bit of those. It's never been an issue of mine that I've been really interested in actually was once assigned a book by a newspaper. And I've talked about the book Living with Guns by a liberal journalist who said, okay, they're here, what do we do to them? And I said, no, actually, I don't think that I'm the right person to review this. I don't have this kind of background, despite the fact that I think the book is interesting. But you know, when you also have to look at, you know, Christ Church, New Zealand is not a place full of, I mean, Andrew's Breivik in Norway, you know, I mean, there's, I still am interested in the people to go and mass stabbing attacks because great, they don't have access to the guns. Don't they call it Friday night in Scotland? Yeah, just call it Scotland period. In other places, it's Christmas, but London. But you know, I mean, if you have these things, I mean, why is this happening is not an answer that you can offer an opinion on Twitter? You have to do that in a very long, like piece of like excavation of data and of all sorts of studies and you know, the changes and what has happened between sort of 1960, 50, 70, and now, and people always get angry too, when you bring up Chicago in places where there's mass killings every weekend. I think there was 50 just slightly lower than 50 shootings this weekend or 55. I find it so odd that people get like, get mad when you bring it up. Yeah, and it's not about it's like, is it what is, you know, is it better in a sense when the shootings are, you know, older people, not in schools? I think yeah, in a way, it is different. It's materially different and I react differently. And I think there's a reason for that. And it's, and it's people react differently. And this is a horrible truth that spent decades kind of railing against in the journalistic realm. But they, it happens to a neighborhood, you don't have any relationship with true. Yeah, then it's fine. I mean, I, we used to read the murder round up on page B three or B five of the LA Times growing up and it was like, okay, let's let's see how many paragraphs they give to Compton this time. This is back when Compton was scary. It's less so now. They specifically made movies about it. And it'd be like, it was the murder paragraph. They're like, Oh, yeah, over the weekend, there was like 17 murders in South Central LA. But if there was one, you know, sweet looking Asian American student caught in a drive by it in Westwood and UCLA back when that was a nicer place, then that's front page news for months. And that was always the case. And it drives me nuts. But that I think that totally informs the Chicago conversation in some way. And again, this is you always have to preface it that you're kind of spitballing and haven't given a ton of thought to the stuff you're thinking on your feet. But that's what the podcast all about. In some ways, it's even more worrying when you see, you know, hundreds of hundreds of shootings a year in a place like Chicago, by people who do not have traditional mental health issues. Right. I mean, this kid, you know, who killed these people in Texas, one of his friends, when there's very few friends said he showed up one day with cuts all over his face. And so this cat scratched me. And then he admitted that he was cutting himself with a knife on his face, self mutilations, but it's putting your own face. It's typically on your arms. That's very common on arms. I mean, I've seen a lot of people legs. And on the face is like, that's, you know, you're gonna end up looking like seal. I mean, what is this like, on scars in your face? I mean, even even as you talk about it, like I get, I get goosebumps. I just, and we texted about this earlier, and I just have such a hard time. I have hard time putting myself in the shoes of someone who reads a story that includes details like that. Yeah, about a kid that is going through like that sort of severe, like mental health crisis, and thinking, God, if only we could like just, you know, ban all get rid of all the guns. Like, are you kidding? Like, that's, that's it? That's that can't possibly be the only answer. Or the bullying too, because that's in every story is that he was pretty brutally bullying the issues with the whole world that was being projected towards him. We were on Megan Kelly's program yesterday. We're recording this on Wednesday. We did it on Tuesday. And she brought up a point to the, which was news to me, you guys know, because you read closer, but that the buffalo shooter decapitated a cat. Yeah. I think his mother helped him bury it or something. Yes. And like, which you get, these, those are both important. And actually important. It's a boy in a mental health crisis, whose parents, rather than getting professionals involved, are helping to obscure this and hide this. And who pays the consequences for that? And also parents of mentally messed up teenagers. I've heard. It's hard. It's hard to feel like you lose perspective of where things are. Stuff is happening so weird, so often that hopefully you're not burying the headless cat in the backyard and covering it up. But like you're, you know, it's difficult to, I mean, to your personal case too, like it's unimaginably difficult. And I'm sure for you, it's, it's all the more like infuriating because you're trying to protect people who like might resent your intervention in the case. Without a doubt. And, and, but there's another constitutional question here too, because it's not just the one of the Second Amendment. It's, you know, on red flag laws, and who is the person that is allowed to determine that you should be committed, right? I did a story in Washington, Washington state when they were, they had one of these red flag laws. And it was opposed to the time by the way, by the ACLU, the NRA and the ACLU, because it basically gave, I think, a judge, you know, they were saying, I think I'm trying to remember this was many years ago, the judge had the power then to take away a constitutional right when you'd committed no crime. Right. And that was the, that was the beef. And people think like, well, you know, I mean, you're saving potentially save lives and everything. Well, it's a little more complicated than that. And you do have to, you know, look at the kind of slippery slope or the judge. If you don't like that constitutional right. So that doesn't make a difference, right? You do not want judges in this position where they say, well, you that you can't have that constitutional right. Because I said so, and there was, I think there was no medical. It wasn't, I think it was something, and again, I'm just trying to remember this, that there was, you didn't have to have a medical doctor's assessment. And there was a fear that could be weaponized by like, expouses, family, like saying like, Oh, without a doubt. Yeah, he's terrible. They're straining orders. Yeah, yeah. Of course. They're all but the thing about it is like, this is the painful thing of going through Twitter and seeing the stuff is that, you know, there are all sorts of like complications in this stuff, particularly when it comes to like, you know, my husband is, I think he's violent. He has a gun and he's gone. And then, you know, the judge, you should take away this right. Like, even if you don't think there should be a constitutional right, it is at the moment. And I suspect it will remain. And so you have to deal with these things in a way that confines to laws. And that is something very different than saying within the Second Amendment, what should be allowed, right? I mean, what, what does this actually mean? Can you have the bazooka, that old, that old, right? This is like, yeah, you just, you can't just say, you don't have that right based on the assessment of a family member who might be vindictive or an ex-bouse who might be vindictive, whatever that might be. But it was a complicating factor in that, in that law, which I think ended up passing to. Okay. I want to ask a question about like, and maybe there's no question in it. I'm not sure, but you said something that a moment ago when you were talking about the decapitated cat and mom who helped bury that cat, which is, it's interesting until you, until you put it that way. And I'd read that and I knew about it. But until you put it that way, I just, I didn't think about, like mom's role in helping to kind of suppress this thing and not helping to surface it. Not that she didn't do other things in other contexts to try and address this, but in that particular narrow context, like that was an opportunity to do something. There's a sense in which like all of the grief police who were telling you how to feel about this and the proper way to emote about this publicly and the proper things that you can be concerned about in this particular moment, whether or not it's fair to regard someone as objectively evil, or you know, they'll tell you, this is just pure evil. There's nothing to discuss, or this is just racism. There's nothing to discuss here. This isn't about mental health. This is racism, literally something that I was told because I regarded a person who would perpetrate active mass violence as a lunatic. And to take a cat. I mean, I'd say that that's a lunatic nature. Racism and lunacy can overlap and they often do. They could. But they're telling us that you can only talk about it in this one way. And there's a very real sense in which that metaphorical decapitated cat. That's precisely what they're insisting on. If we can't talk about these other complicated dimensions of the story when Joe Biden lands in this particular place, because he's not, you know, necessarily going to the other supermarket shooting that happened what maybe a year ago or so, but he's going to this thing. And he's going there to talk about racism and the particular evils of racism and white supremacy. And there's a very real sense in which all of the complicated details, the factors that are so hard for us to talk about the parents who find themselves in difficult situations with with troubled children who desperately want help, who need help. The weird thing that this this particular kid did where he was reaching out to people and friending them on Instagram and telling them, like, I have a secret, I'm going to do something where he's posting the pictures of the guns before he goes into the, maybe he's doing it for to try to create some sort of mystery, because he's just that monstrous. Maybe it's a cry for help. Maybe there's a pattern here and there's an opportunity to be able to identify people who are in the the throes of the be preparing to do something completely homicidal and insane and heartbreaking. And I just, it just, it's so frustrating. We can't have sophisticated conversations about this. Part of that is, and this relates to a shooting that happened five minute walk from here, an assassination of a guy who lives in Park Slope was just coming for Sunday brunch, taking a subway, and a guy paced around nervously and then the shot him in the chest and killed him on the Q train. Yeah. That happened. It's crazy. Which is crazy. But what is that we are witnessing in big cities New York, even with a mayor who's just elected sort of ostensibly to combat that, there is a lack of like, people aren't even coming up with ideas about what to do with jabbering lunatics on the street in public places where there are other people. Yes, that should be priority. My 13 year old takes the subway by herself or with her friends. I was coming back, think last night tonight's kind of like melt, late in or from Monday. And you know, on my subway car, there's eight people, three of them were sleeping and one of them was just screaming absolutely crazy things and twitching all over the place. And what was not extraordinary at all. And like, there isn't, I don't necessarily need a SWAT team to come in there, but also like, there is a an almost nihilistic, well, what are you going to do about it happening in a lot of big cities right now? It's certainly all over parts of Los Angeles in many parts of New York still in San Francisco and plenty of other places that don't get that kind of attention. We don't have a good answer to what to do with the beheaded cat. I'm not sure. I'm not sure the good. I'm not sure the subway example, we have any answers at this point. Because I mean, one of the things that, you know, politics and the politicization of this stuff obscures is it's often very useful. Like, let's be honest, I mean, you need political solutions, a lot of the stuff you need to go through legislatures, you need to propose bills, arguments, competition. Yes, absolutely true. And I don't want to say that this is it and only it. But one of the things that when you say things about the subway is a good example, and I someone mentioned this, and I was like, man, what a fucking great point that is. And I forgot who it was. So I'm going to, I'm going to steal it and try to get you a part where you actually talk about someone else. Yeah, this is my take a break. It's not that great of an idea. It's just an observation of the sense that like, when you see seven people have been killed in the subway system last year, and I think as Peter Moscow said, pointed out, I think 2017, there was zero. And so seven, you know, I was still like, you know, millions of rides and the rest of it. And someone pointed out the interesting thing is, what you just pointed out, we've, I think we've told stories about this a million times in the podcast, is that the fear that you get on the subway, you know, when we did our live show, I took the subway back to Brooklyn. I was fucking hammered. And I fell asleep. You know how I woke up in the subway? I fell asleep. I was looking at my phone. I fell asleep and I dropped my phone in the floor and loud and I woke up and there was like two girls across me laughing at me. And I picked it up and I fell asleep and dropped the phone again. True story. But estimate to the safety of the city. Well, the funny thing is, is that this person had pointed out it's not the fear of being murdered. It's the fear of the regular harassment. And that is so true. And the MTA, someone is going to either directly harass you in your car on the platform or make you get off and go to another car. I mean, back when I moved to a situation where you try to intervene on someone else's. Oh my God, that's a good word. You in this situation says Camille and Michael, subway riding, anger bears. Well, I'm Batman. Yeah. I'm a lot of them. It's a good one. I just need to get bear spray. But yeah, it is that shit is like that is off in the case. But to, you know, I was going to say something about the Camille's point about the, you know, parents, when you're both your points. I mean, it's very hard to do something about this, right? Yeah. You are you love your child. You think you can solve this issue. You don't want them going through a system that's brutal and that doesn't really care about them, etc. Generally doesn't work. And generally doesn't work is that, you know, there was, I think it was Dylan Klebold's mother of the column button shooter who after a very long time wrote about this and wrote a book about it and has given interviews about it, which are totally fascinating of that, like, you know, beyond the stuff of like people blamed me for this. And I think she's kind of understanding about that, like I get why you would. But here are the complications with this stuff is, you know, it's it's pretty fascinating. And I just like, you know, this is the thing that we do is that we don't, you know, aggregate all this material. We've talked about this a lot on the show, this one example. And we have a listener, a very smart listener who came to the event, our live show, who goes to Columbia, and he's in the history program there. And he's studying German history. And we have a lot of overlapping interests in these things. And he sent me a message I haven't responded yet, I'm going to respond to. But he mentioned this book that I've mentioned a lot in its by a guy named Christopher Browning, and it's called Ordinary Men. And it's a real breakthrough book in the study of the Holocaust. And basically, you know, the whole premise is right there in the title is that the people that were perpetrating so many of these crimes in the Eastern Front in 1940, 41, 42, were ordinary. They were not committed Nazis. They were ordinary men. And why did this sort of thing happen? And that is effectively what you lose when you have all of these conversations on Twitter, because you need to take a look at all of these people who are either ordinary in the sense of like people in Chicago, who are just like not people who are affected by mental health crises, mental health crises at, you know, I would guess that's probably not the kind of default there. And the ones that do like these motivations, don't just say, oh my God, he played Call of Duty. Yeah, seriously, go fuck yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody plays Call of Duty. And not everybody goes on and does this, right? Pretty simple. So that's, you know, a correlation causation problem. And Fortnite. And for you play and for it, literally like every other child on earth, right? If he'd built like a 15 foot high blinds in 15 minutes and then carried out an assault, then we can talk about that. That will help us understand that like this is the shit. Like, I mean, we this needs some interesting study of what all of these shooters have in common, whether it is, yes, and you have to look at their media diets, their internet diets, etc. Their home lives, it's all this stuff, the bullying, the school, you know, there's got to be some profiles that you can build up here. But and this seems rather obvious, but it isn't obvious when you look at this stuff in the days in now, in this case, the day after the shooting, in which nobody has any interest in that stuff and is saying, what is the thing that I hate and why can I, how can I blame it on this one? And I mentioned Paul Gosar, the repugnant Arizona House member, right? And he said like this was a trans illegal immigrant. And it's like trying to kill one of these. Yeah, I was right. Kind of like, they were all Hispanic, except for I think one person. And apparently a lot of the families that feed into that school are like border, border patrol agents. Yeah, which I think was at the border probably didn't didn't the border some people from the border patrol think they might have engaged. Engaged. Yeah, I was not sure to hear that. Yeah. But like that kind of shit, man. I mean, it is disgraceful and he should be ashamed of himself, but this is he appears to be a man that has no shame. Before we before we pull off of this, Matt, I mean, and maybe you can speak to this, I suspect there is someone listening who's like a staunch gun gun control advocate who happens to know that some of us are sort of strenuous Second Amendment advocates. And we'll do things like go out and buy an AR 15. In theory. But who listen to this and might interpret me and who will listen to this and might interpret this as well, look, you're making a lot of excuses for why, you know, we can't do anything, perhaps. And I don't think that's a fair characterization. But it's certainly the case, Moynihan, that a moment ago, when you were talking about this, you acknowledge like, policy is kind of part of this. Sure. Also not a lot that you can do very easily. Yeah. I think I think to the extent it is complicated, the fact that we're having there's a desire to have more sophisticated conversations about this and how hard it is and the limits of policy, even magical policy that might, you know, wave a wand and all the guns disappear. Like the cultural shift that's necessary and the kind of empathy and understanding that needs to be cultivated around mental health and families who are dealing with a family member who is in a desperate situation who has become dangerous. Because in most instances, people don't just kind of start out this way. In my circumstance, if we grew up together, like known him, he's one of the most gentle people I've known in my entire life. And the fact that it can turn into a situation where he is potentially dangerous to others, like my family and others, is just like, even now, I don't know how to reconcile that. But it's also the case that as someone who is interested in media who follows a lot of these stories, like until I had to deal with it, I hadn't even really, I hadn't contemplated what that might be like. And I don't think most other people who haven't experienced this in some way have either. There's one part of the first half of your question there that I want to latch onto, which is culture. We used to talk about, and this category of people has shrunk into nothingness and in the abortion debate of those who say they want it safe, legal, and rare in the famous formulation of Bill Clinton. That was pretty normal, like 90s Democrat thing. It's actually my position on it. And also make birth control over the counter and much more widespread, and do things to prevent pregnancies and allow people to control their own reproductivity at the root, which was an article strangely missing in New York magazines, as something Nancy pointed out, Nancy Rommelmann. Here's 14 ways to get an abortion now in New York, because there's going to be abortion tourists. You're like, what about the, like, maybe use contraception? But anyways, but one thing that conservatives who for a long time have been on the losing end of a Supreme Court fight, and in that way there's an interesting parallel between the abortion debate and the gun rights debate, because there's a big Supreme Court case that meant you lost more or less. So conservatives, they started chipping away at the laws, but they also started talking about changing the culture, right? Changing the culture, having a discussion about how culture influences the choices that people make. Do you want to make abortion just sort of a breezy other way of birth control? Or do you want to say, hey, look, there's other ways to do it that's not necessarily good for the culture? I think that there is a, an argument or a discussion that isn't happening as much as it could about the culture of guns. One of the things that makes America different than other countries is its level of violence inherent. The only really good Michael Moore documentary, I think, was the Bowling for Columbine thing, partly because he went sort of openly looking for questions. Why does this seem to happen in America when, you know, Canadians have just as many guns? And he didn't really have answers. He had a couple of ones that weren't, I didn't think very convincing. Lockheed Martin makes bombs. Lockheed Martin makes bombs and also like everyone gets scared because of the media or something. But like it was the bombing of Yugoslav, former Yugoslavia, that made everyone happen. So I think Dylan Harris, there was an issue of his. But I think there was a spirit of that document which I appreciated. One is that like it did point out that America has always been an unusually violent country when guns were not available. This has always been true. It's not, we shouldn't be bragging about this. And also there's 350 million guns. And I think that the culture that has grown up around the protection of the Second Amendment has often been as was in the case of the Governor Abbott in Texas. He's like, Hey, Texas, just get this is not what he's tweeted yesterday. This is something they said I think last year, whether you're before. Hey, Texas is now on his phone at the second place on the per capita gun ownership. Come on, Texas, we can do more like, no, that's not necessary. Protect the amendment. It was the Supreme Court case that made this an individual right in 2008. So like, you know, if you care about constitutional rights care about the right, there is nothing necessarily beautiful in showing videos of your seven year old shooting guns at the firing range. Having guns around the house is inherently dangerous. Most gun deaths are suicides. They're suicides because someone had access to a gun. It's easier to get to the violent weapon and boys in particular, 18 year old boys. That's exactly it. Is there a gun around? Is it possible to figure out the lock on it, even if my parents are very responsible about proper storage of the gun? Get your hands on it. I don't think that it's a thing to celebrate that there are 350 million guns. We are not going to seize them. It's not going to be Australia. But let's also like, enshrine and try to, as people used to do a lot more in Second Amendment or organizations, talk constantly about gun safety and gun management and not celebrate the damn thing on its own sake. It is a tool that is used constantly and used in a way that leads to more deaths. It just is. So like, use your gun, use your firearm to protect yourself and your family as you see fit. Also be aware that you've introduced a thing in your household that is deadly and other people can use it. And like, you have to be able to say that and have that conversation instead of or in addition to like, I'm either going to grab all your guns or I'm, you know, you're going to take the guns out of my cold head. Yeah. The on the other side of that and I'm going to move on to other stuff. It's kind of a bad asking to say though, more than like from my cold dead hands. Yeah. I like how many that was. That was the great Charles and Esten moment where he's raised it. He actually had a gun. There's a video of Charlton Heston from like 1988 talking about the reason foundation does really important work. You should go find it's fantastic. But I would say the other end of that, I do know a number of people like a number of people, all very well educated, good jobs, the rest of it. Apparently, Evan thought this through. Think that you can do that without consequence. Go and take people's gun. Oh, I mean, I just want to say regardless of what you think, this, the complexion of this country should look like when it comes to owning guns and the second man and everything like this, is that the unforeseen consequences of that are so huge that I cannot imagine that anyone would say that with any seriousness. It reminds me in a sense of like, let's go to a rock. What could go wrong? I can't imagine. I'm not saying it's good that there's ISIS or the mighty army resisting, but it might happen. That might happen. I think that when people say, somebody actually said this to me recently, that we just get rid of them. We should just take them from people and fight back. Sure. I don't. It's like, you know how many Randy Weavers you're going to have in the situation like that? I mean, it's terrible and unthinkable. And we just have to, you know, talk about this issue around that. You cannot use that as a serious and also a second point. It would be disastrous. Um, you were the same people admitted who wanted to end stop and frisk because it was racist. So you got to pick a lane because stop and frisk is an anti gun program, you people. Well, it's also the case that people that wants, I mean, it is. It's funny. Like, if you're not crazy, they want you to kind of like skate on gun charges depending on where you are because, I mean, the bail reform stuff is like, you know, people who support that. There are a lot of people that get popped on gun charges and get out pretty quickly. And the opposite is the conversation you hear happening after after a tragedy like this is that we can have, you know, no quarter for people who carry guns illegally, even legally, if they're crazy, whatever, all of these things get rid of them and stop people. That is what fills up prisons. And that I'm not saying don't prosecute people because at all, I'm saying you absolutely should. But if you are going to take the position that we need to have fewer people in prison, we have to have, you know, you know, bail reform in the sense that if you get caught with something, you know, don't go too hard on these people. A lot of those things are gun charges. So I mean, I don't know the exact number, but, but somebody will surely tell me. I'm thinking we should talk about a few other things as well. Baseball. Well, you guys went to a baseball game. Yeah. And you have some insight into this, this non traversy where someone is referring to themselves as Jackie Robinson and then other people say, Hey, Jackie, and apparently that's racist. Super racist. Matt, if you could explain, I don't know what's going on. So outfielders and first shortstop. First of all, first of all, we went to, we went to a drinking expedition and a baseball game. Yes. Yeah. In literally, and it was 140 degrees. This is this is Yankee status. This is hottest. So every year we do this little thing. Kennedy, you might remember her email from the launch. This is that work, which will tell you something. You don't live here. Anyways, we have every year we go to a Yankee day game on the weekend and Kennedy smuggles in. Every year gets bigger. The, uh, there's a lot of the, the boost that she smokes in a walk bottle. Just gives us cost. It goes to Kila. It's really, really good. But by the way, talk about that. Are you talking about that? Yeah. Yeah. I just want to point out. It's all the Super Bowls. This is, by the way, a very bad idea when it is 98,000 degrees out, you're sitting on like close to, you know, good seats. That's not tricked us out. And, um, there's no coverage from the song. You're just getting beaten with the song and you're like, I just, I'm so thirsty and I just keep drinking booze, which is like, you know, like pickling me in the inside, drying me out and I'm like, I need more. I don't know. I'm so thirsty. And I'm drinking more and more. And then get up to go get more mixers and a fight breaks out. Yes. Um, uh, a fight breaks out and we don't understand it at all because it's a baseball fight so that there's actually no fighting. Okay. It's a battle. So the plate, Josh Donaldson, who's this guy. He's kind of what we say in baseballs or red ass. He just sort of like, good player. Like it was either MVP or as a finalist MVP a couple of times. You should play with Oakland and Toronto. Red ass red ass means that he's just like, it's usually a white dude doesn't have to be, but it almost always is, um, who is like ready to fight and just like sort of hustles. And he's got like a charcoal under his eyes and he's quick to temper. And he's just like a baby's tobacco, just a red ass. Like he's, he's, you don't get red asses in like Massachusetts. That's just like, it is a geographical, very specific. Yeah. I mean, Larry Boa, I don't know where he comes from, but he was very red. But just sort of like a little anger, like ball of energy. So Josh adults is at home plate and suddenly he's having a conversation with the catcher, Yasmani Grandal from the Chicago White Sox. And they kind of are sort of getting in their face and they seem to be disputing about something. And it was totally baffling, not just because of all the tequila that we'd had before, including at the Yankee, what was it called? The Yankee River Cafe or the Yankee Twin Cafe are our listening, dangerous, our listener, Craig Mahoney, please go there before every angel game, including, or any Yankee game, the angels are coming. He'll set you up. But so it was baffling to us watching this because, you know, usually a baseball fight happens when the pitcher throws it a batter, it hits him or there's some kind of scuffle like that. Nothing like that happened. So they start to coalesce. Keep in mind that you said, Donaldson, this is actually Tim Anderson, who's who's the one who's? No, I know. Yeah. I know. But so yeah, much going on. Josh Anderson is the hitter and the catcher is mad at him and they're getting in their each other's faces. The benches clear, the bullpen's like, and again, it's 90 degrees in a hot day. They don't want to run all the way out from beyond the left field fence. And so they kind of run out and everybody's John Crunk. Everyone congregates and they don't really do anything, but they look at each other and yell for about five or 10 minutes. And we don't understand any of it. And we find it's a super weird sport. I love every minute of it. So we come to find out that Josh, the catcher was mad at Josh Donaldson and the white Sox were mad at Josh Donaldson. Josh Donaldson, the red ass for the Yankees, kept calling Tim Anderson the all-star short stop for the Chicago white Sox, kept calling him Jackie. Hey, what's up, Jackie? What's going on, Jackie? Yeah. Now, Jackie in baseball, as usually, and in this case, definitely a reference to Jackie Robinson, the heroic and fantastic Brooklyn Dodgers, the trailblazer, the color line in baseball in 1947. So the reason why Josh Donaldson, who was white, was saying this to Madison, who was black, is because Tim Anderson, in an interview or an article a couple of years ago, had said the perhaps unfortunate statement, like, yeah, you know, I pretty much, I kind of feel like I'm the modern day version of Jackie Robinson. Oh, yeah. It's a bit of a stretch. In what respect? In the respect that there are fewer black players, black American players, as opposed to black Dominicans, who somehow don't qualify as black when we're talking about black players in America, because of the very important racial classification system that we have in our brains. It was sophisticated, yeah. So, you know, and dealing with the struggles of life and he's also very good players. This is like a Black Lives Matter kind of utterance. Yeah. He's sort of like thinking about racial reckoning and different things in baseball. So, yeah, he's just like Jackie Robinson in 2020, multi-millionaire playing a fucking game for a living. Yeah. You know, so there are many ways known as a thing that you definitely are going to be mocked for. There are many ways that Tim Anderson, who again is a very good player, is not like Jackie, Jackie Robinson's the best player in baseball for five years. Yeah. In those five years included Ted Williams and Sam usual kind of you kind of had to be. He was an absolute badass. He would, I don't know anything about this, I know this is true. He was one of the only four sport athletes in NCAA history, not only that, but he led the precursor to the Pac-10 basketball league in scoring. As a point guard, he was a national champion, high jumper and he owned, or a long jumper and he only tried once or twice. Like you always say, Matt, the Negro is naturally gifted in sports. Thank you. You say that all the time. It must be the jeans. So, Josh Donaldson baseball. He gets quite when the mike song. He doesn't say it. It's much from the mike song. Baseball is a trash talking game. Like long predating basketball, which is very good trash talking game too. And it's an art. It is succeeded baseball in terms of the quality of trash talk. And like the way that you can do it, baseball has just always been, you know, they've had bench jockeying back and forth. And so Josh Donaldson taking the piss out of a guy who would claim to say that he's like Jackie Robinson. So venerated is Jackie Robinson that every year on April 15th, every player in the in baseball wears his number 42, which is otherwise retired. I mean, he is also the meaning of life as close to as a Saint Saint figure in baseball. Actually, he's more complicated and interesting than his Sainthood figure. So Josh Donaldson taking the piss out of Tim Anderson and calling him Jack. Hey, what's up, Jack? And he's been doing that for a while. And Tim Anderson finally decided, apparently enough was enough in that this was racist. And so, so also said Tony LaRusa, who is a yeah, the manager of the White Sox, who's about 917 years old. You're years old serial drunk driver. Yes. Right. And he's like, I can't, this is just racist and terrible. And so the Yankees and the Major League Baseball decided to investigate this incident of him making fun of a guy for saying that he thinks that he's Jackie is sort of like an unearned privilege insult. That's right. That's how I imagine. I can't get into Josh Donaldson's head. I do know baseball and I also know that no one is Jackie right. No one has come close to enduring what Jackie right. Jackie Robinson got court marshaled for refusing to go to the back of the bus when he was in the army in the 1940s and went through this long fight that he was a hard-ass motherfucker. Tim Anderson, great player is not Jackie Robinson. So Josh Donaldson taking the piss. This was seen unanimously in the sporting press and elsewhere, unanimously as racist, unanimously. And not just that when Tim Anderson, so the story comes out of this and like people are like us, maybe a little bit less drunk, we're trying to figure out after the game, like what's going on? It's like, oh, they hear the story. And this is why stuff almost came to blows. And so when Tim Anderson comes to the plate in the next game, he's booed by the fans. Yeah. This is again, almost universally Dave Zieran in the nation of course, but also Will Leach from New York Magazine. I'm like, I am so disgusted. Yeah, I think it's kind of a writing thing. I think somewhere. And I'd like Will's work over the years. I'm so disgusted at that racist display by the Yankee fans. Yeah. By the Yankee fans. Yeah. I'm just maybe. I think by the way that Tim Anderson by the way has the last laugh here. I think the second half out of it, he had a homerun and then put his finger over his mouth like shush to you, which is great. That's great. That's what you do is trash talking back. You want to fuck with me? I'm going to fuck with you. I just hit a homerun. So you got him, Jackie Robinson. Yeah, exactly. I mean, that's, I mean, it's a fun. It's how it works. But the the unbelievable thing, this was, I think it was in the Will Leach article, but he quotes this guy from the athletic of saying, God, I have to find this here because it was like James Fiegan, do you know him? Said that the Donaldson comment, quote, called to mind a long history in this country of racial minorities being derisively referred to by the names of celebrities of the same race, often implying that racial minorities are an indistinguishable and largely irrelevant monolith to the person casting the insult. Now that might be relevant had he just made this up out of nowhere. Yeah. And just said, what's up, pumpsy? Like, no, that's not what he said. He was making fun of him for being a bit pompous. That's what you do. Yeah. I mean, if it's so like willfully, I mean, these are equivocally ignoring this context. The equivalent would be if somewhere to walk down the street and see Camille and close it. What's up, Denzel? Which Camille would like because he likes Denzel in their both hands men, but like, a little more handsome than him. But if he was, but if it's perfect, but if it was done in a way where like you could tell the sort of a tease associated with it, it'd be like, well, that's kind of a random and out of nowhere. What's what's that all about? This wasn't random. The guy said, I'm a modern day Jackie Robinson. And he was like, what's up, Jackie? Piss tech there. Yeah. But by the way, the funniest thing about this in in the context, that we were walking into the game. And you know, first 20 minutes of any Yankee game is a crush. I mean, 105 starts and there's 20 minutes of the crush of people trying to get in. So I'm walking up the stairs and there's a million people there and there's a cop at the top of the stairs. This cop is not white. I don't know what he is and where do I care, but he's not a white guy. And this guy is screaming in the stairs and he's like, keep fucking walking and he's not even paying attention. And the guys yelling and yelling at him, I'm starting to hear what the guy says in the cop in Kenny Confront. The cop was like, you can't scalp tickets here. And he's like, I'm not arresting you. And he's like, and the guy says like, this shit is racist. This is racist. The cop has the most amazing response. But he's that it was not about him. It was about society. Yeah. He looked out the guy and he's like, you know what? I swear to God, he said this. He's like, people are getting pretty fucking sick of this. Of this excuse. People are fucking sick of move on. Yes. Moving. Yes. Fuck you, man. And like, it's going and he didn't arrest him. Yeah. He just had his hands folded and he was standing at the top of the stairs making sure he was getting trampled. Yeah. And he was telling the guy to stop scalp and sick. It's the guy was brazenly scalping to his infront of a cop. Didn't arrest him again. But the most amazing thing is when he was like, people are getting kind of sick of this. And it was a non white guy. Yeah. It was probably I mean, he was probably his man. Bronxian kind of got basic truths about the world. And I just thought it was so funny when he says like, people are getting sick of this. And then four innings later, then this huge copy and into to cap his mouth. Donaldson was investigated by MLB and New York magazine was very upset about this and said he got a slap on the wrist. He was suspended for a game and find. I'm not sure exactly why. But to frame that the way it was framed was dishonest, I would say. I think that's dishonest. There's just not any room in this game for that kind of talk. I mean, look, this is to Matt Iglesias's silly tweet, you know, about America. I'll tell you one, you realize that things can be a lot worse is when you go to a sporting event in Europe. And I remember I was in Sweden and there was a black player on a hockey team, like a Sweden team. And they threw bananas at him. Yeah. This happens in soccer all the time too. It's like, I'm not saying I don't compare these things, but that shit's bad. That doesn't happen in the statistics. I mean, I just not. And I really, if it did, it would be wouldn't understand it. Yeah, I would be like, what's the matter for? I'd be like, what is he? No, he's a good player. Understand. I think they don't understand. I don't know, man. Like, like, even old time eraser stuff like that. What? Yeah. And it's not saying that eraser shit doesn't happen. It's for some course it does. But, you know, when you're getting especially in Boston, that's well, that's historically that's a long time. Historically, yeah, that's a long time. And be like Kevin McHale, because he was just a nice chap and a good right about it. Now, and you know, Robert Parrish, you got an arrested for the weed being sent to his house by UPS. Right. Yeah. God, it's so crazy. I imagine those people who got their lives like, not ruined, but like fucked up and away. And now we're like, this shit's legal in math. You could go down the store and buy it. And my, I was like on the front page of the Boston Herald for like three weeks, because I got some weed sent to my house, you know, free Robert Parrish. What is Robert Parrish doing now? Besides being awesome. He's got to be hawking like used cars somewhere outside of it. I don't think he is though. Yeah. I don't think he is. No. No, because there was always everybody. When I was sure that when they do the little documentaries, you don't see him. No, he's not. He's not interviewed. I mean, all of the other guys were always interviewed. Chief. Maybe. Yeah. Thanks for all. DJ is DJ dead. DJ died. Yeah, he died. Dennis Johnson. Yeah. Talking to 80s basketball here. Yeah. He's a little guy, little guy. He was, but how do you die? I'm a broken heart. So just the redhead freckle. Yeah, that was, I love that. He looked great. Anyway, that's the baseball thing. What was the last thing when I talk? So there was, well, the two things come up line. One, I snuck out, and I went to see a Dr. Strange yesterday, the multiverse of madness. What is that? It's like the new Marvel movie. And I just want to just say this very quickly for whatever reason. It sounds. Marvel movies are dog shit. Yeah. Marvel movies at this point are just like glorified fireworks displays. Isn't Amber heard it with? Well, she was no, it was a Marvel movie. That's DC. And she had a bit current in Aquaman. I thought she was a superhero that went around shitting on people's bed. No. She, she actually kind of is. In real life. You fuck with me? I will take a dump in your bed. Like what kind of super powers that of that? Dumpy. Dumpy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm struck. Scat man. Scat lady. Come on. You're right. Scat girl. Scat. Scat. You know me. Yeah. Is that Scat girl? Oh my god. Run. She's at it again. Yeah. She's shitting on my couch. Yeah. But she's got a hardcore fan base. That's a lot of people into that. A lot of people. They're all German and or Chuck Bailey. Ruby was so big in Germany. I was saying there's no one pooping on anyone in and Dr. Strange. But, but honestly, it would have fit right in. Like these, these are fireworks displays with kind of haphazard, almost plots, grafted onto them. And it just it boggles the mind just how shitty a film this is compared to like the original crop of Marvel Avengers movies and how much character development went on. Like they literally just throw some bizarre character who almost know and has ever read onto screen. And it's kind of like, yeah, there she is. She can do some shit. It's never quite explained. But you know what she does have on like a Pride pen. And it is prominently displayed through most of the film. Yes. This young girl who's wears a denim jacket. Her name is America, America Chavez. In the movie. Yes. Yes. She's from another planet where her two parents are women. So my mom's she sees them and they're like sucked into a vortex wormhole. I don't care if I'm ruined in this movie for you. I'm doing you a favor. Don't see this shitty film. Stop watching all of these movies. I want them to get back to feeling as though narrative and plot matters. And I worry because I was in that theater. This is from a different planet. I've got her name here. Again, Stanley and the rest of the Marvel. Marvel actually went through a whole thing before the kind of woke revolution. Marvel went through a thing where they were just kind of minting these characters for precisely these purposes. Like that's how that's kind of how we got Black Panther in the 1970s. It was in response to kind of the pro Black back to Africa stuff. He made up a fake Stanley, a white man, made up a fictional African country. And he's going to made up what's going on with that. Stanley gave you Wakanda and he gave you Black Panther. Oh my god. You're welcome. That is actually disgusting. But yeah, just thing that he was appropriating a culture and making money off. Yeah. And everyone has celebrated him and the film. This is because this belongs to us. It's Phubu. Except not really. Yeah. But I don't know. Just movie the movie is shitting. I want them to make better movies. And I was I was disgusted. And I wonder if we don't. Private. There were kids. No, I didn't know any about it. It's fine. If you just want to have a movie about a Pride pin, fine. I don't care. I just tell me that that's what it is. So I don't give you my money with the expectation that there's a story. You know, it's not even that he's complaining about the lack of plot. That there's some stakes in that thing. Yeah. So there you have it. It's right there. You can hear that little weirdness. But so if any of you want this, you can hear all this great stuff. And it'll just sound muddy. But just from the online and I'll send you the muddy file and you can fix it or something because we've tried and we can't. So back to the program in the middle of a sentence from Matt Well, in the wake of Trump has been very sort of loudly saying, Hey, I I like the new deal or I associate myself with the new deal and you know, and certainly the anti trade policies and and strange new respect for Bernie Sanders and or Elizabeth Warren, sometimes on a case by case basis. So yeah, it makes it more difficult to do that. And like there's the they want to attack the libertarianism within the Republican Party. And so you means that you're against all that stuff. There's very little, the only like a spillover between the existing libertarianism and the party usually has to do with foreign policy. And there wasn't a lot of libertarians in the foreign balls to begin with. But now actually, that's I think it's a real change in the Republican Party. Now we'll see what happens next time they get a president. But the only foreign war is often a lot, a lot. And like the sand and the gears to, you know, the next $40 billion. Here you go, Ukraine is exclusively Republican and the language being used by people who oppose it. They're not all just Josh Hawley and and people like that. You know, there are other Republicans are picking up on that. So it's become part of a conservative identity. Now I like the lots of that part of that identity, or at least I'm glad that it's not as interventionist as it used to be. But there's, you know, many other things about that identity identity. We haven't talked much about it, but I'm curious to know what you guys think. Because I mean, when Donald Trump was in office, one of the things that was most disconcerting to people was the fact that he would just say anything. Yes. But Joe Biden, especially since like the beginning of the year, like, he's kind of been saying anything. And he's been saying anything about things that have pretty profound significance, like US foreign policy, antagonizing major rivals of the United States. Go get him. Go get him. Like deploying troops and assassinating heads of states, not kind of behind closed doors. And this is leaked by someone who is close to the president and who's concerned about his bizarre behavior. No, no, this is him. On camera, in front of reporters, just saying shit, particularly somebody who is instrumental in creating American policy vis-a-vis Taiwan. Yeah, for many, many years, he was like on the front line of that stuff. I mean, is to the extent you guys had concerns about that with Donald Trump before, how concerned are you about it now under the Biden administration? And what accounts for the kind of difference in perspective? No, it never walked it back. That's right. I mean, that's right. But sometimes there would be walkbacks. I suppose in other cases, people were trying to like quickly kind of talk around it. But there was never, oftentimes when he would like openly muse about something or say something insulting about NATO, he says the thing, but they continue to proceed with the current policy. Well, we learned in Mark Esper's book that he was serious about like, we need every US troop out of Germany now. Yeah. Yeah. And, and so, and I mean, you know, take away the grain of salt. There's a lot of like, boy, it really was terrible. I can, I can exclusively reveal now memoirs dropping every week. But according to his version, Esper's version, they're like, okay, we'll get a commission to look at the impacts of shifting troops. So they just ran out the clock on it, basically. Right. And that's, and that's how you take care of it. The Biden thing is interesting with Taiwan. I'm kind of curious here what one hand I say about that, because he's basically articulating what has always been the policy. But part of the, except for the fact that the part of the policy is to articulate is to never articulate that. Exactly right. So he violated the rules of Fight Club, basically with this. And, and, but also did it at a time when, with the strategic ambiguity, strategic ambiguity, but he did it at a time when there's a lot of discussion in both directions of how does China respond to the post-Ukraine thing? They could, you could see them rationally saying, well, the US ruled out troops to begin with in Ukraine and continue to say, no, we're not going to have a no fly zone, whatever. Cool, we get to have our sphere of influence. They're not going to do it. That's one interpretation. Other interpretation is, oh, wow, the world community is going to wreck our economy overnight. And China seems to be taking steps to try to mitigate against that. And China's a basket case right now. There's a lot of, bad, bad time. Like the Chinese economy is in, is in genuine, like, I want to use the phrase dire straits. I don't think it's a distress for sure. But it's super fucked up. It's hard not to think that some of the COVID zero response and the lockdowns is not an attempt to try and distract the domestic population from this horrible disaster circumstance they have. Like the real estate property bubble there is unlike anything that we've seen before. Yeah. And the company that, uh, should the bed that, you know, rattled the entire economy was, was a real estate company. Right. It's different in a few ways. I mean, I would say that the one thing, you know, disentangling yourself from China economically is harder than it is with Russia. It's possible at the moment. Yeah. And, you know, you can cut off the gas. We'll find another thing who'd literally have nothing in the targets. That would be very, very, very, very, very, I could order stuff from Ali Express, my favorite website. But the other thing is that strategically, you know, getting weapons to, to Ukraine is pretty easy because the western part of Ukraine has a big, you know, welcome sign coming from Poland, right? Taiwan's an island. That makes it a little more difficult to actually, you know, you know, that just strategically has a lot of kind of different, and it's not a lot of space to, I mean, used to always call Russia the great feather pillow. You'd invade Russia, you punch the feather pill and just comes out somewhere in the back because you keep going East, keep going back up, back up, which the Germans, they did to the Germans and then counter attacked and destroyed them, right? There's nowhere really to go until I'm on. That's a, it's another thing. So I think they're thinking about this in that way. And Biden on the other hand is like saying, so here's the crazy thing. I looked this up, I was trying to find the exact quote. This is true. I tried to find the exact quote of what he said to that. It was the first question when he got off the plane in Japan. Yeah. And I google it. And this thing comes up about him, them walking back to Taiwan policy from Joe. And it was from November. Yeah. He's done this before. Yes. And he's done it about three times before. And he just can't get like that is a point at which it's not even the verbal flubs. It's just like, when you have to walk it back multiple times, like, Joe, we already want this back. What are you doing? It's like, I'm gonna protect him. I'm gonna do it. And it's like, we did this already. And now, and this is particularly a guy who doesn't, I imagine know a ton about, you know, you know, like, Senkam in Africa or something, you know, Horn of America. He, as I said, was like when he was the chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, he was like instrumental in formulating America's policy. And particularly, he even said this thing about the one China policy, which was kind of wrong too. And we said that we, we totally agree with them on this. It's like, well, that's not really the policy that it's like an accommodation with one China, with one China, of course, means that there is one Chinese country, which includes Taiwan and of course, at one point, Hong Kong too. But it includes, and he's like, no, we're fully on board with that. We're on board with that. And it's like, you also just said we would defend them if they, none of it, he makes a hash of everything. And so to the Trump thing backing up is that that when he said things, they were kind of crazy. It was, there was a part of it. And you have to kind of sort of separate out the policies. There's a part of it where he would say crazy shit, and off the cuff, and then he would make it policy. He'd be like, yeah, let's do that. I said, like, like, I think that's where it's between a mad king who's still like in charge of his mental faculties and a senile king, which, which in a very real sense, and this is just, it's not, this is not conspiratorial. Like, it does not seem like Joe Biden is in control of anything. He's constantly on camera saying, I'm not allowed to talk about this. I'm gonna get in trouble. It's very, it's very weird. You saw the Tom Friedman article though, when he was like, I had, no, he was like, I had lunch with him. And you know, obvious people would say he's amazing. He's sharp as a tack. I'm wondering about you, Tom. Yeah, because you mean after about his, his, like his family or something. But yeah, when you say, like, we're gonna shut down, you know, Muslims from coming to the country, pretty sure that that was an off a cuff thing. They became policy. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And it kind of, yeah. Yeah. It was, he tried. He tried for sure. He couldn't actually do it. It was, well, he did a thing that he was, he did. And then he, yeah, it was a mess. The evil child of his crazy. It was like, the wall he was gonna build was like, don't do that. That's stupid. And he didn't really do it. Yeah. Although he says he did. There's a, there's a great bit. I really recommend everybody watch Shane Gillis's comedy special. It is so funny. It's so unbelievably good. But he's, he has a bit about going to the border. And he's like, there was already a wall there. And he's like, they built this shit. It's been there. Like we've had this here. And he's like, really? It's really, really funny. But yeah, Shane Gillis's special is really good. But anyway, yeah, you got a role out of your don't you? We probably got to wrap up soon because I got to, I got to go catch a helicopter to the airport to get on the plane to go to the thing. So we do. What we do? It's just like this one's they night. You do. It's one by night. I have to go catch the F train where a man would be defecating on the platform. Yeah. And I'd be like, this is my helicopter. It's like a scat man. Yeah. Girl. And he'll probably be doing a helicopter with his dick. You know, he's like, helicopter. Yeah. Man, don't get the helicopter. That's Kim Biel is like going over man. That's pretty. And I'm like, I'll wait. I'll wait to you. It's fine. Yeah. That's fine. I'll be underground. Well, you can wave free while they're putting me on the gurney. Just putting me in the back of the hand. What we're going to do is become like the lobamba thing. Like, I'm going to go take your your to take your to take the train. Yeah. And we'll make it. I will. I thought we were going to make it, but you have to go through the ICU to get there. Yeah. Yeah. You're you're you're the big bopper. You're not going to reach you balance with the big bopper. I don't have a big one. Do you share that that you share that? Hell come right? Yeah. Yeah. So it's like hardering it. Yeah. Yeah. It's like it's like an uber pool, but like an helicopter. Yeah. I don't want to name the name of the of the company because I don't want to like help people find them. They should pay me if I'm going to sponsor. Yeah. Actually, no, let's try this. I think there's one company. It's blade. It's blade. I'm going to take a blade. This I haven't done this before. But I'm interested because I actually like genuinely have some unique scheduling. What is the flank time between here and Newark? Five like five minutes. It's where you get it from the seaport. It's it's I'm. Oh, see, actually on the other side. Yeah. It's like 15 15 minutes from where I'm staying. So I'm going to walk over there with my bags, get on a helicopter, five minutes to the airport. And then there's going to be a shuttle that takes me to the front door. And then of course, the shuttle be longer than the actual pre checks. I'll go through those with the breeze. And then when they call group one, yeah, I'll just go through and take my seat because yeah, can I tell you a good scam? Yeah, even the end on some good practical, like life hacker. Yeah, that's what we're doing right now. Yeah, I like this. Hacker advice. This is a helicopter and never flack. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Money. That's like Tony Robbins of this motherfucker. Just this is easy. Yeah. Have some money. Yeah. I'm just wrong with you. Stop being poly. Yeah. Do that. Oh, shit. Did you see the guy that brought the the Reverend? No, brought, you know, the guy who killed the dude in the subway. We talked about. Yeah. Yeah. I think that guy. There was like a Reverend that brought him in. Oh, no. In like, as court in the man who brought in the murderer. Yeah. Yeah. He negotiated. Yeah. That's right. He went to his church and he negotiated and he came in motherfucker drives up to the police. And badly rolls Royce out with a Fendi. Yes. That's right. That's right. That's right. And he's Reverend. That's right. What's his name? Chris. The all of the Creflow dollar. Yeah. Creflow and Taffy. Yeah. It was fucking crazy. And he gets out and he's like, you know, we have to bless the man of God. You have to bless the man of God. I can't remember this. Oh, but my life hack for your for how you act like you have good. In addition to be a prosperity pastor. Get as much money as you can for the parishioners. You can give your 10%. You think this bettly fuels itself? I'm going to literally googling Fendi rolls Royce. I will definitely come up. The pastor who negotiated in your city subway shooter surrender is an ex con. I didn't know who he is. Yeah. The fan is life around. Fendi obsessed $350,000 rolls Royce driving ex con pastor. That's right. That is used to be a criminal. Now he's a criminal. Yeah. That eglases was right. I mean, I'm the more Miller Whitehead is the founder of the leaders of tomorrow international church. Yes, sir. Yes, sir. He was once locked up for five years in Singsang. I didn't know that. Is that like a 40? It's old school. Yeah. Singsang. Oh my God. In 2006, he stole the identities of multiple people in Long Island. In 2006. Yeah. And in Brooklyn. A two million dollar scam. Wow. The bishop who was ordained in 2016. Yeah. And God recently registered his ministry as a nonprofit business in 2014. Well, nonprofit for everyone else. Yes. That's pretty much. You said a bettly. He's a rolls Royce. Yeah. But this is another important data point. Yeah, but he's got a whitehead who has reportedly been seen in a mozzarati and a Bentley. Yes. That's how she allegedly owes $250,000 and loans. Yeah. And he showed up in a $350,000. Well, he owes that. Oh, is that not the church? Well, that's honorable. Yeah. Because you don't have to do that. Yeah. That's and I want to show you. I want to show you. I want to show you. Usually they pick up the tab for your mansion as well. Yeah. That's this is the subtle jacket that he's wearing. Yes. Not have the Fendi logo on it. Yes. I like his eyewear too. Yeah. The whole thing is looking looking good. Oh my God. Oh, but here's my. But it's the white T-shirt that I love. It's the way it's understated, but you know that that's a Balenciaga. It's I think it's a Balenciaga. A turtleneck. No. So it's a Oh, no, it is a T-shirt, but he has a Fendi shirt underneath, which is another layer. Oh, yes. My God. That's pretty impressive. Yeah. God, that is so tacky. But yeah, I got to get to my thing. He's like a guy. He's one of those guys with the bust down Rolex. Of course he does. Yes. He got so tacky. That's how you do it. You got that Rolex playing three card. And then I'll bust down the Rolex dummy. Well, if you want to get on first, I don't know why it's very important for me to go on first. I cannot wait. I don't. I can't do it. Do you do you steal valor or do you pretend to have some sort of injury, which is which is worse. Yeah. Yeah. I do have a Danish army coat that produces people and they're like, yeah, go on. Yeah. No problem. I mean, you said active duty manager. Yeah. Yeah. You didn't know town. They were having to do these prompts. No, make sure your ticket is a digital ticket, right? Is it on your phone and on the app? Yeah. Particularly works at Delta. I am fly Delta. So that's what I know. Yeah. When you go up and they call the, you know, the sky priority or whatever. Yeah. You are putting your phone face down on the scanner. That's right. They are not looking because the priority boarding does not, you can be in 38 F, but it does tell the seat number. Yeah, but it doesn't tell which section. No, you can be 38 F and have status. So you go in. So you just go through. Fuck. Yeah. Fuck. Yeah. I'm in the back by myself. Like in by myself, Rosa Parks in the back, I was just like quiet. And in the back, like, I never went in the back. Yeah. That's the whole thing. You're not well. Yeah. And I'm not for a lot of reasons. I am Jackie Robinson. So Jackie, we're all Jackie Robinson. That's the thing. I think that's what I'm saying. You wasn't that special. We could all be Jackie Robinson. It's all being five sport, four sport masters. And if you dispute it or agree, you're racist. Yeah. I, yes. And we can go back and go back and look, if you want to see some interesting Jackie stuff, is political evolution, particularly his relationship and support of Richard Nixon, which then dissipated pretty quickly and became an anti-Nixon type. I don't think he actually campaigned against Nixon, but he did campaign for Nixon at one point. I mean, he was more of for Nixon than like 1960. He soured on the Republican Party because of Barry Goldwater. And they said, right. That's right. He did. That's too bad. So I know you weren't around. The extremism and the defense of liberty is no vice. Yeah. Or just bomb the shit out of Vietnam. You got to come in. Yeah. Bye. Yeah. Bye. Oh, okay. Bye. We know of new methods of attack. See you."
