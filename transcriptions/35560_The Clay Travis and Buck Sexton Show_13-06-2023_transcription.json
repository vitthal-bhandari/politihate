Join the millions of listeners on the iHeartRadio app. Free never sounded so good. Hi iHeartRadio. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Alright, third hour of Clann Buck kicks off right now. Thanks for being here with us. 800-282-8882 on those phone lines. Get some of your calls in the back of this hour. We want to talk about what happened at the White House with the Pride celebration and Play. This is going to go into this is going to be something that's in your wheelhouse to analyze. We'll discuss what happened there because there was somebody who showed their boobs outside of the White House. At a Pride celebration and took a photo of it standing outside the White House at an event where there were families, there were children present, a trans influencer. We'll get to that in a second. But first, I thought this was just interesting. People often try to get a sense as to when we talk about the establishment GOP or the unit party control the opposition. These are terms that will come across a lot. Sometimes we'll use them. But generally this is something you'll see talked about online and a lot of people in the GOP base, people who are based or who know what time it is or who understand what is at stake in the country right now and what the communists want to do to it, also known as Democrats. They get annoyed because they see things like this. Here is, you all remember Paul Ryan. Paul Ryan was Speaker of the House. He was Mitt Romney's running mate. He debated Joe Biden, if you recall, Clay, and the VP debate, which was interesting. When he was running in 2012 and at a time when it seems on the one hand, we have trans influencers flashing their boobs in front of the White House. And there's all this enormous push for trans issues all through. We all know. We talk about all the time. Here's what Paul Ryan says the GOP should be focused on. Play 28. Can I get your thoughts on that movement just quickly? I know we have to go. Republican lawmakers around the country are pushing legislation when it comes to banning books. It could be trans rights. Call it anti-woke. How do you want to label it? Is that a good approach, a good strategy or football fan? Is that the way you should approach it? Yeah, I'm not a cultural work guy. I think it's really polarizing. Look, on some of these issues outside, you know, with the anti-woke crowd, but to me, I'm worried about a debt crisis. I'm worried about, you know, the future of our country and in China. There are big policy problems that we need to tackle if we want to have a great 21st century for this country. My work at AEI Notre Dame and my poverty foundation is all about poverty and upward mobility. What I worry about are the big policy challenges that are going unresolved or made worse by Joe Biden. So that's why I want to win this election. Okay. Can I just call you a couple of... I want your reaction to this, but first off, whenever someone says that they're... If you are Republican and you are in this fight and you understand the stakes, when someone says there are books being banned, you have to say that is a lie. That is an obvious lie. That is not reality. A kindergartner not getting a book with pornography in it in his school curriculum is not a book ban, all right? Any more than... Am I banned from the New York Times? I'm not banned. They just choose not to publish my editorials all the time, Clay, but are we banned? Why don't they just run our transcripts? Are we banned? It's not a ban. And then beyond that, when he says I'm not a culture war guy, what does somebody... What does a Republican think is left if we continue to lose on primary culture war issues? Like these things are all tied together. The notion that we're just going to tackle the debt crisis. This gets me super fired up. It gets me super fired up. And I think ultimately there are two ways to think about politicians in general. Some politicians are almost exclusively story people. I'll give you an example. Tim Scott right now is a story politician. His story is I grew up poor in South Carolina and I have bootstrapped my way up to becoming a United States senator and I feel like my story is representative of the American dream. Okay? And I'm just paraphrasing. And then there are candidates who are extreme policy guys, right? And extreme policy candidate would have been for instance, Mike Pompeo. Mike Pompeo would have come in and he would have said, here's the policies that I'm going to put in place. I would say Ron DeSantis right now is more of a policy candidate than he is a story candidate, right? He'll tell you he put out today, hey, here's how I would fix the Department of Justice and here's how I would remedy the issues that the attorney general, all those things, very policy. The most successful candidates and Paul Ryan is a policy candidate, right? The most successful candidates are able to twin story and policy and that's how you win. When you say I'm not going to get involved in cultural issues, you are basically saying, I'm a big fat loser and I have no respect for anyone who tries to do that because what they're trying to say then is I want everybody to really like me when I walk into a New York City cocktail party because I don't want them to think I'm anti-trans because I'm focused on whether a dude with a penis can become a women's champion. That's kind of icky to me. I don't really want to talk about that. I want to tell you why the corporate tax rate needs to be 24% instead of 29%. You're a loser. You're going to get your ass kicked. Now I love policy guys. If Paul Ryan wants to come in and be my treasury secretary and go with all the nerds on Wall Street and argue about what tax policy numbers should be, I have no issue with them at all. But if you put a policy guy out there, he gets run over like he's standing in front of a bulldozer or a tank. He gets flattened. That's how you lose. That's Mitt Romney. Now, I actually think that this is helpful to Trump in some ways because when Paul Ryan says I'm not a culture war guy, let's talk about the debt and poverty, which sounds like he's it sounds like something you would hear from a a think tank scholar who has no interest in doing anything other than collecting the checks from his sinicure and hiding, right? Like has no interest in actually engaging in the debates that matter for the country. But then he also went on to say that we will win as long as Trump is not the nominee. Play 22. He's got a great core support in a primary. That is what you build off of. And so it does matter. But my point is I think the electability argument is going to become more salient with with this indictment and whatever happens in the future. All the exhaustion of all the Trump baggage is going to make it easier now, I think, to make the argument to his core supporters. He's not electable. He's going to cost us the Senate again. He's going to cost us more house seats. He'll cost us the White House and we want to win. And we do want to win. So go look at one of these other great conservatives that are in the race who don't have all this baggage. I think if we nominated anybody not named Donald Trump, we're going to be Joe Biden. We nominated anyone not named Trump Clay. I think that Paul Ryan attacking Donald Trump is the best advertisement for Donald Trump. This is my concern too. There are other people who could make this case and maybe it would resonate in some ways. But Paul Ryan saying, we're going to tackle the dead and we're going to focus on what does that focus on China? What does that mean? I think this is really an easy thing for people to sometimes pivot to. Yeah, we're just going to focus on China. We're not going to buy Chinese stuff anymore. Things are going to get a lot more expensive for people in this country. What does that really even involve other than talking tough about Taiwan defense once a year or something? Yeah, and to me, all these things are interconnected, right? Because you can't win unless you can point to issues. We just had Nancy Mason. And I thought she was really good, right? She used to be a waffle house waitress and she was talking about how literally the thing that you have to do when you're a waffle house waitress is talk to people from all different backgrounds. The way that you cut through noise. And I can't believe like, I can't believe I just keep having to slam this home over and over again because people like Paul Ryan just don't get it. People understand when there is a dude who is six foot three and he's wearing a bathing suit where you can tell he has a penis and he becomes a women's champion and they raise his hand. They recognize viscerally buck. Something is wrong, right? And they may not have the time because they got kids or they got grandkids and they're running around busy all day long. But it cuts through the noise and they're like, that's BS. I don't know everything that I think about. I'm talking like I'm these people. I don't know everything that I think about tax policy. And I don't know everything that I think about what my third grader should be getting taught in school. But I know a dude, a man with a penis is not the greatest women's athlete of all time. So if you're not willing to have that fight, Buck, then you aren't connecting with the people who are going to make decisions in who's elected. It also runs away from something that's clearly very important to the Biden White House and to the Democrat party overall. A culture war, it's not like this is a one way fight. Correct. If anything, if you don't, if you get slapped in the face over and over and over again and just pretend it isn't happening, you're a wimp and you get your ass kicked. And what happens is what we've seen now, I mean, the Biden White House, they had a an LGBTQ plus at some level two, having to just say an acronym that long feels like a feels like I'm being serious. It feels like a concession. Like how many more letters can we put on there? Oh, if you forget a letter, you're being non inclusive. Like, can we just come up with an acronym is supposed to make it easier, not harder. That's the purpose of an acronym, you know, need to come up with a name for this that makes sense that anyway. But the Biden White House invited this Rose Montoya, who is a man that has grown out here and, you know, changed and gotten, you know, gotten breast augmentation. So as, you know, fake breasts and is a man with fake boobs who was standing outside the White House and on video in front of a Biden hosted event, decided to this guy just pulls out his fake boobs and makes a video of it. And is like, yeah, Pride month or something. Yeah. And now you could say, Oh, this is just one person, but I mean, this is the, these are the kind of people that the Biden White House is inviting to celebrate. This isn't just a random person. This is an influencer, a person who's meant to tell all the tell all his followers about how great Joe Biden is and all the rest of it. Right. But these are, this is the mentality. Who does that? Yeah. Can you imagine a conservative influencer under the, you know, under any Republican president shows up and it and is and is having. First of all, it's not even her boobs. It's his boobs. The whole thing is crazy. And now the Biden White House, but it's like, oh, you're being too harsh. Biden White House has condemned this. This behavior is inappropriate and disrespectful for an event at the White House, according to a spokesman and is not reflective of the event we hosted to celebrate LGBTQI plus families or the other guests. There were kids there. I mean, I think it actually is reflective book. And this goes to people say, well, I'm, well, I don't know why you're focused on trans, a drag shows. Well, because kids are going and because Biden's focused on trends. I get it. I get this is this is the response to Paul Ryan. He would say, well, I don't really care about trans direct. Okay. Would you care? And this is the argument that by the way, just steal this from me and take it and run with it. If you took Buck, you don't have kids yet. I've got kids. If I took my eight year old to a strip club, if I took my eight year old to a strip club, I would probably get charged with a crime. Justifiably, right? There are men out there listening right now who have heard stories about dads who go to strip clubs and leave their kids in the car in the parking lot. This happens every now and then, right? Dad goes into the strip club. Why does he leave his kid in the parking lot? Because a kid can't go into the strip club. Dad's not making good decisions when he leaves his kid in the parking lot. But we understand that children do not belong at strip clubs. Why did children belong at strip shows when men are dressed up pretending to be women? Like this is not a complicated situation. And there are a lot of women out there that are worried, these wine moms, they're worried that they're not going to be inclusive enough. So they've got their kids prancing around putting dollar bills and thongs of dudes pretending to be chicks. Like this is weird. Men wouldn't do this. Men don't do this, right? Men don't take their kids to strip shows because we know how inappropriate that is because it's sexualizing children. One of these moms thinking and one of the Paul Ryan's of the world thinking we say, yeah, I don't really want to get involved in this. I just want to talk about what the corporate tax rate is. You're a loser. You're going to get your ass kicked just like you did in 2012. Case anyone was wondering what Clay thinks about that. Gunners. Let go owners. Let's talk for a second here. All right. Come on over. Treat yourself to a new training device, my friends, that will improve your skills and sharpen your aim. It's called the Mantis X. It's a great tool to have at home or out of the range.

That's what Mantis X is a firearms training system that is a no ammo all electronic way to improve your shooting accuracy. It attaches to your firearm like a weapon light. Turn it on and allow it to connect to the Mantis X on your phone via Bluetooth. The Mantis X then gives you data driven real time feedback in your technique. It'll guide you through drills and courses. The end result will be better scores, better aim and better visits to the gun range. The Mantis X is a must have for every gun owner.

She is running for GOP nomination for President of the United States. Ambassador Haley, thanks for making the time. Thanks so much. It's great to be with you. So let's start if we could with your analysis of the situation. Look, I understand that you're running your own campaign and you want to talk about your own issues. We're going to ask you about some of your policies and what you'd want to do for the country. But today is a particular day. Your chief rival in the primary, the guy who's leading in the polls right now, is before or is about to be before a judge down here in Florida. What do you make of the situation of Donald Trump? And would you commit to pardoning him if it came to it if you were able to win the race? Well, first of all, I had a great relationship with President Trump and you know, what's happening is unfortunate. I think the Justice Department has handled this whole thing terribly. I mean, you can't have one standard for Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and then another standard for Republicans like Donald Trump. And we're seeing that again. And we're seeing that again with the Biden bribery recordings that have come to light. I mean, the country should never stand for that. And I think that we should all speak up and we have to be loud about that. Having said that, if the claims and the indictment are true, if they're true, then Trump was incredibly reckless with our national security and that's not okay. So now if you've got the question of a pardon, I mean, that's a very different question. I'm not going to presume President Trump's guilt. I think we all need to let this trial play out. We need to see, you know, exactly what happens. But, you know, when you look at a pardon, the issue is less about guilt and more about what's good for the country. And I think it would be terrible for the country to have a former president in prison for years because of a documents case. That's something you see in a third world country. I saw that as the United Nations. So I would be inclined in favor of a pardon. But I think it's really premature at this point when he's not even convicted of anything. Nikki Haley with us now, you're obviously running for president. Two leading candidates right now are Donald Trump. We just ask you about Trump as he gets ready for the indictment in Florida and Ron DeSantis. You have aggressively attacked Ron DeSantis for his response on Disney. What has he gotten wrong there? What would you have done differently? Well, first of all, you know, I call people out whenever I see anything. I was a governor and, you know, certainly we had to work with a lot of different companies. South Carolina is not a woke state. But, you know, you have these things. Disney, the biggest issue, look, Ron can do whatever he wants. He is the governor. But the biggest issue with this is Disney just didn't become woke overnight. They've been woke for a long time. I remember when they hit President Trump on immigration. So this is nothing new. All I'm saying is, look, if you've gone and given Disney that the largest corporate subsidies in Florida history, if you've gone and done all of these things for Disney and they are your largest employer, I just don't think you need to get into this vendetta politics where you're, you know, using taxpayer dollars for lawsuits. That's not what I would do. What I would do is call them out on what you need to call them out on. But just because they hit you doesn't mean you have to go into an all-out war with them. I mean, these companies tend to do that. We're seeing more and more woke companies. What we should do is keep pushing policy that we know is right for our people and then let the companies go and hurt themselves in the way that they criticize things. But I just think that back and forth is unfortunate for the people of Florida. But he's got a decision to make. I mean, I much rather talk about the fact that, you know, we're $31 trillion in debt. And, you know, he voted to raise the debt ceiling back in 2018. And, you know, now we're sitting in a big mess when it comes to our debt. I think we've got to take care of that. Ambassador Haley, on the issue of Trump, you mentioned a moment ago that you always had a very good relationship with them. You obviously were the US ambassador to the United Nations during Trump's first term. You know, you're running for president. So what would be different about a Haley presidency than a Trump second term? What would you do better? Or what would you do differently? Well, I've been a two-term governor that took a double digit on employment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse. I was at the UN. I didn't deal with one country. I dealt with 193. In President Trump and I differ on some things. You know, he thinks January 6 was a beautiful day. I think it was a terrible day. You know, he thinks we should stay neutral on the war with Ukraine and Russia. I think a win for Ukraine is good for America's national security. You know, he had no problem with the spending and, you know, the increase in the debt that we had. And I, as an accountant, I think that our kids are never going to forgive us for this. If we don't start seriously cutting back on the spending, stopping the borrowing and making sure we go back to pre-COVID level. Talking to former ambassador and governor Nikki Haley, Joe Biden, it appears, I think, to almost every single person listening to us right now. A lot of Democrats, Republicans and independents all overwhelmingly agree isn't physically or mentally capable of being president. Should he be the Democrat nominee in 2024, in your opinion, Nikki? And if he is, do you think that he's going to be able to finish his term in office? No, and I don't. I think this is a shadow campaign for Kamala Harris. I mean, I, when I look at it, that's who I'm running against is Kamala Harris because we can't look at Biden and see the decline that he's had in the last couple of years and honestly think that he's going to make it as president until 86 years old. I think that this is very much, they're going to keep him from debating in primary. They're going to get him to be the nominee. We don't know if he's going to actually make it through the election. If he does make it to the election, I don't think he stays long as president. And so I think, you know, I will continue to say a vote for president Biden is a vote for president Harris. And I think that's also why you're seeing them go and spend all this money trying to, you know, change her profile and make her look better than what she is. Because I think that she is going to be eventually either the nominee or the president. If it continues going down the path where Biden wins. And that's exactly why we need to be very focused and understand that we've got to have a new generational leader. We cannot lose this election again. We can't afford to lose the general election and give Biden and Kamala four years because I don't think America would recover from that. One of the big questions we've had on this show is Trump says that 2020 was a stolen election, that it was rigged. If Democrats were willing to steal and rig 2020, why would they not do the same thing in 2024? How do you look at discussing 2020, not only retrospectively, but also prospectively as it pertains to 2024? I think there were a lot of lessons that we should take from 2020. I mean, voter integrity is everything. If you have people who don't trust the election process, I mean, that can be the weakening point of any country. And so it's really important that we have integrity. I, as governor, passed voter ID in South Carolina, and I was vilified for it. But I said, if you've got to show picture ID to buy suit-a-fat, if you've got to show picture ID to get on a plane, you should have to show picture ID to protect the integrity of the election process. What we saw happened during COVID was a lot of spending of the rules. And you saw secretaries and state do things without their state legislatures. We saw mail out validings. We saw some inconsistencies there. And while I don't think that changed the results of the election, I think that should be a wake-up call to every American that we need to do everything we can to have election integrity. So I think every state in the country should at least have to do voter ID. I think we should make sure that when they're absentee ballots or any early voting, we should always have to verify signatures and make sure they are who they are. I think when ballots come in, they should be counted at the time, and everybody should get the results of the election on election day. It shouldn't have this going two weeks out. And so I don't think we should stop on fighting for election integrity. I think we still have a few states that are concerning, and I think that we have to be conscious about that. And I think we also have to understand whatever the Democrats are doing and the ways they go to get people to vote, Republicans need to do the same thing. It's about getting as many of our people out to vote as possible. And we've got to make sure that we continue to push for voter integrity in the process. We just have one more for you, Ambassador Haley. We're speaking to Ambassador Nikki Haley. She's running for the Republican nomination. What does a Haley, what would a Haley presidency look like with regard to both border security and the tens of millions of illegal immigrants who are currently in the United States? What would your approach be? What would your policy be? Well, I first of all, I went 400 miles down that border and you are not ready for what I saw. It is unthinkable what those ranchers go through when they get up in the morning and have to see if someone died while they crossed the defense or pick up whatever little kids were behind. And when I talked to sheriffs, they sat there and said they round up illegal immigrants before 7 a.m. Turn them over to Border Patrol. Border Patrol releases them until their court date years from now. And when I talked to Border Patrol and asked them about their jobs, they said, you want to know what we do? We're glorified babysitters. They don't let us do our jobs. When I was governor in South Carolina, I passed one of the toughest illegal immigration laws in the country. We did a mandatory e-verified program that required all of our businesses to prove who they were hiring, work here legally in this country. I would do a national e-verified program across the country. I would defund sanctuary cities. I would go back to remain in Mexico because no one wants to remain in Mexico. We pulled back on the provisions of Title 42. Instead of 87,000 R.S. agents going after middle America, we put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground. And instead of catch and release, we would go to catch and deport. We've got to stop the bleeding. We've got to shut down our borders. We can't have this continue to happen. 5 million illegal immigrants across the border. It's unthinkable. Nikki Haley, ambassador and governor. We appreciate you. Look forward to talking to you again soon. Thanks. Go to Nikki Haley.com. I appreciate that. Tunnel the Towers Foundation. We know how important they have been in everything that they have done. I saw Buck really great footage of their golf tournament this past weekend. It was fantastic. Really, really cool. But I want to tell you now about computers breaking. They fail. They crash as much as we rely on them to store important documents like my book man, you script or save priceless photos. They break down. In fact, you can guarantee it. The question is, are you prepared for when that happens? Whatever you have on your computer or phone, use iDrive to back it up. The company we recommend, iDrive.com. Their system, easy to download, even easier to use, most important. The data you back up is accessible when you need it most. If I didn't back up everything I've written and my computer crashed, that would be catastrophic. My new book comes out August 8th. And I thought I lost it for a little while on the computer. I bet you guys have had files like that happen before, whether it's computers, whether it's documents you've drafted. It's a sick feeling in your stomach. That's why you need iDrive.

And I just for people who did not see it, I'll set it up and then you can you can you know, knock it off the T here. But basically you tweeted that Hillary Clinton got a different standard of justice than Trump did and that she was able to get away with destroying her emails and Olberman came back at you and describe exactly what happened. Well, he said that I was hallucinating. He said that I was wrong, that she didn't take a hammer to anything and that I was hallucinating as if I were on drugs or something or high. I guess I don't even know. And then it was beautiful. It was I love Elon Musk. The community notes went in in fact check him and I fact check him with the CNN videos where they were fact checking to get it actually happened. Did Hillary Clinton and her staff take cameras to their devices or phones or iPads and they use bleach but on the server. The answer was yes and fanically yes, it actually did happen. It's called obstruction of justice. And we were able to fact check him. But also community notes on Twitter did the same thing. It was it was beautiful. Congresswoman Nate, mace, thanks for being with us. Trump is going into court today. He's doing the whole checking in. I don't they're fingerprinting him. I don't think they're doing a mug shot and then he's going to be in front of a judge going to plead not guilty to 30 plus counts here. What do you think the position of the various candidates in the Republican primary should be on this matter? The vet, Ramaswami, saying he's already committing to a part in if he were to be president. Do you think that's the right approach? And and just how do you think that everybody should be viewing this? Well, in this case, and people understand like I've had my ups and downs with Donald Trump. But when you look at this at the outset, when you look at the timing of these indictments, the first one happened the day that the oversight committee got access to the SARS reports. The second indictment happened when we got access to the 1023 showing bribery with Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden. The next one will come down when they when we released it, when the tapes get released, I guess. But when you look at this from a very high level, this is the executive branch utilizing their power, wielding their power to put away, walk away for life. Like this is a death sentence for Donald Trump to keep Joe Biden's number one political enemy from the presidency. I mean, that's at the end of the day, that's what this about. This is about because we can argue, oh, sir, my dog is going off. We can argue about how mishandling of documents, you know, but Hillary Clinton, she sets the standard with how documents are handled. And she instructed Justice, didn't get indicted. And they're indicting Donald Trump. They're arresting him and today, they're awaiting him today to keep him off the ballot in 24. At the end of the day, that's what this is about. And I don't care if you're Republican or Democrat or Independent, that's what is happening in this country today. It should not be. And I think it's egregious. I think that the other candidates need to support Donald Trump in his arraignment today. I mean, I think it's a whole other argument on how we handle documents and the Presidential Records Act and all that. But the precedent we're setting today is unwarranted. We should not be doing this, especially during a presidential election, especially to a former president, when Joe Biden got away with classified documents, Mike Pence got away with it. Hillary Clinton, like, what are we talking about here? You're just trying to do this to lock them up, put them away for jail for life. In nobody else's held to the same standard. It's crazy that this is happening in the way that it's happening. So how does this play out? 2024. You have, I think, laid out a bunch of different arguments for, hey, you've got to win back suburban women, right? And Buck and I talk about this on the show a lot, the persuadable voters. You represent a district that has persuadable voters. How does this play in your mind with those voters out there who may not be following this as intensely as most of our listeners are, and you just laid it out. I mean, clearly, two systems of justice is going on. But how do you make that appeal to these moms that are out there running around with their kids super busy every day? And they're going to look up in October and suddenly make a decision next year who to vote for. How do Republicans take back the White House? What do we have to do in your mind? I'm trying to show a path here. You got to be able, you can't just be able to speak MAGA. You've got to be able to support and speak suburban mom too. And I've tried to show a pathway to 24 in talking about the issues that women care about because at the end of the day, and I've heard from some independent voters and independent minded people that aren't supporting the former president just yet. They're supporting somebody else in the primary, but they don't like what they see happening in our country right now. They don't like what Joe Biden is doing with the executive branch wielding and weaponizing their power to throw somebody a presidential candidate a political enemy in jail. And I am slowly seeing that it's taken a while. And my instincts are that we need to show it for what it is, but also at the same time as Republicans, we have to show women that we care. We have to, while we're talking about the issues of life, we have to talk about birth control and protecting women who've been raped or girls or victims of incest, doing all the compassionate, caring things that suburban moms care about and want us talking about. And I, you know, last summer, last year in my, my race, I'm a very purple district, even though I'm South Carolina, we're along the coast, but our district was not a Republican district last summer. It was heavily, and we need Democrat on a generic ballot last summer, but we were up by almost double digits at time because I was talking about the issues that mattered to women voters, particularly highly educated suburban women, suburban moms who maybe aren't pro-life or as pro-life as I am, but they understood and respected the position I was taking that I struck out and staked out and said, I care about women and I care about life. And they were satisfied and can live with that because I'm willing to work with other people that might even disagree. And that's going to be, it's going to be a really, abortion is going to be, and women's issues are going to be very important issues to us in 24 if we want to keep the house, if we want to put this in it, and if we want to win back the White House. Congress, when before I let you go, clearly your dog, not a Hillary Clinton voter, not a fan. I'm just wondering what kind of dog? She's a havenee, her name is Liberty, and she loves freedom in the Constitution. There we go. And you can do you see with me this week, you know, marching around and taking votes if we get to vote today. She's around with us up here on the Hill this week. Two things in your background that I want you to tell our audience who may not know you, Nancy, you worked as a Waffle House waitress. I'm wondering what the best Waffle House story you have. Second part of this. So think, you can think on that for a second part on this. You were, I believe, the first female graduate or among the first female graduates from the Citadel. Would you, it's a fabulous school in South Carolina. Would you have ever believed, I'm curious, when you were in school at Citadel, that the entire Democrat party would believe that men should be able to compete in women's athletics, and that that would be their dogma. What's crazier, your experience at Waffle House as a waitress or the Democrat perspective on athletics? Oh gosh. Well, definitely in the Democrat perspective on athletics, I remember, you know, I'm a high school dropout. A dropout of the school is 17. My father's retired army general. I said, if you're going to stop going to school, you got to start going to work. Definitely, I took up the job at the Waffle House. I will tell you my favorite stories at the Waffle House, when I was on the morning shift, and the guys that were coming off their night shift at work, and their wives or their family or their kids would meet them at Waffle House for breakfast when they were getting off their shift, or the cops that would come in for a cup of coffee, as they were going to work. That community feeling and meeting real people with real stories and real lives and real jobs, that was awesome. But at the Citadel, I used to say when I graduated, I was like, I'm not a feminist. I didn't do this to be a feminist. My father's a graduate of the Citadel. I went to improve my own strength, my own potential there. I didn't go there for any other reason, but now I'm like, well gosh, conservative women are feminists now, because we want women to achieve, we don't want men to take away the achievements of women today. It's so crazy to me that this is where the conversation has gone. Now, we're the feminists. It's mind-boggling that they want to give these achievements away to men. Someone had told me in the 90s when I graduated in 99 from the Citadel. I was the first woman to graduate from there in 1999 that it would have been okay. It was 154 years where women had never been there. If a biological male somehow put a dress on, then it would be a woman who could achieve that experience. I don't think so. Not happening. We want to make sure that our women and girls are protected in their locker rooms, on the fields, and academic achievements, everything. We've never had a female president in our country. Something we want women to achieve, but not at the expense of, hey, men can take it away from you. If they decide that they're gender something different, that's not the case and shouldn't be. We want to protect women, always. Congresswoman Nancy Mase, appreciate you being with us. You're on Clan Buck. Thanks so much. Thank you.

She is running for GOP nomination for President of the United States. Ambassador Haley, thanks for making the time. Thanks so much. It's great to be with you. So let's start if we could with your analysis of the situation. Look, I understand that you're running your own campaign and you want to talk about your own issues. We're going to ask you about some of your policies and what you'd want to do for the country. But today is a particular day. Your chief rival in the primary, the guy who's leading in the polls right now, is before or is about to be before a judge down here in Florida. What do you make of the situation of Donald Trump? And would you commit to pardoning him if it came to it, if you were able to win the race? Well, first of all, I had a great relation, working relationship with President Trump. And you know, what's happening is unfortunate. I think the Justice Department has handled this whole thing terribly. I mean, you can't have one standard for Democrats like Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden and then another standard for Republicans like Donald Trump. And we're seeing that again. And we're seeing that again with the Biden-Brawberry recordings that have come to light. I mean, the country should never stand for that. And I think that we should all speak up and we have to be loud about that. Having said that, if the claims in the indictment are true, if they're true, then Trump was incredibly reckless with our national security. And that's not okay. So now if you've got the question of a pardon, I mean, that's a very different question. I'm not going to presume President Trump's guilt. I think we all need to let this trial play out. We need to see, you know, exactly what happens. But, you know, when you look at a pardon, the issue is less about guilt and more about what's good for the country. And I think it would be terrible for the country to have a former president in prison for years because of a documents case. That's something you see in a third world country. I saw that as the United Nations. So I would be inclined in favor of a pardon. But I think it's really premature at this point when he's not even been convicted of anything. Nikki Haley with us now, you're obviously running for president. Two leading candidates right now are Donald Trump. We just ask you about Trump as he gets ready for the indictment in Florida and Ron DeSantis. You have aggressively attacked Ron DeSantis for his response on Disney. What has he gotten wrong there? What would you have done differently? Well, first of all, I, you know, I call people out whenever I see anything. I was a governor and, you know, certainly we had to work with a lot of different companies. South Carolina is not a woke state. But, you know, you have these things. Disney, the biggest issue, look, Ron can do whatever he wants. He is the governor. But the biggest issue with this is Disney just didn't become woke overnight. They've been woke for a long time. I remember when they hit President Trump on immigration. So this is nothing new. All I'm saying is, look, if you've gone and given Disney the largest corporate subsidies in Florida history, if you've gone and done all of these things for Disney and they are your largest employer, I just don't think you need to get into this vendetta politics where you're, you know, using taxpayer dollars for lawsuits, that's not what I would do. What I would do is call them out on what you need to call them out on. But just because they hit you doesn't mean you have to go into an all-out war with them. I mean, these companies tend to do that. We're seeing more and more woke companies. What we should do is keep pushing policy that we know is right for our people and then let the companies go and hurt themselves in the way that they criticize things. But I just think that back and forth is unfortunate for the people of Florida. But he's got a decision to make. I mean, I much rather talk about the fact that, you know, we're $31 trillion in debt. And, you know, he voted to raise the debt ceiling back in 2018. And, you know, now we're sitting in a big mess when it comes to our debt. I think we've got to take care of that. Ambassador Haley, on the issue of Trump, you mentioned a moment ago that you always had a very good relationship with them. You obviously were the US ambassador to the United Nations during Trump's first term. You know, you're running for president. So what would be different about a Haley presidency than a Trump second term? What would you do better? Or what would you do differently? Well, I've been a two-term governor that took a double digit unemployment state and turned it into an economic powerhouse. I was at the UN. I didn't deal with one country. I dealt with 193. I mean, President Trump and I differ on some things. He thinks January 6 was a beautiful day. I think it was a terrible day. You know, he thinks we should stay neutral on the war with Ukraine and Russia. I think a win for Ukraine is good for America's national security. You know, he had no problem with the spending and, you know, the increase in the debt that we had. And I, as an accountant, I think that our kids are never going to forgive us for this. If we don't start seriously cutting back on the spending, stopping the borrowing and making sure we go back to pre-COVID level. Talking to former ambassador and governor Nikki Haley, Joe Biden, it appears, I think, to almost every single person listening to us right now, a lot of Democrats, Republicans and independents all overwhelmingly agree isn't physically or mentally capable of being president. Should he be the Democrat nominee in 2024 in your opinion, Nikki? And if he is, do you think that he's going to be able to finish his term in office? No, and I don't. I think this is a shadow campaign for Kamala Harris. I mean, I, when I look at it, that's who I'm running against, is Kamala Harris because we can't look at Biden and see the decline that he's had in the last couple of years and honestly think that he's going to make it as president until 86 years old. I think that this is very much they're going to keep him from debating in primary. They're going to get him to be the nominee. We don't know if he's going to actually make it through the election. If he does make it to the election, I don't think he stays long as president. And so I think, I will continue to say a vote for president Biden as a vote for president Harris. And I think that's also why you're seeing them go and spend all this money trying to change her profile and make her look better than what she is. It's because I think that she is going to be eventually either the nominee or the president. If it continues going down the path where Biden wins, and that's exactly why we need to be very focused and understand that we've got to have a new generational leader. We cannot lose this election again. We can't afford to lose the general election and give Biden and Kamala four years because I don't think America would recover from that. One of the big questions we've had on this show is Trump says that 2020 was a stolen election, that it was rigged. If Democrats were willing to steal and rig 2020, why would they not do the same thing in 2024? How do you look at discussing 2020, not only retrospectively, but also prospectively as it pertains to 2024? I think there were a lot of lessons that we should take from 2020. I mean, voter integrity is everything. If you have people who don't trust the election process, I mean, that can be the weakening point of any country. And so it's really important that we have integrity. I, as governor, passed voter ID in South Carolina, and I was vilified for it. But I said, if you've got to show picture ID to buy suit-of-it, if you've got to show picture ID to get on a plane, you should have to show picture ID to protect the integrity of the election process. What we saw happened during COVID was a lot of spending of the rules. And you saw secretaries and state do things without their state legislatures. We saw mail out validings. We saw some inconsistencies there. And while I don't think that changed the results of the election, I think that should be a wake-up call to every American that we need to do everything we can to have election integrity. So I think every state in the country should at least have to do voter ID. I think we should make sure that when they're absentee ballots or any early voting, we should always have to verify signatures and make sure they are who they are. I think when ballots come in, they should be counted at the time, and everybody should get the results of the election on election day. It shouldn't have this going two weeks out. And so I don't think we should stop on fighting for election integrity. I think we still have a few states that are concerning. And I think that we have to be conscious about that. And I think we also have to understand that whatever the Democrats are doing and the ways they go to get people to vote, Republicans need to do the same thing. It's about getting as many of our people out to vote as possible. And we've got to make sure that we continue to push for voter integrity in the process. We just have one more for you, Ambassador Haley. We're speaking to Ambassador Nikki Haley. She's running for the Republican nomination. What does a Haley, what would a Haley presidency look like with regard to both border security and the tens of millions of illegal immigrants who were currently in the United States? What would your approach be? What would your policy be? Well, I first of all, I went 400 miles down that border and you are not ready for what I saw. It is unthinkable what those ranchers go through when they get up in the morning and have to see if someone died while they crossed the fence or pick up whatever little kids were behind. And when I talked to sheriffs, they sat there and said they round up illegal immigrants before 7am, turn them over to Border Patrol. Border Patrol releases them until their court date years from now. And when I talked to Border Patrol and asked them about their jobs, they said, you want to know what we do? We're glorified babysitters. They don't let us do our jobs. When I was governor in South Carolina, I passed one of the toughest illegal immigration laws in the country. We did a mandatory e-barrefied program that required all of our businesses to prove who they were hiring. We're here legally in this country. I would do a national e-barrefied program across the country. I would defund sanctuary cities. I would go back to remain in Mexico because no one wants to remain in Mexico. We pulled back on the provisions of Title 42 instead of 87,000 IRS agents. Going after middle America, we put 25,000 Border Patrol and ICE agents on the ground. And instead of catching release, we would go to catch and deport. We've got to stop the bleeding. We've got to shut down our borders. We can't have this continue to happen. 5 million illegal immigrants across the border. It's unthinkable. Nikki Haley, ambassador and governor. We appreciate you. Look forward to talking to you again soon. Thanks. Go to Nikki Haley.com. Appreciate that. Tunnel the Towers Foundation. We know how important they have been in everything that they have done. I saw Buck really great footage of their golf tournament this past weekend. It was fantastic. Really, really cool. But I want to tell you now about computers breaking. They fail. They crash as much as we rely on them to store important documents like my book man, you script, or save priceless photos. They break down. In fact, you can guarantee it. The question is, are you prepared for when that happens? Whatever you have on your computer or phone, use iDrive to back it up. The company we recommend, iDrive.com. Their system, easy to download, even easier to use, most important. The data you back up is accessible when you need it most. If I didn't back up everything I've written and my computer crashed, that would be catastrophic. My new book comes out August 8th. And I thought I lost it for a little while on the computer. I bet you guys have had files like that happen before, whether it's computers, whether it's documents you've drafted. It's a sick feeling in your stomach. That's why you need iDrive.
