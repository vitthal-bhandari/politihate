    "text": " Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragansales. We have Mr. Glenn Beck back with us, back from CPAC. Yes, yes. Yes. With some observations on CPAC today. Yes. All right. Is that your top story? Yeah. Yeah. The things that I learned at CPAC. Okay. All right. Still. I guess I'll go with the vote on the national emergency on the border. Okay. Andrew. What are the most partisan counties in America? We're going to talk about that. All right. I can't wait to find out about that. But first we want to thank our sponsor, RityaZone. So I know, you say you used to be fat, blah, blah, blah, you're not anymore. Okay, cool. I love doing that. I just love doing that. Look, see, because you get that face. And the great thing is I'm not married to her. I don't have to do that. Okay. Well, I'm going to call Tanya. I don't know. Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. But in all seriousness, if you are trying to lose the extra bit of weight and you just can't seem to figure out a way to get it off, might I suggest RityaZone? Try it and see if it works for you. The folks at RityaZone, it's not like a bunch of crazy chemicals that they put into a pill and you take it and you're jittery all day. It's just, it contains OEA, which stands for something that I can't actually pronounce. It's this really long word. But it's no. It's not cocaine. Speed. No, it's meth. But it's the good molecule in olive oil that helps boost your metabolism and reduce your appetite. I use it to maintain my weight. It works like a charm for me. Try it and see if it works for you. Go to RityaZone.com. Use promo code theblaze. It gets 30% off of a three month supply. That is RIDUZONE.com for you podcast listeners. Glenn, what did you learn at CPAC? I learned that the state of the republic is more fragile than I thought. Not as unified as I had hoped. I was impressed by the number of people that were there. I was impressed by the age that was there. About half of the 9,000, 10,000 people that were there were around the age of 25. I thought that was good. However, I asked over and over and over again, what are the two things that we have to take care of? It's the two things that we can only take care of. The Washington is not going to take care of. That is abortion. If I heard it once, I heard it a thousand times. When I'm talking about abortion anymore, Glenn, we're now talking about infanticide. Heard that over and over again. The second thing, socialism. When I said, how do we affect socialism, the answer for 25 year olds was, I don't think you're going to. Everybody loves it. Everybody thinks it's neat and no one knows what they're talking about. They said, we have flushed this generation away. This generation, the millennials, they all think it's neat. They all don't know what it is. They said no one's going to be listening to the talking heads on television. They're not relating to anyone on television. Ben Shapiro, Stephen Crowder, Ali, that's it. That's it. Who is teaching about socialism? That kind of worried me because as we've been talking the last few weeks, if the economy goes into a nosedive, what was that poll today? 41% of the American people are for socialism, wasn't that it? Do you remember? Sure, which poll that one. We read it on the air today. 39% of the American people don't know what the definition of socialism is. Yes. But it's a frighteningly high number of the people who are like, I'm cool with socialism, but they don't know what it means. Sharing, right, Glenn? Isn't that the definition of socialism? Just being in a nice person on a government level? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, the Democratic socialists have done a really good job. You've got to tip the hat to them for creating a message that does make it about sharing and about equality, which I think was something that you addressed in your speech. Yeah, we just talked about it on the show here's a few minutes ago. It's equality of outcomes. Well, there is no fairness in equality of outcomes. And that's what we really have to preach to our kids at home is, you know, show them, okay, you and your sister went out for Halloween. Great. I'm going to take all of the candy. I'm going to take 40% of it, and then I'm going to make sure that your sister, who's younger than you are, has exactly the same number. But mom, I went to more doors. Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. It's equality. That's not fair. It's not fair. To be really accurate, you also need to lose a lot of the candy that you take from your kid. Yes. And then like just randomly, like, I don't know, try and turn it into corn or something weird like that. It is truly amazing, though, how this younger generation, you know, they're thriving right now from capitalism. They're thriving off of the capitalist society that we have created. And in this backwards world, still think that they're so oppressed and, you know, they have their latest iPhone while they're talking about, you know, socialism is good. I've never seen an easier case to make the capitalism in my entire life than right now. Yeah. And yet you don't hear it. You know, Brian Cranston did a movie about a blacklisted Hollywood writer. I can't think of that stupid. No. Something with it. It's driving me crazy. Trump, Trump, oh, Trump, oh, thank you. Thank you, Trump, oh, I knew there was a bee there this morning. So Trump, oh, and there's a part where he's a, you know, he's a communist and he's explaining to his daughter who doesn't understand like, why is my area of communist? And he has a sandwich and he legitimately gives almost the exact same example. Except he says in the most nicest way. It's like, I have a sandwich. Would you like to give, could I give you half of the sandwich? And she's like, well, yeah, that would be great. Well, why don't you just get a job? That's capitalism. Get a job. Earn the sandwich. Or you could be nice and give the sandwich. That's socialism. It's like, that is like not socialism at all. But I mean, you're talking to a group of people who up until about their mid 20s were not alive during Soviet communism. And you're up to the upper 20s before they could even remember it. But here's the good news, I think, is that it's already decaying and already falling apart on itself. When you look at the people who say transgender, and here's the thing, justice and fairness do come out of capitalism, okay? Not equality, but justice and fairness. So when people say, look at this transgender person, they just want to play baseball, okay, will the fairness in all of us say, you know what? Let's be just, let's let that person play baseball and they can play on the boys team and everything else. But then that's equality as well. And this is where it breaks down. Capitalism will not treat that person as an equal because they are not equal. If it's a girls softball team and you're a boy, nope, nope, we can all be. Thank you for thinking that I would be competitive on girls softball team. We could all be nice about it and we can all be want fairness, but you're not going to get equality. Instead, what they do is they put you on that team and now all the girls are like, he pretends he's a man and he's really a girl and he can't play worse salt. Can you give us some other transgender besides Andrew? I get that a lot. No, but that's what's happened to us. We're seeing it now with the sports, the girls, their instinct is to be fair. But once that fairness turns around and it's no longer fair to them, well, wait a minute, wait a minute, how do we be fair to both? Can't. Well, there was a there was a female, I believe this was on the blaze, the news story, there was a female high school sprinter and she was beat in the championship and she was ranked third and the top two people who won were both transgender athletes and she spoke out and said, I'm happy for them that they have the courage to be who they want to be, but it's wrong. Right. So now what do you do? Now what do you do? Socialism would say nothing. Well, no, but that doesn't work. I think it's starting to come apart because people are starting to see the fruits of it. I mean, you could change everyone in college's point of view immediately. If you said everybody who gets an A is now going to get a C and everyone who had an F gets a C, we're just redistributing everybody gets a C. You would see the people in college go crazy because they know merit matters. So is that the solution then, do you think? Because you said that these young people are like, we can't do anything about it. Is that the solution is just to let them start seeing the fruits of this? I don't think we can let them see the fruits of it because it gets too ugly too fast. We are on the edge. If this economy goes down with Donald Trump in office, he's got to get 11% more people really in his column or he'll lose. If he loses to a democratic socialist and they lose the house and the Senate, what do you think is going to happen? That new Green Deal is going to be passed and that is a fundamental change in the economy. I mean, I love inequality. I think it's wonderful. If you have merit, you must have inequality. It's just true. If you want to get rid of inequality, you must get rid of merit as a measure. And I don't think that's a good thing. I mean, we also, by virtue, the Declaration of Independence, the right to pursue happiness, I mean, I don't have the same happiness as all of you do. I have no desire to work 70 hours a week as a financial stockbroker. I have friends that do, that they enjoy doing that and they getting a lot more money is more important than them. I didn't want to do that. Very happy with my job right now, by the way. But where I'd leave here, I'd be like, well, I'm going to try and do 30 hours a week or make less. And I have that ability within our system because within our system, you get to determine what's the extent of money you want to earn and all kind of thing. That's pushed all together. Nope, we're all going to have the same thing. That's the thing when it comes to women and their, and their, their pays. If you look at, if you look at women totally and you see what they choose, they generally choose to go home, have children, they are not generally speaking, the ones on the treadmill that are going 80 hours a week and are trying to put food on the table and have this big long career. Some choose that and they should be paid equally for the equal amount of work and what they're doing. But if you're, if you're looking at, well, you're a male, you're a female, well, okay, we should treat you equally. But the minute he starts pulling ahead because you have different priorities in your life, then it shouldn't be equal anymore. There's no equal outcome on that. Stu, I want to move on to the national emergency at the border. Yeah, I touched around doing a Hickenlooper mania or Inslee. It's crazy. Or Inslee Palooza. I could have done that as well. Neither, I just decided we have a lot of time to talk horse race stuff. So let's do this emergency declaration thing. It's interesting. Grandpa came out and said, look, I believe there is a real problem on the border. And I've talked to the president about it. I support him and his border security actions. But I can't give any more power to the executive branch. I don't think he should be the power the persons are. It's not his. So he will be voting against Trump for the bill that would stop this national emergency. That vote puts the Senate over the line. So they will likely, unless something changes, reject this emergency. And it will go up to Trump who will then veto it. It's going to be interesting to see now. Go ahead. Did Mike Lee still on the fence? He's not announced his vote. I do fully expect him to vote the same way. I think I'd hope so. Yeah. And there will be others. You have these different lines. No one wants to be the deciding vote. So the first line is, let's all, the first one is like Susan Collins and Tom Tillis all rushed out to get their vote out there first. Because there's three votes, the best gold vote slots, or the ones you get out there before it overturns. You only get to 50. So there's three slots there. The first three that get out there aren't the deciding vote to overturn Trump and they could take a principled stand. Then you need someone really brave who has some principled background. Rand Paul was the person in this case who takes the 51st vote. Now it's going to be rejected. Now you have room for a lot of other people to jump on in and take their principled stance without hurting Trump because they have to get to 67 votes to overturn this veto. They will not get there. I expect it to be somewhere between maybe 57 and 61. I do think you'll get Mike Lee and Ted Cruz. You'll also get some people from purple states like a Corey Gardner who will be able to kind of step in and say, well, the border is important, but I get to take this stand and I can say to my voters later on that I rejected Trump. This is a very cynical reading of this, but I do think it's pretty much what's going on. I think all of the senators, all of them, are uncomfortable with the way that this is being done. But most of them are not going to step up. The other thing too is if they did somehow get to over 67 votes, it's a little unclear, but it's not exactly clear that they would even have to take it up to overturn the veto. So if they got to let's say 70 votes, then McConnell could just not call a vote on this particular bill to overturn it and it wouldn't get overturned anyway. So this is all sort of a ridiculous, ridiculous act. And it's left a bunch of Republicans in impossible positions. We've heard a lot of people have said, and Ted Cruz mentions in this to you a little bit when he was on the air with you at CPAC, and Obentio Piero kind of said the same thing, which is kind of like a way to say to Trump, look, don't do the emergency thing, you're setting a terrible precedent, it's probably not unconstitutional. So instead redirect funds through these already existing processes, and you can get just as much or more as you're going to get from the emergency anyway, and you can just build the wall. Now, of course, if that were real, why wouldn't he just start there? Why is he going to ask Nancy Pelosi's permission to get this money if he could just do it? I think everybody knows it's not a good idea if he starts doing these things. And even with the current way that some Republicans are arguing to do this, one of the situations is they'll say, okay, well, there's money allocated in the defense budget for, I believe it's housing for military people, and they've already started to build the housing. Well, they could take the money away from that and they can build the wall. Now, of course, no sensible politician would take money away from housing for the military. That would be crazy. So what they'll do is after they move the money from the housing from the military over to the wall, they'll do a new bill that will just pass the housing to the military money, which of course no one can vote against because it's housing for the military. So that's, I mean, that is another terrible precedent to set. Oh, just pass a bunch of feel-good stuff. We'll take the money from the feel-good stuff, put it in the stuff we want to do it, and then just fill back up the covers of the feel-good stuff. Department of kittens. Yeah, exactly. None of this is a good idea. Get stuff passed through Congress if you want it done. The founders came up with a system that made it difficult for you to do that because they didn't want you to pass everything that feels good because you have 51% support or 45% support or 39% support like the wall seems to have. You have to be able to get it through. If you can't get it through, you don't get it. I know that sucks because I think the borders are really serious issue. We should have had it so many times over the years. We don't have it because it didn't go through Congress, and that's the way it's supposed to be. All right, you pretty much wrapped it up. Summed it up quite nicely. I don't want to hear from any of you people on this. That's my, that was my segment. Before we jump back into the conversation, I want to thank our sponsor, Relief Factor. Relief Factor is for people who just live in constant pain and think that that's just something that we should be doing. But it's not necessarily constant. Like, oh my gosh, I cannot live another day. It's also just like, you know, my neck always hurts, or my arms hurt, or that old. It's just getting old. Tompkins glam. That old women's softball injury. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That old thing is just flaring up on me. The old war wound. Those things, and it reduces inflammation. It doesn't string you out. It doesn't hook you on anything. It's all natural. And you can try it for three weeks, and if it doesn't work, you're not out at anything. I mean, 90 bucks. But that's, I mean, pain. Yeah, 70% of the people who try it, they try this three week quick start going to keep buying it. Why are you laughing at me? No, I'm not laughing at you. Boy, you are centered, isn't she? I just find pain funny in general. So anyway, try it out, relieffactor.com. Relieffactor.com. Go there and get your life back. All right, Andrew, talking partisan counties. We're going to talk about the most partisan counties in America. There was a fascinating, fascinating project that the Atlantic put together, where they got a bunch of quantifying data and they went through, and I'll actually, I'll throw up the picture on the full screen there. They went through all 3000 counties in America. They did a combination of polling, and they did a few of the things as well. I think they looked at households where voter registration was different between married couples and things like that. But a significant portion of it was polling. One of the big questions they asked is, would you be bothered if someone in your family married a Democrat, if you're a Republican or vice versa? And saw which states, which counties have the most partisan, prejudiced counties. And the darker you see, that is the more partisan it is. I have no idea why all of Florida is just this crazy handbag of partisanship almost all of South Carolina. And then I'd be looking like, North Carolina, fine. North Carolina, I have no idea what it counts for that. It looks like maybe Utah. And I'll say this too. I don't know, and that might also be, not knowing the data specifically in Utah, it could be that like Democrats in Utah or Republicans in Utah, it may not be across the board. The county that takes the cake though, for the most partisan prejudice county in America is Suffolk County, Massachusetts, which is where Boston is located. And that, I don't want to paint the picture that it's just sort of a radiating thing from the capital of progressivism. And there's lots of partisan conservative counties as well. But what I found really interesting about this was the predominant factors that account for partisan prejudice and assumptions that I'm right and other people are evil tends to be, if you were white, college educated, affluent. Those tend to be the things because you presumably can kind of create your own zone of people that you're dealing with in a way that other people don't have. Or you don't have to point something out. You'll notice that that is not, that is actually Colorado. It's northern Colorado and western Colorado. And the most white anywhere on the map besides the Great Lakes is Utah and southern Idaho. And if I can give you a story on this that might account for this, when Utah was going through statehood, they were all Republicans because they were all vehemently against slavery and everything else. And they had been kicked out of Missouri because they were trying to influence against slavery. So they were really hated. So they were die hard Republicans. So when Joseph Smith, or not Joseph Smith, but Brigham Young brings them into Utah and now they have to vote on statehood. He said, we're never going to get anywhere if we're all Republicans. So this half of the church, your Republicans, this half, you're now Democrats. And they did that in every meeting house all in Utah. And some people still take, I've been a Democrat since the beginning in Utah. And so they have this different look at politics to where just because where they were sitting in the aisle might mean that they were on the, it might mean that they just always voted that way. And they still kind of come together. It's amazing how much white is on that map. Which is fantastic. Hats off to Utah on that capacity. There's a lot of whites. You like that? Yeah, that was unbelievable. And that's, that is a phrase that has been uttered. Wow, a little bit of a white in Utah. You see these, I don't know all of the differences that account for the various states and counties, but I generally like it when I can be in a place where if I disagree with somebody in terms of what their party is, I'm not, I'm not viewing them as in sin. I'm viewing them as an error. I think there's a difference fundamentally between viewing people as evil bigots when you disagree with them versus being mistaken when you disagree with them. And for me, like me being a fairly dyed in the wool independent, like I really don't like partisanship because then it's just people hate, I'm always in the crosshairs. I don't get to, I don't get to sit out of the fight. So, let me be the first to say that I think that opinion is evil. Thank you. Actually, let me, let me, let me, it's really you. It's really you. That's a good point. That's a good point. So you're judging me based on character. And I'm failing based on character. Okay. All right, that's fine. And a little bit of a defense to political prejudice. I think like prejudice that like skin color and all that stuff, I've never even understood. It's so completely an aim. And I, you know, when you're talking about a political viewpoint, like that is something that's telling you something about the person, like there's a choice involved. And I like a lot of times when you're talking to someone who's more like minded, they're going to understand where you're going with something. They're not going to assume the worst about you. And I think like people, you know, like we, I think because we sit here and talk about it all the time, it's very easy for me to go talk to a Democrat about some controversial issue. Because I know where they're kind of coming from. And I know where I'm coming from. And I know where the boundaries of the debate are. And you know that for the average person though that doesn't live in diapolitics, it's just ease of life. Like if you go in there and you say something and you know what, maybe the person's not as refined on the point they're trying to make about let's say immigration, right? They might not necessarily, they know generally where they stand, but they're not going to have all the nuances. If you say something wrong and the person you're talking to takes the offense to it and it winds up blowing up into this big thing, I think people surround themselves with like-minded people because it's just, it's just easier. It's not the focus of their life. And they don't want their life to blow up because of politics. Well, we tend to think for the average person. Generally as a species gather together in packs because it's what we had to do to survive when, you know, ancient man, and it's still in, still in us. You're part of my tribe. And I want my tribe around in case there's an attack. And we all, both sides, feel like we're under attack. So it's not unusual that we would start to become very tribal. All right, back in a minute. We can all agree though that Sarah's evil, right? Yeah. I don't think so. This is really, thank you. Sexist. Sure. All right. So Mr. Andrew Heaton, you have a podcast. I do. It's called Something's Off of Andrew Heaton. Something's off of Andrew Heaton. You should check it out. It's- The title is very, it's very true to form. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's funny. Find it wherever you get to your podcast. Check it out. It's funny and thoughtful. I bring on interesting people, policy, wonks, and comedians. Tomorrow I'm bringing on Senator Mike Lee. I'm going to talk about balancing the constitution, about balancing federalism within the constitution. And today I had on Catherine Meghur word for reason, talking about Marie Kondo. So there's lots of different things that I bring on. Up next, enjoy bonus overtime content from the news and why it matters. Available exclusively for podcast listeners and Blaze TV subscribers.

She was asked to, if she would denounce Maduro and ask to comment on what was going on in Venezuela. And it's interesting the way that she spun the answer. Watch. As a Democratic socialist, I'm wondering, what are your thoughts on the Venezuelan crisis? Is that what you're going to be with the denounce the Maduro regime? Yeah. So I think that this is absolutely a complex issue. I think it's important that that we approach this very carefully. One, I am myself, just like anyone else who is absolutely concerned with the humanitarian crisis that's happening. And I think it's important that any solution that we have centers, the Venezuelan people, and centers the democracy of Venezuelan people first. I am very concerned about US interventionism in Venezuela, and I oppose it, especially when we talk about a figure like US Special Envoy, Elliot Abrams, here. I think it's he's pled guilty to several crimes related to Iran Contra. And I don't think that we should be, I am generally opposed to US interventionism as a principle, but particularly under this administration and under his leadership, I think it's a profound mistake. Keep talking for another seven minutes without shooting a point. She has a knack for just words, just keep coming out of her mouth, but they're not really making any sense. Yes, she didn't have an answer. I mean, that was no answer. No, there was no answer. It's possible she thinks the word denounce means overthrow, because you can actually not be an interventionist in their policy by saying he's not a good guy. That's actually pretty easy. I feel I could be wrong about this, but I feel like let's say that there's like a libertarian billionaire who owns like a compound slash cult in Montana and is just killing puppies everywhere. And they're like, you like that libertarian? I'd be like, no, that guy's a jerk. Yeah, that's not very good. Decrying that Rand Paul good, that guy bad. I think I could do that. Well, and I mean, it's just interesting because she won't denounce him, but she's willing to admit that there is a humanitarian crisis there, which I mean, I don't know, maybe some of that might be due to the fact that he's setting trucks on fire that have aid and food. We're just ruining the economy of one of the wealthiest countries in the world over the last 20 years who tried and true horrible socialist policies. But let's spin it to be about Trump. I'll say a Maduro's defense that those trucks were filled with kale. So I do not mind that they say, okay, we'll call that net. Yeah, that neutral trucks here is protecting its people, I think. Seriously, these are the people. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, she is their spokesperson. And I know Glenn was talking earlier about young people just thinking that socialism is so great, and they're too far gone according to the younger generation at CPAC. But I just feel like the more she talks, she's just going to make our case for us. Yeah, I mean, I think I do think that's true. I mean, people think she's good at social media, which is another way of saying she's not good in person. Right? Like, I mean, like, it's like when you're policy, right? It's like, yeah, I mean, she's had another thing the other day where she's like, I voted against this because I don't want ICE doing X, Y, and Z. And it's like, well, ICE doesn't handle that policy. So I don't know why we're bringing them up. You know, a lot of times she just doesn't know what she's talking about. Now, when you're on social media, you say something that's wrong. And six hours later, after you're told what's right, you can come up with a snarky response as if you knew the whole time on social media. And that's what they mean when they say she's good at social media. I mean, she's bad in real life. But look, I mean, she's kind of a celebrity right now. I think, you know, the one thing that I do see as a potential worry with her, generally speaking, I think she's fantastic. Like, it's this type of thing that Republicans and conservatives tried to get liberals to admit for decades that a lot of people, not all, but a lot of Democrats really have these sorts of tendencies and want these things in the long term, just can't admit it. She admits it. I think that's fantastic. And honestly, I think it's fantastic for voters to be able to hear, you know, I think it's honesty from her. And she's one of the very few, I think, honest in Congress. So I give her credit on that. I think the same feeling that we have about Ocasio-Cortez, the left had about Donald Trump. And they said, look, this guy's coming out. He's blurting all this stuff out. He's saying all these mean things. He's saying, you know, his, his, their Mexicans are rapists and all the things that Democrats said about Donald Trump. And then he won. So I don't know. Maybe she's a big enough celebrity to overwhelm all these failings. And I could be wrong. I do think where she is very clever and, and which worries me is I do think she grasps the concept of an overton window very well. I think she gets that. And so when she's like, we'll do like a 90% tax, she knows we're not going to do that. But all of a sudden the conversations from like, let's increase it by 2% or maybe decrease it. So let's, should we do 14 or 20? Yeah. And that's, there's, there's a herd effect going on right now with the whole Democratic Party where they're all moving that direction, which saddens me no end. Yeah. I have a, I think a slight distinction on, on that point is I don't think she knows that. I think the term overton. No, of course, I think what you're saying, tell correctly or wrong, I think you're describing a Qazi court has has a strategy to say 90% so that she gets 70. I think she's saying 90 thinks she wants 90. And people like Pelosi and others are appreciating the overton window move so they can get to 40 and 50. I think like they, I think there's other people in the party who are seeing her fuel as, as advantageous to what they're trying to do long term. So they can say, oh yeah, the Green New Deal is obviously a little nutty, but we can go to here and that's totally fine. That's sensible. I mean, we would never go way out there to her, but we're right here. And I think, I think she is, you know, at some level an ideologue and, and somewhat naive and thinks that she can get these things. And she maybe, who knows? And this freaking country got, I don't even know, maybe she can. But I think the, the, people who are in the power seats of the, the Democrats are going to use her fuel as long as they can take her nonsense, which might be a year. I mean, I don't think they, I don't think there's a long runway here if she could, you know, Omar is the same thing. Like she can't just keep making anti-Semitic mistakes every weekend. I get some point this is going to get old for Democrats having to deal with this. But at the moment, there's enough fuel, excitement, social media stuff going on with them that's like, okay, let's take this and move the ball as far down the field as we can. We can still seem rational compared to her. She's never going to lose her seat anyway. It doesn't matter what she says. So she, we just kind of move it back to something a little bit more rational, but still very far left. Something that the Democrats wouldn't even propose just a few years ago. Yeah. I mean, that's a great point. But I still feel like they are kind of, they're eating their own, right? They're eating each other alive. You saw that what the, the co-founder of Greenpeace tweeted at her. Oh, Patrick Moore? Yeah. So, yes. So, if we could get that first tweet, because I don't have it on my cards. So, he was responding to her tweet that was talking about, if you don't like the Green New Deal, then come up with your own ambitious on-scale proposal to address the global climate change. Until then, we're in charge and you're just shouting from the cheap seats, which is such a, like, no, you work for the people. You're not in charge. Right. I'm not in the cheap seats. I'm a freaking calculator trying to actually work stuff out. I'm one of the guy, like me and eight other people believe in math and are trying to fix these problems. Well, you morons are shouting at each other to see who can be more self-righteous. I love the premise of the question too. Like, if you can come up with an idea that's exactly the same as my idea, then go ahead. Like, well, what if we don't think that we need it? Maybe it's not that ambitious enough. Right. Yeah. But so, the co-founder of Greenpeace, Patrick Moore, tweeted back, pompous little twit. You don't have a plan to grow food for eight billion people without fossil fuels or get the food into the cities. Horses, if fossil fuels were banned, every tree in the world would be cut down for fuel for cooking and heating. You would bring about mass deaths. So, the sour green piece is now a conservative democrat. Yeah. Wow. Okay. You know what? Maybe she's going to do some good. But that's why it's so crazy. It's just like you. I mean, she's talking about the green New Deal and we're talking about how crazy radical her policies are and the co-founder of Greenpeace is like you idiot. Yeah. Well, you even know what you're talking about. I know and Patrick Moore actually has a real solution that could actually make a difference, which is nuclear power. He's been talking about it for a long time. Yeah. Very pro nuclear guy. And she doesn't want that. That's out of the green New Deal. Even though that's like the one thing we could do right now that we're actually- So, it's source of energy with no emissions and they reject it. There are a few, I will say on the left, that don't. And they're important figures. And, you know, I follow a few of them on the Twitters. But it's important to see they did a documentary about this a few years ago. I can't remember the name of it, but it was really good and it was about saying, hey, look, we, this is a massive problem climate change. Whether you think it is or not, at least it's a sensible solution and it connects not only with the left, but also the right. We like nuclear power because we don't necessarily have an import power, even though that's changed a little bit. So, you have a clean source of power. You have, you have- It's infinite. We don't ever have to worry about another meltdown in the Middle East affecting the- Where our energy comes from. And it's something that can really be developed. And you can see honesty in environmentalists when they actually embrace that. Yeah. It's a St. Thomas soul. My favorite living economist said that environmentalism is not about solutions, it's about trade-offs. And that's absolutely true. You look at that and you're like, okay, we don't want emissions. Nuclear power is a good way to- No, it's not magic. Magic would be terrific. We don't have magic. So, barring magic. It's almost magic. It's almost magic. It's almost hard creating a tiny sun that we can use to keep people from boiling water. It's as close as we're ever getting a magic. It's magic. It's magic. We have wizards. And just really quickly, this is my favorite part. He tweeted again at her and said, you're just a garden variety hypocrite like the others and you have zero expertise at any of the things you pretend to know. He is. Pretty harsh words for the woman who is going to tell you that she is the one person who is finally trying to tackle all of this climate change business. I also- So, it would be interesting. I went through the green new deal with a fair amount of- I went through all the data that they had available at the time and like, given her grasp on economics, I can't fathom that she would be the one to save the planet either. If you're understanding of the environments anywhere near you're understanding of economics, don't come in the room. Like, I'll just- I'll let the green piece guy handle it before I let you handle it. Doesn't she have a master's in economics too? I mean, it's just insanity. Boston University, she just closes doors and knock itself down. I just want to know how much she spent on her education to come out blabbing the things that she says. I don't know. I feel like you shut the- Honestly, you should shut the numbers. Because all college should be free always. Ah, great for all of your life. You want to be a student at 60? That's your constitutional right. All right. So last week for children in, I guess, I don't know if private schools do it, but in public schools it was read across America week. I don't know if your children have that. I'm a good father. I just want to say that. It's not that I have no knowledge of what you're talking about. I'm a good father. Yes. We all know still. We all know. But so, commonly, a lot of children or a lot of schools have Dr. Seuss week because it's about Dr. Seuss, right? Read Across America Day, it's Friday, and then they have this whole week of celebration. Where wacky socks. So, what they learn about reading, a lot of Dr. Seuss involved. So, a Virginia elementary school decided to celebrate transgender kids for Read Across America Day. And they had books like Heather has two mommies read to kindergarten students. So our five-year-olds were reading and are being read to about transgender issues. Andrew, you are our resident libertarian. Yeah. And give me your libertarian spin on this. Okay. Well, I mean, my overall thing is like, I'm fairly, you know, whatever gender you want to identify with, I'm fine. The state doesn't dictate your gender. Either you- I mean, biology. You were biology. It was one of the two things, but I don't want the state getting involved. I'm generally like, my disposition as an Oklahomaan is that I believe it's my etiquette to address you as you wish to be addressed as long as you're within reason. I'm not going to call you Pope. But if you want to be- if you're- what appears to me to be a male, you want to be a female, I'm happy to accommodate you. I don't know the science beyond that. Where I do get kind of concerned, I don't like it when new and glorious fields of battle open up in the culture war. I don't think that that's actually a good thing. Like, it's a different issue, but the whole kneeling thing with Colin Kaepernick. I don't like football, but I didn't- I was like, one more thing we got to fight about. When you call him Kaepernick, it's really hard to say that- Kaepernick, which is- Yes, there you go. I'm like, football was shocked. So, like, with the elementary school, I mean, I don't have kids or anything, but I don't generally want the- I would rather schools take a back seat in terms of moral instruction. I would rather than focus on, you know, whatever- learning, reading, whatever- I'm not sure what reading seems like a good thing, math. Math would be good. Math would be great. So- They don't teach that at BU. They don't even teach that at BU. So, yeah, I don't know. I mean, if it was just like if it were- basically, if they're looking for a fight, I don't like that. If it's just making people feel comfortable, if there is a kid that has something- I mean, a five-year-old though, like, is it really- is that really the proper age to be teaching our children about all of these complex adult- Probably not. I mean, like- Yeah, I mean, like- For me, I'd probably- like, I'd probably- if I had kids, I'd probably read, Jill has two mommies or whatever. I'm fine with that. In the Heat and Household, that's great. I don't know that I would want a teacher doing that though. And I don't want the teachers co-opting that parenting role that I would presumably have in this scenario where I've convinced a woman to become pregnant with me. Which is, again, a wild sci-fi- Yeah. Sort of a sort of a drama. Sort of a romp that would be, huh? So, I mean, the libertarian position, though, is right. I don't want it to be a public school at all. Like, I got that. I mean, because I think you can get into these worlds. Like, I know, you know, if you want to- you know, private school is expensive and not attainable for every person on earth, unfortunately. I think if we- if there are certain laws that I think that would- when it comes to vouchers and such, that could support a much better education system. And you know, then you could have a- you know, you could have your school where everyone's reading two mommies and you can have one- one- one- this crazy idea that a mommy and daddy- Mona-sory school. I mean, I think that, like, that variety should be something that you as a parent should be able to choose. I think- I don't want- you know, I don't like the idea of teachers at a public school wading into the culture war. Because I think a lot of times- I think, you know, because this is partially due to things that, you know, like Fox News, I mean, Bill Riley, we have him on every week and he used to do a segment all the time that was like, the culture wars. And like, that's kind of his, you know, his game. And I think a lot of times, Republicans or conservatives get kind of unfairly mentioned as the only side in that war, like the only one who's trying to make it- it's not war on Christmas, that BS stuff. Yeah, I mean, like, you two- two players in that tango. Exactly. If you're- you know, look, I think the- the right answer is really that there's not a place for sexual interaction when you're talking about children. I mean, she's- did anyone watch that Michael Jackson? Maybe five years old is too young. I think, you know, it might- if you want to make that as your choice, that's fine. However, as a matter of public policy, where a public school is doing that, that makes me feel like, you know, it's definitely not appropriate. And, you know, you can design the school that you want if you have people going to private schools and they don't have to dump thousands and thousands and thousands of tax dollars into a public school that teaches things that they don't believe so that they have to pay thousands of thousands of dollars in taxes to then pay tuition to a private school, nothing personal about this particular point. All right, I didn't realize I was going to set you up. Now I'm going to completely switch gears really quickly. Before we have to go, I want to know more about you watched the Michael Jackson documentary. I only watched clips of it. I- I- I actually did record it. I want to watch it. It's- from what I've read, I think it's going to be really hard to watch. Yeah. Because it's like, pretty like graphic and a little more information than I think I can handle. It briefly swung to where they were like, actually he didn't do anything. And I think it's now swung really hard back the other words. Like no, actually quite- Yeah. And I do find that interesting. Pat brought this up on, I think it was Friday's show and that like we are at a point now where like, it's really like a documentary is in the new trial. It's like, if you have like, if Michael Jackson was innocent after all of these things and he went through an actual court trial about these specific allegations, these guys were defending them in court. And now it's like a documentary has come out and it's completely swung. The same thing kind of happened with R. Kelly and the same thing kind of happened with Bill Cosby and the same thing. Like this is a- it's an interesting turn. I don't know that it's- it's got to hit due process and we're going to miss on some of these. I feel like we hit it. We're right on Michael Jackson. But I feel like we're going to miss on some of these and some bad things are going to come out of it. I feel like the number of retweets of a documentary is not the appropriate form of justice we should be chasing after. But so far I don't think we've missed horribly on these things. Such high standards. I know. I'm a little nervous. All right. Fridays poll, what domestic issue concerns you most? 39% of you said abortion. 28% said culture war. 22% said national debt. What percentage said paying taxes for public school and also paying tuition for private school? What was the- It was- it was like 0.5% and it was you. That was me. Okay. I had to click on that one. And then today's poll. Do you believe it's an interesting one? Do you believe the MSM narrative, the mainstream media narrative, that Republicans are more likely to be racist than Democrats? Is that- I guess that's- that is a narrative of theirs for sure. I mean, but was there like a recent story that came up that they were like- All the stories. That's the last two years of- A new poll conducted by us in the newsroom shows that Republicans- The cool thing is that progressives just don't ever talk about race. So are you interested in it? It's just not an issue to them. So like that only leaves one group that would be racist, does it not? That's a great point. That's a good point. One of my favorite things that's happened with this 2020 presidential- all of these people come- the candidates coming up was when Kamala Harris had to like explain why she married a white guy. She really let us down with that one. Yeah, no kidding. Stay in your ghetto. That's the- that is what we want. Everybody be in their own ethnic ghetto. Insane. The world is insane. That's it for us. We'll see you tomorrow. You shouldn't have heard what kind of- that was wrong. I think we all know that that. I mean, I love him. Thanks for listening to the news and why it matters.
