Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we're rolling through the Thursday edition of the program. Unlike CNN plus, we have not been canceled. We've also not lost $300 million in the space of 21 days, but we are going to continue to bring all of the fights and the battles that are taking place and matter in the world today. And this just happened and is going to turn into a big story. Florida Republican house lawmakers just approved a new congressional map. Remember yesterday, the Florida State Senate did this. So there will be four new Republican seats in the house based on this map. They also, and this is going to get a monster amount of attention. They also have stripped Disney of its special powers and they ended Disney's big tech exemption on now to the governor's desk. Ron DeSantis will be signing this. Let's talk about each of these and why they are significant. First buck. Let's talk about the congressional map. We talked yesterday. Ryan Gerdusky was fantastic. Encourage you to go listen to the podcast of him breaking all this down. But effectively, Florida has added four Republican seats, which will count out the additions that New York, Illinois and cancel out, I should say, California have tried to do to add seats to the Democratic tally. So assuming that this is upheld by the courts and all these battles, a lot of these redistricting battles end up in the courts, four more seats to Republicans. And putting that in context, we are five seats from a Republican controlled house from Kevin McCarthy taking back the gavel from Nancy Pelosi. So Florida by itself is almost flipping that. Obviously other states are making their own moves, but this is big number one for the larger national political landscape. It's one of the few times I can think of where a Republican politician anywhere has done something other than just talk a big game about pushing back on woke corporations. What corporations understand this, everybody, were really the vanguard of both BLM propaganda and of COVID lockdowns over the last two years and what corporations? Yes, they're trying to indoctrinate your kids and trans ideology and all the stuff that's going on. They support all that clearly Disney does, but they have been used and really in concert with the White House. I mean, let's understand the White House openly says we're telling Facebook to get rid of more disinformation online because then that's more, that's more powerful than any other platform of information dissemination out there. The White House is straight up using these, these corporations. The Democrat party is using companies as political weapons. So we can either sit there and say, well, we would like a neutral space where commerce and capitalism or we can say, you know what, there are going to be consequences for this too. You can go back. I've talked to people about, you know, in the ad industry about this for many, many years. I'll say, and this is before things got quite so woke. I mean, I remember I have a conversation with somebody, the big ad agency years ago, said, you know, the difference in the left and the right is the left doesn't even have to boycott. They just do enough that the companies are always looking over their shoulder, always concerned about the possibility of when was the last time the left really organized a boycott against a conservative company? They'll do it. But generally speaking, it's just the threat of that's enough to get companies to try to preempt. Think about how tilted the battlefield is in their favor and that circumstance. Now with Disney, we're seeing real action, take it and clay. If Disney doesn't like it, they can just build their own floor. Yeah. I saw you tweet that out. Um, and so that's the second part of this. This is really significant. And certainly social media has made that worse because, Buck, I've been there. You've been there, but a lot of companies haven't when suddenly you have. 500 or 1000 people angry and tweeting at you. It feels like everybody in the world, the first time you go through this cares about whatever your issue is. When the reality is for 24 hours, people are going to get fired up. There's going to be a tempest. And then that tempest almost always passes. What DeSantis has done here to Disney is let it be known that there are consequences for left wing woke Disney politics and the consequences are going to be pretty significant. And the reality is, despite what governor Jared Paulus might be trying to say in Colorado, which got some attention, oh, why don't you just move here? Yeah. Are they going to pick up Disney World and relocate it from Orlando and all of the hotels and put it in Colorado, which by the way, has awful weather where nobody is going to want to be outside. Even if they could relocate Disney, I don't think they would be picking Colorado, but they can't. They can't relocate Disney World. They've got all this land. They built all the hotels. Disney needs Florida at this point more than Florida needs Disney. And so what they have done is when Disney bought all this land back in 1969, basically the state of Florida said, Hey, you get to be judge, jury and executioner over all of the decisions that are going to be made with these tens of thousands of acres. You want to build a new lake when it comes to develop, do it, right? They don't, it's not developed. This isn't like, you know, they don't get to put somebody in prison. But, uh, but in terms of the, uh, in terms of the master plan, you want to build a new hotel, good, you want to build a, uh, a new lake, uh, to, to have right in the center of Epcot, good, you can do that. No, what reportedly, Buck, this, they also get tax abatements and all sorts of benefits from this. It's hard to know the exact dollar value of this, but there's a story in the Wall Street Journal, I believe saying it's worth tens of millions of dollars a year. Disney doesn't like to talk about it because of the benefits that they're getting. And now that's gone as soon as Rhonda Santa strokes his pen, uh, when this bill gets to him, uh, right there with the house and the Senate bill that they have passed. So when he signs this, boom, this is disappears. And so this is a different level of battle. And, and the ultimate calling card on this, the referendum on it is going to be what happens in this election in November, because if DeSantis wins by seven or eight points, and I think he probably is going to win by seven or eight points, that's going to be seen as a seismic shot with shockwave in what was considered to be such a battleground state just a few years ago. I just also have to ask why there aren't more Republican governors. I pose this question earlier on in the week who see what's going on in Florida, who see, look, let's be honest, there've been articles written about this. People in saying leadership of the Republican party right now, or I should say the, the sense of the Republican leadership's base of power has moved a bit from Texas, which has been the stalwart red state that people felt like they could go to for freedom to Florida over the course of the pandemic. Now, Texas is still great and there's still a lot of obviously, you know, fantastic stuff going on there as a state, even with Governor Abbott in charge. But you have to wonder why aren't more of them seeing what's going on and following here? Yeah. Um, because it's not like Ron, you know, think about what could have happened. He could have gone against the consensus on COVID and he could have picked some of these battles and been politically destroyed over them. Yes. He could have, if, if they had a much higher percentage of not just COVID cases, but COVID fatalities per capita than comparable states, if they had had, you know, economic ruination because they wouldn't go along with the wokeness, if, you know, 80% of Floridians or whatever had had, had a dis approved of the parental rights bill, he keeps taking risks. He keeps, he keeps throwing it out there and hitting home runs. And you wonder why aren't these other Republican governors, some of whom probably listened to their show or at least their staffs do following in his footsteps, corporate money for their campaigns. I mean, I really don't know. Are they just, they don't have the stomach for the fight? Yeah. They don't have the stomach for the fight. Because it's hard buck. Initially, the natural reaction among, I think, Republican politicians is when the main stream media comes for you, you curl up in the fetal position and hope they leave. And what DeSantis is natural instincts, and I think this is Trumpian in nature. And that's where I think the most lasting legacy of Trump may well be is so many Republican politicians were terrified when the New York Times or CNN or the Washington Post or MSNBC came for them. And they would beg for forgiveness and or run from whatever policy was getting a lot of attention. What Trump did was say, no, I'm going to own it. And DeSantis is, I believe, a particularly politically, a droid and skilled individual who has, along with his staff, correctly diagnosed that most of the outrage that exists in this country is not representative of the masses. And so if you just withstand a little bit of outrage and own your opinion, most of the time it fades, they've gotten used to left wing has to be enabled to bully people into doing exactly what they want. And when you don't do it, you suddenly realize there ain't a lot of power behind the punch of the left wing when you stare them down. It's a lesson that everybody should be taken. Certainly it's one that we've been trying to instill in people with this show by saying exactly what we believe in owning it, no matter what the reaction is.

We appreciate you hanging with us. We have a fantastic guest and expert in fact to join us now. Dr. Nicole Sapphire, a full time practicing physician here in the New York City area where I am. She's also a Fox News contributor and best selling author of Make America Healthy Again and Panic Attack playing politics with science and the fight against COVID-19. Dr. Sapphire, first time on the show. Thanks so much. Hey, thanks for having me. Looking forward to it. So what is what is your feeling on the the back and forth now on the plain mask band data and also what is it with all these epidemiologists who are wearing loosely draped cloth masks on their faces in the airport and thinking that it's some kind of protest? Yeah, you know, I mean, it's really, I mean, we laugh about it because it is such a disgrace what is happening right now in the back and forth. But I mean, it's really quite devastating in terms of public health and just our overall trust of our public health entities. You know, pre COVID, I would say that I was a huge supporter and proponent of the CDC and FDA. And unfortunately, as we have seen throughout the course of the last two years, the political nonsense that's happened. You know, the big issue with masking, it's devices, divisive, undoubtedly. But at the end of the day, it really should just be scientific. It's not about being Republican or Democrat or, you know, too cautious or not cautious enough. But the bottom line is we have failed as a scientific community to prove or really disprove that mass work. And just like people who are refusing to fly when there was a mask mandate, the people who are now refusing not to fly because the mandate's been removed. They're both being dramatic and certainly not science driven. Dr. Sapphire, first of all, thanks for coming on this clay. I wish we could go back in time and sort of make public health decisions more rationally. One of the things that will happen, whether we like it or not, is 20 years from now, there will be big, massively best-selling books likely to be written about the way and beyond, certainly, the way we responded to COVID. What do you think those books will be saying about many of the choices we made, whether it was masking, whether it was taking kids out of school, whether it was social distancing? In your mind, and I know it's always hard to judge in the middle of historical moments, but is history going to say, hey, you know what, the United States, they're a really good job responding to COVID? Or for the most part, are we going to say most of the things that we were prescribed to do didn't really have that much of an impact? Well, as someone who actually wrote a book about the politicization of science, and the way that we handled it, in fact, let me give you before you answer. Let me go ahead and tell you and everyone out there listening all about this book. It's called Make America Healthy Again, Panic Attack, Playing Politics with Science in the Fight Against COVID-19. Historically, we say what? So, well, Make America Healthy Again, just, you know, was a pre-COVID book, Panic Attack. Yes. And during COVID, we had wrote about it, and it's the exact same issues that we're dealing with. What we have failed to do from an American public health standpoint is we failed to prove that a lot of our measures actually worked. And actually, you know, looking back retrospectively, when it came to lockdowns and keeping kids out of schools, all of those, we have shown that there was more damage than there's actually benefit. And maybe we could have excused some of these measures that were done and hasted in the first three months, in six months, when there was an unknown. When we didn't know much about the virus, we didn't have the ability to test for it. We certainly didn't know how to treat it. In fact, some of our treatments turned out to make things worse, and we didn't have vaccine for it. Now fast forward to two years in. That excuse is no longer there anymore. We have over 95% of our country has some level of immunity. Boosters, tests, treatments are all readily available. Now is the time that we should be having more freedom and tailor our actions to individual risk. These blanket universal mandates have no place in the United States anymore. And the biggest fumble, in my opinion, when it comes to how we responded to this pandemic, is how we are still continuing to fight to keep some of these mandates, which have proven over and over again that they did not work. Dr. Sapphire, one of the troubling realities of the pandemic this whole time and in terms of the conversation about it and the policy discussions has been the number of doctors that a client I both had this experience, who reach out or have been reaching out now, going on two years saying, I know that this policy is counterproductive, or I know that what Fauci has said about this is untrue. But I don't want to lose my medical license. All right, I don't want to have my peers or even my hospital, let's say, if you have admitting privileges, turn against me publicly. Do you feel like that is changing? Because I'm surprised at how few doctors are willing to come out now. And obviously you do, but how few doctors willing to come out and say, a lot of the medical establishment was wrong, owes an apology to the American people and needs to come clean about what was right and what was it? Well, more than two thirds of physicians in the United States are employed by someone. And that person that employed them tends to be a large entity full of administrators who really cowtown to a lot of political movements. And unfortunately, we did allow a lot of political intervening in health care from when they restricted the elective surgeries in the beginning, which resulted in people dying, as well as, you know, stuff that we've seen with the Affordable Care Act, which have allowed them to just completely destroy, in my opinion, the American health care system. What unfortunately has happened that is physicians, all of a sudden, were told that they weren't allowed to prescribe certain things, go way back when to hydroxychloroquine, because that became so politicized. But it wasn't so outlandish to think that someone may try hydroxychloroquine for this new illness that we had no means of treating. We had pre-existing data that hydroxychloroquine did have some antiviral effect and actually had been studied in the original SARS virus. So for people to say, we have no way to treat this virus, maybe we just try them with a longstanding, well-known hydroxychloroquine, whether it works or not, we don't know yet. But there's always a risk versus benefit. But because President Trump touted it, all of a sudden, physicians were told you are not allowed to prescribe that medication. Ultimately, the data showed that that medication really didn't, you know, work as well as many of the other treatments that we have now for COVID-19. But at the beginning, we could have at least tried. And now, I mean, we dealt with that with the Ibramectin. And also, we're dealing with it, look at New York and New Jersey, where the governors of the states have said healthcare workers have to be boosted. Forget just the vaccine mandates. They have booster mandates for healthcare workers. And if there's a medical exemption where the healthcare worker doesn't get the booster, they have to be tested weekly. Well, I can tell you what's happening right now in these healthcare institutions. You have non-boosted employees who are having to cover shifts for boosted employees who have COVID. So as soon as the vaccines and boosters stopped preventing infection, and their main role was to decrease severe illness and prevent people from being hospitalized, these mandates should have gone out the window. But unfortunately, they couldn't let it go and they've continued to push them. And we have seen healthcare workers as well as first responders lose their job over anti-science mandates. Dr. Sapphire, one of the moments when you mentioned early on, maybe in March and April, people are listening to the quote unquote experts for a lot of people listening to us right now, that ended when all of these same experts said, yes, we need to have lockdowns. Yes, we need to have people social distancing. And then they simultaneously endorsed all of the BLM protests. After being furious at people for protesting lockdowns, they then came out and said, well, yeah, COVID's going on, but we don't have any issue with hundreds of thousands of people marching close together all throughout the streets of America after they had locked down so many people. That was, I think, for many people, the beginning of this being super political in nature. Will we ever trust in this country, people listening and the nation as a whole, the quote unquote public health experts again? I think, unfortunately, we are going to have a very long road to get back, just a monochoma of the public health trust. And I blame that solely, to be honest, on the CDC and a lot of the, you know, advisors to the president because they had one role. They really had one job in the last couple of years. Their job wasn't to create policy or be spokespersons for the United States or any of that. What their job was to do was to collect data and put forth good trials to determine what we can do as a nation and as individuals to lessen our individual and collective risk of COVID-19. But they didn't do that. Unfortunately, none of the decisions that have been made have been data driven at all. You're talking about the Black Lives Matters protest. Well, what about the fact that people, they started shutting everything down and they started locking playgrounds. So children couldn't even go play outside. And yet they had to quickly start opening bars and restaurants because, well, that was going to be allowed, but children still weren't allowed to go on playgrounds. And churches weren't allowed to go because you couldn't sing. I mean, unfortunately, there was, there was far too much hypocrisy that went on. None of it was data driven. And here we are over two years into it. And the CDC still has zero studies to even reference for the whole airplane mask mandate debacle that we're dealing with. And that's because they didn't run any. Imagine if they did. They could have proven or disproven that the mandates work or didn't work. And a judge wouldn't need to be striking this down. We wouldn't have to be going and appealing. It would have fallen to the whole scientific consensus, but they didn't do that. They didn't do that. They had one job and they failed. And if I were to fail 100% in my job, I would be fired. Why they're not fired. I don't know. Speaking of Dr. Nicole Sapphire, you all should go check out her books. She's got two of them out there, make America healthy again and panic attack, playing politics with science in the fight against COVID-19. Dr. Sapphire, one more for you here. Where do you think we're going to be as a country when it comes to COVID policy? I mean, I think we're going to have probably COVID cases in the fall, right? I don't think anyone believes it's going away entirely, but going into the election. What do you think the position of the more extreme mitigation, masking, lockdown, voices in the medical and let's be honest, the democratic community, what are they going to be saying then? It's your guess is as good as mine. Sometimes I can't understand what's even coming out of the president and vice president's mouth as is right now. But what I can tell you when it comes to, you know, the near future with COVID-19, these blanket harsh restrictions as it currently stands with the current variants. And the wide availability of testing and boosters and treatments, it does not seem that any of these universal restrictions have any place in our future public health policies. I think that it needs to come down to individual risk assessments and people who are considered higher risk should talk to their physicians, get boosters, wear good quality, high quality masks when they are in congregated indoor settings. But for the rest of the population, especially those with hybrid immunity where they've been vaccinated or boosted and have already recovered from COVID-19, there's ample data that demonstrates that that's very strong protection. And if you want to get stronger protection, get a booster. It's all risk benefit. We cannot live our lives without risk. If we spend every day avoiding risk, we are risking not living our lives. Life is not about getting to zero risk. That's why we are able to get into cars every day. That's why we eat fatty food sometimes or I have an Oreo at night. Everything comes with risk, but that is what life is all about. And when it comes to COVID-19, it is not about the entire population. It is about determining what your individual risk is.

This showdown in Florida between Ron DeSantis and the activist Woke left, in this case, through the prism of Disney, which is pretty remarkable when you think about it. It's escalating, folks. This is now a major national story because here's what we saw in the most recent election, the off-year election that occurred in Virginia. Parents mobilizing and first of all, seeing what was being taught to their kids, seeing what the school boards and what the school administrators and unions really favor, which is just the interest of adults over the children and also wokeness and indoctrination. That created a surge that delivered a huge win to Governor Glenn Youngkin and almost delivered a governor's ship. The governor's mansion, the state of New Jersey to a Republican, which would have been completely mind-blowing in politics given the numbers the registration advantage Democrats have there. But parents who are mobilized around the idea of what their children are learning, what the school system is doing to their kids. It's a big issue. Democrats thought that they would regain the moral high ground by picking this fight over the, I don't even like to say, I don't like to say the don't say gay bill because that's propaganda. It's called the Parental Rights and Education Law. It was signed. It is law now. But they got to rename and the whole media, you saw this working real time. They got to rename it. And what happened was a remarkable reversal because of exactly what Clay and I were just talking about with you, which is that Ron DeSantis doesn't get punched in the face and run away and say, I'm sorry, Libs, please don't be mean to me. You take a swing at Ron, he's going to take a swing back, politically speaking. And he fought back on this by telling people, read the bill. Remember those press conferences he would have when they would say, why do you have a bill that says don't say gay? He'd say, is that in the bill? Read the bill. What is in the text? What does the polling say about the bill? Now, of course, now it's a law. And the more we find out about the Democrat position on this, the activist left position on this, the more trouble I think it's causing for them politically and they know that the time is, you know, that the time is flying here. We're going to be at that midterm election soon. And angry parents are not good for the Democrat party right now. Gen Psaki was on the, I guess that is this going to be like an NFT or some kind of a collector's item, all the interviews that have been on CNN plus because, you know, limited edition. Let's be honest. They're very much limited. If you're just getting in your car, CNN plus has been canceled. It's a glorious day for anybody who believes in truth. But that is the joke there. Because I think some people are like, what already yet? 21 days at last. It was, it turned out to be almost like, you know, a ban that came together for a few last live performances that also happened to be their only performances. Yes. But that's what CNN plus was here is Gen Psaki. When she's, and I want to listen closely, we're going to play this whole sound. But if you listen closely to the White House press secretary who just a couple of days ago was was literally sobbing. I mean, not not exaggerating, sobbing in an interview about how mean the parental rights and education bill is. They say they don't want to teach your kids this stuff. Listen to what the White House press secretary claims. The law is not about teaching sex education. It's about teaching about gender identity. So what do you do if a kid in one of these elementary schools says, what about Sally? Sally has two moms or I'm not sure if I'm a girl or a boy. I mean, these are kids who are experiencing these moments in their lives. I also think that these are not, there's not a big record of there being either sex education or extensive gender identity education in these schools. And this is creating a problem or a political cudgel about an issue that I don't think exists. Well, first of all, she just said that the issue exists. Okay. So you can't say, what do you say to a boy or girl who asks whether they are a boy or girl? I have an answer for you. As someone who has had three kids through kindergarten and currently has a first grader, you tell them boys have penises, girls have vaginas, go to the bathroom of your gender, you are one or the other. This is not a complicated question. Anybody who has ever had a five year old has had to say, hey, boys, go to the boys bathroom, girls, go to the girls bathroom. We don't need to confuse the gender of a freaking kindergartner. Okay. So the fact that she says this isn't an issue like within 30 seconds of saying, what do you say when this occurs? The answer is, you are not in the business of telling someone that they are a different gender than what their biology purports to show when they are kindergartners, first graders, second graders and third graders. And the idea block, I would be furious if my first grader came home and said, hey, today at school, one of the teachers said that because I had a pink shirt on today, then I must be a girl and they sent me to the girls bathroom. I mean, this is crazy talk. We know what boys and girls are. Like that there was that great meme of Amy Coney Barrett. You know, when we had just had the Katanji Brown Jackson hearings, she couldn't answer what a woman was. And there was that member Amy Coney Barrett memorably had like a note card in front of her. And there was a meme where it just said, boys have penises, girls have vaginas. I don't understand how this is become confusing or complicated for the Democrat part. That's one of the more memorable statements of fact from kindergarten cop for those who don't remember. Yes. Which is a, you know, a movie. Evidently, it's a hateful film. Historically, it's not a tumor. You know, I remember we all remember kindergarten cop. Yes. And I do want to tie this in though, Clay, to why the libs of TikTok hit piece also happen now because you notice Jen Psaki. And that's exactly the right analysis of this. Jen Psaki says, this isn't a problem after saying it is a problem because they can't get the story straight. You saw this with CRT. You see this with the left a lot. You saw it with inflation, but in the CRT is a closer or more analogous situation where they say, that's not CRT. No one's teaching CRT in school. Oh, you can't know what CRT is unless you have a PhD to, damn it, they're not letting us teach CRT anymore. Right? They go through these processes of trying to hide what's happening and lie and misdirect. Exact same thing here. Why does this tie into libs of TikTok? Because, and to be some of her sins, libs of TikTok ends up being on, you know, Tucker Carlson show and ends up being on Facebook and other platforms too. So it really was just a feeder for, but it was showing people teachers who were saying how important it is to them to teach five year olds crazy stuff. So Jen Psaki's life is complicated to lie to you, the concerned parents of America about what your kids are being taught because she's out there saying, this is just about like, what if somebody has, you know, gay parents? No, that's actually not what this is about. It's about teachers who want to have pronoun choice day and tell a little boy who's five who says, I feel like a girl today, oh, let's, let's chase this down and not tell your parents. And maybe in a few years, we'll even have a transition for you. That's what this is actually about. And that's why they were trying to shut down libs of TikTok because some libs were saying it out loud. No, there's no doubt. And this is when you know that you are over the target when you start taking flack. And what's amazing to me, and we talked about this earlier in the week, Buck, I really feel like the Democrats, I saw somebody tweet this are trying to tank. And I said, what could they possibly be thinking on all of this? And someone sent me an email, and I thought it was an interesting email regarding the masking and the decisions that are being made. And they said, the only thing I can think like, because I agree with you in Buck, this was the email is saying, Hey, it seems like they're intentionally picking the worst argument of every single issue, right? If you had to sum up the Biden White House, Buck, you and I, even if we were being hired to try to spend for them, there's almost nothing we could spend in their favor. And the argument was, I feel like, and this is his argument, but I'm curious whether it might actually be true, they are trying to set up to be able to have all mail in ballots again in November by saying COVID still hasn't gone away. And that is their safety net. That's the only thing, and I'm sitting here trying to think, why would they be arguing in favor of the DOJ, even appealing this mask situation? And that's the only thing I can think, Buck, because otherwise everything they're doing, the Biden's touch is destroying everything that he touches. I got to say, I hope, I really hope that every Democrat running for office in Michigan, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Georgia, I hope that they really, really dig in. I hope they really get as deep as they can on the issue of we abs, it is a core foundational right in society to have publicly funded bureaucrats telling your five year old that it's time for gender transition talk. I want them all to run on this. Their party believes it. They should have to defend it. I want them to explain why the White House is putting out. We need pre adolescents to be having gender, gender transition surgery as well as hormones, and that that is standard of care. And if you don't believe that you're a bigot, let's have them run on this. Go for it, guys. Amen. It's child abuse. It is without a shadow of a doubt in both of our opinions. And I think almost the vast majority of the American public as well, it's child abuse to be trying to change someone's gender when they are under 18 years old. It's shameful, indefensible.

Welcome on into the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. Your audio extravaganza begins now. Thank you for hanging out with us for joining us here New York City National Tennessee all across the country. We got the mask situation on the planes. A little bit of update on that one. The United CEO says he thinks they're never coming back. The DOJ says they're going to challenge the ruling but not clear exactly when, how or in what way. Do they just want the authority to mask you up when they decide again to do it? We will dive into that. Does Biden even know what title 42 is? That's an open question after a press conference earlier today was discussing another 800 million dollars of funding for Ukraine today added to the billions of dollars that has already been given to Ukraine and weapons assistance and other material. Jen Psaki makes it even more clear in a sense what she thinks is at stake. What the left believes at stake in the parental rights bill that showdown between Disney and Ron DeSantis not going the way the woke libs anticipated not going the way they were hoping it would. That's for sure. They are now not only on defense politically. I think they're trying to avoid Clay a political route going into the midterms pushed on in part by that one that the issue of children, education and indoctrination CRT the trans agenda. We've also got Dr. Nicole Sapphire. You all know her from Fox News. She's fantastic. She'll be joining us talk about the latest with the CDC the rulemaking authority masks all the rest of it. So that is coming up. But Clay we just got the news. We just got the news that I guess we are not going to have to worry about competing for our audience's attention for the three hours we're on daily with CNN plus CNN plus has been put out to pasture. I guess CNN plus has been sent to the glue factory actually it is no longer no longer with us as a network as of today. We've been talking about streaming Netflix. They've gotten crushed big changes in the media and political landscape come as a result of all this stuff. But I got to say what was CNN thinking CNN plus rest in peace shutting down after just 21 days buck. I think that's basically the length of Kim Kardashian's marriage to Chris Humphreys back in the day. If I'm not mistaken, this is maybe the biggest media failure of all time. I mean, when you consider that they have invested hundreds of millions of dollars in the launch of CNN plus, they said, Hey, what America wants is more Brian Stelter. What America needs is Don Lemon on that wall. What you absolutely positively will pay for is Jamel Hill and Rex Chapman breaking down the latest in the woke universe. But they got an average viewership in a day of under 10,000 people under 10,000 people for CNN plus. I mean, to put that into context, I mean, we have videos on outkick on our outkick programming that do infinitely better like outkick is bigger with the eight shows that we do or whatever than CNN plus was and buck, they spent hundreds of millions of dollars, hundreds of millions of dollars on the belief that people were committed to CNN despite the fact that no one watches it for free on their cable and satellite packages by and large. This is one of the greatest miscalculations in the history of media. I don't remember. I mean, I know the quibi thing was a huge mess. I think that was Katzenberg. If I'm not mistaken, the daily beast. You remember when that launched actually the daily beast in its initial years of publication, I think lost 100 million dollars, but over the course of a few years several years, over several years to basically light this much money on fire, hundreds of millions of dollars they spent on the launch and to have this few people respond and to shut the entire thing down after 21 days effective April 30th, CNN plus will no longer exist is an unprecedented failure in the world of media. And I got to tell you, Buck, when I saw this when I had my phone blew up with text messages because I didn't even see the news breaking. And everybody was like, CNN plus is done. I just had such a great smile on my face. And I bet a lot of people sort of without even intending to smile. I bet also a lot of people out there listening to us right now also are smiling. What do you think the over under is on when Chris Wallace shows up on the mass singer or perhaps dancing with the stars? I'm going to be a mass singer because that's a Fox product. Somebody tweeted me worst decision. And there are this this is fun, you know, from a career arc perspective. Back in the day, you remember Chris O'Donnell? He passed on the Titanic. Was he Robin in the really bad Batman movie? The really so Donald Chris O'Donnell turned down the Leonardo DiCaprio Titanic role to play Robin in that Batman. What have the all time worse, uh, forced Hollywood decisions? Obviously, the Leonardo DiCaprio has become a monster star. I don't even know what Chris O'Donnell does now. So he turned down the role of Jack and Titanic. And somebody tweeted me and I retweeted it. I didn't even make that choice. We can probably get some great responses out here. Chris Wallace joining CNN plus to leave Fox News better or worse decision than Chris O'Donnell becoming Robin to, uh, to turn down the Titanic. I think you got to put that to the people. I think you got a phone, a friend on that one as in our audience and put that out in a poll because that's open phone lines. Some of you guys and there may be other things that people think of from a career arc perspective. I mean, some people might say Johnny DiCap marrying Amber, uh, heard given the fact that that's been on news for the past couple of days. But this is, I think this is going to be sort of a seismic shock wave event because some people say, well, why do I care about CNN? Plus this is a sign. CNN has new owners in the Discovery Time Warner merger and they're looking at the data now with fresh eyes and they are saying, my goodness, to me, this is a test of the overall value of the CNN brand and how much it's liked by the people who consume it. And the answer is not at all. I think there's a number of things that all come together here that are of interest of, of general, just one is Donald Trump broke CNN. Donald Trump, almost single handedly he and it was Jeff Zucker pushing it over there, managed to turn what could still front as a journalism first left leaning to be sure. And I, yeah, contributor there for a couple of years when it was in this phase, when it was still in the, you know, Kayleigh McEnany was over there with me. I was over there, you know, Ben Ferguson was over there. We, you know, we had conservatives that would, and you know, Tucker Carlson had his own show. People forget that CNN for years and years, that's where he got his start. CNN in the Trump era went essentially full left wing activist woke in a way that's irreparable to the perception of the public about what their, what the brand is. I do think they're trying very hard now because it's really about the, the whole channel is effectively about the Ukraine war right now. They've moved even away from the insurrection on January 6 coverage. I think they're trying to reestablish themselves as a news entity in the minds of the public because they just became a kind of more boring, less honest version of MSNBC, which is a lib prop again to network, but everybody knows it. You know what I mean? Everyone understands everyone agrees that MSNBC is, is Democrat is liberal. And CNN, I think in a lot of ways, because it's such a legacy media brand, insulated the thinking of various anchors and executives over there from the reality of, if you have to compete in a marketplace where now people have a lot of choices, you know, streaming is very different from the cable news world. Cable news is very difficult to get on, it's very expensive. And there's a lot of incumbency protection for cable limits, limited actual options, right? Whereas you can sit down on YouTube and watch anything from anywhere from any perspective, there's three or four options at all for news. If you want to sit down in front of your television and for people are saying, Oh, but pocket, I've got 500 channels. Yeah, but to be in the news spectrum, you have to be in certain channels in a certain zone and have to have a certain level of coverage in households. Anyway, that's maybe a little inside baseball. But the point here is, this is just a massive belly flop. I mean, it's, it's stunning to watch this play out. But it's really not surprising. Like, wouldn't it be clay? You sold your business to Fox, you know, built a successful business with streaming. Wouldn't you have been shocked if all of a sudden CNN was drawing, you know, CNN plus, I mean, was drawing a half a million, a million viewers a night? I mean, that would have been a, that would have been stunning. It would have been stunning. And Buck, I think you're right, because what CNN not only did, did under Jeff Zucker before they forced him out during the Trump era was, there are a lot of people out there listening to us right now, who had CNN pegged as the most trusted name in news, right? In the context of back in the Gulf War, I remember being a kid, you would come home and you would turn on CNN and they had Bernard Shaw reporting from Baghdad or Kuwait or wherever it was. They had the first television war was the way that that was characterized. And you would put it on and you trusted them to bring you the news. And they totally gave up the decades that they had branded themselves to turn into an anti Trump network. He broke them. He really did. And I mean, you were, you obviously have a history at CNN. I'm being banned. Yeah. And which is amazing. That is like being banned from North Korea, by the way, that is a badge of honor. You know, if North Korea says the clay Travis is Buck's ex, they're not welcome to visit again, you'd be like, that's pretty cool. But but I can just from from personal experience, he gives folks a sense of from, I think I first started doing occasional CNN hits maybe 2014, 2015. So be like pre Trump era. Yeah. And Jeff Zunker himself came up to once and said, I did some analysis of a Russian assassination that occurred right near the Kremlin in real time on TV. And you know, had my, you know, you have a lawyer hat, I have my CIA hat. Yeah. And and I, and he's came over. He's like, that was such a suit analysis. They used to have me on with their top terrorism analysts on panels. When there was breaking news about major terrorist attacks, I was one of the people they would call me, you know, it would be me and Paul Crookshank and you know, a handful of other folks, not saying I was the top of the list, but I was one of the people that they would draw upon. By the time Trump was running and I started being a pro Trump voice on the air, I was told that there were conversations in the control room when I'd be on air about how they really needed to dig into my background because they thought I never actually worked at the CIA. That was how crazy it made them. That was how, you know, I could show them briefing photos from the Oval Office. I'm sure they still wouldn't believe it. It's a deep fake. Right. The point is, that was how much they that was how much they were broken by the Trump phenomenon that they would go even with someone like me from, wow, this guy really knows his stuff to, oh my God, he likes Trump. He must be lying about everything. And it's it's well said there too. And to your point earlier from my background in media, what I have found is people pay are willing to pay. I don't mean like you pay for a cable subscription. People pay based on strong brand affinity. In other words, if you're subscribing to something that you actually directly pay for, I mean, the cable bundle is such an amazing business because most people don't realize that they're paying for 400 channels or whatever, because you pay a hundred or $150 a month, whatever you do. And that money gets redistributed to all the channels. When you actually have to make a choice to pay for a brand, what matters more than anything else is brand affinity. Do you like and trust that brand? And so your point, I would have been stunned at if CNN plus worked because I don't really believe there are that many people who are like, man, you know who I love? Don Lemon. I can't get enough of Anderson Cooper. I mean, you might not like Chris Cuomo, but I actually think he had stronger brand affinity. People aren't going to pay money for Jake Tapper, right? I just don't believe that they are. Now, I think there are people in media, whether you like or not, people will pay for Rachel Maddow, right? They trust her on the left. They'll pay for people will pay for Tucker. They'll pay for Sean directly. CNN doesn't have any of that. They're kind of still in the squishy middle where there isn't strong brand affinity. Nobody's paying for Brian Stelter, Jamel Hill, or Rex Chapman. So I would have been stunned beyond belief if this worked. I did think it was going to last buck longer than 21 days. I mean, they, you know, they do have some real, they do have some real journalists over there. I mean, to be fair, and some of their anchors are more fair-minded than others. And so I wonder if now with the massive failure of CNN, plus, I should say massive failure, what's the CNN failure? But the massive failure of CNN plus maybe now they try to go back to at some level, the CNN roots, if you will, of being a more, they're never going to be objective folks. Okay, it's a, it's a question of where they go on the scale. But, you know, I mean, Clarice Award has done some very good foreign, foreign affairs, foreign policy reporting for a disaster. She does, she does brave stuff and knows her stuff. And she's the real deal. And, you know, they could be more a network that at least is center, you know, center left. And I think they may have to go on that. Otherwise, I don't know what happens. Well, they may get a bailout because they could just go back to the anti-Trump network, because I think both we both think he's going to run. And then they just run the Piers Morgan interview and the outrage and the Trump show and continue that for basically a couple of years. It will be interesting to see whether they'll go and take that sugary sweetness high, which destroys their brand or stick to, as your point, hey, Clarice Award on the ground at Ukraine.
