    "text": " It's Tuesday, ladies and gentlemen, so let's have some fun to get you through it. Question of the day today. What is one conspiracy theory that you believe in? I know there's one. Everybody gets pulled in by at least one. Plus, I will be responding to some of the most insane comments I received following my monologue on Kanye's alleged anti-Semitism. And one of the nation's top children's hospital is now claiming that some children know their gender identity in the womb. Yeah, we're not crazy or anything. All that and more today on Candace Owens. So I asked you a question and that question was what is one conspiracy theory that you believe in? Because I know there's one. There's just always the thing that you talk about in your house. You're like, I just feel like maybe the government is pulling the wool over our eyes a little bit. So I'm going to tell you mine in the spirit of fun. I promise you, I actually talked to my husband about this. I'm like, there's just no way. There's just no way. So we were talking about the moon landing. I don't know why. That one always gets me. I think it's because it was in 1969 and to think about where technology was during 1969 and then to envision that we somehow landed on the moon and took a casual walk. It then gets a little bit stranger, of course, because not only did we take a casual walk on the moon, but then we had a casual phone call, right? You have Neil Armstrong who just called down and was like, hey, what's up, everybody? I'm on the moon. And then, of course, it was the live television aspect. I didn't call down from the moon, but everybody was able to watch it all over the world. And then when he came back, NASA accidentally lost all of that original footage. He's like, okay, sorry, we kept us all on a vault, but now it's all gone and we can't actually look back and examine all of that original footage to be clear. NASA searched for but could not locate some of the original Apollo 11 data tapes, original in the sense that they directly recorded data transmitted from the moon and intensive search of the archives and records concluded that the most likely scenario was that the program managers determined there was no longer a need to keep the tapes since all the video and data was recorded elsewhere and they were erased and then reused. But it just sits weird with me. And then if you go back and you watch Neil Armstrong's interviews, he doesn't seem like he even knows that he was out there. He's just really awkward. Maybe he's an awkward guy in general, but he's just really awkward. The astronauts have no feedback. In fact, even, and I know obviously the suspicion, but even on Netflix's The Crown, they did an entire episode on this and it was around Prince Philip being so excited to host the astronauts. And then in conclusion, being really let down by how not amazing they were and how they really gave him no interesting feedback about what they saw, this amazing feat for humanity. And then these astronauts were just like, yeah, man, we did it. So it gets me. That one gets me just a little bit. And when I was saying this to my husband, he actually said something that smacked me down a little bit. I think it was a good rebuttal. He brought up Concord Jets. He said, actually, this isn't the first time that technology has gone backwards. He said, think about in general during that time, you used to have Concord Jets. You guys even know about Concord Jets because when I brought this up to my production team, some of them had no idea what I was talking about. There used to be a Jets that carried passengers from New York all the way to London in under three hours. And that's unimaginable. I mean, I obviously frequent London a lot because that's where my husband's from and that trip takes if you're going from New York all the way to London about seven hours. But there used to be in the early 70s and 1973, they launched a passenger jet that it would take you just under three hours to do that trip. And so my husband's father, who used to travel to New York for work, used to be able to leave London arrive same day in New York. There's a couple of hours later for breakfast and then make it back home to London all within the same day. I mean, that's crazy. Fashion, then you could get to Los Angeles. You could just go to London. And it wasn't just that route. They also had an Air France route. It wasn't just British Airways that did it. It was Air France that did it. And you used to be able to go all the way from France to Washington Dulles Airport in the same quick timeframe. So what happened? How is it plausible now that we have passenger jets that are going slower than they were going in 1973, which is when it began. And they stopped it. They retired these jets in 2003 following an Air France accident that happened on one of these jets, which by the way, had nothing to do with the manufacturing of the jets themselves. It was an Air France passenger jet. And because of debris that was on the runway, when they took off, it basically the entire jet tripped and the tire got caught in the engine. And there was a huge explosion and all passengers, all 109 passengers on board, plus some people that were in a nearby hotel, perished. And after that, they said, oh, we have to stop. And they just retired the jet in 2003. Seems like a very bizarre thing, right? We know now that even horrifyingly that these passenger jets have accidents, even the ones that we have today. And yet this one was retired. Why? So yeah, I thought that was a very good rebuttal that my husband gave me and said, okay, that's just a conspiracy. Again, there are so many different areas in which technology has gone backwards. And then it led me to ask myself the question, is society going forward in any regard? Think about it. In what way would you say that from the 1970s to today, society has moved forward? We have become better and we have become stronger and we have become smarter? I've already painted the example of how we are going backwards in terms of travel. What's another area? What's another category? Phones, right? You might say, oh, okay, just look at the cell phone. Obviously that has led society and humanity forward. No, I would rebut and I would say actually our phones are enslaving us and because of our phones, we have less capable human beings. We can't do anything. Social media has sent humanity backwards, right? You might say, oh, well, can I say, listen, at least we live in a society that has more racial harmony since the 70s. I beg to differ. Look around you. Yeah, we're being painted a picture. We keep calling it progress, but obviously we are digressing. We are actually having to argue and explain to people why it's wrong to put in place policies that disadvantage white people and that disadvantage Asian people. For example, the education system. Now we have something called affirmative action, which means that if you're a black person and let's say you have a 2.0 GPA in high school, you're going to get into a college ahead of a white person or an Asian person who might have a 2.7 GPA because they're black, I guess. That's not progress. That's actually just saying it's upside down land and we used to be racist towards these people, but now we're going to be racist towards these other people. People might say women, women's right. So obviously since the 70s, women's rights, obviously no women's rights are also facing a catastrophe and we are going backwards. We used to want to be on equal footing with men. Now we are suddenly saying we want nothing to do with men and we are tearing families apart all in the name of progress, right? All in the name of progress. So what actually today in society is moving forward? I'm asking you this question. I don't have the answer. I want you to actually comment and give me feedback and say, well, Candice, in this one regard, we are moving forward because the only answer that I can come up with is that our government is moving forward. Our government has amassed a lot of power during this time. Our government, of course, is still using these sonic boom jets. We know that our military has these tools. We know that our military is using this technology, which gives our government more power. And of course, going back to the women's rights movement, which I say is causing us on a personal level and a household level to digress, the government is moving forward because in the absence of strong households and in the absence of strong families, you instead have a strong state, a strong state that is stepping in and saying, we will be your family. We will create the Department of Education. We will raise your kids to think in a manner that guarantees us more power in the future because they turn to the state for solutions. The same for the alleged racial harmony, which is nowhere. If you're looking around, obviously, we've gone backwards. It's volatile. Of course, that gives the state more power because the state tells you that it needs to offer solutions. And its solutions, of course, are things that just create more division. It just creates more governments. It just creates more departments and compartments of government that we need to deal with the never-ending racial strife. So no, I would say government is not doing us any favors by growing itself. The individual is shrinking as the government grows. And that's all I have to say about that. All right, guys, before we continue, I want to take a quick second to talk to you about Birch Gold.

The reason why I say that is because in case you forgot, one day I was having the back forth with Megan McCain on Twitter about COVID, she was one of the people that were super scared of COVID and could not understand how any person in their sane mind did not get the vaccine. What's wrong with these anti-vaxxers? That being me, I did not get the vaccine. And I basically explained to her that actually clinical obesity, which is a fact, is something that is concerning if you have COVID, which I do not have. And she was very upset. And she tweeted this at me. She said, come get your girl at Ben Shapiro. Wait, what? What? It was one of the weirdest things in the other. I mean, we didn't even come get your girl Ben Shapiro. But I realize this is now becoming a theme. Since I work at the Daily Wire, people just randomly say, Ben Shapiro, come get your girl. Like, he's my father or something. And that I have to, I guess, agree with everything he says or he has to agree with everything that I say. Pretty sure they didn't want me to work in the Daily Wire so that I could be a black Ben Shapiro. By the way, picturing a black Ben Shapiro is just weird in general. But boy yesterday was a come get your girl Ben Shapiro kind of day. So I did a totally sane monologue regarding Kanye West's tweets, which were confusing to anybody who saw them. I don't know what DEFCON 3 is. I said, I literally don't know what it is. I know what DEFCON 3 is. I don't know who he was talking about. I didn't know if he was talking about a specific person who was Jewish. That would have made any sense to me. But I definitely did not read between and think that Kanye West was going to organize a military strike in Israel. I know that the web is emotional and that we all have to be really extreme in our reactions. But I basically said that Kanye should clarify what he meant before everyone got hysterical. But you know, we live in a world where you're not allowed to clarify what you mean and nobody waits for you to clarify what you mean. Instead, they just castigate you. They tell you that you're this or you're that, you're racist, you're transphobic, you're anti-Semitic. Nobody wants to hear anymore from you ever again. Well, Kanye is a friend of mine and I actually want to hear what he has to say and I would like him to further explicate. But this was not enough for the internet. No, no, no. In fact, they did exactly what I said that they love to do and they stripped essentially a minute out of my 15 minute monologue and said, can this is defending Kanye West? In fact, this was a headline in the Jerusalem post. They ran this headline. Candace Owens defends Kanye West, says tweets about Jews wasn't anti-Semitic. Okay. Interesting though, is that buried beneath in their article? They actually clearly, literally, this was like one of the last few lines. They actually clearly said at the end of this article, quote, Owens stressed that her statements are not a defense of his tweets, but an open question which never seems to happen anymore. Oh, okay. So, doesn't that completely go against your headline? You say at the very bottom of this article that I stressed that I was not defending him, but you went with the headline, which was hysterical, Candace Owens defends Kanye West. Nope, I did not defend Kanye West, not even once. I just said I'd like further clarification about what he meant because I know him and I know that he has tons of Jewish friends. I actually met him through his best friend who is Jewish. They reached out to me and said, hey, I'm best friends with Kanye West and I'd love to get you to in touch. So it didn't make sense to me that people wanted me to say that he suddenly wanted all Jewish people to die. But of course, this is now not Kanye's fault, what you tweeted. It's not Candace's fault, what she tweeted or what she said in her monologue, but it is Ben Shapiro's fault. A person actually tweeted this and I just wanted to read it. This is from Ari Cross. Ari Cross is totally a stable human being and he wrote, I'm pretty sure that by tomorrow Ben Shapiro either has to get Candace to say, sorry I was on Ambien at the time or fire her. I'm going to go with that. Hey guys, I just wanted to say I'm sorry that in yesterday's monologue, I was on Ambien. I was, I just, I took three Ambien pills and I did this crazy monologue where I said that we should wait before we react and get clarification. So I hope that makes you happy, Ari, and I just wanted to say that. If you didn't think that was insane response, I went onto my Instagram and I was tagged in a tweet. So somebody was pasting a tweet onto Instagram and the tweet said, so death con three, I still don't know what death con three is, against the Jews then, question mark, damn bigots, you don't quit. And this was in response to learning that there is still conflict obviously between Jews and Palestinians in the region. And a girl actually wrote to me, she tagged me and she says, it seems like this was the desired outcome that you were both looking for. Am I right? And she is talking about the Israeli, Palestinian conflict, which has been going on forever. And I guess now it is the outcome that I was looking for when I said that we should ask Kanye to clarify what death con three means and what he actually meant by these tweets. So I guess now I'm responsible. It's me, the entire reason in case you didn't know, if you were like, I'm actually don't know what's going on in that region. It's because Candace wants to wait for Kanye to clarify his tweet. That is the reason that Israel and Palestine have been in conflict with each other. It's me. I'm the girl you're looking for. Ben Shapiro, come get yo girl. You know, I have to say what I found to be really ironic here in reading all of these insane tweets and blaming me for the entire conflict is they essentially were accusing me of anti-Semitism by association while at the same time saying that I work for him and controlled by Ben Shapiro, right? So you're accusing me of being anti-Semitic. Why would I work for Ben Shapiro? Is that not at all in your brain register as a conflict of interest if you're anti-Semitic, if you hate Jews, why would you work for Ben Shapiro? And then the funny thing is by saying Ben Shapiro, come get your girl or saying Ben Shapiro, come control Candace Owens, you are actually, aren't you giving into a racist trope that Jews control the world? Isn't that a racist trope? Ben Shapiro, come control Candace Owens. Isn't the orange you doing exactly what you are accusing other people of doing? Why would Ben Shapiro need to get me under control? That makes absolutely no sense. As I said before, we have different opinions and we have different strategies when it comes to certain things. So I actually don't know what Ben's response was to Kanye's tweets because I gave you my own, which is that they made entirely no sense to me. I want clarification. And then I also think, by the way, to wrap this all up, that it's really funny that people were very upset with Kanye because they felt that he was blaming Jewish people, right? When he spoke out about Jared Kushner, when he tweeted about Jewish people and death con three, they felt that he was arbitrarily blaming Jewish people, which is a racist historical trope. Well, what are you doing when you blame Ben Shapiro for what I say? So this entire thing happened and you're basically saying this is the fault of a Jewish person, Ben Shapiro. Yeah. So I'm not saying that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that I'm going to say that somebody that was able to speak whose voice, I don't know if I've ever heard, I think maybe just in the Opeler interview before his wife spoke over him, but Prince Harry spoke yesterday and it does, it feels like a rare act. He just has let Meghan Markle do all of the talking. She's not had a podcast. It's like she is his PR agent and she tells you why his family sucks and she does it like every month. And then she also tells you that the only reason they left was because they wanted their privacy and so they moved into Hollywood, which is not the area that I would recommend, the neighborhood that I would recommend if you want your privacy. I also wouldn't recommend having a podcast if you want your privacy, but Prince Harry has actually spoke. He spoke to the winners of the 2022 Well Child Awards, which is a charity that celebrates the inspirational quality of the UK's seriously ill children along with those who go that extra mile to make a difference to their lives. Here is Prince Harry. I'll tell you what, we all need a dog that keeps us calm. I've got three in this house now. We basically have five children, but I've got a black Labrador called Pula, a rescue beagle called Guy, and we got another rescue beagle called Mia. And between the three of them, they charge around chasing squirrels and causing all sorts of problems to us every single day. But they are also emotional support dogs. One hundred percent. I mean, I'm one of my biggest pet peeves as emotional support dogs, but I think he just comes across as likable. And I don't know how it's possible that he's so likable and Megan is just seems to be the exact opposite, which brings me to her podcast. She recently released a new episode where she says that she's been labeled as crazy and hysterical and nuts and insane. Although she doesn't actually say who said that. And she also says that she feels pretty strongly about the word crazy and that families have been shattered by its use. Take a listen. Hi Megan, and this is Archetypes. My podcast about the labels and tropes that try to hold women back. I feel pretty strongly about this word, this label crazy. The way that it's thrown around so casually and the damage it's wrought on society and women, frankly everywhere. From relationships to families being shattered, the mutations destroyed and careers ruined. The stigma surrounding the word, it also has this silencing effect. This effect where women experiencing real mental health issues, they get scared. They stay quiet, they internalize and they repress for far too long. Look, there's a lot to unpack here. So she says stigma around the word crazy has a silencing effect. I challenge that notion because clearly she says that she's been called crazy and she's definitely not been silent at all despite what she would have you believe. She keeps pretending that she's being in prison and nobody's allowing her to speak. I just want to say also in general, this sounds like the worst podcast ever. I just don't understand people that think leaning into this victim mentality is something that people want to hear, especially nowadays. It's just old. It's just aged. Nobody wants to hear how oppressed you are as a princess. It just doesn't make any sense. And I do think actually I read a really interesting piece in The Daily Mail where they talked about this weird environment or this weird place that Harry and Meghan are in now because they don't really know how to make money. Their entire brand is talking about their own victimhood and they've signed a deal with a devil. They've agreed to Spotify. I think that the deal was something like $25 million. And they agreed to this deal thinking that they were going to do something productive and healthy, but in reality, what Spotify wants is blood. They want them to continue to trash the royal family. And they seem a little less willing to do that now, especially following Queen Elizabeth the second's death. They don't seem like they want to give that, but they have no other use in society. Meghan was never a great actress. Nobody knew who she was before she got with Prince Harry, which granted her access to the parties that she wanted. Grant granted her access to the billionaires that she wants to be around like Oprah. But how is she going to make her money? Oprah's talented. Oprah was an incredible talk show host. She owns a network. She's very good when she gives these interviews. She knows how to get people to give her the information that she wants. What is the talent that Harry and Meghan have? Because I don't care how far left you are. I don't care how anti-family you are or how much you despise nuclear family or the concept of a royal family. That doesn't actually, by the way, have any real power. They're not an absolute monarchy over in the UK, despite the depictions that Meghan and Harry have given to society. No matter how far left you are, you just become a little bit uncomfortable when somebody's entire brand and the only way that they make money is by denigrating their family. They're going to have to come up with a new plan. Moving on, I want to talk about this planned parenthood cartoon ad. Yep, Planned Parenthood is under fire. Not because they've aborted millions and millions of babies and have ripped them limb from limb from their mother's womb. No, they've never been under fire for that. But they're under fire for a cartoon ad that teaches teenagers different ways of delaying their puberty, some of which they say works like a stop sign. You can just stop your puberty. It's one of the ways it's for the use of puberty blockers, which can halt voice deepening, facial hair growth and menstrual cycles. The organization posted the video to its YouTube account in January, but it's recently resurfaced on the eye inside the classroom Twitter account. Take a listen. There's no one size fits all puberty experience. If your trans, intersex or non-binary, know that you're not the only one feeling confused. For some intersex people, puberty may start later than age 14. You might experience some of puberty's changes and not others, and your body may or may not go through puberty on its own. There are medicines you can take to help your body start the process, like hormone replacement therapy. Some people decide on hormones or surgeries to help their bodies match up to their gender identity, or how they feel inside about themselves. Your gender identity is real. You should be the one to decide what changes you want to make to your body. If you're transgender or non-binary, you may find that your puberty experiences don't line up with your gender identity, or how you see yourself. That feeling can be uncomfortable, scary, and stressful. But that sounds like you. Know that you're not alone. There are medicines you can take to delay puberty for a while. They're called puberty blockers, and they work like a stop sign by holding the hormones testosterone and estrogen that cause puberty changes like facial hair growth and periods. Puberty blockers are safe, and can give you more time to figure out what feels right for you, your body, and your gender identity. You don't have to have all of the answers right now. So remember, it's all a work in progress, and it may take time to figure out what feels right to you. But talking to a trusted adult and a nurse or doctor may help. Want to learn more? Go to Planned Parenthood.org slash teens. It's just positively despicable. I mean, there is no question that Planned Parenthood is a deaf cult. It is. They are a deaf organization. They specialize in death. That's what they do. They tell people that they shouldn't have families. They abort children from the womb of their mothers. I just can't imagine that this organization is still being funded by people. And now they are turning their attention to teenagers and trying to get them to destroy their bodies so that they can never become reproductive human beings. That's the aim, right? Actually, we won't even have to perform an abortion on you because you're not going to be able to become pregnant. You are going to be rendered infertile. How brilliant is that for Planned Parenthood to realize, right? Because now that conservatives are once again winning on the pro-life movement, which by the way is sad that we had to win on a movement that supports life, that supports families, that supports birth. Now that we have finally won that argument and sent that argument back down to the states we voted on again, they're going, what can we do? What can we do? Their answer is to make sure that human beings just can't procreate. Target the teenagers. Target them and say, oh, you can just stop your puberty. Don't worry, by the way, we're not going to tell you that these hormone therapy and these puberty blockers are actually used to castrate pedophiles in prison. We're not going to tell you that. We're not going to tell you that if you're a male and you take these for a long time, you're going to develop a micro penis and you are actually not going to have any sexual desire. You take this for long enough. You're not even going to be able to have productive sexual relationships when you become an adult. You're actually probably going to fall into a deep, deep depression when you realize this. When you realize that adults lied to you, when you realize that doctors lied to you, when you realize that you were intentionally confused, intentionally targeted by an entire ecosystem of evil, an ecosystem that is happening in the classrooms, an ecosystem that is happening on social media where they permit these lies to be told and spread around the world and ecosystem that ends up really in a hospital room when children are confused about why their bodies don't work the way they're supposed to because they were given credence to an idea that is a lie. No, you cannot pick your gender. No, you cannot halt your puberty like a stop sign. These are incredibly sinister organizations and people that support this. I'm glad that Planned Parenthood is having their day in the public courtroom and people are starting to realize what this organization has always been about, which is death. Speaking of a sinister ecosystem, we can hardly mention that without talking about hospitals. Hospitals, I don't know when they became prison wards or when they started focusing on harming patients, but we are definitely there. One of the nation's top children's hospitals has generated controversy over a video claiming that some children know their gender identity before they are born. That's so, isn't that kind of just pause there for a moment. It's remarkable. So, we are being told that they're not human beings, which is why it's totally fine that Planned Parenthood is aborting millions and millions and millions of them. It's totally fine that we're harvesting organs. It doesn't even matter because they're not real, but also they know their gender identity. Those not real things that are in your stomach know their gender identity. But Boston Children's Hospital posted a video on its YouTube channel in August where a psychologist explains that a good portion of children she sees at the hospital's gender multi-specialty service clinic, whatever that is, they know their gender identity from the room. Yep, this is the video you should take a listen. So, most of the patients that we have in the Gems Clinic actually know their gender usually around the age of puberty, but a good portion of children do know as early as seemingly from the womb. And they will usually express their gender identity as very young children. Some, as soon as they can talk, they may say phrases such as, I'm a girl or I'm a boy or I'm going to be a woman or I'm going to be a mom. Kids know very, very early. So, in the Gems Clinic, we see a variety of young children all the way down to ages two and three and usually up to the ages of nine. When they come into the clinic, they'll see one of our psychologists and we'll be talking to them about their gender. We'll be talking to their family about how to best support that child and how to make sure that that child has the space and support to explore their gender and do well throughout their development. And we'll be answering any parent questions. A lot of parents do have questions and so we answer those questions. The biggest piece of advice I give parents who are coming through the Gender Clinic at Boston Children's Hospital is to just be supportive. Sometimes you might not understand. Sometimes you feel like you don't know the terms or you don't get exactly what the child means when they say that they might be this gender. But the biggest thing you can do is just love your child and support them and just allow them to express themselves. That's the biggest protector as well against negative mental health effects such as depression, suicidality, anxiety that we worry about for our gender diverse kids and young adults. So that support from a parent is one of the best protective factors and one of the best things they can do. I almost have no words for this. I really just want to say that I hope that in watching and in paying attention to this, what we have done is played a part in waking parents up. I just hope parents are now realizing just how evil this world has become and how focused this world, this state, if you will, because what's really happening is over governance and stateism, I hope that people are realizing that the new target is children, that it has to be children to accomplish whatever the state's goals are, which are always anti-family. They need to focus on the next generation coming up. They need to strip children of their identity in order to turn them into bots and to state slaves, right? And they know that this is exactly what will happen if you destroy the human being, if you destroy the things that are our souls naturally desire and strive toward, like family, there is nothing that makes people feel more whole than actually accomplishing having a family than going home at the end of the day like I get to do and sitting down with your family, having a meal with your family, talking about your day, the joy that comes from having children, a children's laugh, right? The pitter patter of children's feet when they run in the morning. The state doesn't want that for you and what they're doing is they are poisoning your children. They're poisoning your children to hate family so much that they will sacrifice their own bodies, right? They will sacrifice their own bodies, not even knowing it. In fact, what they're doing is they're selling them an idea. They're going to feel better. All you got to do is take these pills and get rid of your body parts, ruin your body parts in some regards. Sometimes it's just taking the pill, sometimes it's going the extra mile and getting these surgeries that permanently deform children because these are cosmetic procedures and not going to actually change what you are. You are either a male or you are a female. But this new focus, these radical videos and convincing children that they knew they had the ability to know that they weren't this even when they were in the womb, that's all an effort to get the state more power because these kids are going to become permanent wards of the big pharma states and they are going to have to turn to the state to deal with their medical bills that will become insurmountable. They will forever be in debt. They will forever be depressed. They will forever be looking for the next pill, the next injection that's going to make it all better and it's never going to. It's never going to make it better. That's all I have to say about that. All right, guys. I want to take a second to talk to you about Express VPN.
