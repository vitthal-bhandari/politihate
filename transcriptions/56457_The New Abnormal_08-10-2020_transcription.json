I'll try to keep Rick to the minimum number of F-bombs and try to keep our kids, pets and other wildlife sounds from invading our respective bunkers. So we have a very special, VEEP post debate show with the illustrious Rick Wilson. Hi there. At his undisclosed location. Indeed. And our special guest, Kathy Griffin. It was not in an undisclosed location. She is in a disclosed location of California. Ow, that flies in my hair. Ow, ow, sticky. And she is in California where you need to manage your forests. Rick, we've got to do a lot of forest raking and then we're all good people. Yeah, they really love the raking. Like they're so stuck on the fucking raking. Someone told him about raking. Well, it wasn't Gavin Newsom, by the way, who I believe agrees with Trump once in a while when he needs money. But you know, California, the forests of California are 60% run by the government, the federal government. So they love to say it's up to the states. I think the federal government, I don't think they're doing any raking. And that's not what I hear works anyway. But it's actually, that was one of the moments I have to say, as someone who, I'm in Chicago, but lives in California, that was actually really sad. Because we are not the only state on fire, but the whole west coast is on fire. And it was kind of like blame in the victim. I think that's exactly right. And it's sort of the difference between rational people who follow science and people who hear random shit and are named Donald Trump. I mean, I just don't understand how Mike Pence is such a sick of fan. And did you see that the swarm swarming? Swarming was a search 500 times during the debate. Like he's just so obsequious. The best thing in terms of the post debate or the debate searches, of course, was COVID-I. Which I have to give a little credit for static because the close up shots of Mike Pence's bleeding eyeball were like watching some sort of like 80s horror movie. I mean, it was, I expected some sort of snake to come running out of it at any minute. It was, and when you spend that much time denying that COVID is a bad thing and saying it's a blessing, how can you not look at his eye and start looking up? Like I was looking up symptoms of COVID and I know I'm being a conspiracy theorist myself here, but they were saying pink eye is one of the symptoms of COVID. And also his breathing sounded so labored when he was talking. It's everywhere. I mean, they're the notion and I do like the Susan Page actually. I believe she actually identified the Amy, Tony Barrett, whatever her name is. The super spatter event. Yes, as a super spritter event, the Rose Garden massacre. So I thought that was a little bold, but it's almost like it has it gets inflamed during the debate. And the reason why was doing some triage. The question I think is, does it work? See, all I saw and maybe I'm biased because I hate Mike Pence with the passion and burning fire of a thousand sons. But I just saw a guy who doesn't give a shit about women and who doesn't respect women and who talked over Susan Page and talked over Kamala and refused to, you know, he was like, I'm a mediocre white guy and I'm here. Well, that's I think why I'm speaking was trending and why so many women responded to that moment when she just turned to him and said, I'm speaking. I'm speaking. Weighted. And at one point, she said, if you let me finish, you're going to have a conversation. And he finally sort of meekly said, OK, but yeah, as it went on, Susan Page, no disrespect, but I wish she would have just pivoted to Senator Harris instead of just saying, thank you, Mr. President. Thank you, Mr. President, which doesn't work. But I think a lot of women responded to those moments because it was it perpetuated throughout the whole debate. I've always heard that eye rolling and interrupting is a really effective relationship. It's true. Yeah, that I women love eye rolling. They also like the one from as it as if to say what's with her. I actually want him to go what's up, Senator on the rag, but I'm fine. So I'll be here all night. But you know what's interesting to me? I did think her non visual cues were much better than his and they both felt the same things, right? But for some reason, her sort of smiling and laughing and then her face of abject sort of amusement spread in my mind. And again, of course, I'm biased because I hate Mike Pence. I thought it read better. I think one thing is as somebody who's done a lot of debate prep, when she was delivering her key lines, she was on camera. She was doing the engagement with the audience through the through the camera. A lot of time Mike Pence was flipping back and forth to Susan Page over to Harris, looking down a little bit. And he wasn't like doing a lot of this straight to camera delivery that is as convincing to viewers as I think what she was doing accomplished because, you know, Mike Pence naturally looks like he's like trying to shed a snake skin and he's not very, he doesn't come across as a very like straightforward guy to begin with. He comes across as a guy who's saying, hey, little lady, what can I do to get you into this beautiful 89 camera today? Yeah, just it. There's a little creepiness about him. And look, I think I think she could have hit a little harder on a couple of questions, like the court packing thing and just dismissed it. Right. And just said, oh, you're being an absurd. You're trying to feel the Fox conspiracy machine that's absurd, Mike, and it could have diminished him. But I think she did very well overall. I think she had a strong performance overall. I don't know if Mike Pence could overcome the most symbolic moment of the evening that we're just not talking about that. Which is that Mike Pence refusing the peaceful transition of power. Did that speak to you? Well, that spoke to me mostly in saying that Mike Pence will be in a Nuremberg trial someday. But I think that I thought it was interesting that a lot of pundits made the case that that was the same as the court packing. I think there's a there's a degree to which the assertion on the part of the president that he will not necessarily accept a peaceful transition of power. Mike Pence could have done a lot of good for both the candidate and for the campaign and for himself. If he had just come out and said, that's ridiculous. Of course, we're going to have a peaceful transition of power. And Donald Trump is going to win a glorious victory. Blah, blah, blah. But instead, he had to get weasily and he had to get his dick crooked. And the whole thing got more icky than it should have been. But I think Pence was legit afraid to say that. And I think he knows where his bread is buttered. And I really think he would have caught, you know, a bucket full of hate from the Fox fans. And the whole Trump crowd. And so I think he is honestly afraid to say that. And by the way, I think he was very clear. Do not think Pence is going to lift a finger when the shit hits the finger. Which in will, by the way, regardless of the decision. So, you know, I think for just a civilian such as myself, that moment was actually kind of separate from the packing the court moment. I did think Senator Harris handed that moment really well, which he did once again. Like you said, return to the camera and say, and did you know out of the 50 court lifetime appointments, not one of them was black. And Pence looked definitely uneasy and jarred by that as he was. But I will say the moment I thought was a little more subtly frightening when he was just sort of parroting Trump's answer. And I do wish Susan Page as well as Senator Harris would have sort of highlighted that more from sort of the civilian view or how disruptive and frightening that is. You know, Kathy, I think that's a really smart point because the idea that Mike Pence can be as duplicitous as Trump, but do it with a sort of more calm affect. Yeah. Is something people need to be aware of. And something people need to be very focused on. And I think that's a really good point is that he was doing every line of Trump, because look, he does have an audience of one here. You know, if he makes Trump happy and Trump says he's doing great, then Fox will say, Pence is doing great. And then the men will say, Pence is doing great. I asked a question of both of you. As you know, I used to be able to watch Fox from my act and now I can't even like do that anymore. Do you think that if anything did happen to Trump, do you think or not think that the Trump cult members will pivot to Pence? Or do you think they're just with their dear leader and Pence is never going to kind of cut it for them? What Trump has done to the Republican party is converted into a personality cult. And so, you know, if Donald Trump tomorrow got eaten by wolves, they would not jump to Mike Pence first. They would go to Kim Jong Un of the Trump family gone to. Oh, God, really? Yeah. Oh, listen, this is a. Oh, yeah. So what's the polling say? Like, it would be like Jim Jordan. Like, if they if they couldn't have Trump, no, it would be as the president of voters who say they are most passionately committed to Donald Trump. Their number one choice for 20 24 is Don Jr. Wow. Right after that, like eight points below that is Josh Hawley. Oh, my God. Yeah. How is Josh Hawley the same as junior? I guess they're both dumb. I actually thought Ivanka would be first choice. Seriously. Ivanka doesn't speak fluent dick. And that's what you have to do. You have the language of Fox and the of the oppositional defiant disorder of Trumpism. That's Don Jr's like, he's like a flu. It's a native speaker of that ship. Rick, are you going to say that that Josh Hawley is smart? I'm going to tell you do not underestimate Josh Hawley. He's not stupid. I just I'm telling you that not because I like him, but because I think he is going to be one of these people that tries to run Trump isn't through the car wash and pretend it's respectable. But plenty of evil people are not stupid, Molly. Right. Trump is evil and stupid, but the polling they have done some polling of Mike Pence and Joe Biden. And it Pence actually does better. Yeah, he actually does a little better because, look, say what you will with Mike Pence and I will, he is a much more standard issue Republican in terms of just the optics of him. Donald Trump. And it's the Frank Luns group saying he's robotic. Yes, exactly. But there are times when, you know, do you want to psychopath or a robot? I mean, I want to psychopath the robot, but that's me. I have a problem. But I also think you don't want us there. There's an unhinged quality to Trump that Mike Pence is not high. Right. Mike Pence is not obviously deranged. He's more the quiet guy who makes a skin suit out of you rather than the guy who goes on a bloody school shooting or something. He's a different kind of horrifying. Yeah, right. But he's not bringing the heat in the way that Trump brings the he's a business man. And he says stuff we're all thinking he does. He has none of those, those, I should say qualities. Now, what do you guys think? Because I don't really agree with the the pundits saying that the debate didn't change anything. Maybe it won't move the dial as far as a measurable vote count. But I will say you have to assume most people don't know Senator Harris. So I think this was a real opportunity for folks to actually get to know her a bit. But let me jump in with a fact on that because we just got the CNN poll. So she's at 59%. He's at 38% from that CNN poll. But her favor ability also went up greatly. Jesse, did they pull the fly? On your to 1% growth scale. Kathy, I think that's a good point because, you know, she's very poised. She's very smart. She's very polished. She also has some genuine human emotions that come across her face when she's frustrated or insulted. And she doesn't just do the robotic, you know, debater in transgents sort of debate tech. So long story short, I do think it helped her. Look, as a general vice presidential debates only help the winner. Yeah, if you're ahead, a debate helps you. If you're not, it doesn't. So what's going to happen if Trump's team does what they do and they declare that Pence won't and then people won't believe that. But here's the thing. Everything Mike Pence was talking about tonight was almost exclusively for the Trump base. I mean, let me tell you something. Yeah, right. Not a single real voter in the swing states who's not already a Trump voter is out there tonight, worrying about the Green New Deal. They really are obsessed with the Green New Deal. Well, and fracking. They think they've got these like two points of fracking and Green New Deal that are going to help them win Pennsylvania and Ohio. You know, those things work with the Trump base, but they are absolute non-starters everywhere else. Now, and just so you know, in the real world, nobody knows what fracking is. Like, I think if you sat people down and even just like, I almost wish Senator Harris would have explained what it is for 30 seconds. But most people, they just really don't know what that is. I mean, I think it's a giant issue, but they just have tied it to fracking equals jobs. Right. And so, you know, and look Biden, the people who do care about it in Pennsylvania, Ohio, they really care about it. Right. So they're trying to avoid a political train wreck there, which I did take the path of these resistance, but Trump's sort of apocalyptic. You will be doomed. They will destroy everything. The Green New Deal's pure communism. Yeah, it doesn't. It's just. What about when he threw in the red bead of a, mentioning ALC? Oh, I think he got it the first direction he'd had in mind.

Like they did a little bit of the CPAC thing they have been doing where they were like, they want to kill your babies. They want the babies to be born and then to murder them. They want to take away your hamburgers. Abortion's five minutes before they're about to get burned. I mean, they're having a little trouble with the abortion stuff because they killed 210,000 Americans. Yeah, that's a fairly pro life stance to 200,000 people. Last night's chat. Columbus Salves is a living person, but if we kill one in a thousand people. But grandma needs to die for the Dow Jones. Right. So I think they're having a little trouble with that, but they are very interested in the Democrats want to take away. They didn't say it tonight, but that whole midterm thing Democrats want to take away your hamburgers. They were, Pence was playing entirely to the base tonight. You don't think Pence went too far though trying to convince Americans that the Obama folks were spying on Trump? Like I thought that was the most out there one he brought up. That's just like Fox porn. No, that's too crazy. It is crazy. Like you think Senator Harris should have responded to that at all or just not let it sit there? I think she should have rolled her eyes and said, listen, your boss is flat on my Putin's bitch. End of school. They can't curse. Can they curse in those debates or no? Molly, how do you think that Senator Harris should handle the packing the court? Because as a lefty libtard, I just when he got saying say it, say you want to pack the court, I was like, yes, we've never wait to pack it. We're going to why going to Johnny wears bathels. Pack it. Yeah, I think that's not making it in there. That's getting beeped. Kathy, congratulations for being the first guest to get. Oh, I've done this. I've done this plenty of places. You know, the court packing is an interesting issue because clearly they are they can't answer that question. Right. If they say yes, everyone will flip out. If they say no, everyone will flip out. So you can't win with that question. You're better off just not answering it. Now, of course, I just think the fact that Pence wouldn't agree to the peaceful transition of power, which is like what democracy is bounded on. And then they're like, and see she wouldn't agree to the court packing. What I like about Pence and what I liked about Harris, what they both did was they didn't, they didn't answer any questions. And honestly, good for them. I mean, fuck the questions. Like she couldn't control that she couldn't cut off Pence. I mean, good for them. Good for Kamala. She Kamala. She shouldn't answer the question. Yeah, I thought she had to get some points across. And I thought, frankly, some of the, a couple of the questions were, you know, a little inside baseball. So I thought she did a good job of talking to the viewers about the stuff that she knows that they want to hear about. And I will say just as a female watching, you know, I did feel like Pence was doing a very classic gaslighting the woman. And it came across that way. So by the way, the gaslight men and women, but in a situation where they're only two of the women on the stage, it did point that out more. And it just, I just think you'll find a lot of women had a visceral at some level reaction to like, oh, I've been with that guy. I've been in a meeting with that guy. Oh, okay. This is the part where he runs long. Okay. Now I got to think about how I'm going to respond. I mean, we all know that feeling. I think that, I think that's right. I think he, there was a very small pool of, of gettable voters out there. And a lot of them are swing voters. They're women in the suburbs. And I just keep looking at that guy's performance tonight and thinking, yeah, that's the man's flaining and the, he didn't say it outright, but it was like, okay, a little lady a couple of times. And I think people are not, and look, I think, I think tonight they came into a very bad situation on the, on the Trump side. Donald Trump is, spent the last 48 hours tripping balls out of his mind crazy. He's tweeted a gajillion times. He's living a blessing, Rick. He crashed the stock market. The super spreader in chief, his numbers have dropped with seniors like crazy. The campaign is in full mutiny right now because of the infections. The White House is basically a ghost town. The Trump campaign started pulling more of their media down today and places like Iowa and Minnesota. They're, they're basically down to airing in on Fox News in DC to keep him happy. And so Mike Pence came in there tonight with a really bad thing. Also his insipient COVID infection because of his bleeding pus filled by. Yeah, let's talk about whether or not Mike Pence has COVID. Did you hear him laboring? That thing, Jesse, he said to us the other day of, you know, you lose your bottom octave and it's a little harder to breathe and, and that he was, he was huffing a bit today. So what I suspect that he could have gone in there, he could have had live Ebola. And he would have still shown up tonight. This was not a good performance for him physically. He looked, he looked terrible. He had a fly on his head for two and a half minutes. The headlines on drugs right now, of course, are the fly and the eye. So it's good luck. Is there a really headline on drugs? Yes. To add to that, I did the torturous thing if I watched the Pence cane debate today. This is Jesse our prettiest. Jones and Lawrence work, I might have. You're going to be extra gruel for that. So it works. Yeah, I'm a dedicated employee of the podcast, but very, very low energy tonight compared to that one. And I will say not the Mike Pence of four years ago, and I will say, you know, Tim came much, much easier to roll over, but like, really did not bring the A game tonight. No, but those two visuals are there's, you can't really argue with the fact that they are were genuine distractions. I mean, honestly, I kind of couldn't take my eyes off his eye because I was genuinely, of course, we could be connection between if he's ill or not. And then you get into this whole thing where you're sublimating, think you want, is you can admit it, who else is around him. And then of course, I'm thinking, I wish that Senator Harris wouldn't have shown up tonight. They should do this virtually. They're not playing. And then when the fly started and you're like, okay, that's too much distraction for me. I'm just going to work with her pretty eyelashes and listen to him go on and on. I actually think that's of my affect people. And also I'm curious to see Trump's reaction to the fact that the fly is now pulling out Trump. And what my understanding is the fly is now leading in Wisconsin. The fly is a leftist hero. All right, Kathy is our special celebrity guest. We need you to give us your fun, that guy. Okay, this is going to be pretty easy. Mike Pence, that guy. That's a guy that he was the sloppy seconds to Chris Christie. Ouch. And no, he's actual or as I call him the accidental vice president because we have an accidental president. It was a big accident, but it happened. And this is a guy that honestly, I think some of the sort of more, whatever you want to say, the classic Republicans really looked to him in the beginning thinking he can kind of sort of write this ship in a way. There was a time. Maybe I'm not a fan, but there was a time when he could write the ship. And so I think it's very difficult not to tie him directly to Trump. And it's shocking to watch him get indoctrinated like a freaking member of, you know, right wing ISIS go on his degenerate journey to becoming nothing but the crap under Trump's shoe. And it's like disheartening watching him tonight, his performance, so condescending with Senator Harris, so out of his league, eye rolling, shaking his head at the wrong time, not making any salient points, just parroting conspiracy theories that seem to get crazier as the night went on. I just looked at him and I went, fuck that fly. That guy. Love the fly. Rick Wilson, who is your fuck that guy? My fuck that guy is today. He's my returning champion. It's once again, the president of the United States Donald John Trump. I know I have a general rule not to have a repeating fuck that guy, but the psychopathic nature of his behavior is leading this country into enormous danger. He is talking about going back out on the road as early as next week to start in person events again. Now, they've refused to do contact tracing for the plague events that they were doing before he acknowledged he had COVID. There's there's now speculation he had it as early as Sunday, and we know he's not exactly wedded to the truth. So I suspect that his behavior of wanting to get back out there right away is to show he is strong man, but he has always spread this goddamn disease. He's going to cause more problems with this. This is a reckless and unbelievably dangerous position to take. But of course, that's what he's going to do because he is in fact an asshole and deserves the appellation that we are that we are prone to dispense in this podcast of fuck that guy. My fuck that guy is Rudy Giuliani. Rudy Giuliani. And I know this because of Mike Madrid got tested for COVID. I don't know if he ever got his COVID test yesterday back. But last night, there were photos of him at a GOP fundraiser not wearing his mask. What he should have been quarantining. So he is yet another super spreader in the Republican Party. He's my fuck that guy. My honorable fuck that guy mentioned is John wrack, Clifty current political commissar of the Office of National Intelligence, who is now furiously masturbating over a pile of documents in hopes that they will be blessed by some sort of psychic power. And they will release them and it will cause it will cause a thousand flowers to bloom in the Russia get conspiracy pushback. God bless everyone. On that note, we'll wrap up this episode of the new abnormal for the Daily Beast. In future episodes, we'll be talking with smart folks from the Daily Beast and beyond for media, culture, politics and science who will help us understand what's happening to our country and the world.
