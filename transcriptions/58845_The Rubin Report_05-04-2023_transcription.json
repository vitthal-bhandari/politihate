    "text": " I'm Dave Rubin and we are once again in DC and joining me today is the Republican Senator representing the great state of Wisconsin, Senator Ron Johnson. Finally, welcome to the Rubin Report. Well, I appreciate you having me on. I think I've had basically everybody here. You're a rookie on the Rubin Report. You didn't realize I was so elusive. Well, I told you right before we started, you have nothing to fear because I am unvaxed and this has become one of your hardcore things, what has happened with these vaccines? Well, it's tragic what's happened. And the pandemic has exposed so many problems in this country. The capture by big pharma of our federal health agencies, but also of the media and the big tech social media giants as well. And the American public has not been given the truth. The agency has not been transparent, so the big pharma companies have been transparent. And I'm certainly not an anti-vaxxer, but based on what's happened here, I've certainly started asking a whole lot more questions. So when you ask those questions, specifically in the hearings here at the Capitol, the Congressman and Senators get out there, it seems like we catch people in lies and Fauci will be caught saying we didn't do gain a function. We did. I didn't say masks. I did. I think one thing that people are getting very frustrated with now is that it doesn't seem like anyone pays a price at the end. Nobody gets fired, nobody gets removed for their job. It's like we live in this time of cancel culture, we'll cancel a comedian for a joke, and yet the people that are really doing some nefarious stuff, it's almost irrelevant. Well as it relates to the pandemic and the coronavirus, you've got the COVID cartel. And that is the Biden administration, the federal health agencies, big pharma, then the legacy media and the big tech social media giants. There you go. There's the COVID cartel. They're the ones collectively that sabotage early treatment. I can't tell you the exact moment that the decision was made that the only solution to the pandemic was going to be vaccines, vaccines, vaccines. And as a result, we better not have any therapies because it might be difficult to get an emergency authorization if there's those types of therapies. Because you actually can't, right? Technically you can't get the emergency. Well, I'm getting you. In Washington, do you say there are rules that tell people don't want to follow the rules? Fair, right? But the fact of the matter is I totally believe the doctors who say that hundreds of thousands of people lost their lives, they didn't have to because they weren't being treated early. And it is bizarre. I'm almost 68 years old. As long as I've been alive, the medical advice has always been early detection, allows for early treatment, produces better results, right? Do that with everything. We're trying to go in there, detect cancers early so we can treat them. But now with COVID, we were happy to spend tens of billions of dollars on tests. And we did spend tens of billions of dollars on tests. And you can argue about the PCR tests. Okay. And then so what good did that do? I mean, once the horses out of the barn, the cat was out of the bag, we weren't stopping the spread. So the testing didn't stop the spread. And then we told people, well, don't do anything. Go home. Be afraid. Isolate yourself. Hope you don't get so sick. You have to check yourself in the hospital where they'll inject about 3,000 bucks worth of room, desk fear in your arm that might take out your kidneys, put you on a vent, 89% of the people that put on ventilator never came off it, not alive. This was insane what we did. And yeah, I'm thoroughly convinced that this, I always called a cornucopia full of widely available, proven safe, generic drugs, used both unlabeled and off-labeled. They worked. I had enough people coming to me. I could refer them to doctors. I followed up on the case. I mean, some remarkable results. But it's all being denied. Now they're, you know, doctoring at different studies, under-powering, for example, use of iromectin to give it for three days on an empty stomach, well into the course of your disease. It's sick when you're aware of what's happening here and how the COVID cartel continues to cover up for its miserably failed response to COVID. But again, the body count is way too high. They can't admit they are wrong. And I just described using the COVID cartel. They have the power to make it almost impossible to prove them wrong. So that's why they're out taking away people's, you know, doctors certification that had the courage and passion to treat COVID. They're destroying these people. They're vilifying them. It's sick. So is there anything we can do about it? I mentioned here right before we started. I saw you a few weeks ago at Governor DeSantis. He's doing these blueprint events. I think the one that we were at was an education one, but you know, he's done one on COVID. He's got this panel that it seems to me some states might start doing some things, but maybe at the federal level. Well, you know what a lonely voice I am here in Washington, D.C. where most of my colleagues push a vaccine on their constituents. They don't want to admit they are wrong. Doctors don't want to admit they are wrong. Again, the COVID cartel will never admit they're wrong. So the only solution I have here is uncovering and exposing the truth. And that's what I'm dedicated to doing. I held, can't call them hearings or events. I did that after I lost my chairmanship. Now, as a chairman, this is odd too. Nobody else was holding hearings on early treatment. I'm the guy that holds a hearing first of all on February roundtable with Scott Galli who found out we don't make drugs here. We spent trillions of dollars. We didn't solve that problem. We wouldn't spend a dime on on shoring drug manufacturing. May of 2020, I held a hearing with Johnny Anidis trying to put things into perspective. You know, he did the analysis of the Prince of Screws, which pretty well stood the test of time now, right? The infection of tality rate of COVID crossed the, for anybody under 70 is actually less than a bad flu season. Okay. This was not a disease that we should have been freaking out about. Yes, serious if you're elderly, if you have certain comorbidities, but we never should have shut the economy down. So I held that hearing in May of 2020. I also had Pierre Corrie there talking about corticosteroids. He was savage on that until, well, I'm suddenly UK studied with dexamethasone, which is a corticosteroid, proved those were effective. We had the hearing with Peter McCulloch and George Fareed and Harvey Wish on early treatment in November. We were labeled the snake oil sales from the Senate by Dr. Jha who never treated COVID patient. Filed that up with the hearing with Pierre Corrie and Iver Macden. Then I got to connect with the vaccine injured community held events. Again, I don't have the power, but anyway, those early hearings, those weren't conducted by the help committees or I was doing that as chairman of Homeland Security. I'm in affairs. Again, I thought this was insane. They were shutting down our economy, but everybody seemed to be on board with that. Do you feel that really from day one? Because I always say to people, and as I mentioned, I'm unvaxxed. I've become sort of, I'm not an unvaxxer in the, as you said, in that traditional sense of the phrase, but once they started with mandates and after two weeks, to me, that was it. Once the two weeks became 15 days, I was like, something else is going on here. Were you feeling that really from day one? Well, as soon as I heard about that. I was like, grant everybody a certain leash. So if you don't expect you follow my clips, but I'm the guy who said, probably in March of 2020, well, it's in March, that listen, we tragically lose 36,000 people a year in the highway, but we don't shut our highways down. We need a transportation system. We can't shut the economy down. We can't shut it down. Fauci heard that comment and said, it was way out there. No, it was actually pretty good analogy. We never should have our economy down. Not even for a couple of weeks. Again, I understand the fear back then. And maybe that's what separated me from others. Well, that's fine asking. I wasn't freaked out about this. Yeah. I was concerned to me. You see the folks in moon suits, doctors treat COVID patients. They're dropping like flies. Yeah, it was something to be concerned about. But once John A. Anita stood there and I also saw the Princess Cruz and that certainly calmed me down. But I also understood the reality situation. You can't shut the economy down. And look at how we shut it down. Let liquor stores open, shut down churches, shut down all the mom and pop Main Street businesses, let the big box stores open. I mean, this was sick. Yeah. Bobby Kennedy writes in his letter to liberal, of course, a study conducted in 2021 said there was about a $4 trillion transfer of wealth from the middle class to the big tech social media giants. Yeah. Gee, why were they censoring information? Why were they pushing the shutdowns and be so supportive of, again, what I always call our miserable, our miserably failed response to COVID? Right. And basically we're all sitting at home ordering everything on Amazon instead of going to those, the few mom and pop stores that might have fought it or. So by shutting down our economy, by printing trillions of dollars, I mean, the economic devastation of the pandemic and how we mishandled it. I mean, I don't know if they're ever really fully dig, dig ourselves out of it. And then the human toll too. I mean, people died that didn't have to die. You mentioned following some of your clips. You had a clip about two months ago now on Meet the Press with Chuck Todd where he was going after you and you really threw it back to him. So I'm going to throw to the clip. You have a crime that you think Hunter Biden committed because I've yet to see anybody explain it is not a crime to make money off your last name. So check you out or read the Marco Polo report where they detail all kinds of potential crimes. You'll send a grass. Oh, well, let me stop you there. Potential. This is about about about about potential is about 30,000 about 30,000 dollars. I mean, Chuck Chuck Chuck is it a crime to be soliciting and purchasing prostitution in potentially European sex trafficking operations. Is that a crime? Because Chuck Rass and I laid out about $30,000 paid by Hunter Biden to those types of individuals over December 2018, 2019 about 30,000 dollars. This is about the same time that President Biden offered to pay about $100,000 of Hunter Biden's bills. Again, that's just some information. I don't know exactly what's your crime. It doesn't really look on the it sounds sleazy as you know, I'll take your I'll take it at your word that you're ethically bothered by Hunter Biden. I'm curious though, you seem to have a problem. Are you not? I seem to have a product. Chuck, you know, part of the problem and this is pretty obvious to anybody. By watching this is you don't invite me on to interview me. You invite me on to argue with me. Yeah, I'm just trying to lay out the facts that certainly center grass and I uncovered they were suppressed. They were censored. They interfered in the 2020 election. Conservatives understand that unfortunately liberals in the media don't and that's part of the things that part of the reasons our politics are inflamed is we do not have an unbiased media. We don't. It's unfortunate. I'm all for free press. That are more unbiased. Seems like you like fighting people on television. I can't wait. You were ready. You were ready. I kind of like to argue. Yeah. Yeah. You know, unfortunately in America today we don't have an unbiased media. We don't have journalists anymore. We have advocates for the left that you know Chuck Todd doesn't invite me on to interview me. He buys me on to argue with me or set me up. You know, use me as a foil to make his leftist point. You know, that was two years since I had a similar situation with him after January 6th where he said, you know, I think he accused me of a center. You're your your your sightings lighten the fuse. You're starting to fire. So no, no Chuck. You are. Yeah. You are. Okay. And it's true. I mean, for four years, conservatives have to watch the Russian hoax the growth where let's face it, the media set aside any pretense of being unbiased. And they said, no, we can't be we can't be unbiased because we got to take down Trump. We noticed that as conservatives. And you know, so you go all the way through them, then all of a sudden there are all kinds of irregularities in the election. They're just were. That's indisputable, but you couldn't talk about them. If you did, now, now you're a one of the insurrectionists, which by the way, there weren't thousands of armed insurrectionists. Yeah. I'm the guy that asked the FBI witness that that joint committee, the Senate committee. Okay. If there were, if this was an armed insurrection, how many guns do you confiscate? I had no idea. She might have told me a thousand, you know, zero is what she told me. You know, they also didn't have plans. That's what I could say. Was there anyone with a piece of paper that had a plan? Yeah. Also, we saw the video that day of people walking between the rope lines in the campus. That's not what an armed insurrection would look like. Yeah. Plus, you know, we were back in business in a few hours. Yeah. I didn't see any fires being started. So again, listen, we all condemn the violence. You know, it's tragic that that happened. Okay. But the vast majority of people came here on January 6 were here to protest peacefully, exercise their First Amendment, rights petition their government. They are not domestic terrorists, and yet they're being treated as such. And now we're seeing this multiple tier system of justice we have where the Justice Department of the FBI are putting record number of resources to persecute and prosecute individuals that weren't engaged in violence. But just to make an example of them, while at the same time they're completely ignoring, by and large, the 570 riots that occurred during the summer of 2020, 2,000 law enforcement officials injured a couple of billion dollars on the property damage, a couple of dozen people killed during those, a couple of people killed in Kenosha. We're supposed to ignore that and focus all on one day of rioting, which we all condemned. You can also go out and protest without a mask. What members of the left are condemning all the riots in the summer of 2020? No, they were condoning. Well, they were, you know, encouraging their followers to bail out the rioters. Yeah. Again, the double standard drives us nuts. That's what I was pointing out to Chuck Todd. It's, you know, you are so blatantly unfair, so blatantly biased, that inflames the situation. You're the one laying the fuse here. If the press were fair and unbiased, I think our politics would be a lot calmer and a lot less divided. Do you think anything's shifting there? So for example, you go on, you fight him back rather effectively. That clip goes viral. And then I think a certain amount of people do wake up a little bit and they go, wait a minute, wait a minute. Todd was acting like a Democrat lawyer here, not an honest interviewer. So is that, does that show you that something's shifting at all or is that a little Polly Anish? Well, again, I think truth has its own power. The problem is the truth is being suppressed and censored. And you know, what I've been telling audiences recently is I don't think the conservative movement has really grasped the, how pervasively and effectively the radical left has infiltrated every institution, not only of America, but globally. It's not a fair fight. It's not a level playing field. I mean, the master stroke in the US of the left was they took control of the university system during the Vietnam War protests in the 60s. So now they control colleges of journalism. So they're cranking out a bunch of radical leftists, advocates and education. And that is where they really are exercising their power. So now we're, what we are pushing K through 12 is it's obscene in some cases. Okay. We're trying to tell little boys, maybe a little girl or vice versa. I mean, you don't do that to children. Listen, we have compassion. You know, I understand there are people that are conflicted and we have all kinds of compassion. We want health folks like that. But at this point in time, all of a sudden transgenderism just exploding in our society. I don't think it is. I think it's being pushed on our society. And again, I don't think I've said this on camera before, but the fact that we have doctors and nurses that are mutilating children. I mean, that's, I mean, that's a serious operation as an adult to be, to be that, I guess, tormented that you actually undergo a sex change operation. I don't see how any adult can approve of that, you know, for a child. I'm seeing how you can do that. Did you see the clip? I think it was about a week ago where somebody unearthed the clip of Rachel Levine, you know, the deputy health secretary, whatever, where he, she, whatever says that, I hate this pronoun. I think it's so annoying. But he basically says that he's glad that he didn't have a sex change until after he had kids because his kids are the love of his life. And in the same time now, he's saying kids should undergo these surgeries. He's pushing that to forget for minors. And a minor get a tattoo, minor can't drink. And there's all, again, and there's a reason that we protect minors that way. Okay. Again, counsel people are kind of, but don't push it on them and don't mutilate them. It's irreversible. Now, of course, there are some celebrating cases of people, you know, transgender individuals who had the sex change and they kind of like to get their, their old gender back. Yeah. Oh, it's huge. It's huge. It's just, it's so hard to watch. I mean, my wife, she's always looking at these things and she wants from showing to me and I, you know, Jane, please don't. It's, it's, it's too awful to look at. It's just too tortuous. So when you talk to, or if you talk to your colleagues on the other side about this stuff, and this is what I ask literally every Republican, do the Democrats pushing it believe it? Did they? First of all, I don't talk to the Republicans. Well, no, I mean, yeah, I think this first time I've ever, you know, been recorded talking about, you know, this is mutilation of children. I talk about it. And we're just doing a bunch of events this weekend. I'm talking about Jordan Peterson came to Senate lunch about a half a year ago. And the point he made to you was conservatives were just terrible at defending conservative values. Then he granted us immediate absolution. He said, because we never thought we'd have to. Whoever thought we'd have to defend the benefit of having a mom and a dad. Listen, there are other ways. Okay. But can we at least acknowledge it's really nice for children to have, you know, a father who provides discipline and, you know, the mother, the, you know, again, that's a good arrangement. It stood the test of time. We never thought we'd have to defend that. We never thought our daughters would have to compete against biological males, then be expect to take a shower in the same locker room and then have a judge order the biological male take showers in the girls locker room. Never thought we'd be pushing back on school administrators that want to administer gender blocking drugs to our children and not tell the parents. And then I get, and then I, I'm literally going to say, and this was very uncomfortable to talk about, but I never, I never thought. I mean, I revere doctors and nurses. They saved my daughter with a serious heart defect, you know, open her surge at the age of eight months. I never thought I'd hear doctors and nurses would actually mutilate children because that's what's happening. I mean, how else can you, what else can you call it? I mean, you take away your God given body parts. Again, as an adult, I guess that's your right. Nobody should have the right to approve that for a child. You know, it's interesting. I don't know if you know, but I toured with Jordan Peterson for a year and a half. We did about 120 shows, 20 something in countries. So I do know who he is. So the reference didn't go over my head. But one of the other things he says about, about the transgender issue is that he says even for the people that clinically have gender dysphoria that truly at the end believe they are in the wrong body, just switching the body parts doesn't mean you're going to be happier or more fulfilled on the other side because you often end up with a series of other health problems and psychological problems. That doesn't help. Again, that's unfortunate. Listen, you know, we all have compassion. We do. We have compassion for people like that. But, boy, let's not, let's not force that on to show. I mean, kids are kids. You can throw all kinds of weird ideas into their head. You can destroy children if you're not educating them properly. And I would say that's pushing transgender and transgenderism on children is not educating kids properly. So let me let's just go deep into a couple things because I can sense you're not holding back here and you normally don't. So I'm not surprised. It's a good mutual. Well, so, you know, I got. Like a poet, Chateata. You would. So, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, so, I got reelected. I did not want to, you know, it's obvious. I did not want to run again. Yeah. I was so sick of the dysfunction of this place. The primary reason I ran again was because nobody else was advocating for the vaccine injured. I could not turn my back on them. Okay. But having won the six year term, what I've dedicated myself and I tell crowds is, you know, I am dedicated to, to naciously pursuing, uncovering and exposing the truth. Pick your hair. All right. What is the truth? All right. So, this administration to me seems either the most generous version of it would be that they are sort of willfully ignorant of economics and reality when it comes to science, gender, COVID vaccines, whatever, or they're actually malicious. I'm veering towards the malicious at this point that they cannot be that inept. Do you think that that's a fair, is that, is that, is that a fair premise? So, I was able to spend some time with David Horro was one time I went out to one day. And so I'm, I know his answer would be. So, so I'm talking to him and go, so, you know, David, you were a communist. Your parents kind of, he saw the light when his kindness about his murder somebody. That's why, you know, I said, so what is it with these folks? You know, what are they thinking? I mean, they see where socialism, kindness has been tried in the past. It's failed miserably. It didn't work economically. It resulted in totalitarianism. Tends of millions of people murdered. I mean, what don't they get said, no, they're, they're utopians. They just think if you give them the power, they're smarter and better angels than the Stalin's or the Castro's or the Chavez's. They're just giving them all the power. So I mean, I guess I'll take him to the word, you know, the, the, the do-gooders, I think they're utopians. They think they're just so much smarter. And of course, obviously by extension, we're stupid. We can't be expected to live our own lives. We'll destroy the planet. And, you know, so they're going to be the better angels that are going to tell us exactly how we need to live our lives, you know, how many times we, you know, what kind of cars we ought to drive. You know, never mind the fact that we don't have the rare earth minerals to produce the batteries or the generating power to, you know, it's all, it's insane. I mean, what, what policy of the left works? I don't know. I mean, I can't think of one. I mean, their economics don't work. I mean, a dolly held the start of the Biden administration is worth 87 cents a day. That's, that's a pretty rapid decline in the value of the dollar you held in your savings account in a little over two years. But what I, I thought it was the inflation reduction act. Doesn't that mean it reduces inflation. So, so now I mean, so now you had Goldman Sachs do a study published in the Wall Street Journal or they wrote a column on this saying that the $300 billion of tax credits for the green energy boom doggles is really going to cost about 1.2 trillion. And of course, Janet Yellen's for finance committee a couple of weeks ago and I asked, I laid out, listen, you know, these bank failures obviously are caused by the inflation, caused the Fed to increase interest rates, which devalued the bonds, put them into bankruptcy. Okay. Let's talk about inflation. For my standpoint, the three primary causes, massive deficit spending, that's the biggest one. Of course, your war in fossil fuel doesn't help driving up cost of energy. And then of course, the slightest locations from these idiotic shutdowns, right? She came back to, well, I don't think deficit spending is a major cause of inflation. So, she says that. So, right. So, I'm sure, well, she knows I said inflation was transitory. But when she says that, do you want to say to her, well, do you understand base like Econ 101? I mean, like, well, unfortunately you only have five minutes, which is a real problem with hearings. Okay. You can't get into a back and forth dialogue. You got five minutes. You got to figure out, which is one of the reasons I like my events. Yeah. You're like a COVID-19 second opinion. I'm there and I can ask them any questions for as long as I want to. And you actually have a good dialogue. You make sure it's a good dialogue. But no, I was pretty well shocked by that. Again, I don't think the public understands basic economics, but it's kind of frightening when the Treasury Secretary doesn't really, won't acknowledge the harm that all this massive deficit spending has caused. Again, now we're concerned about the money supply. That was the problem. The great depression is foolishly they allowed the money supply to decline to be reduced, which probably took a really bad recession, turned into a how many year of depression. So we need to understand these things, but we need to be honest and transparent about them. So what would you have done if you were in charge of the Fed and they tell you, okay, Silicon Bank is going down. Silicon Valley Bank is going down and this could trigger now, you know, 20 other banks to go down. And then that triggers the big one. I wasn't going for all the steps of spending, so we'd have the inflation we had. But you know, in that particular circumstance, let's go back to 2008, 2009. What I would have done there is I would have said, we're going to suspend this market rule because it's destroying these banks for no reason. The mortgage-backed securities weren't worth zero. You know, I know the market froze so nobody could sell them. So in effect, short term, they were zero. But by the way, I asked one of the Federal Reserve presidents recently, I'm not going to name them. I never determined what percent of value those mortgage-backed securities had. I don't think everybody's going to study in that, but it's probably about 90%. But we forced banks to mark all those assets down to zero, put them in a bankruptcy. Well, the same thing kind of happened here. Held in maturity, those bonds will be worth full value, but they were, you know, because of the duration risk. They had to write those things down. What I would have done is I would have come into Fed and I would have opened up a lending authority to the depositors where you could, okay, we're not going to have your deposits held up in a bankruptcy. You can borrow a set up to a certain percent. Pick your number, 80, 90%. Basically, so they could stay in business. So they could stay in business. But, you know, if they were so stupid and negligent not to have sweep accounts, people don't realize, okay, my deposit only showed up $250,000. When I had my manufacturing account, we also had a compensating balance. I was saying probably risk above that, but beyond that compensating balance for the things, you know, it would sweep into overnight CDs or whatever. So you help. So there is a way to mature. There's a way of doing that and people weren't willing to do it. So for their negligence, for their stupidity, they should take a haircut as well. I mean, obviously the shareholders are wiped out. That's capitalism. If you don't have a consequence for stupid and risky behavior, well, you just get stupider and more risky behavior. So the way the Fed has done this, and by the way, do you think they would have bailed out depositors if those depositors were oil drillers? Right, of course. Refineries, you know, or gun manufacturers. So you know, these were all the little wool businesses in Silicon Valley. They were doing everything, you know, green energy. So these businesses are probably never made money. You know, the, the, you know, we're probably going through cash soon they, than they needed to. Yeah. So again, all the way around the way the Fed has handled this has been, has mismanaged in what it'll probably do is it'll probably hasten the next banking crisis and make it worse. So is that sort of job? Is that sort of what the Fed wants? Do you think again, going to sort of the maliciousness versus incompetence thing that to me, it seems like the Fed always wants to get bigger. The machine just wants to get bigger, right? So okay, the more big things that we have that are too big to fail, we'll just keep making them bigger and then they'll be one bank and it'll be in this town. I mean, there are people, yeah, there are people saying this is the, just the, the game plan, the strategy to move toward a central bank digital currency, which would give me cause for concern. You know, I mean, it's long, long past to argue whether or not we should have a Federal Reserve or not. I think that's been, been decided they're not going to go away. Right. You're far better off with decentralized power. You're far better off with a lot of smaller banks. Now you need some, you do need some big banks, you know, do the big international transactions and do things that need big businesses too. Some things only big businesses can do. Okay. But what I've seen, for example, my plastics manufacturing plant, when I started that business in late 70s, early 80s, we probably had a couple, couple hundred potential customers. My guess is that's shrunken down to about 12 major ones because everything's consolidated. All these little, you know, individual manufacturing, you know, plastics manufacturers, thermo farmers and stuff and, you know, great little businesses for little towns and stuff. They get gobbled up and, you know, that manufacturing goes from theirs and too much larger plant. That's not good. You know, it's small businesses that are, that are the engines of innovation or economy and provide the kind of competition you really need in a competitive system. So I don't like to see all this consolidation. I think that's something that the federal government does have a role to play in terms of antitrust. I think we need to rethink and rework the antitrust laws. It's all around, you know, benefit of consumer and that makes sense. But you know, how do you handle these big tech social media giants where it's all free? So it's almost impossible to prove consumer harm. I think it can prove societal harm. When you start seeing the cooperation with government officials to censor information, I mean, something, something has to be done about that. But again, Democrats won't help us slightly on that because it, you know, plays their advantage. Is that the weird thing that we find out things like the Twitter files where we know without question 100% proof positive the government was coordinating with Twitter and Facebook, Saki even admitted a year and a half ago, but nobody cared about Facebook, that they were censoring people at the behest of the government. It is, that is, it's a violation of the First Amendment. That's, that's basically it. The show just goes on. Well, you're seeing the mainstream media screen about that, right? Oh, I guess we're not. No, exactly. That's the problem. Yeah. So we know about it. Yeah. You know, Fox News covers it, you know, a couple of conservative outlets, but by and large, the vast majority of American public is completely unaware of what happened there because they're being distracted down there. The news feeds by the Kardashians or, you know, whatever, whatever you get. Is that a push and pull that you always have to deal with as a senator that you probably could get more done on the ground just focusing on Wisconsin, but you're part of the federal machine too, obviously, as a senator. So that it's almost distracting from where you can get concrete things done. Well, again, the things I want to get done are reduce the burden of the federal government. And so when people come into my office, if you're looking for a government handout, I am proud to go into the, you know, the Democrat Center for Wisconsin. If you're looking to help get the government off your back, you've come to the right office. I'm here, you know, try to pull the vision of our founding fathers. You know, yeah, we need some government. You can't live in anarchy. You can't live in chaos. So you need some government, but needs to be limited because our founders, they came from tyrannical regimes. They realize as government grew, their freedom recedes. And let's face it, freedom is the essential ingredient in America. It's the freedom that people use to dream and aspire and build and create this marvel we call America. It's not big government. Big government crushes those dreams. Big government takes away that freedom. So you know, my goal here isn't to bring home the bacon to Wisconsin. My goal is to shrink the size federal government. So Wisconsinites can aspire and dream and build and create. Let's do a couple of other, the big ones. This Ukraine situation, which we are, I think it's around $160 billion now. It's weapons. It's not a declared war. But at some point, in my opinion, if you're funding a war, wherever you're kind of at war, I think you're pretty much in the same spot as that. What do you make of this? Is there any off ramp every week? We have spokesman telling them, no, there'll be no negotiation. I mean, it's all very bizarre. I'll give you a little more fulsome answer because I think it requires one. Yeah, I was chairman of the European subcommittee on San foreign relations ranking member. I've probably been over Ukraine as much as just my name and my colleagues, right? I was at Poroshenko's inauguration. I was the only member of Congress since Zilinko's or Zilinko's. Zilinko's the doctor that... Right. But yeah, so Zilinko's inauguration. I thought he was the real deal. I know that Ukrainian people are. They want to shed themselves of the legacy of corruption. And to describe it for you, his prosecutor general, when I was over there, he said, let me describe corruption in Ukraine. We have some like 22,000 prosecutors in Ukraine. We don't pay them well, but they live like kings. I mean, that's the endemic corruption. Okay, so the Maidan, that was a scream. We want what you have in the West. I mean, I have nothing but sympathy for that, right? I have nothing for sympathy for a country and for its people that are invaded by an evil war criminal. And that's who Putin is. Okay, so I don't want to give any aid and comfort to Putin whatsoever. And I want to support the courageous people of Ukraine. But... I think there was certainly a way of preventing that invasion to begin with, but not under Biden, obviously. Okay, so once invaded, once the one opportunity we might have had when Russia was felt the resistance, because the Kurds are Ukrainian people and the support of the West, which I supported that first tranche, partly because we had to replenish our munitions that the commander-in-chief can just deplete our stockpile, so we had to replace those as well. There was a moment in time, it was a glimmer hope where maybe Russia would say, well, we've been off way more than we can shoot. Let's return back and let's end this. But that was quite a while ago. Now the reality situation is, you know, you don't have a fair fight here. Putin can continue to send in cruise missiles and bomb population centers, infrastructure. I mean, this war just continues to grind on, and just more and more of Ukraine is destroyed. Now, both sides are losing individuals, but certainly when I've asked people the State Department, well, what's the public opinion polls in Russia? There's highly support of the war. Well, why wouldn't they? They've got Putin's propaganda. They're not getting their cities bombed. So it's a completely unfair fight. There's no way Putin gives up on this. There's no way. It's existential for him. So it's a reality I hate, but at some point in time, everybody's going to have to face a reality. Every day this goes by, the eventual outcome just gets worse and worse and worse and worse and worse. It doesn't get better. So when you hear our State Department or even Biden saying that the Ukrainians don't have to negotiate, which is what they've said repeatedly over the last couple of weeks, I mean, what do you make of that? How does this get better? Give me a scenario in terms where we turn the thing around and you end up with a better result than what you have right now. If you were to just stop fighting right now, how does it get better by continuing the fighting? Again, it's a horrible reality. I hate saying this because I don't want to give any aid and comfort to Putin. I guess I would just ask everybody, including Putin. Right now, this is a lose, lose, lose situation. There is no other than maybe China wins. But I guess I would just ask everybody to kind of temper what they're thinking. We shouldn't be contemplating going to war with either Russia or China. There's no good outcome on that. Okay. They're kind of coming together right now. There is no good outcome on this. I mean, we've got a recognized reality situation. I mean, China is growing their military, their navy. They get a lot more bang for the buck than what they spent on military. So, again, it's maybe not a reality. I like to contemplate, but it's a reality you have to accept. So I mentioned that I saw you a couple of weeks ago at this blueprint event in Florida that Governor Insanza was holding a bunch of governors and senators and Congress people. Obviously, a lot of your message definitely resonates with the Trump side of things. What do you make of this push and pull over the last week or so and what's going on there? Well, I've always been a firm believer in Ronald Reagan's love commandment. And I've always thought, no matter whether it's for a school board position or a primary in a state race or for a national one. So, your best strategy as a candidate in a Republican primary is show Republican voters how you defeat the radical leftists you're going to be running against. Now, show people what you bring to the table, your qualifications, and don't denigrate the other guy who just or gal who just might be our candidate. Because it's a team sport and whether you're the candidate or somebody else's, we want that the eventual nominee, Republican or conservative nominee, to win. Yeah, by the way, talking to enough Republican voters, most people agree with that. They want to hear the positive things about you. They want to hear the negative things against the Democrats and the radicals. How are you going to defeat the Democrats as opposed to how are you going to rip your Republican opponent? So, I just personally don't think that's a particularly good strategy. Yeah, I keep saying to people, it's the two things that I'm looking for and that I think my audience is looking for, competency and the ability to communicate it. You give me those two, even if we disagree on some of the periphery. It's like that'll be just fine. Would you say you're hopeful that we can turn this America back around to what these guys were fighting for? I would say the number, normally I start out with speeches. I just warn audiences, I'm not the most uplifting. I heard you say it at the end of my life. I'm all saying too, you're much better off getting me as a speaker where there's cocktails around. Kind of take the edge off a little bit. We can make that happen right now. Again, I'm beginning to reality. I've come from manufacturing background. It doesn't do you any good. You can't solve problems if you're not willing to acknowledge that you have a problem. You're not, you know, deluding yourself is never a good strategy. And I've been pointing out to your audiences that Venezuelans voted themselves in poverty. An oil rich nation, a successful South American nation, what an election. They voted themselves and put themselves on this destructive path. Right now America is on a very destructive path. Again, picking up the theme that conservatives haven't truly grasped how effective and pervasive the left has infiltrated these institutions. We our eyes are open. We think we see the truth. This just looks like Governor Sanders said, this is normal versus crazy. We know we're normal. Okay. But we have to, we have to understand this crazy has not been defeated. If anything, it's, it's still on the rise. You got to give the devil is do. Okay. So we're going to have to advise strategies and how can we effectively push back on this? Because it's all the, all the stuff's being done in the radar. Remember how obviously the left is teaching our children critical race theory. Obviously, obviously they're pushing transgenderism on our children. They'll never admit it. It's, quite an honestly, it's only probably COVID and online learning that brought to the surface and brought to the attention of parents. That was a, you know, the pandemic was an awakening for a certain percentage of the population, but probably not a majority. And again, the majority of the Americans still get their news from legacy media. They're, they're not going to be talking about this stuff. I mean, you don't see 60 minutes leading with an expose on, you know, transgenderism being pushed in our children or critical race theory, you know, inflaming the divide between racial. No, they actually put, they'll do a lie, a hit piece about someone pushing back. Yeah. I mean, right now we've got a Wisconsin Supreme Court race going on. It's crucial. I mean, the left realizes because if they can, this will flip the court. If the radical left is the judge wins this thing. Okay. So the left realized that that, you know, she'll become a super legislator and Wisconsin Supreme Court will become a super legislature. And they'll overturn whatever games we've got. They'll redistrict and we may lose two house seats. And so the, the left is pouring millions of dollars into this race. There are credible charges against the, the liberal justice. Okay. She, she married when she was young and elderly. I think it was a judge. She had apparently had a drinking problem abused him, I mean, elder abuse. These are credible allegations from people, you know, a stepson. Other people that are willing to put their, you know, name behind this stuff, you know, freely use the N word in her official capacity in the court. Okay. Now, I'm going to have it even heard about this at all. Precisely. Everything you need to know. If that or if those credible allegations were attached to a Republican candidate, local news stations, they'd be breaking to the first moon landing to bring you this important news. Instead, what local news is doing is they are covering the fact that she is saying she's going to sue these journalists for defamation. So again, you're completely marginalizing the charge and all you, you're not covering the charges. You're just covering the she's, you know, being defamed. So it's not, again, it's not a fair fight. It's not a level playing field. And the sooner we come to that realization, then start developing strategies around that. The only hope we do have, but no, I'm, I'm not the world's greatest optimist when I hear somebody call us on big optimists. Well, okay. You know, where's your head? Right. I always say to be a lot of world weary optimists. I don't think, and I suspect you probably are too in a certain way that you probably couldn't really do this every day if you didn't believe you could affect change. Yeah. Yeah. Bobby's. Yeah. Okay. I mean, again, I, I have to believe the truth has its own power, which is why, you know, my dedication in the next six years literally is pursuing uncovering and exposing the truth. All right. Then I got two more for you in short order. If your phone rings and it's maybe one of those guys that we talked about earlier, either Trump or DeSantis or maybe somebody else and they say, Hey, I could use some help here. You know, VP, something like that. Does that have any interest to you? I mean, clearly, clearly you're a fighter. I mean, that's obvious. For I would not expect that. Okay. And you know, helping out the administration, that'd be hard. You know, listen, if you get called on by, you know, a president elect or something like that to serve your country, I mean, it's a thing I was called on here. That's why I did it. That'd be kind of hard to turn down. But I certainly don't expect be offered something like vice presidency. Then I got one more. If your phone rings and it's Chuck Todd and he says, you want to do meet the press again? What do you do? Absolutely. Last time I was on there saying, I was trying to do this remotely. Yeah. Bring me in the studio, Chuck. You know, pick up the phone. Was it their offer to only do it remotely? Well, I wasn't available. So no, I'm, but I offered right right on there. Yeah, let's do it. Yeah. The phone hasn't run yet. So he had me on and it kind of blew up after January 6th, who's two years later, blew up again. Wasn't my intention to blow it up? But at some point, I'm looking at every two years, you know, I've got a regular gig. I meet the press, I guess. No, listen, I'm not afraid to defend what my beliefs are. And truth be told, I do like to argue. I think it's a really good way to flesh out, you know, the issues. And by the way, if in the end, you know, I'm defeated in an argument, I'll change my position. Go on. You made some pretty good points there. I mean, that's, that's the way life is. You have to have a flexible mind. You have to have an open mind. I think that's one of the things I found most disturbing during the pandemic still is just the lack of open mindedness. It's like, here's, here's the narrative. Here's what our, you know, the car tells telling us. So, you know, again, the disappointment in doctors is not, not primarily being responsible to their patients, you know, just, because I've heard the tragedies in hospitals, family members are going, please God, just try. I'm going to have to just please give it to them. Don't do it. Don't do it. And then just watch the loved one die. And they couldn't even be by him. They were prevented from visiting. I mean, that has not been exposed to the extent it should be. I mean, the, the, what happened in hospitals, the, the lack, the loss of freedom when you checked yourself into hospital, which is why a guy like Paul American, my, my second pinion event just said, you know, I hate to say it, but the hospitals like the last place he would go and again, he was critical care specialist. I mean, he, I mean, here's a guy just real quick. Because it's really powerful. Tell, tell, tell you, you should put the link onto my rumble account on the second, but, but his testimony this, he's, he's critical care specialist. So he's taking care of patients way later than he should. Okay. But he has a 50% death rate of the other people because he's using all these things. So his death rate is 50% of his colleagues. So what do you think the hospital did? Pity Medal on him? No, no, what they did is they took away his, his tools. They, they forbid him from using Iremectin, these things, including vitamin C, but they looked him with seven patients. And this is with the powerful Tesla. So they, they tied my hands. They took away my tools. So all I could do is sit by and watch my patients die, including like a 30 year old mother. That's what hospitals, that's what the COVID cartel did. And now they're out destroying people. And you know, so the, in the end they took away his hospital privileges. So here's a, a world or now in critical care specialist, really can't practice in hospital anymore. I mean, they're, they're, they're taking away certifications of these doctors, suing people like Peter McCulloch, you know, terminating their employment. They're going to make an example of them. Of course, that's how they kept everybody else in line. I'm sympathetic with that. Doctors, they spend, you know, a decade plus getting trained, getting their certification. You know, if they've got 300,000 hours with a student loans to pay off, they have to make a living. Plus they want to be doctors to help people. They just couldn't step out of line or else they risk losing it all. That was purposeful. I can see why Chuck Todd only does this once every two years, but I'll do it more than that. How about that?
