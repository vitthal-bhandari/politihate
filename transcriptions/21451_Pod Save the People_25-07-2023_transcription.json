    "text": " Hey, this is Dorei and we're going to pause here with the people in this episode. It's me, D.R., and Miles talking about all the things you don't know with regard to race, justice, and equity from the past week. The news that we're underreported or unreported, that you should know about. And then I have the pleasure of sitting down with the one and only writer Christian Cooper to talk about his new memoir, Better Living Good Burning. Notes from a black man in the natural world. I learned so much. It was incredible. You will too. Family, welcome to another episode of POD Save the People. I am D.R. Ballinger. You can find me on Instagram at D.R. Ballinger. I'm Aussie Johnson. You can find me on Instagram and Twitter at Pharoah Rapture. This is Ray at Trita on D-E-R-A-Y or on X now as Elon would like us to call it. But you know, mama called it Twitter. I'm calling it Twitter. You can not dead name X. Yeah. Yeah. If they them, she, her ex wants to be called X now and not Twitter. We're going to respect that. What was behind that? Was it just like he just was on a yacht vacationing and just came up with this idea or is it like an idea based on something that is thoughtful? Apparently, he's always wanted to name a company X and hasn't been successful. Apparently, when he was a part of PayPal, he tried to rename PayPal X in the board, forced him out. And that's how he got Peter Thiel. Interesting. Yeah, that's really weird. I guess everybody, I mean, not everybody, but I guess like a lot of like diabolical evil wrongdoers have like their one thing that they're fascinated with. I guess like for Mojo, JoJo, the power of girls and for, you know, Elon Musk and sex. But I guess I kind of just vaguely get like being weirdly obsessed with a number or a letter and kind of being like, Oh, I want everything to match. I think this most of us just go buy something. Go buy a mug, not a app. I'm like, can we just get to the bankruptcy part? So there's a new owner and we go back to normal. Like when is the reset on what's going on over Twitter? An all serious story because you know that, I mean, I just look at the branding and Twitter is like very like early millennial internet branding when everybody like Instagram that kind of like like fluffy the X has a black background. It's a little distress and it looks a little like, you know, the new Republican conservative. You know what I mean? Like it just looks like that. That is like the underlying reason why the reprints happening just to feel more welcoming to this new birthing conservative. I can't speak my mind anywhere. Don't call me Sis community. I think that might be a part of it. I also think that he's like, I think that what is good about this young moment for people, even though Lord knows we are struggling through it. I was at your school at home, man. Yeah. This is not real to me. There's a difference between like money and genius and he just has money. Like that's what everybody is seeing right now is like this is that these decisions are not brilliant. They're not smart. They're not. And I think before he really was benefiting from the glow of genius, it was like, wow, he must have really. And I think that that window is completely closed. Yeah. And I think a lot of like even like him doing Tesla and Tesla, you know, during his life time being a genius, but like the name absorption. Yeah, I think you're spot on with that. I'm just looking at page six. Evidently one of his children's name is X. He named one of his kids X. But that is of the obsession that is not he also has any other obsession. No, I think I think it is an upset. Yeah. And I think it is mental illness, obviously. And the other thing that worries me about him is that he has 10 children. Did you all know that? Now you lay with the last man with a man with the last name of Musk. He just says things now. What I don't like that. I mean, it's given me Nick Cannon because the headline of this article is who are Elon Musk's kids is 10 children's names, ages and their mothers. I'm like, again, when do we get off the train? Like he has taken us on a crazy ride. OK, cool. Let us go to Sanityville because this is a lot. I guess the last thing I'll ask about it because I've been dying to ask the story about this all week is so do you think like this is the last stop? Oh, because my whole thing. Shout out to threads and spill or whatever, like, you know, live your dreams, pursue them, whatever. But my, like, my hunch is, oh, if Twitter implodes and stops, that's a sign that we should stop talking on the same app at the same time together as a as a world coming to the world. Like I'm totally down to say, oh, that was a failed experiment. There's no, that's not even try to do that again. They get everybody in the world together to talk about things, even as I look at the trinity topics now, there's wars, there's doja cat there. It's just, I don't, I don't know. I don't think we're really made to be disconnected. I think we I think if it is you know, just about connection and bringing people together, it would be wonderful. But it's actually about leveraging misinformation, disinformation, psychological warfare onto Twitter users and using the app for evil. That is what is messing us up. I think when it is just about the people coming together, I think that's a beautiful thing, but it's it's like that is the means to the end for for the people who want to control the world to be able to use that. I sound like a conspiracy theorist this morning, but you do sound like you. I do think that that I think that there will always be a place where people do real time things. What is the place of after Twitter? I don't know. But I think that Twitter, my my read of Twitter is that it crashes and burns under Elon, somebody buys it and it like comes back. So that's sort of that is what I hope happens. I used to find it useful, like nothing about I guess we're thinking about. Cause I think the thing with Twitter is it when it booms, unlike Instagram, it's Facebook, when it booms, when Twitter booms, it had such a, um, a moral political boom that it felt necessary. I don't like I feel like when Twitter got really popular, you're like, this is the new reporting activists are on here. Intellectuals are on here. It's not just popular pictures or pictures of food. This is real things happening. Do you think that with Twitter existing or not existing? Do you think that we as a culture have surpassed? No, I think something will fill the void. I think that like when things happen, you will need a place to go to be like, what happened? And I think that spill is like the cool kids room and threads is, you know, this is the hard thing about threads is I think threads try to lean into the bare bones too much. And it's just like, I can't find my likes. It's no turn like it. It feels like Twitter when it first started and you're like, we already went through that thing. Like that's that's too. They went too far back. It's like we did that already. That's why they had a 70% dropping user, uh, and, and user, whatever, um, user using it. Wow. Threads, threads had a 70% drop offing and like user usage, uh, like a week after launch. And it's like, that makes sense to me. Cause it's like, it's like very 1.0 Twitter and you're like, we, we can't search any that can't search names, cancelers topics. Can't say it was like, this is not what I want. But anyway, they're more important things to talk about than wild Elon. Uh, like wild DeSantis, is that a more important thing to talk about and the new Florida Department of Education standards for how they are talking about. The history of, of, of slavery in Florida. Oh, the new teachers really teaching this though. Uh, I think some, you know what was actually derived this, an aside, but sort of related NPR, maybe, and this American life, maybe two Sundays ago had a whole, the whole episode was, was, um, was about Florida and how people during COVID, in particular, moved to Florida because of the, because schools were open and they were that, you know, and they weren't masking, but it was fascinating to hear how people like literally just so admired DeSantis that they picked up their lives, their families and relocated from places like New Jersey to Florida. So just as interesting to me, because I think to answer question, yes, I think there is like obviously a demographic of people who are very much like, ah, that makes sense to me. That's right. And it's like the same category of people who are like, but we treated our slaves so nice. They were treated nicely. And, you know, I'm, I'm not the, I'm not the youngest chicken, but I'm still really, I'm still young, you know, and I went to school, elementary school, middle school, high school in Georgia and middle school in elementary school in Georgia proper, like not Atlanta, Georgia, Georgia, like it's definitely making sense to tell you the hometown because nobody would know it. But like having the teachers I grew up with and having the teachers there that like I knew and stuff like that, like it's just so imaginable to me because the, if I can make a whole book just based off of the 100 most racist things that I've ever heard around, you know, social, social, I had a teacher tell me that, um, that black people liked, like, like too calm me down. She did what he would be choosing being like nice races. She was like, she was like, oh, don't worry, black people are not, you know, people are not good at algebra. That's just not what don't, don't cry. I was getting frustrated. I wasn't getting it. She's like, don't cry. Black people are not like, she was sweetheart. Like she was like, go, go, go play basketball. Yeah. That was like, she said the last part, but that was her whole thing. She was like, black people are just every community is good at something. And that's just not what you're good at. And just wild things like arguing in a real argument about the basis, one of the biggest of the Civil War beings, um, slavery, like one of the reasons why we were in the Civil War and having multiple teachers just say like that nothing to do with the Civil War that is miscommute, like just arguments. I've been an eye assess for that argument many times. I have friends who we still talk on Instagram when we see each other that had, we're in the same school who like we all got together and like argued and it makes it just, I just already see it happening. I know those teachers, I know the environment and this is just a green light to do really what they've always been doing because that's how I was educated. And this, there's a quote from the scientists. I think what they're doing is, I think what they're doing is, is I think that they're probably going to show some of the folks that eventually parlayed, parlayed, you know, being a blacksmith into doing things later in life. For what? What are you talking about? This has given me all my little high school flashbacks. We also, what do you, we also went with the blacksmith recreation and high school in middle school. And it took me a minute years to figure out, wait, all those white people were supposed to be black people. It wasn't a blacksmith, I'm trying to recreate it and go to that and be a blacksmith. It took me minutes. I was like, where are these Amish people at in the three books? I was like, oh, y'all are supposed to be slaves or enslaved people or, yeah. No, I think that like that, that re-narrative is just such a whistle. It's just a whistle. Like you don't believe that. We don't believe that. But the people who you're even listening to don't believe that you just want them to know that you're willing to be on the side of white supremacy other than the truth in certain things like that and ideas like that show people, okay, you're actually loyal to the institutional white supremacy and not, and not truth. And that is what it costs to be a Republican. And it's a reminder that, you know, as much as it is the structures and the laws, it is the stories we tell that shaped the way people think about the world and they are invested in reshaping the stories. I think about, I don't know why I was in DC at the Bible Museum, there's a museum of the Bible. And they were talking about the slave Bible, that during slavery, slave owners, there was a version of the Bible that we only have a couple copies left of where they removed every single instance of rebellion. And that's what the slaves got. And we know it exists because they have some slave owners who are invested in burning it. They like destroyed them, but there are some left and it's like, yeah, you're making all these people become Christians and like literally removing every instance of people rebelling because you need to control the narrative. Like the narrative is so much a part of how this functions. Don't go anywhere. More potting to people's coming. The recent Supreme Court decisions striking out affirmative action, student debt relief, and basic rights for LGBTQ people deserve no respect from us. Put on a T that shows you dissent and turn on the latest episode of Strixscrewdney to hear Leah, Kate, and Melissa break down the latest batch news from the court. Head over to cricket.com slash store to get your T now. So today I bring in some some sad news. So this is actually something that I like revisit a lot on the podcast because a I find it interesting next to like the burgeoning new black conservatism. I also kind of I think that because of all the conversations that we're having around trans people. I'm also really observing and aware about how other people react to those those discussions and those advances. And I'm not a fan. So the person who I'm talking about is just hilarious. Just hilarious is the comedian who you might know from co hosting on the breakfast club also being on Wild and Out. She's really popular on Instagram and her demographic. She skews, you know, black, mostly black women and you know, the 18 to 35 or probably like 18 to 40 or maybe older, like age racket and she's in she is a popular comedian. Two days ago, she got on the internet was responding to one soul person. She was getting the conflict with who was trans and then just kind of like says kind of the most of vitriolic thing that you can think of to the train to the to the entire train community instead of like, you know, saying something to one person and says that, you know, I'm a natural born woman and who's gonna protect us and and and is kind of saying all these things that are alluding to a of course trans women not being women, but then also that there's a hierarchy in women, humanity and oppression and and and either in a black women are the only are the only real black women. And then also that they're that black women are also the most vulnerable and even trans women in their engagement with us is like a kind of like. Like a like a like a kind of like a reinforced misogyny like seeing trans women as just men in dresses who are telling quote unquote real men women what to do. That's just kind of like this counter narrative that's been that's been coming out and without any kind of like critical analysis. So she says this it goes super duper viral and. It's it's just wild to me you all because there's so much going on. And I like I tweeted it out like yesterday. I'm just like you're with the fending something I said is count time on this podcast alone. I'm like you're not even included in the gender binary you're defending. You know, I know it's like a tired tired tired like ABC talking point, but it obviously needs repeating. I'm like we when everything was when the dust was settling and we look at social life here specifically being from the south and maybe because I grew up with such remnants of it, but it's like no it was men, women colored it was how we were engaged with during even chattel slavery was was divorcing us from any gender and the only reason that truly matters to us is because gender in the society is how you're getting that how you often get granted humanity. So us getting granted gender and humanity help was important even the sign that we put on our chest. I'm a man. All these things were shouts and signals of showing that we are gender people because we want to be seen as human people and other that conversation is expanding and we're kind of editing stuff. It's just interesting to see some of the people who have the loudest things to say and the most violent things to say towards the community are the people just hilarious who would benefit from it all. This is a sticky part of the conversation, but a lot of people were bringing up I forgot that the woman's name the woman the cis woman who just died because a man thought she was trans. So she was killed because I mean thought she was trans just hilarious is actually talked about different experiences where somebody because of her voice or because of how she performs her own gender people assuming her to be a trans woman and asking her this is you know she said this sort of kind of time but like asking her to go on dates and then not saying not want to go on dates or somebody getting mad at her and saying something transphobic in order to diminish her we see the same thing happen to Serena Williams, Michelle Obama. I say all these other things that no trans issues are selfishly assist black women issue and then if we even think altruistically just as a community just because trans people trans women because we are human we should be able to be great in certain types of conversations in certain types of leeway. It's just what's disturbing and I don't know I want to see y'all's opinion you know. So I think that's the right is repping the same the same hometown and I just felt like we got we got to talk about it we got to dissect it and then maybe figure out like what is I think I'm most interested in what is the conversation to have. So every single time where at this point of conflict culturally we don't go back to square one I think that's the thing that's most exhausting is that it feels like I'm telling people things that Laverne, Cottagena, Mox said almost like damn there 10 years ago you know and kind of gave their whole first 10 years in order to educate people on the ABCs 123s and people are like throwing out the window saying no like how do we avoid that happening if there's any avoiding it. I was both disappointed in Jess Layers and unsurprised because she said other problem and you know I remember when she was homophobic and then was like I didn't mean it did it but you know I love gay people and you're like okay girl like this is this is a this is who you are. I think the only thing I'll add to add to what you've said is that what strikes me about Jess hilarious that's so interesting is this defense of womanhood but she so famously doesn't defend women and that I think is interesting so you know Russell Simmons is you know Taren Camore down she is on Russell's she's like how dare you criticize that man you know when and that's like a pattern there was another black woman too who something happened to them and like Jess just was on their side and I say this because she is actually a poet she is like reminds me of Bell Hooks reminding us that patriarchy is something that everybody participates in I think that that is what Jess to me is a poster child for a woman covering for patriarchy and calling it feminism like she nails it and it is there's actually not a more cookie cutter like explanation of it than her she just like defends patriarchy she finds her power in it that is where her comfort is she jokes and mocks women in the name of patriarchy and then she's like I'm a feminist and you're like wow you are you are like I wish Bell Hooks could write about you because it's almost so pitch perfect that it is a caricature yeah when Bell Hooks says patriarchy has no gender like she is the picture of like this is literally it's like wow well you all have very intellectual analysis of this young woman me not so much sis really wants to be famous like so badly and that is an issue with our culture and with our community we don't have to talk about a girl who was saying she the whole abduction thing when I'm gonna get into that alleged abduction everybody wants to be so famous and I felt like for Jess who I'll assume has a lot more good sense for what she is showing knew that that was gonna be a scandalized topic knew what she was saying was going to go viral and that's why she said it period okay it's been one thing after the other with this gal saying wild things stunting like all of it so I mean it it everything that you all are you both are saying is true but I really I do believe that this is much more a show I can't it yeah yeah I can respect that I will I will double back and I checked and she defended Bill Cosby Jesus but that's the same it's more she wants to go against the grain so that she can get people can talk about what I'm saying the only thing I don't disagree with you but what's it what what is interesting is usually she's saying this either to herself but people who are she saying it around often agree with her you know part I don't think it's strictly like kind of like being a contrary and I'm saying what I want I think it's I think what's kind of disturbing is that she does represent a lot of people in how they think and she activates people who are like no why are you calling me assist women right now when I'm a woman you know why you know not knowing that like you know we also don't go around call each other mammals but it's a medical you know scientific term and now the trans issues talked about so we're using a medical term to talk about a medical thing in the culture so that's why it's been absorbing the culture but like to her and other people it's just been something that's invented so I'm using that as an example of like how they're kind of she's like they're kind of like Trojan horse of like somebody saying it who's famous you know so I don't want to make it so much she's just solely a one individual makes me so sad yeah she's famous and remember that she also famously uh definitive Tori lanes and joke about Magna stallion so it's like again it's like you she just is she is about she is the bell hooks critique it's like the defender of patriarchy and then I just saw literally in this moment um you you probably didn't see this because Angelica just posted it four minutes ago I'll show you this is a just hilarious DM'd Angelica Ross to to taunt her about the period conversation well let me see this she just like Angelica Ross just posted this literally like while we recording oh wait let me read oh okay still couldn't print sorry so this is what just hilarious has said to Angelica Ross be a DM so if I say something anything wild it's I'm quoting something still couldn't produce if you tried homie help homie oh my god Angelica Ross's dead names a new way to bleed huh a lot of y'all got more and more stupid by the effing days the gag is we got it in your never gonna get it never gonna get it so she went to Angelica Ross who's a famous black trans actress and went into her DM's and taunted her because she's trans and she doesn't experience menstruation cycle that's really miserable and that's that's really miserable and again it just really makes me feel like if she is this is what she's saying you feel comfortable with what is the actual content that may be a big group of like more conservative more trans folk like transphobic whatever black folks like how are they feeling of course it's happening everywhere obviously this is happening everywhere between races but sometimes I think that black people can get like the liberal paint washed over them if you're not black and you're like oh you're black you're different about your liberal you're with it all and you're like no voting blue because we got to not because we want to like if it wasn't for the race issue we will have a lot of more conservative black people if if if if yeah if people weren't okay so I'm I'm I'm amending when I said so yes she wants to be famous and yes she says controversial things for social media but she's also just evil so I think that is my synopsis of just hilarious and just hilarious I'll tell you one thing young lady stop speaking for me because I don't watch this or that or whatever that show comedy show is you wrong no you call it I don't listen to that show I don't watch the upper club I don't watch none of that child I don't know that I'm not I'm I'm a black woman and not not your demographics so don't try to represent me because I I didn't follow you I didn't even hear no of your name and I am from what you young people are now calling the DMV just really DC and the others as we exit this topic we'll we'll leave it with if it's with an RT slogan that just came to mind as you were talking if it doesn't come on HGTV it's not for me let's move on and that is the truth hey you're listening to the positive the people stay tuned there's more to come so my news is so I think it's about Alabama I'm actually gonna be in Alabama this weekend though okay but this is a vanity of vanity fair article shortened suite I actually was looking for the right article to post on this issue and this was the one I like the best but the headline is definition of non-compliance and we covered this before so the basically the Supreme Court even we have a conservative court but the court still came down and said that Alabama's districting was basically gerrymandering and they needed to go back to the drawing board to ensure that they were drawing congressional districts that black people could have can keep their congressional members so right now it's um it's school I believe and so the new drawings would basically take away that that I think it was going from like 50% to 40% um for black folks and then taking a portion of of what that congressional district was which was predominantly black and giving it to a nearby congressional district that went surely went for Trump in 2020 um but what's interesting is even with the Supreme Court being like you cannot do that and you need to redraw the lines this legislature in Alabama was like oh we're gonna do what we do um so they passed a redrawn congressional map that appears to really go against the court order mandate to create two majority black districts in the state or something quite close to it as the Supreme Court said the new map was quickly signed by republican governor kiv on friday and the gop dominated legislature says that collectively we know our state our people and our districts better than federal courts are activist groups so the new map was approved um it reduces the percentage of black voters in alabama soul majority black district currently represented by that's right congress and tier tary's school from 55 to 51 percent and then on the other side it boosts the percentage of black voters in one of the state's six majority white districts from about 30 percent to 40 percent oh so you know the democrats of course are you know all of glaze in alabama saying that this is you know quintessential definition of non-compliance um of course also you know clearly uh a practice of of white supremacy and trying to suppress the black vote um and it just you know it's one of those things that you know with these elections coming up both you know kind of state local elections but also the you know next presidential election things like this still being playing out how they're playing out and being unresolved is of course really upsetting and really unsettling um similar things are happening in places like Louisiana they had a similar order um for the state legislature to redraw its voting maps they are refusing to do it so it's just interesting because even where even where there should be an advantage given to black voters and it's not even an advantage really it's actually just equality it's it's not it's not happening right and it's being not only is it not happening it's being like wildly fought against so it's just interesting i just wanted to bring just bring this to the public also bring it to to our listeners just because you know we have to be on the lookout that these things are happening and as we're preparing to gear up for these elections and for getting out the vote i mean questions like this just around the voting maps are going to be absolutely essential for us to have a free and fair election so the only that you know it's it's so interesting i saw this and i saw that statement like y'all really they really don't care and i just get frustrated because you know the left is supposed to play by the rules and you know the court says that we finally lost this and abortion and blah blah blah and then they lose the supreme court and they're like vibes right they're like they're like didn't read it didn't see it sorry thanks for right like and not even stressed about it they're like we know it better than the supreme court that that's like not even a rumor that's their visual statement you're like right and it's so funny when i read that i could like in my head i was hearing it like we don't care about your rule like it literally was like that that depiction of somebody you know what i mean that's like has a whip in one hand like i will say because of our conversation last week i called a friend who was a professor at harvard who studies reconstruction because i was like tell me what happened like what happened and the short version that that i relay he was like remember that the only reason why black people gain any power or anything in the south is that we sent the military he's like the military was in the south and maintain order and it was like the compromise of 1867 or something like that it was like a contested presidential election they didn't know who was gonna like it was it was contested so for one other people to drop out of the race to be president the deal was that the military would leave the south and when the military left the south that was the end of reconstruction that's when everything that's when the kukla that's when everything comes back and he was like remember that the only reason the south complied with anything was because the military was literally there and he was like the question became for the country how long do you keep the military in the south like at some point like that that probably is not a tenable a hundred year solution but i just say this because it's like alabama is remoden us that it took the military being in the south to actually make people do right by black people yeah this is way more just like informative for me and just like remind reminds me and and that there really just is no place that people won't go in order to win into gain power and that it's necessary to like talk about stuff like this and to be in to educate other people who are um affected by this and i'm just like chewing on that great information that dar\u00e9 just gave us i'm so i'm just kind of like my my head is kind of spinning because that's so right and that it almost makes certain other efforts not laughable as in they shouldn't have happened or or like me minimizing them but it's like yeah it took this for the south to act right we need something equal to that you know when you really when you really feel the gravity of it it makes so much more sense how come certain things haven't worked because it never worked you you always needed uh other federal forces in order to make the south not uh be a contentious place to be to to to be black a beautiful place that i grew up in but also a really hard place to be black and be raised so my news is the criminal justice news just so we're all on the same page about how the world is really special the short synopsis is that there's a famous forensic scientist who was making it up and his name is him really you might know him really because uh he's now 84 but he was the famous uh evidence forensic expert in the oda Simpson trial he was a consultant around the john bene Ramsey trial in colorado uh he was also involved in the 2004 murder trial of scott peterson uh and the 2007 murder of record producer phil specter and he was the former head of the state's forensic lab and he is now professor meritis at the university of new havens college of criminal justice and forensic science now he was just found liable by judge for making up evidence in a murder case that sent two kinetic and men to present for decades for crime they didn't commit uh ralph birch and shawn henning they were convicted on december first 1985 for killing every car uh based in part on the testimony that he said that there were blood stains on a towel found in the 65 year old's home 55 miles west of harford now there was no evidence connecting these people there was like no blood on people's clothes and da da da da da but lee testified that there was a towel which he suggested could have been touched by the killers while they were cleaning up and it was found in the bathroom near the crime scene with stains that he tested and he said were consistent with blood but then after the test done tests were done after the trial when the men appealed their convictions and there was no blood actually on this towel but he really got on the stand and said that that he suggested heavily that there was blood on the towel and that he had tested it and that he was the expert and that and the judge has noted there there was no that it's not even clear he performed a blood test when he testified and this is you know this man is testified in a gazillion cases and his quote was in my 57 year career i've investigated over 8,000 cases and never ever was accused of any wrongdoing or for testifying intensity wrong this is the first case that i have to defend myself now let me tell you if this was some error where it was like the machine broke or da da da da i'd be like you know everything like perfect is hard you said you did a blood test and didn't do a blood test that is live that is not a mistake that's a lie so i am just you know these people spent 30 years they spent a lifetime in jail you know and i can only imagine how many other lives he ruined in the name of his own career to be an expert what what a mess i just wanted to bring it here but do i just think how many first of all do you're obsessed with just forensic's period we've had so many we've covered criminal forensics in so many different types of way and what we have learned from you bringing this to the pod is there's such lack of accountability around the discipline but also like who can actually who can get into forensics and what makes you forensic expert right we already know that's just like not a whole lot and not a not a whole lot in terms of what you need to know about science so i think this is just like what's shocking about this is that he has been an expert in 8,000 cases and we don't have a system that that holds holds this discipline holds these practitioners to any great standard of accountability right it's like what they say goes because they're the expert there's no kind of system around making sure that what they're saying is actually accurate and making sure that it is not completely fabricated so i think that is the scary part in all of this is that we'll never know how many people how many people have been falsely accused of the well falsely incarcerated but also um we'll just we'll just never know what those numbers are because we don't really have a system in place beyond something that's just like you know DNA testing um that's gonna that's gonna really bring this really shed light on like how deep this issue goes and the other thing is that you you know these people got lucky they had a lawyer who could appeal who knew the right thing to appeal right most people you know they even even when the judge is crazy they don't have the legal resources to follow the peel i would you know we're doing this campaign of campaigns they're on a drug free school zone and we were talking to somebody about it and their friend got an extra two years for committing a crime in a drug free school zone that wink wink turns out they weren't in a drug free school zone but their lawyer didn't know anything about the zone they didn't know the streets so they just didn't even know to contest the idea that they were getting two more years for the zone that they weren't even in and you're like this is crazy but that's even like innocence projects i mean i was when i was in law school i was with innocence project four semester and it really just is in cases where DNA can be tested you know what i'm saying so it really when you're talking about the science and the forensics of it all it's like there aren't that many avenues to be able to disprove what is what has happened or or you know so it's just i don't know this is this is i hate that this happened and you know i'm a big believer in limits and sliminess i definitely want the Netflix doc investigation of what's going on because it's why because of the the wildest thing that's like echoing to me is that he's being accused of making up evidence and there's so many things when i was reading the article that he's being accused of that of course maybe show like incompetence or show you know how if he forensics are stuff like that and the other things are just kind of like moral things that you're like hmm could you have gotten is there is there a money trail here are you being are you being requested by lawyers to be the forensic expert and get paid money might you be uh like that's the kind of the the part that i'm most interested in um and specifically because he was in some landmark cases like oh my goodness have y'all seen this have y'all seen anything about the phil specter um case oh my goodness please ruin your day and watch it because it's so fascinating and phil specter is such a musical genius and evil genius and it was just it's just wild but that was such a phil specter had got off that on it was such a um oh i think he killed his wife right no a girlfriend like uh like a girl yeah like a girl girl who he had met that night but like he had already had like a knife so i thought this day he had got off for some wild things and it was and it's so um necessary once even even when you think about the phil specter um situation just that one not the all eight thousand but that one situation how important it was to ask somebody with integrity reviewing though that evidence because phil specter's celebrity had already freed him and had already made people uh having to get away with murder and violence is so it was so it was so important that somebody who couldn't be influenced because of money and again i'm not saying that's exactly what happened but i'm like there's just only so many conclusions you can come to while somebody will be in the habit of saying they did a blood test but then didn't do a blood test or you know that it feels like money will have to be the foundation of that this week we welcome christian cooper on the pod to talk about his new memoir better living through birding notes from a black man in the natural world many remember cooper from the 2020 viral video of him being accosted by a white woman dog walker in central park while he was birding but there's so much more to his story than meets the public eye we talk about his love for birds hot developed and all the lessons that he learned through birding you will learn so much from him too here we go christian it is so great to be in conversation with you welcome to the pod well thank you dorei glad to be here so you know we all met you because of a viral video in the park but you've done so much more than just that one moment i'd love to know uh where did your love of birds come from like how did this was this like uh was it cartoons was it you know you grew up around the bird place or i don't know what was it um well the setting the the background was the fact that my dad was a science teacher and and for a good chunk of that he was specifically a biology teacher so nature was always big in our household um but with me for some reason it took the particular form of birds uh it started with my spark bird as we call it in birding lingo uh the bird that that starts you down that dark dark path um and for me it was a uh a red wing blackbird i put up a bird feeder in the backyard and i thought i was seeing crows with little patches of red on the wing and i thought i've discovered a new species of crow at 10 years old getting all excited and then uh it turns out they were red wing blackbirds but i wanted to ask you like um do you own birds how do you feel about owning birds oh no no no no no no no to me owning a bird putting a bird in a cage this creature that was born to fly free through the skies to take a bird and put it in a cage is like you might as well take a hot poker and blind Picasso or take an axe and chop off the hands of Chopin you know you just you don't uh in in my opinion you just you just don't do that um and i think particularly for us as black people we should have a little bit of of understanding of what it means to have your freedom taken away and uh and and empathize with with how birds should be wild and free you know early in the book you there the first thing that i read that i was like hmm didn't know this at all is you talk about how birds have a limited sense of smell and i don't know if i like i just i never even thought about that and and you obviously talk about the importance of sight and and touch and um and how the thing that we all know about birds they can fly but i was like i didn't even think about the limited sense of smell well but you know new theories or that that may may not be so correct that in fact their sense of smell may be okay now they're still primarily like us they primarily rely rely on sight and sound but new theories new study seem to indicate that they have uh they they you know their sense of smell is not as limited as we thought and then certain kinds of birds like vultures they've got a good sense of smell they have to have one because they got to smell that rotting carcass so that they can zero in on it got it now let's go back to the park real quick and then we'll hop back to the book sure so the video obviously changed your life in a lot of ways in that moment how has it been the further you get away from it what is people like what do people come say to you or what are the like i have to imagine that people recognize you and they're like hey what is that what do they want to talk a lot in addition to birds? interesting question um a lot of times and and the most most of the time if i get recognized and i don't have binoculars around my neck it's other black people and usually it's always a very positive interaction and you know they're just you know thanking me maybe for bringing the issue to light or for how i handle the situation or or whatever so so that's that's usually what how people come to me and as far as sort of you know what people want to talk about i mean i guess i've been asked a number of times lately why i didn't want to be involved in the prosecution of her or why it ensue her or something like that and you know there's a lot of a lot of different reasons it was really right on the line for me i i could have gone either way and ultimately i decided to go on the side of mercy even though i knew there were some important potential legal issues to establish and legal precedents to establish i thought you know what her life is imploded it's a mess already you know this would be piling on you know let's let's show a little mercy but there's a bigger point which is that to keep going after her is to keep the focus on her and it's not about her you know what was important about that incident was how it highlighted principally for white people because we black people know we live it absolutely highlighting for a lot of white people that hey racial bias is deeply ingrained in our culture and pops up in all these different ways that's what's important and so we need to focus on how that racial bias affects our lives in big important ways for example how it bubbles up in the criminal justice system so that a white police officer in Minneapolis that same day as what happened to me thinks it's appropriate to kneel on a black man's neck until he's dead and how that racial bias manifested in the other police officers that they stood around and saw that and did nothing and how that racial bias comes up for example in the fact that Washington DC has no representation a urban largely black and brown city and urban largely black and brown city has no representation whereas rural overwhelmingly white Wyoming gets two senators rural overwhelmingly white Vermont gets two senators but black and brown DC can't become a state nobody's doing anything to make the mistakes that's racial bias in a way that affects lives in big important ways so while we're high-fiving maybe that we put that woman away behind bars from Central Park meanwhile the the Supreme Court is rolling back affirmative action so we have to keep our eyes on the prize we got to keep our focus on what matters and that's the racial bias and how the racial bias manifests in important ways that we can fight against and change i love it did you ever get a private apology no and i'm not looking for anything i'm not looking for anything from her you know my life has moved on in myriad ways hopefully hers has to and you know let our let us lead our separate lives one of the things in the black perk chapter that that stuck out to me as you talked about the jimme i think it was called the wild refuge that trip with your jad and jimme wild like refuge right jimme kibay and then um the adventure with Elliot is is i was like oh my god there's so much around me that i haven't paid attention to like even when the walk through Central Park the idea that like took in my mind there aren't a million types of birds in the park i don't know it's like a bird's a bird and i was reading this i was like oh he is like seeing things that i just didn't see um and i and i wonder how how did you train yourself to see those things like what was it the walks was it the i don't know like yeah birds move so quick to me that i'm like and i and i love the part about the you know keep your eye on the bird like that tip that's in the black bird chapter but yeah i'd love to know i that was my takeaway from that chapter i was like wow there's way more around me that i just haven't seen you know once you start paying attention to the birds you start noticing all these different things about them and you don't have to have binoculars you know i mean binoculars are a great tool and you know yes if you can get the special binoculars i don't like special ones oh well they are special to me because uh first of all they are top of the line super expensive and they were a 50th birthday gift from my late father so what's the best binocular brain i don't know this i'm curious well you know it depends on who you talk to um a lot of people swear by uh sporofsky so you know you know they make binoculars exactly a lot of people people think they're all about blame but they actually have a division because you know they're working with crystals and and you know super polished glass so they make optics that are very very high end and yeah my my 50th birthday gift gift for my dad was a pair of swarovski binoculars so but you don't need binoculars um great if you can get them i never bought a pair of my life all my binoculars have been either hand me downs or gifts but the point is you start paying attention and you notice all these different things and you're like oh wait this little brown bird is a little bit different from this other little brown bird and i just kind of lumped them all together as little brown birds but there's a difference is that difference because once a male one is female or are they different species one of the most interesting things for me was i used to um i still do for years um for decades i've been going into the new york city public schools to talk to kids about birds and get them outside of the concrete jungle and into whatever green spaces they have nearby and away from their pixels whether it's their phone or the tv screen or whatever and get them looking at nature and whatever green space they have and when i took the kids out at first some of them were like oh okay so there's a pigeon and then they would look at a house sparrow and they'd be like and that's a baby pigeon to them that's me that's me well yeah they didn't realize that they're they're two different species and then that little brown sparrow was never going to get any bigger and was never going to turn into a pigeon um you know it's sort of like the idea that you would look look at a mouse and then okay that mouse is going to grow up one day to be an elephant and no that's not the way it works so yeah so once you start paying attention to these things there's so much to learn and it's so exciting it's like it's it's having a veil lifted from your eyes and there's a not to be a cliche like from a disney film but a whole new world out there for you to experience it's wonderful and it happens everywhere that's a wonderful thing about birds it is everywhere i don't care if you're in the middle of the city i don't care if you're you know out on the ocean you can be in the desert there are birds but in the um in the rain mist the book of rain mist can i say right yeah book of rain mist and that's after when you talk about what it is what it was like to be a queer kid who you know wasn't out and and was trying to advocate in in the escape to the outdoors but also the fast issue with science fiction and the x-men which i also loved i was like a x-men through and through is that love who was your favorite character i mean it's it's so cliche i'm embarrassed but storm obviously it's like it's like i think it's all about storm who is better than storm i will say i'm met the guy who um who who created jin gray mm-hmm and i asked him like why did you make her the most powerful person and the universe and he was like i was 18 i just gotten hired by stanley and all of the female characters were they had sexist powers so he was like one person one woman's power was to scream he was like well that was sexist he was like another superhero got small she shrunk he was like well that was sexist and he was like i couldn't change those characters so the only thing i could do was make her the most powerful and i was like i love that i had never even thought about that you know what i mean well it's funny because there was a time in the x-men where all the most powerful characters were the women storm jin gray you know as as phoenix that they had all the raw power they they could kick the men's ass anytime they wanted to i love it do you still have that um do you still have that love or oh totally totally um i i don't follow x-men as closely as i used to that you know there's been a lot of changes in that world um but yes no i saw the passion for science fiction for for comics and certainly you know the marvel universe has conquered the movie theater uh you can't swing a dead cat without hitting a marvel blockbuster these days so um yeah no i still i still embrace that that passion for for science fiction it's a great escape but also the nice thing about science fiction is that let you imagine other possibilities and i think that's so important for those of us who are queer and for those of us who are black you know where we face a world that is not always the way the world should be for us and science fiction fantasy let you imagine a world that is different where we are fully embraced or where there are new possibilities for us so i think that's that's important that hope and that opening up of the imagination now i don't want to give away too much because people need to buy the book and read it but you talk about in this chapter coming out to dead i think that dead is her name right yep um did you have a long relationship with dead after that moment like did you oh she texted me yesterday you still are in touch with dead oh i'll be talking to dead till the day i die more back in bird land you talk about black birds a lot and i didn't even appreciate i mean you put in the book but like black birds singing in the dead of night dude i was like i was like that is about birds but my question to you is if i walk through the park what bird should i be looking for like is there like a most common bird in New York City or is it just like a bird like i don't know like what if i start in my birding journey should i be seeking out a bird all right i want to make this more general because there is no one single bird that you're gonna that you're gonna find it really depends on what habitat you're in what time of year it is what's what part of the country you're in so the thing is to to just you know when you when you walk out your front door or you don't even have to walk out your front door if you're homebound when you look out your window you know just see what you see and observe it's funny i birthed in east africa in kenya i'm so lucky to be able to do this with kenyan birders you know i wasn't birding with these expat Brits this was a black african ornithology student who i birthed with which was fabulous and he said he kept his catch phrase for me was atd atd attention to detail so when you see these birds observe what they do observe you know not just what the colors are but where the colors are distributed you know is it primarily on the breast is it primarily on the back doesn't have an eye ring doesn't have wingbars what is it doing is it cocking its head sideways and looking at the ground you know you notice all these things and in the it'll not only help you identify the bird but you'll learn so much about what the bird is doing and what the bird how the bird fits into the bigger world and then you start to figure out well how do i fit in into this bigger natural world and you start to explore that so it's it's really just a matter of atd attention to detail and you in that segue the book highlights you've traveled a lot of places you've been to a lot of countries and seen birds of many habitats is there i don't even know the best would ask this because i'm like a learning birder i guess is what i'd say um is is there a place where you're like i will never forget birding here there are a lot of places in the book that you talk about like just the whole experience of the people and did but like yeah is there you're like wow that was just like a wild birding experience tons of places i can't even begin to to limit how many places that i've gone where i've had an incredible birding experience and i'm happy to say that before the year is out i will i'm lucky enough that i'll be able to visit the last continent i haven't been to on the planet i'm actually going on a cruise to antarctica so i'm going to see you know all the glaciers and icebergs and penguins but anyway yes so many memories of amazing birds for example i remember being in tobacco in the caribbean trinidad in tobacco the country there i was on the island of tobacco and i saw this hummingbird called the ruby to pass hummingbird but i didn't know i was looking at it because hummingbirds a lot of times the colors only come out when the light hits them a certain way so i'm looking at this bird and it's gray and then it gets into a fight with another ruby to pass hummingbird and so the two of them are fighting midair tumbling down towards the ground and as they do the light is hitting them a certain way and suddenly the colors on them are flashing because ruby to pass hummingbirds when the light hits them a certain way are flaming red so as these two birds are tumbling it's like someone is striking matches off as they fall down towards the ground like flash flash flash flash he was stunning um and then another as an opposite end of the scale i was an equidore and i had made this trip in the middle of the pandemic on a whim because somebody i knew said they knew where there was an active harpy eagles nest harpy eagles are the biggest eagles in the world and so i went down there i trekked through ankle deep swamp ruining a pair of hiking boots didn't care and finally i get to the street and there's a huge nest and there is the hugest mother of all eagles sitting there in the tree and at one point she just kind of stretches out a wing and this huge thing opens up and her tail opens up and i'm just standing there like okay you are a harpy eagle it was just stunning so you know there's memories all around the globe of amazing birding experiences i love it there is this beautiful sentence about you are about your dad deep in the book um Elliot Kunder was my birdie mentor for all those years but Francis Cooper was my dad just a just a good sentence can you talk about how he how your your dad set you up to be the man that you are today yeah well my my it's hard to summarize in just a few sentences that's where you really need to read the book is the chapters about my dad because um he was he was a project my dad um he was a very difficult man and yet you know his love for me was never in question um not to him you know i didn't always understand it um but i eventually came to understand it and what that love for me meant was that you know he was a school teacher he spent all week busting his butt um working with kids getting up early going to school and you know teaching is a hard job very very hard job and then the weekend would come and you would think he would get to sleep in on a sunday but that man got himself up at the crack of dawn because his bird crazy son wanted to go on the south shore ottabon bird walk and go see some birds and so he got his butt up at the crack of dawn on sunday when any everybody else would be sleeping in and took me to the bird walk and that was you know just one example of his devotion to family and what that meant so yeah he he he was he was a special guy he was a difficult guy but what did he call you did he call you christian? depended you know my family tends to call me alternately christ or christian usually christian happens when somebody's mad and me or i've done something wrong so hello now one thing's all in with i know they were coming up on time but um but i as i got deeper into the book actually in the chapter about your dad this is not where he first appeared not the sense i just read came from a different chapter but um the tragedy of france's chapter so i didn't know that the dillow protest didn't kick into higher gear until activists from bed of queers blocked traffic on Broadway i know clearly about that it was queer people who turned it into a civil disobedience protest um and that was really important because it threw a spotlight on the issue of our treatment at the hands of police as african-americans so that was huge and and i remember calvin butts the the late reverend of the abasenia baptist church really important church in harlin saying that he would never forget what gay people had done for the black community in doing that so yeah it was one of those wonderful moments of intersectionality where you know we had each other's backs i love that i i've heard a lot i mean my work is the police all day and that was a story that i did not tell read your book and i love this the passage about your dad um as you talk about intake and when the quote is when i finally walked out around daybreak the next morning dad with my one phone call upon arrest was they'd agree me bearing the blessed relief of abago yeah and even even more so the the moment when he and i are in jail together that was that was a real moment to remember so yeah i love it well everybody make sure you buy the book i have two questions that we ask everybody the first is what's the piece of advice that you've gotten that has always stuck with you wow piece of advice that that has always stuck with me it's not so much advice as unspoken rule and this is something my sister and i grew up with in our household nobody said it explicitly we just knew it it was it was part and parcel of how we were raised that if you see something wrong with the world it is your personal responsibility to do something to try to fix it and we grew up with that our whole lives and both of us still try to live live by that um is she here in the city too no she is out in l.a. now is she does she love bird does she know anything about birds she knows something about birds she's she's she's printed she's she grew up surrounded by nature just like i did i'm the one who turned out bird crazy but she is quite familiar with a lot of she couldn't she couldn't have a brother like me and not be quite familiar with a lot of birds so i love it and the last question is there a lot of people feel like they've done all the things they read your book they called they protested they ran the streets they watched the documentary and the world hasn't changed in the way that they wanted to what do you say to those people whose hope is being challenged i say that the change does not happen overnight it's really hard for us to remember that to remember that the change is not going to happen overnight and that we will get setbacks like we are seeing from these crazy things coming out of red states where they you know like we are seeing with the supreme court rolling back affirmative action keep your eye on the long-term prize work towards that long-term goal keep making the changes and we cannot help
