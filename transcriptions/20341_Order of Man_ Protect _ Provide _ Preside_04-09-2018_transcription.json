    "text": " There is no question our boys are in trouble. Take a look at any metric and it becomes painfully obvious that our young men are falling behind. Violence, grades, drug abuse, and suicide to name a few. The question is not, is it happening, but why? Today I am joined by Dr. Warren Farrell, a leader in understanding the issues our boys are facing. We talk about how men have fallen into a purpose void. Why boys need to be raised differently than girls, the rise of the incels, and how to deal with the emerging boy crisis. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, even millions of men across the planet all working together to become better fathers, husbands, business owners, community leaders. And we do that partially through this podcast. We're interviewing the world's most successful men. These are guys like Jocka Willink, Lewis Howes, Andy Fersilla, Grant Cardone, Tim Kennedy. I mean, we've got so many great guests that have come on the show and we will continue to have great guests like we do today, Dr. Warren Farrell. But before I get into that, like I do every week, just a couple of quick announcements. Number one, if you would, please leave a rating and review for this podcast. We actually went up from the number 98 position in all of business on iTunes up to number 22 within a period of 24 hours because we had about 50 reviews coming in. We're doing a big push for ratings and reviews. And up until the end of September, we're running a contest. We'll be giving away shirts, hats, signed copies of the book, we're entering you into drawings for one on one conversations with me. And we're also thinking about doing an event that will pick a handful of those of you who have left a rating and review between now and the end of September for a event. This probably will be a one or two day event. And we'll take care of the costs associated with that and have a pretty good weekend together. So if you are interested in joining that drawing and being entered for the swag and the merchandise and the hats and the shirts and the books and everything else that we're going to be giving away, all you have to do is leave a review. We're monitoring those. We're checking those out. Leave a rating and review on iTunes between now and the end of September. And you will be entered into the drawings. Now, the other thing I wanted to make mention of is our store. I just had a new shirt come out, which I think you guys will like. It's a protect provide preside shirt. So make sure you check that out as well as order of men flags. I've had so many questions and people asking about when a flag would be available. There are order of men flags available now. We just announced those last week and we sold a ton of those. So make sure you jump on that quick. You can see our our merchandise at store.orderofman.com. So leave a rating review. Head to our store. That's all the announcements. So with that done and out of the way, I want to introduce you to my guest today. Really excited about this one guys. His name is Dr. Warren Farrell. He's a leader in the movement to understand the myriad of issues that our young men are facing. I'm sure you're well aware of some of these previously a feminist and the only man to ever be elected three times to the national organization for women. He's since seen what the feminist movement has become and its negative impact on our boys. He's been selected as one of the world's top 100 thought leaders and he's been on CNN, Larry King, live, Oprah, the today show. Good morning America. He's been on New York Times Forbes Wall Street Journal. I mean, he's just been everywhere and you're going to hear why as we go through this conversation today. But he's taught at all levels of education and he speaks at Fortune 500 companies, military branches. He spoke at NASA. It was such an honor to talk with Dr. Farrell and get so much incredible insight into his own thoughts and boys and gender in general. And I know I walked away with a ton of information with regards to raising my sons and daughter. So guys, I hope you enjoy the conversation. Warren, good to talk with you. I'm excited to have this conversation today. Thank you. I'm looking forward to it too. I love your vibration, your informality. Thank you. Thank you. Yeah. I try to have just an open dialogue, an open discussion. And there's some things that man in reading your book, the boy crisis and obviously becoming familiar with your work. It's just, it really resonates with me because I've got kids of my own. I've got four children. I've got three boys and I recognize a lot of what you're talking about. And as I was going through this book, I just thought to myself, yes, yes, yes, like a checklist of all the things that I'm dealing with as a father and the things that I know my boys will be dealing with as well. So looking forward to the conversation. Can you give me an example of one or two of those things that just struck you as something that you're dealing with as a father? With education system, my kids aren't that old yet. I have my oldest is 10 years old, but I can definitely see in the educational system how that seems to be stacked against him. He's told, frankly, to sit down, to shut up, to color within the lines, to do what he's told. And from my experience, personal experience, that's not how I enjoyed learning. And it's not how I enjoy learning now. And so I can see how difficult it's going to be when it comes to getting him to engage in meaningful information that's going to improve his life. Yes. So you didn't like learning in handcuffs and mental cups? In college, I went to about a half a semester of college and I said, I'm out of here. And I went into landscaping and I did pizza delivery and I did retail sale. And I bounced around from place to place to place because I'd remember specifically that college was frankly just a miserable experience for me. Wow. Well, I'm sorry about that. That's okay. We're doing okay now though. Yeah, it seems like you are. You had the strength to find yourself as opposed to just coloring in the box. Yeah, I think that's true. And I've been fortunate enough to have some really good experiences that have allowed me to do that and been surrounded by other good men who have and women, frankly, who have helped me see a different way of learning and exposing myself to new information and pursuing a passion, which is something you talk a lot about when it comes to men. Yes. Well, let's talk about that. Let's talk about the passion component of this because I think that's one of the underlying premises in your book is that men are lacking real purpose, I think, is the term you use. And do you find that to be the case? Is that the biggest challenge that you see among men? It's a combination of two things. The purpose void and the dad void combined. And those two arenas, when you put them together, that's where the boy crisis exists. So for example, in the old days, we had natural senses of purpose. The culture said, you are a boy, you become a warrior, and or you become a sole breadwinner. If you did one or both of those, you were considered growable into a man. You got a lot of what I call social bribes to do those things. You were told that Uncle Sam wants you and their dad and mom would be proud of you if you had a military uniform on, and especially if you were in the elite, the more dangerous your job was, the more disposable you were, the more you were valued of. You were very disposable as a Navy seal, even more so than in the regular military, but you were then given elite status, which then bribed you to be disposable. And similarly, in the workplace, if you're a working-class man, and you didn't have a lot of education, the emphasis was for you to use your hands and to be in the death profession would give you what I call the death profession bonus. So you would enter one of the hazardous professions that into the logging industry or into the trucking industry or into the welding industry at the top of a bridge at which you were at risk for your life, but on the other as a coal miner, etc. But on the other hand, you could earn a living for your family. And so you were told if you figured out a way of being a sole breadwinner at work, you would be possible father material. A woman would feel that her family would approve of her falling in love with you and having children with you. What a woman was warned to not want is a lovely sweet man who was reading the boy crisis on the unemployment line. Has that changed, though? I mean, have women really at a fundamental and foundational level changed what they're looking for in men or are they still looking for some of those characteristics? They're still looking for those characteristics if they are planning to have children. Everything turns with children. So for example, the pay gap, we always hear the gender pay gap between men and women. That gender pay gap is assumed to be a male female gap. It's actually not a male female gap. It's a father mother gap. When a man and woman become parents, the woman is statistically speaking far more likely to choose among three things, either work full time, children full time, or do some combination of both. So even if she works full time, she's likely to cut her hours back. So she has flexibility with the children. And 40% of women, when they have children, don't work full time, even part time, they stay at home, 40% work full time, and 20% work part time. And so the average pay of the average mother goes down considerably. Even if I imagine the type of work, too, that they choose, even if they are working full time, I imagine is maybe not so focused or career advancement centric and allows a lot more flexibility and scheduling and time to be with children and those sorts of considerations as well. That's exactly right. It's fathers then that really focus on, it used to be that the mother and father before they had children, they would share the responsibilities of a small home. But that the child comes, she cuts back her work, or completely stops her work outside the home. She's working enormously with the child. And he then has to double more than double up because he's not only having to provide for himself, but also mostly for her. And then also for the child, then also for any emergencies that might come up. So he's got to have more of a safety than that there for them. He becomes focused on that. Now let's get back to Purpose Void. Purpose Void is, he doesn't now have an identity as a man by being a warrior or a soul breadwinner. If he's working in middle class job or an executive type of job, he is oftentimes when the child comes, feeling like, okay, I'm now regional manager and charges such and such, selling such and such product. I need more money. I better accept that offer to become a national manager. I'm now a teacher and I love my passion. My passion is teaching. I'll get more money as a vice principal or principal site or a superintendent schools. So I better give up my passion and do what I need to do. The feminist movement has been completely, this is a complete misunderstanding. They've felt that men because they earn more have more power and more privilege when in fact they have more obligation and more expectation and the men who earn more are fulfilling that obligation and that expectation. That's the male form of discrimination against men. It is not the discrimination for men. Men as fathers earn significantly more because they have an expectation to do so. Okay, so now we have a little bit less of that expectation. So the good news is there's more flexibility. The bad news is that there is a purpose for you. If I can interject real quick, I mean, from my experience and maybe this is what you're getting into is anytime that I've added obligations, expectations and responsibilities in my life, as long as those things are moral, ethical and legal, I have added a sense of purpose to my life. I don't know if this is exclusive to men or generally typical of men, but I believe that I personally and a lot of men that I work with thrive on additional and added responsibility and weight on our shoulders. Evidence for that is that boys who are having problems are very helped by mentors. They're helped even more by becoming a mentor. As soon as a boy is encouraged or becoming like a boy scout and going from boy scout earning merit badges to becoming patrol leader or a boy scout earning enough merit badges to be become starlight for eagle. And then other people look up to them and they have an image to fulfill and they feel like doing something purposeful is really important. But now here is the big issue. The boy crisis is created by the combination of the purpose void plus the dad void. So the boy crisis exists largely among two groups of boys. Boys that are the children of parents of divorce in which the boy does not have consistent and dependable involvement of a significant nature with his dad after divorce. So if the mom is the primary parent, the boy doesn't have a role model of his same sex that he can look up to to take him from the greater purpose void through to saying here's what I need to do for your son. I need to work with you to help you discover what is the unique parts of you, what fulfills you, what motivates you, and at the same time to prepare you for obligations. So if you say that just being a full-time babysitter to the people in the neighborhood is what you love to do, I've got to help you translate that into not just being a babysitter but maybe being a teacher, maybe being a caretaker that pays. So you're talking about the opportunity to provide, turning that interest into a provisional opportunity so that you can be a more effective husband, father, and so on. And I understand that correctly. Exactly. Okay. And so the father is one of the reasons that girls are doing so much better than boys are girls being raised in single-parent homes are being raised in single mom homes. So they have a same-sex role model to help guide them through their uniqueness. Plus they have a cultural message and the cultural message to girls as a result of the feminist movement is you can be anything you want to be. You can raise children, you can raise money, you can do some combination of both, you can do all raise money, and for a while and then raise children completely for a while, you can do it sequentially, you can do it in any way, shape, and form, and you will be respected as a girl woman. And I as your mom, here's what I did that was right, here's what I did that was wrong, here's what I would change, here's what you see me do. And so the girl has this constant feedback from her gender. What's the cultural message that boys are receiving? If girls are receiving the message that you can be anything and do whatever you want and whatever order or whatever it may be, what do you see as the cultural message that that our young boys are receiving? Boys receive a fair amount of that message until they become a dad and if they become a dad they learn that their three options are not raise children, raise money, do some combination of both, but rather they have three options too, which is raise money, raise money, or work full-time, work full-time, work full-time, or if they're working class man, maybe work two jobs. If they're a middle class man, just increase the intensity of the number of hours they put into and the responsibilities they take on in a middle class job. Do you see any statistics about the men who, for example, stay at home while the women enters the workforce as far as fulfillment, purpose, and even just a general sense of satisfaction? Is it higher? Is it lower? Is it the equivalent? Yes, here I'm curious. The children that have stay at home dads, if that does not result in a divorce, so I'll get to that issue in a moment, then the children do extremely well. So that's the good news. Both boys and girls do well? Boys and girls do very well. Boys and girls that have a significant amount of father involvement, the girls, they do better in 70 different areas that I was able to document in the process of researching the boy crisis. Most of the areas are the same, but they have two distinctions. One is the boys are more likely to feel the negative consequences more intensely. So I'll be really technical here, but it's for a minute's worth of technical absorption, you'll really get the power of this. The single most important thing that one has, that is a predictor when you're young of how long you will live are something called telomeres, T-E-L-O-M-E-R-S. They're contained in your cells. Telomeres are long, your genes will easily reproduce genes that prevent cancer, that prevent disease, and so on. If telomeres are short, that predicts exactly the opposite of shorter life expectancy. By the age of nine, if you have 14% shorter telomeres, that means your life expectancy will be approximately 14% shorter. By the age of nine, boys and girls, on average, that have significant father involvement, have 14% longer telomeres than boys and girls who do not have significant father involvement by the age of nine. Is that due to father involvement, or does that just happen to be correlating data, or is that a consequence, if you will, of having a father involved, meaning that's actually influencing the telomeres? There's enough data to suggest that it's most likely due to lack of father involvement, or to conversely to father involvement. Interesting. Just discovered recently, so not every cross test has been done on that. But 14% shorter from boys and girls on average, but boys have 40% shorter telomeres than their sisters already by the age of nine. Everything else being equal, everything else being equal. So you can get a sense of the power of lack of father involvement on both our sons and our daughters, but the proportionally greater power of the lack of father involvement, 40% more significant for boys. Exactly for boys. And in almost every area that I studied, in all of the 70 areas where boys do worse than girls do when they have lack of father involvement, all 70 of those areas where I was able to get good measures of both girls' problems and boys' problems, I found that the girls in most of those areas did worse, but not as badly as the boys did. The areas where the girls did even worse than the boys were areas like in their adjustment to sexuality with boys. So for example, the lack of comfort with a male by not having a father in the house often leads to girls not knowing how to please a male in a way other than being sexual with them. They'll be sexual before they're really ready to be sexual for fear of losing the boy to some other girl who will be sexual with him. They don't have other resources to say that there's something valuable about me other than my being willing to be sexual with you. That's interesting because, and I know this might come across as weird, but I see my daughter in that she has an attraction to me. I don't mean a sexual, I just don't want to talking about. For some reason, she is infatuated by me as a male presence. And I think what I see in my relationship with her is that we can have a relationship outside of what you're saying, these sexual type feelings or whatever they may be in that she recognized she is enough that she is adequate without having to be sexual. In so far as we know that is exactly right, she can play with you. You can do rough housing with her. Sure. And you can be physically close to her without that being a sign that you're going to have to be physical with her in a sexual way. And so that creates a trust and a very deep experience for girls that male does not mean sexual automatically. That my dad could play with me, could a rough house, could allow me to jump off the couch onto his back. And if I did the right thing with, especially if I was doing that with my brother and that together we did the right thing, we could get dad underneath us and we could win the wrestling match. And that's something that traditionally women, and I'm talking specifically about mother figures, just aren't going to do. And you talk about the distinctions and some of the things that dads add to the equation that mothers traditionally do not. And one of them is rough house. And first of all, let's make it clear that mothers bring a lot to the family table. Almost all of us know that the mothers tend to be devoted. They tend to be unconditionally loving. They tend to be more nurturing. They tend to sort of be protective. And all of those things are important things to build a deep sense of security in the child. However, it isn't nearly as much security as when it's combined with what I call the checks and balances of a father involvement. So for example, we go back to the example before and we have in the family, let's say James, Brad and Krista. And James is the older boy, maybe eight or so. And Brad is maybe six and Krista's maybe four. And they're rough housing. And the first thing that happens is that mom's looking over and going, Oh my God, it feels like I just have one more child to monitor called a dad. Sure. Stress over her. Like, you know, and she's like gritting her teeth. On the other hand, she's saying, But the kids are having fun. I don't want to stop them from having fun. I don't want to be the spoil sport. On the other hand, I'm quite sure. Look at how close they're coming to hitting each other's heads. I don't like the fact that Brad is bullying Krista. And she's having all these worries. And should I stop this or should I not? And so finally, she decides, no, I'll let it go, but I'm absolutely sure in my mind's eye, that sooner or later they're going to hurt themselves. Is she right? About 99% of the time she's right. They have a collision or somebody feels like they're pushed away and that one of the kids starts crying. And then she says to herself, two things. Oh my God, I am right. I saw that I foresaw that I should have been proactive in protecting them from having to cry. I shouldn't have waited so long. So she feels guilty that she waited so long to interfere. But if she does interfere, she feels guilty for interfering. It's so right. What happens though, is that dads don't read books like The Boy Crisis or any other books on parenting or subscribe to Parenting Magazine. And they don't know the data on why that roughhousing is so important. So here's what dads don't say. They first don't say that there's a high correlation between rough housing and the development of empathy. Empathy and roughhousing? Yeah, seems like it's kind of intuitive. Like they don't even seem connected, except maybe disconnected, connected inversely. Right. We break down roughhousing. And as the older boy Jim, I think I said, is jumping onto the back of dad and wants to be the one to be able to turn dad over. And he's pushing Brad or Christa away. Dad sort of lets that happen to some degree. And then at some point when it seems to be getting a little bit too much, dad says, you know, Brad, you can't do that with Christa. You can't do that with your brother or the two start having a fight. Nope, you had a fight. We're going to stop rough housing. So dad is doing two things here. First, he's creating a deep bond via the roughhousing. Then he's using that bond to extract boundaries. Right. And he's saying, the pleasure you're having, the fun you're having, the roller coaster that I'm creating for you, a lot of excitement combined with safety. That's what dads provide. They're like a roller coaster. They combine excitement, plus a reasonable amount of safety. That roller coaster ride is going to stop if you don't think of your sisters and brothers feelings, especially if you're the older one. And if you get into a fight, even if you're the older and the younger one, the roughhousing is going to stop. So the kids learn something that they cannot learn from a lecture. They learn from experience. When rough housing goes too far, when not being sensitive to the sisters needs, the brothers needs is going to cost you for not being sensitive. You can always tell this in another child too. For example, if we have a child come over to my house, let's say my oldest son's friend and their rough housing are doing their thing. And they don't know the line. It's very easy to come to the conclusion that they don't rough house in their house, or they don't know those social boundaries and limits that are not to be crossed because they never had exposure to this. Everyone who is listening to that, if you have any doubts about what we're talking about, tune into what Ryan just said, that's exactly a real good test. Bring over a child that doesn't have father involvement, that doesn't have roughhousing. And you will see that deficiency in there. And so that's a very good litmus test for the average family. Yeah, one of the other things that I was fascinated that you talked about is that a dad when he's roughhousing is establishing and developing and maybe even growing to a degree, emotional, mental, and physical resilience. My wife always says, she says, you never stop until one of the kids is crying. And I've thought to myself, that's true. That is true. Why is that the case? And then as I was reading your book and going through the information, I wouldn't stop before he's crying because I haven't pushed the limit. I don't know how far you can go. And I haven't expanded his capacity for more pain or discomfort or something that just isn't that enjoyable to him. Maybe that's subconscious, but that was interesting reading that and learning a little bit more about that. Absolutely. And you're not only, so mom has to know that brings to the parenting process is giving the children not a lecture, but an experience of what empathy is about and when it needs to be applied and when it doesn't need to be applied. And then dad will often say, if you do that again, or if you go over the boundaries again, and that leads to crying or fighting or not being sensitive to each other, that's the warning. And then dad does what? He goes after the crying, he goes back and he returns to the roughhousing. But then, if they go back and they cry again, or they hurt each other again, so dad says to the children, okay, we're to stop the roughhousing. And then he tells them and clarifies what they've done that's too much and what they can't do again and how they have to have empathy for each other, not by theory, but actual in practice, shorthand. So then he returns to the roughhousing and gives them a chance to practice it and do it better. Practicing it and doing it better helps the children develop what psychologists call emotional intelligence under fire. Emotional intelligence under fire is applicable in that, let's say a husband and wife get into a fight. The people who don't have emotional intelligence under fire might let that fight escalate, escalate, and escalate. The ones that do have emotional intelligence under fire realize that situation is getting out of hand and have the tools to stop it and to let it go down and to not get carried away. This is what you're training your child to do. And this is why empathy and emotional intelligence under fire is developed through roughhousing in part and roughhousing combined with boundary enforcement. Now, something else that's happening here is that the bond between the father and the children that's created by the excitement of roughhousing allows the children to be upset when the father says no more hurting each other in this type of way, but not to be rebellious because the children want more roughhousing with dad. They want to reward the benefit of roughhousing. They feel the bond and they feel he's somebody that's on their team. It is not a parent saying rules, child saying, am I old enough to rebel against those rules? So the rebellion process doesn't start nearly as much with the dads. And moms see this in this type of respect. Mom's noticed after a while the dad will say stop this and the children will stop this and the mom goes, darn, every time I say stop this, the kids don't stop. I have to repeat, repeat and repeat because what mom has taught the kids is that when they don't obey her, she will repeat. She will not end the reward process of the roughhousing or whatever the reward process is. She'll try to persuade them to behave. But the kids in their excitement, the punishment of her repeating herself is not nearly as great as getting carried away when they're excited. So mom keeps having to repeat. And she looks at the dad doing the thing and it gets really frustrated as the light word and angry. Is that the bad word? Like, you know, why don't I just pay attention to dad and not me? What I've just explained and if I'd have an explain to well, it's explained. I hope a lot more clearly in the boy crisis. He's willing to end that process if the children don't obey. Boundary enforcement is the single most important parenting skill that dad brings to the parenting table. The child learns that I have to focus on being empathetic toward my sister or brother. I have to focus on not getting carried away. I have to focus on doing what I need to do. Dads and moms tend to set boundaries the same way. You can't have your ice cream until you finish your piece, let's say. And the children tend to test boundaries the same way. They try to have a couple more peas and then say, you know, can I have my ice cream now? And then mom said tends to feel like, you know, I'm not going to get into a big argument over a few peas. Okay, sweetie, I'll tell you what, have a couple more peas and then you can have your ice cream. And dad tends to look at the kids and say, excuse me, we have a deal here. And the deal is that you can't have your ice cream until you finish your peas. You know the deal. I know the deal. You know that I know the deal. The children might say, oh, you're so mean. Momly, let's have peas much sooner. And dad will go, you can continue crying. No ice cream tomorrow night either. The threat of me being mean doesn't really impact me when it comes to the arrangement that we had worked out for sure. I say, and exactly. I bet you. And this is doing true for you. Oh, 100%. I mean, you're talking about our dinner table. So this is exactly right. And so what moms need to know is that that boundary enforcement leads to a much greater likelihood to not have ADHD. That is, children raised predominantly by fathers. Only 15% of them have symptoms of ADHD. Children raised predominantly by mothers 30% have ADHD. When the father metaphorically requires the son and daughter to finish the peas, they're requiring the son and daughter to have attention focus on doing what they need to do. And what they don't like to do. And what they don't like to do in order to get what they like to do, which is called postpone gratification, of course, which I think is a huge indicator. If I understand the studies correctly, delaying and gratification is a huge indicator of success, ultimately in life. That is correct. Post-bone gratification. We have known and seen since the days of Michelle doing this, the marshmallow experiments and that is the single biggest predictor of having a successful life, not just success in terms of money. This is success in terms of happiness and fulfillment, because the boy, let's say, or the girl who doesn't have that postpone gratification goes to school. Maybe he's naturally tall and he has an aspiration to be a basketball player and be a player, let's say, or he's learned to play the piano but not well, but he wants to make a career out of acting or piano, or he just wants to do his homework and finish it. And no matter what his goal is, without postpone gratification, he gets carried away by being distracted by, oh, somebody's texting him. I'll just take care of this text for a minute. There's a new video game my friend wants to play. I won't tell him or her no. I'll just play the video game with now. I'll get back to my homework in a little while. So without postpone gratification, he tends to fail in school among both subjects and activities. Therefore, he doesn't have the respect of other male peers, of girlfriends and future girlfriends. He doesn't have the good grades from teachers. He doesn't have the pride of the parents that he's gotten good grades or has done really well in the basketball team. He begins to then internalize that lack of respect and appreciation for him and begins to feel like he's a loser. But on the other hand, in a video game, he notices he has control over things and he can do well. And so he might take advantage of that, but then he gets addicted to the video games because it's the only source that rewards the immediate gratification and his skill set. And then he begins to realize that girls are not interested in him nearly as much as they're interested in the football team or somebody else that has a lot of postpone gratification. So he begins to turn to porn and porn damages his brain in about four different ways that I described in the boy crisis. He's so needy of it because what is pornography for a boy? Pornocracy is access to a variety of attractive women without fear of rejection. And without the effort. And without the effort, end of the price he can afford. Men, just a quick timeout to talk with you about something I haven't talked about for a while. That is our exclusive Brotherhood, the Iron Council. The Iron Council is a, again, a brotherhood of nearly 430 men all banding together, working together, having some serious discussions and conversations and most importantly taking the action towards our goal, our ambitions and our desires. I've noticed that one of the things that has helped me on my own personal journey to become a better father and husband and business owner is accountability. And I think that's one of the best benefits of the Iron Council is that when you band with us, you're banding with other men who want to achieve who are working towards achieving measures of success in their lives. And they want to help you do the same. And through the conversations and the calls and the assignments and the challenges that we have going on, there is so much accountability built into this. And I don't want to say force you to change, but in a way, hold your feet to the fire a little bit. And I know that's what I needed. And I know there's a lot of men out there who need that as well. So when you join us, you will get the accountability and everything else I just mentioned will help you identify your goals and your objectives and the things that you want to accomplish in your life. You can learn more and lock in your spot at order of man.com slash Iron Council. Again, that's order of man.com slash Iron Council. So make sure you go check it out. Get registered lock in your spot until then we'll get back to my conversation with Dr. Farrell. This actually is really indicative to me when I hear you talk about this of the rising in cell movement, which I'm sure you're familiar with. And as you talk about this, this actually sounds like potentially it could lead to somebody being involved in this, what is it? Voluntary celibate movement. Is that correct? That's correct. Okay. involuntary celibate is what in the cell stands for. And if you just think of just everything I've said, so let's take the next layer of that. The boy feels like he can't get along with girls very well. Girls are not attracted to him. He's very attracted to girls. So from his perspective, every girl in the class that he's attracted to, which is usually about 50% of them, that he would be open to being sexual with every one of them from his perspective is rejecting him. Right. Or he anticipates the rejection so much he doesn't even ask. But he's being told by mom and dad that he's a sweet boy and he's a sensitive boy and he's a lovely boy and he is very bright and he has a lot of things to offer. But the girls don't seem to respect that or notice that or admire that or respond to that. And so finally, one girl does come over to his house. But what to do with girls is a lot of what he sees in porn. So maybe he should come over the girl's face like they do in porn or he should ask her to have a no sex like they do in porn. And the girl is like, yeah, that was just a terrible experience. And the only girl that is okay with it is the one that feels that she needs to do it because she'll lose the boy anyway. And an indicator of that to what you were saying earlier is maybe she didn't have the father figure in her life that produced a healthy relationship with the opposite sex. Yes, exactly. And so she then feels that she has to do that. So he gets involved either with girls that have severe emotional problems or the girl just goes, I'm out of here. Right. So either way, creates a really negative experience for him with girls, which only convinces him that all that girls don't really want that sweetness and sensitivity that his mother said he was so wonderful at who are they out with the captain of the football team. And with a captain of the football team, is he being as sensitive as I am? No, he's not. And what are they responding to? They're responding to that bastard. And they say they want sensitivity says he, but it's obvious that they don't because look who they're going out with. Right. Or they're going out with some guy at the left of jacket and a motorcycle. And that's also not him. And so that's where the incel comes from. Now, incel is not the worst case scenario. The worst case scenario is that it becomes so depressed and down on himself that he eventually commits suicide. Or the super worst case scenario is that the great majority of mass shooters are boys with minimal or no father involvement. Or in more exceptional cases, boys who do have father involvement, but whose father is not good at enforcing boundaries. There's no father's role in the family at all. So Omar Mateen's father, who did one of the major mass shootings in Orlando, his father was present. But every time Omar got into trouble, he was always defending Omar. So rescuing him. That is one of the functions of normally speaking, the difference between mothering and fathering is that the boy gets rescued. And the mother immediately appears at the jailhouse and says, I know my son never does things like this. You know, please let him go because it'd be very traumatizing for him to be in prison for the night. Dad will tend to say, okay, he did this and he got arrested. Thank you. This is exactly probably what he needs. Keep him in jail overnight. Right. We'll pick him up in the morning. We'll pick him up in the morning. I think good night in jail will probably do him good. Sure. That's a typical difference in male female parenting. Omar Mateen's father was just like the female is. So because you're a father, doesn't necessarily mean you're going to behave in dad style because you're a mother, it doesn't mean you're limited to mom style. You can do the boundary enforcement as a mom. You can do the rough housing. It's just these are just the tendencies. Let me ask you this. Is there any data or research from my experience and the outside looking in daughters without fathers in their lives don't become violent. They don't shoot up schools. They aren't participating in this behavior. Is it just because the way that we as men are, is it our physiology? Is it the hormones of testosterone that is causing this reaction to a lack of a father figure? Yes. Testosterone without dads means that you have this enormous force that gets channeled in a way that is not helping it be chatteled well. So this is where the idea of toxic masculinity would come from. That's right. And this is toxic masculinity. I mean, any boy that shoots up a school is demonstrating the toxic masculinity. So toxic masculinity is testosterone not well-channelled. Well-channelled's primary definition is without the boundary enforcement, without the consequences being known. With the father or mother that calls the jail and says, oh, my son can't possibly spend the night in prison. You have to rescue him. He's such a sweet and lovely boy. He's going to be without knowing where the boundaries are. And he usually doesn't get to that place if he's had good boundaries. And then of course you have, you know, with boys, you know, people often say that the other school shootings are a result of family values, of access to guns. And, you know, girls have the same access to guns, the same family values, the same violence in the New York. They don't do the shootings. But on the other hand, the availability of guns, the AR-15s and the assault rifles and so on, make the problems that boys have much more likely to leave a boy with an option for getting attention for a few minutes and teaching those people who didn't pay attention to him a lesson by shooting up all the people in the school that did not, you know, that ignored him, that made him invisible, that didn't feel, thinking at any feelings of worth hearing. Well, I'll shoot up 15, 20 of them, especially so and so and so. And then they'll ask the question, what were we not paying attention to? For the first time in their life, I'll teach them to think about me. And that's all a natural outcome. Of course, the availability of guns is making that toxicity much more possible to be expanded to enormous lengths. The only good news about the AR-15s and the killings is that they're making us realize that something is challenging about boys and maybe we need to pay attention to the underlying problem. I think it's important too that we make this distinction because when we talk about toxic masculinity, I mean, you're talking about a term that yes, I can definitely see where it's coming from. The problem that I see in society, and I think a lot of this comes from some third wave type feminism, is that they've turned the term toxic masculinity to equate masculine and toxicity. When that's certainly not the case at all, masculinity in and of itself is not toxic. I think it's really, really important that people understand that those two terms are not synonymous. Yes, masculinity and femininity both have a shadow side of toxicity, but masculinity and both and femininity also have extraordinary plus sides as well. And so feminism has turned even some of the positive aspects of well-channelled masculinity into toxicity. So for example, in almost every college today, there is a tendency for women and feminists, especially in the university to say, you're male, you have male privilege, you have male power, proof all the CEOs and the- Right. Look around at the metrics, right? Yes, our males and mostly white males. We now are trying to speak up. So let us speak up. And this is time for us to speak up for you to shut up. Wait a minute, I have a perspective that I'd like to offer on that. Uh-huh, that's mansplaining. But what about we men who are in more money, were we making contributions to the society that we believe we were expected to make as part of our male role? Well, not only that, the markets have dictated that. One of the things I hear all the time is entertainers and athletes get paid too much. Well, no, they get exactly paid what they're worth in a free market society because we have dictated what we're willing to pay those athletes and those entertainers. What feminists have missed is by saying that the boys and men who do earn a lot of money, they have power. And the boys and men who don't earn a lot of money, they don't even pay attention to them. I remember riding in a sort of like a town cart type of thing with Gloria Steinem years ago to a show we were doing that Alan Aldo was hosting in New York. We were started talking about what we were going to talk about on the show. The town cart driver said, that's interesting because, you know, do you think I drive this town car because I want more power over my family? And we sort of stopped and I said, well, why do you drive the car? And he said, because I drive 70 hours a week and I hate being away from my family, but I want my children not to have to be driving a town car. I want my children to have opportunities that I didn't have. Sure. I want my wife to have a decent home and a nice neighborhood with a good school. And so I make the sacrifice to do that. And he understood instinctively that, you know, whether it's the coal mine or the oil, you know, rig operator, the person that travels that became a superintendent of schools rather than a teacher, which is was this passion, we understood instinctively that earning more was part of our obligation and expectation. Earning more was part of discrimination against men, not discrimination for men. It is not true that men earn more for the same work. It is true that they earn more for a 25 differences in their work life decisions that men make versus women. And all of those are outlined in a book I wrote called the Why Men Earned More and What Women Can Do About It. Because any woman who wants to earn more can do so with looking at those 25 things. If men and women got paid equally for the same work, then only women would be hired because they're much more efficient in terms of cost and output than the man would be in that scenario. If I can pay a man $100,000 and a woman $100,000, but the woman's going to produce more, the man's going to produce more, naturally, I'm going to go to that avenue that's going to produce and yield a higher bottom line for me. If you're a boss and you could pay a man $100,000 and get the same work from a woman for $76,000, you would hire the woman for $76,000. Of course. Yes, that's a better way of explaining it. Absolutely. It's more for the same work. But let's say you just didn't value women and you did hire mostly men for the $100,000. You would soon go out of business in relation to people who were smart enough to hire women for $76,000 to produce the same work. I don't know a single man who cares more about men than the bottom line. Yes, exactly. Let's say he does care more about men than the bottom line. He's the exception. He will soon go out of business because other people will hire more women if that was the case. Again, this is a very tough argument to understand. If you really want to get into understanding the fairness and accuracy of what I'm saying, and you have a daughter and you want to help her understand the trade-offs of earning more or less or have a son who's helped them earn more or less, almost everything you do to earn more is a trade-off in fulfillment. That is, the fulfilling occupations almost always pay less. When you follow your bliss, it's the money you'll miss. Again, this is just generally speaking. I imagine that fulfillment for men because earning income could potentially mean and equate to fulfillment for men because of the way that we have been conditioned to believe in the way that we operate internally. I imagine for women again, generally, fulfillment is significantly different than what fulfillment for men is. It's overlapping but very different. I think one of the easiest ways to understand this is to look at women who have MBAs who start their own business and men who have MBAs that start their own business. They're both highly educated, highly motivated, but the women earn only 49% of what the men earn. When you investigate that, you find that the women start their own business so that they can have freedom, autonomy, flexibility. They can be close to home. They can do what they want when they want it to a greater degree. Earning money is about the fifth level, sixth level down. Women's own answers to questionnaires as to what they're doing. Right. What they're after is all that they're on business. Men, 76% say the number one priority was earning money. We used to think that maybe it was just the male boss that discriminated and didn't value the woman, but we're finding now that when the woman answers what she wants by, there's no male boss. It's her business. She earns even less than she does in a corporation where there's more frequently a male boss. That gives you a sense of this is not a world that is controlled by men to benefit men at the expense of women. That is a larger picture that has been presented in universities about men. When your son enters a university and he wants to speak up, he's often put in this box of your part of the male privilege group. Right. You're part of the problem. You don't get to have a problem. You don't get to have a say. If you do speak up your mansplaining and you're not giving women a chance to succeed, if you are beginning to take sexual initiatives in 26 states, there is a affirmative consent laws which tell your college son that if he reaches out toward a woman who's already said yes to a date and he holds her hand without asking for permission, she can sue him for sexual harassment because she did not give him an affirmative consent that if she didn't say yes with that one hand, with that one action and that he must repeat that request at every stage of greater intimacy like a kiss on the cheek, kiss on the lips, kiss on the other. Did you say in 26 states? 26 states, some version of that is the law. One of the strictest laws is right here in California where I'm from. And so the boy is now on the one hand fearful of the combination of that and the hashtag me too and becoming part of the predator list. Right. On the other hand, if he's at all of a college student who does his homework, he realizes that the best selling movie of all time for women is gone with the wind and the best selling fiction book for women is 50 Shades of Grey. Interesting. Yeah. 50 Shades of John Grey, my co-author. And the 50 Shades of Grey would lead him to thinking that maybe what he should ask for for his speed 16 birthday is a new set of whips. On the one hand, he's getting the message of what's the message in Gone with the Wind that a woman is protesting and fighting with a man. The man sweeps her off her feet, takes her up the stairs and what's the woman's response? Sexual harassment? No. Mad passionate love. Right. So let's see now. What exactly am I supposed to do? I'm a 14 year old boy. I'm less mature than my female counterpart. Girls have the option of taking the sexual initiative. I have the expectation that's taking the sexual initiative. So sex is dirty. I'm expected to initiate the dirt. And how do I initiate it? Do I initiate it in the 50 Shades of Grey or Gone with the Wind model? Or do I initiate it by asking the woman does she want me to hold my hand? Right. And so he's expected to sort these things out with legal implications. Right. Life altering implications at a very young age. Exactly. And he's been the Asian porn where he sort of knows he has to keep it secret. So it teaches him that sex is dirty. So he feels ashamed about his greater desire for sexuality than the girl has. All of this is haunting him. He's filled with shame and filled with not knowing what to do, filled with expecting to be strong and in the initiator, but also not being strong and not being the initiator. And we wonder why he might be willing to withdraw a deport. Yeah. Interesting. Well, let me ask you one other question before we move on. And I know we're bumping up against time here for you. You've got to stop here pretty quickly. But I do want to go back to something that we had alluded to earlier. You had mentioned the divorce rate among those fathers who choose to stay at home rather than to enter the workforce. Can you talk to me about that briefly? This is picking up on something you had asked me about before that I didn't complete the trajectory on when men stay home and do not work outside of the home, either producing money directly. They're not working on a project that will lead to producing money. Whether or not their marriage works depends more on whether the woman who is working and earning more money respects her husband's role as being a primary caretaker. If she respects him, he's likely to feel fulfilled and secure and feel like he's having a role that has purpose. And if she respects the male style of parenting and reinforces him for that, he feels like a hero at home. But remember, he has a lot to contend with, which is he might be a hero to you. You are his most important person to be a hero to. But on the other hand, he's going into the park with his four or five year old son and daughter. The women at the park with their other sons and daughters at four or five are in a group talking with each other. And he feels excluded from that group. And they might even look at him suspiciously and say, what are you doing? Not working. What are you doing with your that girl that you have sitting in your lap? And we naturally jump to some conclusions about that scenario when we see this. It's like women experience in the 1950s. If they were working full time in construction, or even now in construction, and people said, well, what are you doing in this occupation? The single most important dynamic that leads to fathers or the primary caretaker either having a good marriage or not good marriage is the respect or lack of respect or mixed signals that he receives from the mother. To have that respect, a mom has to know why children do so well when parented predominantly or equally by father. Number two, be articulate about respecting what the father is contributing. Number three, watch your own likelihood of being attracted to somebody at work who is doing very well financially, like your husband isn't. Right. That is as powerful for a woman as a man meeting at work, an gorgeous young woman when he's married to a 55 to 70 year old woman, a gorgeous young woman who's paying attention to him. I really respect you, Mr. Weinstein, because, I'm also just sleeping with you. Yeah, I can see how that would create a lot of additional, not that it can't work, but I can see how it would create a lot of difficult variables to contend with, for sure. Yes, and I'd say that if you're focusing on any section of the boy crisis that I think is the most valuable contributor to keeping a marriage together, couples communication, how to handle personal criticism without becoming defensive. That is humans Achilles heel is our inability to handle personal criticism without becoming defensive. When your partner becomes defensive, you become more fearful about saying that things you really are feeling and fearing to your partner. And then your partner ends up not expressing himself or herself and feeling lonely and isolated. So focus on that part of the book that teaches you how to do that. And then secondly, focus on the part of the boy crisis that focuses on how to structure a family dinner night. So everyone feels heard so that there are no competing variables like electronics at the table, how to enforce there being no electronics at the table, how to make sure that controversial topics can be brought up without one person feeling offended or dominating the conversation. Family dinner nights can be family dinner nightmares if they're not done well. Yes, I've experienced both. But yeah, I mean, I think this is indicative of a larger problem in culture too. You know, we can't have conversations like we've had today without, and I guarantee I'm going to get a message or an email from somebody who's going to be offended by something I said. And because we live in this culture of outrage, we can't have the difficult and much needed conversations like the one that we're having today. It's really frustrating in fact, your ability to both ask crucial questions, do your homework about reading the boy crisis first rather than just winging it and then listen as well as you do and then do good follow up questions are really part of the process that helps a dialogue be constructive. Thanks, Lauren. I appreciate that. Well, as we wind down, let me ask you a couple additional questions. The first one is what does it mean to be a man? It means discovering yourself. And what is unique about you? And then combining that with discovering, is there a way I can be a responsible contributor to whatever level of family I want to have so that I'm not just doing what fulfills me, but leaving my wife or my children in a position where they, that doesn't account for what fulfills them. It's fulfilling yourself in balance with taking responsibility for providing options for your family at the same time and experimenting with adventure with that blend and then talking to your family about how is this working for you? What is working? What is not working for you? Being willing to listen to their feedback about, you know, dad, you seem a little bit off today or when I approach you and you interrupt me and give me an answer before I've asked my question fully, I don't feel invited to approach you more. And so these are the types of things that I think it takes to be a man. The good news is, for the first time in human history, you have more permission to discover yourself that our fathers and grandfathers never had the chance to do. Our fathers and grandfathers were not human beings, they were human doings. I'm a doctor, I'm a lawyer, I'm a, you know, that type of stuff. But today we have the option to be human beings, but as I mentioned before, the more fulfilling the occupation is there's a reason we hear starving artists, almost every actor in Los Angeles has the same name called waiter. And so, yeah, because men who follow their bliss don't usually make a lot of money. If you don't make a lot of money, you're oftentimes not able to share the responsibilities economically once you have children. And so being a man today is having the encouragement, the mentorship to be able to explore your soul, your unique self on the one hand, and your responsible accountable self on the other. That's powerful, really, really powerful. Well, how do we connect with you? I've got my copy of the book right here. How do we connect with you? How do we pick up a copy of the book and learn more about the work that you're doing? Yes, if you just do boy crisis, the boy crisis book will come up. Amazon is definitely the least expensive place to get it. And if you're a guy and you have a commute to work or a woman who has a commute to work, I've been getting actually as much positive feedback about the audible version. I spent five days in studio reading every single word of the book. And then John Gray did the part on ADHD. He knows far more about ADHD than almost anybody that I know. And what are the non-prescription non-drug alternatives ADHD? A lot of people seem to enjoy the listening as much as the reading. Excellent. Well, we'll link all that up. I just want to tell you that I really, really appreciate you. I appreciate you taking time out of your day to come on the show and impart some of that wisdom. And you've enhanced my life, you know, reading this book, going through your work and incorporating some of what you've taught into my life as a father and a man and raising my kids and leading with my wife has been very, very impactful. So I want to tell you, I appreciate you and thank you for coming on the show today. Thank you so much, Ryan. There's nothing that's more important to me than contributing to a family's love. I really appreciate that. There it is, guys. My conversation with Dr. Warren Farrell. I hope that you enjoyed that one as much as I did. If you've got a son or you're a father type figure in the community or in your church or wherever it may be in school, this is just such a valuable, valuable discussion. And if you haven't picked up a copy of Dr. Farrell's book, The Boy Crisis, I highly, highly recommend that you do. It's such a powerful read and you're going to walk away with some very specific strategies and ideas and new thoughts about how to raise our future generations of men. So guys, if you liked the show or if you didn't like the show, make sure you drop us a line. Let us know what you thought. Let us know what you're taking away. Connect with us on Twitter, Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, wherever you're doing the social media thing. And we'd love to continue this discussion. It's so critical as a father myself, making sure that I know what my boys are in for and my daughter, because we talked about that as well, is critical, so important and so valuable in my life. So I'll leave you there, guys. I'm glad, as always that you're tuning in. Please, if you would, make sure to remember the rating review contest that we're doing between now and the end of September. We're giving away hats, shirts, signed copies of the book, one-on-one calls. We're considering doing a meetup and we're going to have a good time, get you guys some stuff. And in the meantime, we're going to continue to boost the visibility of what we're doing here with this movement, Order of Man. So I'm glad that you're on the journey. You help me. You inspire me to be a better man myself and I want to thank you for that. So until tomorrow for our new Ask Me Anything episode, guys, go out there, take action, and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at OrderOfMan.com."
