    "text": " It looks like sports illustrated is just the latest in an increasingly long list of brands that want their customers to know that tangent trans women are women and you will find them beautiful. The brand just released their latest edition which has not one but actually four cover models one of which is Trans singer Kim Petrus who you guys might be familiar with because she was actually the singer who accompanied Sam Smith on stage at the Grammys when he gave that whole satanic performance. By the way Kim Petrus because of that song could become I think the first trans woman to win a Grammy and now here she is back at it breaking barriers becoming the first trans cover model for sports illustrated. They released this set of photos you can feast your eyes on them and I mean yep they definitely are something and along with those photos sports illustrated also released this right up of Petrus. They explained that Kim Petrus has been breaking barriers since releasing her first single I Don't Want It At All in 2017. They say the 30 year old is now adding another magnificent life moment to her growing list of accomplishments with her 2023 SI swimsuit issue cover. They also explained that while Petrus says she occasionally feels pressure to represent the trans community she's proud that fellow trans people are inspired by her and the work she does. I think what you do is the most important thing not what your gender is Petrus says. No matter what your gender or sexuality or any of that stuff is it's about what you make of life and it's about what's inside of you and all of that so I hope that can be inspiring to people. I'll admit I'm not a big sports illustrated fan especially the swimsuit edition I don't know I kind of thought they're all swimsuit editions I'm clearly not the target demographic here but I would have thought that actually the magazine would be about like sports or fitness and then yes also occasionally I suppose sexy women in swimsuits but it seems like it's now about LGBT empowerment so that's kind of that's kind of fun I mean I'm not sure how sports illustrated readers actually feel about that but I can only assume that they're on board with it because there's no way in 2023 that I brand would ever do something that goes against its target audience just for well virtue points right we're going to be breaking down exactly what the reaction has been to this very brave very stunning trend swimsuit model but first I want to say thank you to today's sponsor old guard pet company so don't all pet food companies want what is best for your dogs ideally yes but in practice no so many pet companies in fact are pushing trendy ingredients and expensive recipes but are they better no and in fact for a lot of these things most have no proven health benefits for your dog and on top of that many pet food companies are actually using your money to fund a leftist woke political agenda do you guys remember Mars and the purple M&Ms well Mars is also the biggest pet company in the world so watch as these doff who companies released bug and vegan recipes you know it's gonna happen it'll show you where their priorities are putting so-called environmentally friendly recipes first while barely researching the impacts on your dog's health but if you don't want to compromise on high quality ingredients and want science-backed recipes real proven science not Fauci science then I urge you to get old guard it is the only pet food company founded and run by a PhD in pet nutrition who started old guard after seeing a drastic shift in priorities over her 14 years with some of the largest pet brands with quality ingredients like real chicken egg fish oil and probiotics old guards recipes are perfectly balanced with guaranteed health benefits plus they also have a taste your dog will love and everything including their resealable bags are made right here in the United States so please check out old guard petco.com subscribe today and get it delivered right to your door use code Lauren for a discount with old guard you don't have to compromise ingredient quality your dog's health or traditional American values buy from a company that actually puts your dog first you guys pets give us so much satisfaction and love and just joy in our lives we need to make sure that we are feeding them the best that we can so that's old guard petco.com with the promo code allorin and thank you to old guard petco for sponsoring this video now regarding cat petris and sports illustrated predictably when these photos were released a lot of treads activists out there especially online were saying how wonderful this was how this was a huge step forward for trans representation and I'm sure that sports illustrated can feel really good that they've gained new fans in those 40 or 50 so people out there however I think for the majority of people especially regular readers of sports illustrated there were some questions and perhaps some criticisms to be had over the fact that they would choose to feature a trans woman for a magazine that cares largely to straight men because despite the insistence of the progressive left the truth of the matter is that for the vast majority of straight men out there even just knowing that an individual is a trans woman even if they pass perfectly that's usually enough to I guess remove any sense of attraction because you know attraction is based on biology not gender identity and you know Kim Petrus she's he's male and for any of you viewers out there who are upset about pronoun usage for Kim Petrus yes Kim is a biological male but I just want it to be known that YouTube has been cracking down on people for misgendering even going so far as to in certain cases demonetize or delete people's channels entirely scary stuff but hey that is just another reason why we really appreciate your subscriptions over at blazetv.com because they help us keep the lights on over here without having to worry about what YouTube's new censorship policies will be but in any case aside from being a trans woman what makes Kim Petrus on the cover of sports illustrated all the more controversial is that as other people have pointed out Petrus is actually someone who underwent gender transition surgery i.e. you know snip snip down there while he was a minor or she was a minor please please don't delete us you too so it could be argued here that not only is sports illustrated pushing the trans agenda but they're also pushing the idea that yes children can consent to being permanently mutilated and yes sterilize. In response to the criticism over Petrus though it looks like the people at sports illustrated they're standing firm in the fact that she is a she and is very brave a representative of the company said there is no theme to this year's issue rather there is a vision a sentiment a hope that women can live in a world where they feel no limitations internally or externally but the absence of a theme is not to say that these women don't share certain common traits they're constantly evolving these women don't even share a gender so the fact that sports illustrated is trying to group Kim Petrus in with women like Megan Fox who is another one of the cover models i mean it just the difference between these two individuals Petrus and Megan Fox it's it's pretty glaring and here's the thing yes in my opinion Petrus looks pretty attractive and yeah i would say like a woman in these photos but that does not mean that Kim Petrus is an actual woman let's not forget this is a biological male who has undergone a ton of surgery and hormone treatment just to get to where he is today and frankly without the photoshop and the flattering lighting as you can see with these photos from the Met Gala it's pretty obvious that yeah Kim Petrus is a man and the fact that we as a society are taking this mentally ill individual who was butchered at a young age before they could give consent and we are parading them like some showpony to signal to everyone how accepting and on board with the message we are while simultaneously shaming anyone including straight males for not finding this individual attractive it really is just it's nothing short of Orwellian and in case you're thinking well people want Kim Petrus to be represented and viewed as a woman but no one would go so far as to shame a straight man for not finding her attractive right well you're wrong that is absolutely what leftists are doing as this one petris stan wrote defending her she looks so pretty no one could deny that and if you do you're talking out of your ass and user Billy is writing in a longer thread noted okay apparently twitter discourse today is going to involve transphobes freaking out about Kim Petrus on the cover of sports illustrated my recommendation is just to notice how ridiculous they are a hot woman is on the cover of the swimsuit edition they're mad because dot dot dot chromosomes and just so that we can get some stuff out of the way one no finding her attractive doesn't make you gay if you are a man men who say she's not attractive are fragile little boys scared of losing their straight card hear that fellas don't find Kim Petrus attractive then you are a fragile little boy afraid of losing your straight card and one by the way if you think any of this is a generate then you are apparently a fascist as Billy also wrote if you see someone using the word to generate to talk about Kim or what she means for society run away you have found a fascist i mean is this all it means to be a woman nowadays to get the right type of surgery to have the right makeup and the right photoshop because if so that's pretty disappointing but that seems to be the message that the left is pushing in fact there are leftists out there who are actually shaming biological women actual women for not supposedly being as attractive as petris as we can see here by this viral tweet ratioed by Kim Petrus looking better than you'll ever look so ladies i'm sorry but if you're upset over increasingly being replaced by biological males then unless you have the money to get the amount of surgery that Kim Petrus has gotten you just need to shut your mouth and in an ideal world the backlash of this whole scenario would be enough to i guess scare sports illustrated straight for lack of a better term to let them know just like we've tried to let bud know that this is not okay you can't keep politicizing your brand and expect that everybody go along with it because guess what progressive left is they don't run the world or at least not yet but here's the thing though as someone pointed out online this actually isn't the first trans model that the brand has featured apparently Valentina, Sampoya and Laina Bloom were also both featured in sports illustrated in 2020 and 2021 but from my understanding they weren't cover models in the same way that Kim Petrus is which is why i guess Kim Petrus is still a big deal or a step forward or backward depending on how you look at things but in any case i would like to know what you guys all think about this especially if you're someone who actually reads or read sports illustrated is this stunning and brave and what we need to be seeing more of or is this just another example of how the left insists on pushing biological women out real women out in favor of highlighting males with mental illness let us know down below that's it for now though and if you enjoyed this video please be sure to like share and subscribe until next time"
