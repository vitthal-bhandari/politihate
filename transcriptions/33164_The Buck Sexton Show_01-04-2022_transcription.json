Biden who might don't think knew what trans rights were about five minutes ago is now the trans rights for children advocate. This is fascinating because you've seen that the trans agenda more out the open and aggressive than ever before and more extreme than ever before recently. You have Leah Thomas a man competing against women in the NCAA swimming championship and winning. Some of us have been saying for a long time. This is exactly what's going to happen if you keep this thing going this situation going of pretending that men can become women. And remember that is I have to remind everybody it is not that men can become trans women. The actual theory here the belief I should say among those on the left is that men can become women full stop. And if you say well hold on a second but they don't have a uterus and they don't they won't they can't have babies and they don't have XX chromosomes it's shut up big it some women can't have babies. I mean they just yell at you. You say well hold on a second but that's not that doesn't deal with the fundamental biological reality shut up big it men can become women and women can become men. This is what they tell you they're wrong it's not true it's insane but this is now a mandatory belief for Democrats that is what you have seen this it is now transitioned this is no longer the activist left or the activist fringe it is you must you must bend the knee you must obey you must concede that men can become women and women can become men or else you are out of favor within the Democrat party you're going to be shouted down you will suffer the consequences of believing what you're lying eyes tell you and what you're lying ears here that is the that is the fundamental demand of the left you you believe what we say you affirm what the left says it doesn't matter what you actually know to be true or untrue here is Biden it's Joe Biden folks guys almost 80 years old yeah all of a sudden he's a trans children advocate to everyone celebrating transgender day of visibility I want you to know that your president sees you Jill Kamala Doug our entire administration sees you for who you are made an image of God the deserving of dignity respect and support but we know it's hard when there are those out there who don't see you and don't respect you for example the onslaught of anti-transgender state laws attacking you and your families simply wrong this administration is standing up for you against all these hateful bills there any transgender American who's struggling please no you're not alone parents and children alike please ask for help and know this you're so brave you belong and we have your back I'm reading off a cue cards here I don't know transgender pan pan sexual non-binary cisgender I swear I know what all these things mean care no joke I care deeply and this is Joe Biden everybody he's just been a marionette for the forces with the Democrat Party for his entire life whatever works whatever he's supposed to say that's what he says whatever's gonna make Democrats vote for him at any point in time and make the Democrat Party support him that's what he does he has no principles Joe Biden believes in nothing other than Joe Biden that is it that is it and yet here he is pretending he cares so much about the transgender rights let's let's be very clear I think this is good I think this is exactly where the Democrat Party should be right now because they're saying the quiet part out loud they get outraged when they can't have and you see this on like the libs of tiktok account I know very few of you are on tiktok but it's it's now where it's where all the kids are I mean this is you know this is one of the problems I have with conservatives here we get all curmudgeonly and crusty about our habits oh I'm not gonna download that or oh I'm not gonna watch watch that platform and then it becomes dominated by leftist lunatics who are indoctrinating your children and we don't even know about it that's what ends up happening and look I'm guilty of it too people say oh buck but tiktok is a Chinese spying operation tiktok is brainwashing your kids right now I probably best to know what's on there right probably a good idea that Republicans should engage and know what the propaganda is at some level at least not just ignore it oh I don't want to be a part of the Chinese spying operation well guess what your kids are but you see on tiktok they have all these all these teachers who are just insane I mean all of these blue-haired nose rings overwhelming I'm just gonna say it I mean really look like they you know haven't bathed in a long time these teachers that are going on there and saying crazy things I mean they claim to be teachers who really knows about how they openly want to indoctrinate your children your young children your kindergartners first graders into transgender ideology and gender all this stuff friends they're trying to destroy gender that that is the that is the foundational that is the baseline purpose here that's what this is all about destroy gender the Marxists wanted to do this for a long time go back into Marxist theory what do they hate God family they hate these things because it gets in the way of the project of full control of your mind your soul your heart all of it so they want to destroy these things they want to actually make them into the equivalent of intellectual and emotional rubble and then rebuild something else in their place gender and gender relationships masculinity femininity this stands in the way of the project of the left which is total and full control and a radical a radical equality that is enforced by the state which means all actual power and distinction is handed to the state this is what they're I understand it's like oh my gosh is that is what they're trying to do so we might as well be honest about this this is how they can look at you and say yeah that guy who has male genitalia and his six foot four and has had a different bone structure muscle density etc etc etc testosterone levels and everything for the last dozen or so years him beating a bunch of women in any sport swimming you name it that's not weird that's fine that should be celebrated actually and Joe Biden's out there we see you we celebrate yeah it's great these Democrats want to take your kids and brainwash them into thinking this stuff as they do they do and this is the reality now you're seeing this I mean California New York the Democrat party has lost its mind I mean here's Governor Ron DeSantis pointing out that people are moving to Florida because these states these state governments where the lives have total control or as he puts it dumpster fires you look at the demand in Florida I mean part of the reason is is because people are trying to get the hell out of these dumpster fire states that have just done so poorly so everyone's trying to figure out how to go into Florida so what I think will happen is you know you're gonna need more supply yes we have different programs to help alleviate I view a lot of what we're doing with the police and the fire and the teachers as helping to address overall inflation as well people want to move to Florida because it's not being run by lunatic leftists New York State New York City California Illinois a lot of these places lunatic leftists are calling the shots the ruin your life the ruin your life the ruin your kids the ruin the economy the ruin your day-to-day freedom wear a mask remember four shots is rookie numbers friends when it comes to COVID you need five or six maybe seven don't go with those rookie numbers the four shots that's not I mean you get to shot five outrageous outrageous I want to tell you about Gibson Baker here in a second because there's a there's a broader story behind all of it too you don't know about Gibson Baker you got to stay with me you're gonna be like you gotta be kidding me this is the time to think about protecting the value of your savings account don't be surprised at inflation rate reports later this year it's bound to be bigger percentage wise than last year well I don't want to see that kind of inflation I want you to be able to protect yourself from the effects it means your dollar save won't go as far

good story of the day appeals court upholds Gibson bakeries massive verdict against Oberlin college now let's just put this out there are a lot of colleges that are commie factories that are intellectually unserious that are overrun with the woke left Oberlin college is among the very worst when it comes to that there there's a lot of them brown university Wesleyan even hammers where I went a lot of wokeness there but there are some schools that really take a special pride in taking wokeness to the absolute highest degree possible they go all in on the woke and an Oberlin college is very very high on the list or is it Oberlin University whatever Oberlin college I guess yeah so here yeah it's Oberlin college so here you go the Ohio 9th district court of appeals issued a decision in the Gibson's bakery versus Oberlin college case and just understand Gibson's bakery was a fifth generation family owned business in Oberlin Ohio it served baked goods add to the public and also and there's a great rundown on legal insurrection calm on this one it also served baked goods to the public and the student dining service at Oberlin so shoplifting was a problem there's also a convenience store there they had a shoplifting problem and a member of the Gibson family caught a a student shoplifting caught a student shoplifting there was a scuffle the student was shoplifting but the student was black so what happened the police came there was an arrest and then the story became from the student and from Oberlin college oh but it was racial profiling and Gibson's bakery is racist in fact Gibson's bakery has a long history Oberlin college said officially in statements of being racist and doing racist things they put out flyers saying do not buy from this business it has a long history of racism now just understand the black student in question here was a thief at the time of this was actually stealing that was happening didn't matter they claim that it was racial profiling that led to the apprehension of the thief oh okay it doesn't matter that a crime was being committed because they say well there was racism behind the the ability to figure out that a guy here who's a student Oberlin was committing a crime the school went all out cut off the contract with the bakery for a provision of of of food to their dining hall put out flyers the administration put out a letter and destroyed Gibson's business destroyed the Gibson bakery by putting out flyers claiming that a family-owned fifth generation business in this community in Ohio was racist because they stopped a thief they're racist because of that that was what and they said there was a long history of racism never backed this up never had been another complaint of racism before this never had been anything about racial profiling before this but they just made up a story they made up a story well the good news is that Gibson's bakery was awarded 32 million dollars from Oberlin College 32 million dollars i love it bankrupt that piece of crap school bankrupt it go all and by the way i'm sure oblant probably has a you know 300 million dollar endowment or something but take them to the cleaners as they say this is this is actual it's rare in this era of wokeness you see real justice and just understand this was just upheld on appeal this isn't an initial judgment the appeals court said yeah you defamed them you know Oberlin's claim was here oh it's protected it's protected First Amendment speech actually no it's not there is such a thing as defamation these are private individuals the Gibson family they were not public individuals they were operating a business they were complying with the law and the people at oblant were just upset how dare you stop this black student from stealing let's destroy your business let's be very clear again there's no there's no debate over whether or not the student was actually shoplifting person was a thief breaking the law stealing but that's not that's not to be talked about here oh it was racist ah that's what Oberlin says so a 32 million dollar judgment i mean i wish it was a hundred million dollar judgment but good for the Gibson family happy to see this happy they took this all the way it's not okay to lie about people and claim that there's a history of racism in a place when you have absolutely no evidence you're not allowed to destroy private individuals with false with libelous with slanderous allegations not allowed to destroy a business because you want to just offer up another sacrifice to the woke gods so yay for Gibson bakery and then i think that's going to be it for today i had something else that thought i might talk about but i that's good we've covered a good amount today i told you about Gibson bakery but in pretending he's some trans agenda uh you know freedom fighter or whatever it's it's amazing to watch all the stuff play out thanks for hanging with me team back on Monday shields
