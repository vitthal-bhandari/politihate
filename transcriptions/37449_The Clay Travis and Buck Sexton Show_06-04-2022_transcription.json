    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in clay Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us Thru all through the Wednesday edition of the program Betsy DeVos by the way and Ken kuchen alley former Virginia ag both of those guests scheduled to join us in the next hour and Then half or so so Several different things to dive into but I want to say right off the top. Thank you to all of you who are listening in all 50 states And also thank you to all of you who are listening right now on the podcast we talk about this We want to grow and have our show as accessible and as many different mediums as possible because everybody's busy and there's different obligations and responsibilities that everyone has on a day-to-day basis And we hit nearly 13 million podcast downloads in the month of march Which is a new all-time high for the show As it has continued to grow in a substantial way. So thank you to all the 400 plus affiliates out there Thank you to everybody who is downloading the podcast and encourage you Uh to uh continue to consume the show in as many different ways as you possibly can you can always check out Clay and buck.com and make sure that you don't miss anything at all there. So uh as we roll into april Let's continue to uh fight the good fight and be voices for sanity and an insane world and get as large and growing of an audience We possibly can we thank you for all of that now Vardy talked about a lot of different issues But democrats are really painted into a corner in a really difficult spot right now Particularly on the border Certainly with inflation Everything is set up in A position where they are Really Reeling as we approach the midterms And that's before they're even getting their feet held to the fire in a very aggressive fashion about a lot of different stories Want to talk a little bit about joe biden who claims he doesn't know any of the chinese associates Business partners of hunter biden the guys who gave him 4.8 million dollars Yet today fox news reports that joe biden wrote a letter of recommendation For one of those chinese business associates of hunter bidens to an ivy league school in the united states seems a little bit fishy and today buck we've talked a lot about the rise of transgender athletes and in particular men who are deciding to identify as women and are crushing Women in a variety of different sports all over the country most notably of late swimming in college And joe biden we played this audio for you earlier this week Is poised to introduce new title nine legislation which will increase the overall power of transgender athletes But he's not even willing to say hey, it's wrong for men to compete against women Which is what bores johnson was willing to say and i want you to listen to this and then i want you to think about this question Why is joe biden avoided saying what the vast majority of people all over this country agree with Here's bores johnson speaking out today in the uk i don't think that uh Biological males should be competing in female sporting events and maybe that's a quadrilateral reason But it just it just seems to me to be sensible and i also happen to think that Women should have spaces which are whether it's in in hospital or prisons or change rooms or wherever Which are dedicated to to women that's as far as my thinking has developed on this on this issue So That is bores johnson And what i would ask everyone out there listening right now is this Why in the world will joe biden not say the same thing Why will jen saki not even say it on his behalf? We certainly know That 79 year old joe biden Is not in favor of men competing against women There's just no way under the sun that that is true Why won't he say it? But the reason why he won't say it is because he's afraid of alienating his base He's also in favor of according to the white house documents that we discussed uh just a few days ago of full transgender surgery and hormone therapy for teenagers i mean and and kids who are just uh, you know Adolescence i mean 12 13 14 year olds Uh and perhaps younger which is is just crazy I mean i i spoke with a an md friend of mine about this i said i'm just wondering what does the psychiatric community say about that Not about trans you know you always say adults is one thing you want to live your life a certain way you want to make your decisions That's a separate category we could discuss how that you know manifesting your disagree with that But at least they're adults exactly but i asked i said with the psychiatric community says uh Psych yeah, psychiatrist know that if they speak out About the issue of trans children The woke mob is going to come for them and you know and destroy them and get them to lose their license everything else But they know that there's no long-term Science or studies or data to suggest that this is safe I mean forget about mentally and emotionally safe that this is physically safe The risks of sterility Are very high from those kinds of so never be of of kids your whole life and that's just one thing There are also a whole lot of other areas where it's very likely to have extreme Physical impact over one's entire life. I mean you cannot change well, you know They'll that growth period right when you're going through puberty male or female a lot of major changes happen your body The bite in white house. I mean think this is what we said in the beginning. They're putting forward this old Backslapping. Oh, I'm a I'm a union guy and I know you just gave this whole speech your body Oh, the unions are what delivered this He pretends to be this old school democrat, but really he's a facade For the lunatic left, which is why he won't answer the question as you said about where where does the biden white house stand on this This is about federal law. This is about federal policy. This isn't just a theoretical anymore We're going to talk to betsy divas about what it means for title nine They should have a clear opinion. They'll articulate but clay They won't because they know that it's getting too short here between now and the election And it's not looking good for the for the maniacal left You have to pick a side here You have to pick a side you cannot be in the squishy middle on the question of Do biological men who want to identify as women deserve the ability to compete against women? You're either for women's athletics or you're for full transgender Domination frankly of women's athletics and I think on some level buck What they're not acknowledging but is going to become more and more omnipresent as we move forward Is it's going to happen in basketball or tennis or? track and field a sport that lots of people care about And swimming in the olympics would be a sport that people care about but they don't really care about it that much in the ncwa college athletics of swimming but when a Really good male basketball player Decides inevitably this is going to happen when a really good male basketball player decides. Hey, you know what? I've always felt like i'm a woman. I identify now as a woman and you're going to have a six foot nine beast of an athlete Male who suddenly is playing in the wnba and is dominating because that athlete would be the greatest women's basketball player of all time It's going to be impossible to not discuss and acknowledge this situation. I actually think that it's likely to come to Uh, we know women's tennis is a sport that really lots of people pay attention a lot of people pay attention to women's tennis Uh, I think it's a much bigger draw than the than the wnba is overall. Yeah globally And you're you're going to have a biological male in women's tennis to keep in mind the purse for the us open Same for men as this for women and it's like four million dollars or three points something million dollars Exactly. So yeah, you're in the net now you're talking about somebody who you transition You only have a transition for a couple for a couple of years and you could make theoretically tens of millions of dollars being the best female tennis player in the world instead of being Uh, the number 500 male maybe the number thousand male on the on the tour and whatever the rankings I think the ranking stopped at 500 but point being You know, that's the level of difference that we're talking about here and the left is just going to keep saying yes because we're I have to remind people this because they they people reject this initially clay and then they go wait. No, you're right It's not that women can become Uh, rather that men can become transgender women The ideology of the left is that a woman who is transgender? I'm sorry a man who is transgender can become a woman full full stop node And in fact the left will even push this places like the huff post salon. I mean the real Crazy commie stuff. They'll push that there's something bigoted There are articles on this you can find them about a heterosexual male Who is not attracted to a transgender female because it's a female you see it's a female you're dealing with not a transgender female That is the actual left. I know people here. There's this that's what they believe The other thing is they try to play uh games here because they say well transgender Doesn't really change the outcome of most sporting events And that's because they're saying well of course a woman who decides to become a man Has absolutely no chance of ever competing at a high level because men are bigger stronger and faster than women So the only time this becomes a competitive issue is when we move from uh from a man deciding to become a woman Right and so it's also interesting even from the biden white house if you really want to drill down on this Joe biden supported congressional investigations into steroid use in baseball Because he thought it impacted the overall fairness of the sport Well, if you believe that men Injecting themselves with steroids, which makes them bigger stronger and faster is a direct threat to competition In america and oh by the way the other reason they said in addition to competitiveness They said they didn't want kids to take the lesson that they should be injecting themselves with steroids to be good at athletics What about the kids out there that are taking the lesson of i'm a mediocre guy At sports, you know, even maybe a decent college athlete at sports But i could be the greatest women's athlete of all time and i could make tens of millions of dollars Somebody's going to take that economic incentive. They're going to grab that brass ring But it's also the tip of the spear for the the the marxist uh family destroying gender eradicating left in so many ways You know as a society as a civilization We treat men and women differently and there are some aspects of how men should treat women That i think are actually rooted in In decency morality and ethics, you know the the notion of you know, even when you're i'm sure you're chivalry. Chivalry is not all awful It's actually Yes, exactly where i'm going. I mean, you you know, you never You know any any you know red blood american dad will say you know, you never you never hit a girl A man never lays a hand you know never lays a hand on a woman You know, i mean a guy gets a little mouth you at a bar your dad says, you know, maybe you know Maybe you got a you know defend yourself whatever but with a woman there's a different approach We treat women differently and that's a part of Of our western judeo christian civilization in america that is a good thing when i'm treating them differently in good ways That's being eradicated here too I mean the sense of male chivalry that you are to defend and honor and cherish women That's all being eradicated by this because to bring it all back to the question i'd give Matt wallish over the daily wire credit credit for it. What is a woman? marcia blackbird asked that at katangi brown jacks and she couldn't answer it and by the way We're talking about sports that are not physically violent Combat sports is going to get tougher and tougher buck Because if you got a full grown dude and he decides to become a woman He's still a lot bigger stronger and faster than everybody he's going to be fighting against Um that is not going to end well at some point you're going to have a biological dude Who just beats the crap out of a biological woman And we're calling it women's sports and i think that's already starting to happen a little bit in the ufc But it's going to get worse as the incentive structure continues to be altered and as this becomes more common But in the meantime, hey you had a little pain in your life Seven out of ten people who decide to go and try relief factor feel better after they do It's an all natural product developed over 15 years with doctors And they give you a three week quick start take one uh, uh pill three times a day at breakfast lunch and dinner All natural for three weeks and you know if it works for you or not Heather from georgia gave it a try relief factor works for her.

Uh, let's go ahead and bring in Right now appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We got betsy devoss education secretary under president trump She has got a piece up at the new york post Biden's radical title nine plan would kill women's sports She's also got a book out in june hostage is no more the fight for education freedom in the future of the american child Uh, miss devoss. I appreciate you coming on with us. This by the way, you did a phenomenal job Uh on title nine Investigations on college campuses they had turned completely into kangaroo courts And I don't think you get enough credit for it And I know the biden administration has tried to walk back some of the protections you gave to students Uh, but the obama administration Errors in the title nine investigations in particular into sexual assault were a travesty of justice So I want to start by saying thank you and what is the latest because I know many people out there have Uh sons and daughters on college campuses and these kangaroo courts as it pertains to title nine were a total joke Where are we now with those? Well, uh first of all happy birthday And um So what the biden administration is trying to do now is really the second major round of weaponizing title nine To suit their political agenda The first time around in the obama administration as you mentioned they took title nine sent dear colleague letters and basically created kangaroo courts on college campuses across the country Hundreds of young people were Were unjustly treated due process was thrown out the window We turned that all around did the regulating did the proper procedures to make sure the title nine rule Was going to be fair? Balanced and predictable for all anyone who has to be involved in one of those issues What they're doing now is going a major step further and saying that changing the definition of biological sex to include uh sex stereo or sex Stereotyping to redefine uh Sex related characteristics including intersex traits and just expanding the definition of sex as we know it biologically Uh, which would in effect kill women's sports, which title nine was in part created to really protect and advance and expand the equal access to sports Anytime you have a biological male competing as a woman on a woman's team It's it's hard to say that you're honoring the purpose of title nine for women Speaking of betsy devoss former education secretary under president trump Uh, betsy what what is the the effect of this going to be? I mean, I'm just seeing Some of the numbers here for for people who think that this is a an issue that's limited so much in scope Obviously with lea thomas now. It's been in the headlines More and more people from gen z are identifying as trans so it's likely that there will be more sports We were just talking about this nc double a sports where there are trans competitors And so now it won't even be up to the school right it will mean that there is essentially a Federal civil rights violation under title nine if a trans individual who is biologically male Is not allowed to compete against women. I mean, is that how the biden Change will work. Yes. That is that is uh entirely within the scope of what they are proposing with the title nine rule changes They are not that the party of science Seems to be uh discounting science in every regard And uh, and I would argue the only science they're following is political science They are playing to the far left fringe of their party And uh, they continue to Really massively overreach in these areas where the population is just left dumbfounded the notion that Biological males who are stronger have have more bone density have greater cardiovascular capacity greater muscle mass stronger taller Longer arm wingstands that they should be able to compete on a women's team at any point is is just beyond It's about beyond the pale and it will it will totally ruin title nine So bores johnson came out today and said this is wrong And we played the audio from him earlier in the show Biological men should not be competing against women Why will joe biden not say the same thing? Well, it's a very good question and arguably it's because he continues to play to the far left fringe of his party Um, and I think with the hopes of trying to take take attention off all of the other massive failures that he's overseeing But we have to we have to fight this because before we know it if they continue in the process that they have undertaken To do new rulemaking We will find ourselves Essentially killing women sports across the country and it's totally unfair to all the thousands and thousands of young women who are working Hard and training in their favorite sport to compete The notion that they would have to face and and compete against biological men is simply unfair and it's untenable Betsy I also know that you've been you've been on the forefront of the fight for charter schools both in the past when you were President trump's education secretary and now you've written about what I believe you called the biden administration's What secret war against charter schools if I remember the headline what's going on with charter schools because parents right now all across the country Are mobilized and and interested in taking an active role at the administrative level at the parent teacher Meeting and school board level more so than we've seen in a very long time What's the biden administration doing to charter schools and school choice right now? Well, absolutely they are trying by every means possible to shut down any further expansion of charter schools So while there are over a million kids that we know of on waitlist to get into charter schools across the country The biden administration through the department of education is putting out new rules that will essentially Eliminate any charter expansion by requiring Districts to prove that the school the public the traditional public schools are over our over capacity and that there's you know There's there's too many students for them to be able to handle well This essentially says we will never open another charter school or we will never allow another one to be expanded through the federal charter school grant program because It's not based on demand for the charters. It's based on whether the district decides they have too many kids in their in their school system That's never going to happen. We've seen all of the politics played Regularly by the teachers union in the system And so they're trying to effectively kill charter expansion and expanding opportunities for parents to choose the right setting for their kids Betsy you I believe were a swimmer. I know you've got a couple of daughters. I'm betting I don't know this for sure that you've got some granddaughters as well. So does a huge percentage of our audience out there What should we do? Really to be aggressive? What would you tell those women who are competing against biological men? They're in a tough spot too. What advice would you give them? What would you say for people out there with their granddaughters? With their daughters who are trying to excel in sports working as hard as they can and then boom suddenly they run right into A biological male who is going to be bigger stronger and faster than them no matter how hard they work Well, I would urge them to pay attention to this process So it's a rulemaking process. There will be a time for public comment And we need to ensure that the department of education is deluged with observations complaints Opinions around what expanding the definition of biological sex will mean For the future of women's sports Being quiet at this point in time and not raising voices is absolutely the opposite of what should be done We have got to make sure that Every person for whom this is an important issue and even those who don't think it is speak up tell your members of congress write and Send your opinions in in this rulemaking process so that this will get shut down in its infancy The book out in june hostages no more the fight for education freedom and the future of the american child betsy devos Is the author betsy thanks so much for being with us appreciate it It's a pleasure and have a great birthday.

Thanks for hanging with us Great conversation just there with betsy devoss former education secretary under president trump and We need those parents Clay's mccallen a mom's revolution now for what six months we need those parents out there and mobilized and Stand it up for their kids and that also means voting for the best interests of their children in the sense that Democrat party has just completely lost its mind on some of this stuff and and that much I think has become apparent to anybody who's Got some common sense that it's paying attention. So please stay engaged. They motivated all across the country go to those Uh, go to those school board meetings Organize on your own speak to other parents Whether it's about masks or about you know transgender indoctrination for toddlers or whatever the issue is that's affecting your area We've got to keep people Mobilize because the only thing that stops democrats is the loss of power They'll keep doing this stuff more and more especially if they can get away with it Um, so that's really important. We're also going to be talking to the former attorney general of virginia Ken kuchanelli in the next hour about election Integrity issues as a movie out that looks at some of the shady stuff that went on in that last election So he'll break down for us. What's true? What's not what the reality is of those concerns because obviously we got an election coming up We'd like to know How secure is it are we really gonna find fraud if there is fraud? Do we really find find fraud that existed in the last one? There's a lot of Questions people have out there Uh, but let's get to some of your calls. You've been very patient with us You've been waiting and what do you think? Steve in bowling green kentucky? Steve. How you doing? Hey doing well guys. How about yourself? Work it. What's on your mind? Good of course now. I was just now I actually I was kind of wondering which was going on with Betsy talking about the Biden administration shooting down the charter school systems When actually here right now in the state of kentucky where actually in the process of charter school and expansions So is that the only is our this the only state that this is going on here? Is that the well, it's gonna be different it's gonna be different state to state all across the country There's what the federal government will do to encourage or discourage and then there's what state governments will do as well Uh, I can't speak to what's happening right now in kentucky clay. I mean, how's the scene in tennessee? I think there's a huge charter school movement that is continuing to grow as parental frustration Is on steroids. I mean, it's just skyrocketing all over the country with the educational Initiatives that parents are seeing their kids exposed and you know, there's also more we've talked about the zoom Revolution in a sense here of parents that saw the teaching going on in their own home because of the the lockdowns and the zoom Zoom teaching but technology now also allows parents to share and organize much more and I think that it's It's kind of forced parents to a lot of them. I had to adopt the you know, the zoom culture at some level and I've had to use this Stuff and now they realize we could do zoom call with 10 other concerned parents and talk about this and we could show up and You know, I think I think that the tech role on this is is uh, something that doesn't get much attention But it's very real bobby in bermingham, alabama where I had a great time with clay about six months ago. What's up bobby Hey guys, uh, buck. I just want to first say to you that uh, I've never actually listened to you because Uh, where I am in bermingham, they had you on an a horrible time slot. So I just never got a chance to listen to you lots of shame I'm glad we changed that Absolutely, but uh, my call was more directed toward clay. Um, play. I've been listening to you In bermingham, alabama, you have two stations. You've got rush limbal. Well, 105.5.m Is our affiliate here and you've got sports talk radio That's pretty much what we listen to down here in roll tight war eagle country And I got to tell you clay. I hated your guts for years because you would be a regular host regular calling guy With one of our local radio shows. I'm sure you're familiar with what i'm talking about But i'm like i remember thinking this guy hates alabama. I've been lifelong alabama fan And I hated you a lot. I literally blocked you on twitter just because i feel like that That was my way of you know giving you the finger But listening to you on this new format. I have grown to love clay drab is Well, that's very nice. That is a happy present to clay. It's a good birthday. Look there are i've talked about this before buck Uh, and I appreciate the call and by the way, we're number one in bermingham. So I appreciate everybody listening to us I'm in bermingham alabama. Yes, appreciate everybody listening to us in bermingham alabama right now It's great city my great aunt may be listening. She's 99. She lives in home wood And has lived in bermingham for a very long time, but And so i'm talking about people if you're an alabama or an auburn fan I love it. I mean I love college football. I think it's the lifeblood of this country But man if you say anything other than alabama is the greatest football team that's ever existed Or if you say anything other than auburn's the greatest football team that's ever existed People get riled up and it's amazing how many people now that I don't spend as much time talking about Sport, you know picking a winner between the iron bowl for instance and just you know get to go and have a great time Which we did I took my son Uh, who's becoming alabama fan which is a kick in the teeth to me as a tennessee guy But buck you saw it. I mean what was the reception that we got at the uh, you'd never been to an SEC game never been to a college football game I took you to old miss alabama down in tuska lusa. It was it was great overwhelming the amount of opportunity brothers were handing me all these Delicious elixirs in red plastic cups and they're like we love the show careful with some of those. Yes, I found out It can make you a bit woozy. It's not really for hydration the red solo cups are not for hydration purposes But yeah people of all ages man, we had an incredible time and uh, I think it's just because Oh, and this is who we speak to every day.
