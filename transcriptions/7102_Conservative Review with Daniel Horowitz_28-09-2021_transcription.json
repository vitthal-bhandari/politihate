    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative truth. The conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Miniman standing at the ready to fight anew for our liberties to the one and only see our podcast. This is your host Daniel Horowitz here pre recorded but for you guys it is Tuesday September 28th. I will be out again Wednesdays is the final week I'm out with the midweek blues got a lot going on but definitely wanted to make sure we got you covered for Tuesday this week and we have a really exciting show coming up. The most common question I get asked after how do I treat covid when government is killing people and denying them treatment is how do I get out of being forced to get mal treatment so we will have a lawyer on today who has taken on so many of the cases giving us an update and some advice on what to do. Before we have a mon just a couple of things it is interesting September 28th is the date in 1928. Okay 93 years ago to this day Sir Alexander Fleming a budding young bacteriologist accidentally discovered one of the greatest inventions of all time and that is penicillin. Well if he would have been around during the era of the pharma cartel he would have been squelched. Very simple things that were able to save so many lives and here we are with so much technology and so much money we don't know what to do with yet we can't even come up with a cure but it's not true because we do we do we have plenty of ways of doing it but they're blocking it so I think it's pretty apropos on this day that you know we we celebrate a true invention and and again you know these things I always believe in my religious beliefs that God tries to bring things out that appears to be accidental from our end but that was the predetermined time that God wanted us to discover them but what does not work is the cloth shots it's funny there's this BBC article out COVID-19 and Wales a third of positive cases are unvaccinated like what huh now you'll think like oh they're saying only a third no and you read the article and they're like man it's unbelievable look at all these unvaccinated people the irony is lost on them two-thirds of the cases are fully vaccinated people and it's completely lost on these dudes they can't even read their own graphs and then the irony is there's a subtitle in middle of the thing why are so many vaccinated people in the hospital the sheer number of people vaccinated mean that statistically double-vaccinated people will still be a significant portion of the hospital patients see here's the game they play it's fine if you have like literally a handful of rare hospitalizations and you'll be like well Daniel it's numbers if 95% of seniors are vaccinated so then yeah I mean 95% of the the case in the hospital or you know even less than that it's 85% so it's it's working but that would be if you have a small number but what we're finding and especially in America and a lot of these states is they've come under their worst hospitalization crisis ever throughout the last 18 months so that's called not working but that's where we are I never thought we'd be in this position where they'd be able to mandate something that prima fascia is not working they keep citing this uh Jacobson case and at least at the time the science was pretty clear for what they had then that at least it was working here it doesn't work one iota to stop transmission so that's your public policy goal the state vital state interest to stop transmission doesn't work so at best they resort to well it ameliorates some of the symptoms but even that wears off and we see it's wearing off and it has worn off but that should have no bearings on this that should have no bearings on your constitutional rights even if it did work it shouldn't so we're going to get to that with our guest today first a word from our sponsor you know folks there was once a time when private citizens used to be private the internet changed our life big tech working with big government they spy on us they watch everything we browse search tweet i can't believe how long i was going on without protecting my own devices so finally this year i turned to express vpn and i got vaccinated i vaccinated my computer from government spying i put a mask on it and unlike for covid this actually works basically what it does is it makes your ip address fully masked encrypted so you know no one could monitor it data harvesters using your ip address can't locate it because your ip address is now made anonymous every time i turn express vpn on i'm given a random ip address shared by other express vpn customers that makes it more difficult for third parties to identify me and harvest my data the best part is how easy express vpn is to use see i have my computer modus operandi set up and i don't like tampering with it i hate new stuff so i was very apprehensive but it was like boom the click of a button that's it when your computer comes on done i don't even notice it's there so if if i could manage to get this up without a hitch you could as well um don't allow yourself to be spied on ever again um believe me your data is your business and it needs to be secured secure it with the number one rated vpn on the market i trust visit express vpn dot com slash conservative to get an extra three months for free that's expr essevpn dot com slash conservative go to express vpn express vpn dot com slash conservative to learn more on how to mask and vaccinate your computer computer from Big Tech. Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you. Wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten, if you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. Come to The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. So as I noted, the biggest question I get asked medically is how do I get ahold of early treatment? How do I get ahold of a doctor? So it's hard to answer a thousand people. So I have doctors on the show that try to give you advice. Well, the second most common question is legal advice. What do I do with the mandates? It's school teachers. It's even students in states like California, Los Angeles in particular. It is military personnel, obviously government workers, but really workers in places even like Michelin tires right now. I mean, a lot of companies you wouldn't think that they're very woke. They're getting involved in this and people want to know. I mean, this can't be happening to me where I have to make a life decision. Either I have no job or an often you can't work in that entire field. It's not like you can get another job or I have to take something that often is unnecessary for a lot of people or it's, it's riskier than other things that are available. And this is unbelievable. It's not the United States of America. Where is the legal help? And we keep seeing all these court cases where they cite this Jacobson opinion, which is like citing dread Scott. And as we've noted, there's a number of reasons that even if you believe in Jacobson, it doesn't apply to what's in front of us, especially with the vaccine failing before our eyes and not fulfilling that vital state interest of even stopping spread at all. It appears to be spreading it even more. So what is going on? Do we have any hope in the court? Is there some Ezekiel mixed with my Jeremiah? Well, I can only be Jeremiah. So we have to invite a guest on. We've had Brian Feston before. He is a civil rights attorney from Connecticut who has really put in a lot of his own time and money and risked his own legal practice. Just like we see doctors doing risking their practice to treat people. He is trying to stand up for human rights. And he has an organization that I really, really need you guys to support. We the Patriots, USA dot org with the Patriots, USA dot org. And that's also where you could request help to be a plaintiff. A lot of you want to be plaintiffs. We're going to discover that all today with Brian. All right, Brian. Thanks so much for coming back and joining us today. Thanks for having me back on Daniel. And let me just begin by saying I am not Ezekiel by Eddie's threat. But I appreciate you having me back on. I'm glad you mentioned Jacobson in the intro there because I just want to say that is the most, I believe the most misinterpreted Supreme Court decision of our day is just abused. It is used constantly to stand for the proposition that the state has the police power to vaccinate pretty much without exception. And that's not at all what that case says. And that case was decided not even on the basis of religious freedom. Hening Jacobson was not claiming a religious objection to vaccination. He was claiming a personal liberty interest because he had had an adverse side effect. So a medical exemption of sorts. And the time before the Americans with Disabilities Act or anything like that. And in that case was decided before the incorporation doctrine. So before the bill of rights was interpreted to apply to the states through the 14th amendment. So that case is 1905. That case is basically irrelevant under today's legal scheme. That case was also decided, interestingly enough, before Roe v. Wade, before Planned Parenthood v. Casey, I have a lot of problems with. But the point is the court developed in the 1970s and going forward this idea of bodily autonomy and a right to bodily privacy under the Constitution. And that did not exist, of course, in the time. So Jacobson, so much has changed in the legal landscape to use that case and hold it up and say you can just apply it blindly to what's going on in 2020, 2021 is just utter foolishness. And I can't believe the garbage I've heard out of the mouths of many legal scholars just proclaiming that without even mentioning any of the things I just mentioned about the incorporation doctrine, about things they know about, about Roe v. Wade and the Casey decision. I mean, they just completely ignore it like it doesn't exist. Sure. I mean, and then even going with Jacobson, there's a number of other factors. Jacobson mentions the word legislature over a dozen times in the opinion. Almost none of these are, yeah, I think none of them are being promulgated by legislature. They're executive. Another mitigating factor is that, you know, it was, it was a fine, you know, it was about a hundred fifty dollars in today's dollars. We saw from NFIBB, Obamacare in NFIBB, the Sibilius, right? That it was a matter of, yeah, they have the power to find you to tax you. But to basically say you can't live a functioning life without something, that is a different story that was not going on with Jacobson. Obviously, you have the efficacy, you have the safety concerns at the time. The, the, you know, really it was discovered in 1796, but it was in wide use for several decades before 1905. So there's a lot of differences, but nonetheless, here's where I want to start, Brian. I don't want to talk about you and I who believe in godly values and constitutionalized because our court system largely does not, our political system does not. I want to talk practical in the system that unfortunately we have to deal with and people need success. We need the best plaintiffs in the best cases. So I want you to give us a little bit of hope because what we're seeing is that they're all applying Jacobson. There's no right to potty law, Tom. Drop dead. But use your, your focus mainly on the religious liberty side of it. Do you believe that that is the more auspicious angle whether you agree it should be or not based on recent and longstanding precedent? And we have a victory in New York already on that. Do you think that has the ability to broadly blow the mandate wide open? Yes, absolutely. So just to touch on what you said, uh, first is, uh, religious liberty has a longstanding, precedent in this, in this country going back to the founding of this country, which is why I always tell people religious exemptions are generally more successful than medical exemptions for the simple reason. I mean, the ADA, we don't have the case law to support it. We don't have as much of a foundation. The ADA, Americans with Disabilities Act has only been around since 1990. A lot of people don't realize that. So disability protections have only been in federal law since 1990. It's only a little over 30 years, whereas religious liberty protections, we have lines of cases going back to the beginning of this country. So you have hundreds of years of precedent. So yes, I do think standing on religious liberty is a much more, much more solid ground. The New York case that you mentioned, we filed along, well, several other organizations also filed lawsuits, but we were the first to file a lawsuit in defense of New York state healthcare workers. Like the state of New York, Governor Kathy Fauciel and Howard Zucker, who's the commissioner of the Department of Health in New York, issued a regulation saying that, or what they call the regulation, stating that, like you said, it's not coming from the legislature, stating that all New York healthcare workers had to get this shot and could only apply for medical exemptions, not religious exemptions. So that's not even allowed for you to even ask for religious exemptions. So we said, well, that's clearly unconstitutional for a state government to say that you're not allowed to have religious freedom in the workplace. You're not allowed to have religious accommodations in the workplace. We filed a lawsuit and we also filed a temporary, an emergency motion for a temporary restraining order against it. So while the litigation is playing out, that regulation would be stayed. It can't go into effect. We were initially denied by an Eastern District of New York judge within less than an hour filing it on a Sunday afternoon. He denied it without any explanation. We filed an appeal to the second circuit and the second circuit on Friday granted us a stay, granted the stay pending their hearing to hear it by a full three judge panel at the second circuit, which is going to happen this Wednesday. So all of these New York healthcare workers were slated to have to get vaccinated by today, September 27th, well, yesterday now, September 27th, or be fired. And by having that stay in place, we were able to stop that. And now that regulation cannot go into effect yet. And we're going to have a hearing on Wednesday at the second circuit to decide whether or not that state should be permanent while this litigation plays out. If ultimately we do not get a favorable decision, we will immediately appeal to the Supreme Court of the United States. We think given the high courts position recently on religious liberty and the high profile nature of this case, we think there's a very good chance that that will be reviewed. And we like our chances at the Supreme Court. So yes, if it gets to the Supreme Court, and if they ultimately decide on the underlying merits of the case, that it's illegal for a state to do this, then yes, that would have precedent all over the United States that no state government could tell someone they're not allowed to have a religious exemption in the workplace. Now, whether that would apply to schools and other things, I don't know that the decision would be that broad, but at least in the workplace, I think it would be broader than just healthcare workers. I think it would be broad enough to cover all employment situations. Sure. Sure. So I mean, the thing we have here is that obviously, you know, wouldn't help with private entities, but certainly government, government mandating it in them, you know, context of employment. And now now my question to you is what if the healthcare system is doing it on their own, you know, University of Amman, Maryland, so University of Maryland healthcare system without the force of the state of federal government, presumably that would not be covered by such a ruling? Yeah, I mean, with, well, I mean, it's probably not because this is going to be deciding whether the state can make such such a regulation. And so I probably wouldn't apply to private employers, but the, but what I'm hoping we get is at least some good language in the decision, even if it's dicta, some language, some language stating that, you know, you can't unilaterally say that Title VII doesn't apply to employees because Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 states very clearly that you must attempt to accommodate someone who requests a religious exemption. You have to engage in an interactive process, an interactive dialogue if the terms the courts have used, and you have to engage with that employee to try to accommodate them. You cannot have a unilateral mandate that says, no, you have to get this and there's no religious exemptions allowed, no religious accommodations allowed, we're not even going to listen to you, which is what the state of New York is saying. You cannot, that's clearly in violation of Title VII with regard to the workplace. And so I do think if there's some language in that decision, the ultimate decision, I mean, the decision on the emergency motion probably won't have that, but the ultimate decision in the lawsuit, I'm hoping to include that, so that'll apply to all employers in the United States. It's very, very important. And listen, we've had more victories than just this, and if you don't mind, I'd like to tell your listeners about some of the victories we've had recently. We've had victories in colleges, especially for college students. So we've gotten mandates, we've gotten religious exemption denials, I should say, overturned at Stanford University, Columbia University, Yale University, as well as many state schools. We have a professor actually from Columbia University who was 100% remote. He doesn't teach any of his class in person. He never steps foot on campus. He does all the classes remote. He was told he needed to get this shot or he was fired. We helped him get a religious exemption so that he now was able to work without having to be under this mandate, which he should, from the beginning. I mean, he was a, I mean, come on, he was a fully remote employee. He had absolutely no interaction with students or staff. He's posing no threat, not the unvaccinated people posing any threat anyway. But we have a lot of stories like that. We also have some stories. We have pending litigation against several universities for students throughout the country, Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska, just to name a few that I can think of off the top of my head where students have been denied and kicked out of school. So we have a medical student that who attends a state school, I'm not going to name it yet, but it's out in Colorado and was told he cannot continue his education. He cannot continue his education unless he gets the shot. His religious exemption was denied because they said it wasn't part of a comprehensive system of beliefs. He's just his personal beliefs. Well, that's nothing in the Constitution says that if you don't belong to an organized religion or a comprehensive system of beliefs that you're beliefs aren't entitled to protection, but this is a state university that's saying this and is telling him he is going to be not going to be able to finish his school. He's in medical school. He happens to be an Air Force veteran as well. Okay. So this is a veteran case as well. We have the same school in Colorado, the same school. We have a dental student who's an immigrant from Venezuela here on a student visa and she's being told too bad. You don't get the shot. You're not only kicked out of school. You're going to be deported back to Venezuela. So those are two really big cases that we have, you know, we have now taken on our legal team is moving forward with those and is going to be filing litigation against that school very soon. So you'll be hearing about that soon. So even in the cases where people are denied, we are here to help. The biggest thing we need though, the biggest obstacle for us, as you mentioned, is funding. That's the only reason we're not able to help more people. And unfortunately right now, I'm at the point where we're so flooded with requests that I'm turning away more people than I can take on because we just don't have the dollars there. So if there are people listening that have the means to support us, especially monthly donations, that's a really big deal because that gives us a predictable stream of income so we can budget for these losses. Because these lawsuits, as you know, Daniel, are extremely expensive. I mean, one lawsuit could be 50 to $100,000. These civil rights cases, these constitutional law cases, especially when we have to appeal all the way up to the Supreme Court, that's an extraordinary amount of legal work. And we have very, very good attorneys to do it, but they can't do it all for free. So it's we take the USA to know exactly exactly. And that's why I really, I mean, I feel strongly about this as I do about our go, or not go fund me, but our crowdsourcing page. We're creating for Dr. Henson, you know, he's treating people and you're treating them on the legal side with the Patriots, USA dot org. Brian, what are some of the best type of plaintiffs that you're looking for? If you want to get a nice, juicy, broad religious liberty case that, you know, is it an employment discrimination? Is it a federal worker? Is it a school teacher? What are some of the best plaintiffs if people are listening? And we have thousands of people that are obviously in this unfortunate predicament. What are some of the best people to use as a plaintiff? Well, absolutely. Any federal or state government employee or any public employee, so an employee of a town, a municipality, a city, any public employee makes for a great plaintiff if they've been denied religious accommodations in the workplace. And the reason I say public employees, government employees make the best plaintiffs very often is that the government is subject to more than just Title VII of the Civil Rights Act. The government is subject also to the United States Constitution. They have to honor the Bill of Rights, especially the First Amendment in this case, also beyond the Bill of Rights, the 14th Amendment, equal protection under the law. They're beholden to so much more than a private employer is. Private employers for the most part, and those of your listeners who are libertarian-minded would probably agree with this for the most part, should be left alone. The government really shouldn't be able to tell them what to do. They should be able to run their business the way they want to run their business, and they're not bound by the Constitution either. Whereas a public entity here. No, they're not, except the 14th Amendment EEOC and all that stuff applies to them every day. But I get what you're saying that there's not a juicy plaintiff because unfortunately we already know that suddenly the courts are super libertarian when it comes to this, not other things. So you're saying, and I totally get it, so if you're a federal employee or a state or a local employee, that's the best because a clean shot government worker, government is not applying religious liberty, equal protection in that context. I like where you're headed, but let me challenge you a little bit. Let me challenge you. So you're trying to basically tell me that, look, as bad as it is with them applying Jacob's sin and ignoring any semblance of bodily autonomy, like even in its most basic sense, we're not saying a right to abortion or assisted physician suicide. I mean, we're just saying you're right to just literally breathe and be left alone without having a sub, you know, this, an injection under your skin with a spike protein. And it's very disappointed, but you think that the religious liberty thing could break this wide open. But my challenge to you is this. So on the one hand, we just had the Fulton decision, the Philadelphia gay adoption case with Catholic charities, Catholic adoption services. I mean, and basically the government said that as long as you're offering exemptions, you have to offer them, you know, equally, and then you're subject to the law. And certainly here, the, by definition, have to offer medical exemptions to people of cancer and whatnot. So that's how we're going to get them. We have very recent case law that's pretty strong as much as we didn't like how narrow that Fulton decision was for what it was. But for these purposes, it really does help us. But here's the thing I'm getting from a lot of people. So you know, everyone knows it has an all major allegiance that it's against homosexuality. Um, every, you know, you have Judaism, okay, so the guy can't work on Saturday. You got Baptist. They don't drink wine. I mean, that's known. It's documented. But what they're saying is that's BS. It's really a medical thing. You're concerned you don't like the shot. There is no, and, and especially because all of the establishment voices in every major religion are, are pimping the vaccine. I mean, in my religion and your religion, all of them, they're all doing that. So you know, all the workplaces are denying it because they're saying, in other words, if they say we're not accepting religious exemptions, so then the courts going to hit them up and we have a good case, but they don't, they're like, yeah, we'll take it. But this, but case by case, they just turn them down because they say that's not valid. That's not, you know, you, you don't, there's no religion. Show me the religion. I'm once it are the courts going to get in the nitty gritty where you have to have priests and pastors and rabbis come before them and say, well, where is it? Say doctrinal in your thing in the Bible and your literature that it's a problem. I would love one of those cases. And actually, we, I think we have one with that Colorado case I mentioned to you, two different plaintiffs where they're basically questioning the sincerity of their religious beliefs. So there's a case, you may be familiar with United States versus Seager, which came out in the 1960s, which was a case, a conscientious objector case. And it was Justice Clark wrote a beautiful decision in that case where he very, very clearly stated that it is not the government's place. The government is foreclosed from questioning the sincerity of one's religious beliefs. They cannot question that. So standing on that precedent, I absolutely would refuse to bring a priest or rabbi, a pastor into the courtroom because this person does not need their religious beliefs validated by a clergy member. You are allowed to have your own personal religious beliefs. And those are protected just as much under the First Amendment as someone who belongs to an organized religion, who goes to mass or or or to synagogue every single week. They are just as protected if they practice in the home. And there's several cases that I can point to to support that. So I think if this happens, if it comes down to that, and the government's stupid enough to make that argument, because I think that would be a really foolish argument to say it's not sincere, just because you don't belong to an organized religion, or there's nothing in the official teaching that says that. If they're stupid enough to make that argument, I'm going to be very, very happy, because we have strong precedent to stand on, and I think we can win those cases pretty easily. Especially with this court, that's much more favorable to religious liberty than any court that I've seen in the last, well, I haven't even been alive 50 years, but that's probably the last 50 years. This is, obviously, I've been reading decisions that go way back beyond there. So in the last five decades, I'd say this is the most conservative in terms of religious liberty, the most supportive, I should say, of religious liberty than any Supreme Court that I've seen in the last five decades. So I think we've got a great answer. And it's interesting, because we saw that dichotomy, what you're saying in the COVID-Fascism cases, with the lockdowns, where it was very frustrating that the Supreme Court was allowing this stuff to go through, but the one angle, in the Cuomo case, had a New York that was a Nevada case, where you had the church capacity. And New York, yeah. Yeah, and it was frustrating to us, but are you telling me, and I just want to get this clear, that the difference now is, see, back then, so it was limited to the church, literally. But in the context of religious liberty, conscience objections with the vaccine, anyone could pursue those arguments. Yeah, and I think you can go back to the masterpiece Cake Shop case as well, with Jack Phillips out of Colorado. The court even then, and that was less, even less supportive of religious liberty than the current court we have now, because that was a few years ago, remember. So that's before we had the Trump appointees on this court. Even then, the reason Jack Phillips won that case wasn't because they said he had to make a cake for a gay wedding. The reason he won that case is because the state of Colorado was extremely hostile in their questioning of him. They went back to, when they were having a hearing and questioning him about his religious beliefs and how they were, they were showing clear hostility toward religious beliefs. So even that court said you cannot show this kind of open hostility to someone's beliefs and attack someone's beliefs, again, attacking, you know, as I was saying, the sincerity of one's beliefs as well. So this court is even more supportive of religious liberty than that Supreme Court. So I honestly don't see how we lose a case like that, where the government is openly hostile and questioning the sincerity of someone's beliefs. I think those cases, we win every single one of them, which is why I'm taking the religious liberty angle. I wanna say one thing. You know, some people don't like that we're focusing so much on that. I had even someone reach out to me by email the other day who said, that's the coward's way out. You should be challenging just on basic freedom. It's a human rights violation. You're a coward, you're a coward to be challenging. You're not me. That's what they said. You're not a talk show host. I mean, that's the thing. It's true and we all agree, but your job is to take people's donations and use them. You know, the bottom line is you would not be serving people properly if you made my arguments as much as I believe in them. But you gotta play with the courts that you have. Brian, I just, I know you've got to really run here two quick things in just the two minutes we have. Number one, okay, so fine. Let's say the court says you can't categorically banish someone from the workplace, government, maybe even private for religious objections. And you have to offer them the way out. But what if then they say the way out is and they're already doing this? For example, Michelin tires, they're saying everyone has to be vaccinated. Oh, but if you don't get vaccinated, okay, you don't get vaccinated. Everyone has to pay $100 a month until they get the shot. And if an unvax person gets roped up in the contact tracing, by the way, because someone who is vaccinated got the freaking thing and they don't even have the virus, but they get roped into the quarantine from it. So they have to quarantine for two weeks, whereas the vaccinated people don't, they have to test, they have to pay for the test, they have to pay for the time that they're in quarantine, whereas the vaccinated person doesn't have to. Are they able to, do you think you're able to take cases like that? Absolutely. If there's an undue financial burden on the employee who chose to exercise, they're sincerely held religious beliefs and get an exemption. That's another form of religious discrimination. I can still use the religious discrimination angle because now you're taking a group of employees, the vast majority of whom have religious exemptions, because let's be honest here, Daniel, they are not approving hardly any medical exemptions, okay? And even in a company like Michelin, I'd be surprised if out of every one of their locations, if they even had more than one or two people with medical exemptions. I mean, I've talked to people who are leukemia patients, someone else who had a heart, not heart, not heart surgery, though, open heart surgery, denied, denied, medical exemptions, people like that. If they're denied medical exemptions, I don't know who they're granting them to. So there's very, very few medical exemptions at most of these companies. I don't know the number of specific at Michelin, I'm not privy to that data, but my point is I can almost guarantee you the vast majority of the exemptions granted are religious. So if you're gonna penalize people and that penalty is gonna have a disparate impact, that's another term that's used in civil rights law and discrimination law, it's going to have a disparate adverse impact on people who have religious beliefs opposed to this vaccination, then you are burdening their religious beliefs and that runs a file of Title VII, which applies to private companies like Michelin, okay, Title VII and the Civil Rights Act. In my opinion, we have a very strong case, especially if they're paying out of pocket, doing it on their own time, paying a fine, a weekly fine, like you said, if that's really happening, I wanna talk to those Michelin employees, because that is extremely discriminatory in my opinion. Wow, very, very well said, and I hope you could take some of these cases before I let you go, final frontier here. So your main approach is religious liberty and I understand why. But talking about the meat and potatoes of it, until now, we haven't been able to get outside of one Florida and Kentucky County judge that got into the actual science, but until now, they just take the government side. But my question is, when it came to mask litigation, so it's not like we had a definitive masked person and unmasked person, I mean, because there's no such thing, it's, you know, there's no indication on you how much you word or not, to show that it didn't work, even though in a macro sense, it was very clear it wasn't working. But here, we have open data that the vaccinated are getting it and transmitting it at least as much, so much so that Joe Biden just yesterday went out and got a third shot, you know, because it wasn't, it's wearing off. And particularly, here's the main point. The strongest thing we have in science is that natural immunity, even when the shots were working, the breakthroughs were rare. Now it's not even breakthrough with the vaccine, it's prima facia, it just wears off. How in the world is there no legal angle, at least for a person that's like, dude, I love the shots, the shots are awesome. But I have natural immunity, I have prior infection, here are my antibodies, I am less of a threat than the guy who's vaccinated, but it doesn't have prior infection. How does that not factor in the litigation at some point? Well, I think it absolutely could in the testing cases, like I just mentioned, if we bring a test, like for instance, in your hypothetical with Michelin, and we don't have any pending litigation against Michelin yet, but hypothetically, if we did, we would absolutely bring the science in and show that, listen, you know, even if it weren't discriminatory to place this burden on people with religious beliefs, which it is, but even if it weren't, you have no rational basis for subjecting them to different terms and conditions of employment, because the science doesn't support it, and that's when we bring in vaccinated versus unvaccinated, and we bring that into a testing lawsuit to make that case in court. And I have some expert witnesses, I'm not gonna mention their names, but I have some great expert witnesses in mind that I think can support that, that I know can support that, because they have the studies, they have the data, right at their fingertips, and they're eminently qualified to speak on it in a court of law. So I am actually thinking that the testing lawsuits are the best place to bring that up, because then you can show that, you know, even if there weren't a burden on religion, it's still irrational, because what the companies are doing isn't founded in science. Well, folks, you hear that? I mean, there's plenty of you out there emailing me. You could email wethepatriotsusa.org. Is there a better way to get a hold of you? Is that where people should submit the ring queries? Yeah, for the best email to use, is info at wethepatriotsusa.org. Info at wethepatriotsusa. If you go through the general contact form, it's gonna take longer for us to get back to you, because we have to have some of our volunteer assistants that have to go through those and find those, but the info comes directly into our inbox. So I'd use that. Again, I just wanna close by saying, if people are able to sign up for a monthly donation, we started a commit to 10 campaign, which is asking everybody if they can just please commit to $10 a month and tell at least 10 people to do the same so that if we got thousands of people, I know you have thousands of listeners, right? If we got every one of your listeners to just commit to $10 a month, we would be probably fully funded, because even 10,000 people in the whole country, from coast to coast, if we got 10,000 people to do that, that would be 100,000 a month for lawsuits. So that would be at least a couple of lawsuits a month, and that would plus fund our organization so that we can expand and have more lawyers. I mean, we wanna create a huge, huge litigation team so that we can fight this tyranny from every possible angle in every circuit in this country. It can't just be these little pockets here. Right now we're starting with New York, Connecticut. Yes, we've got cases like I said, Missouri, Nebraska, Colorado, but it needs to be everywhere. It needs to be in Florida, it needs to be in Ohio, it needs to be everywhere, California. We need to be fighting this everywhere all at once, because that's what they're doing, Daniel. They're throwing everything they've got at us, all at once as fast as they possibly can, because they don't think there's any way we're gonna be able to mobilize in time to defeat them in court. But with your listeners' help, I believe we can do that. Wethepatriotsusa.org. Absolutely, I can't encourage you enough to give generously. I know Steve Dase's audience really helped fund a lot of this New York law, so it has been successful so far. This might even be the silver bullet folks, you know, look, with the state legislature's not doing anything, I believe that's the option we always should pursue, but it's, you know, it is what it is. Here we at least have lawyers willing to help. Brian's one of the few, so let's help accordingly. Brian, thanks so much and definitely keep us updated as this cycle goes on."
