    "text": " The Blaze Radio Network On Demand Why is this so important? Why did you pick the story? Why does this matter? This is the news. And why? Why? Why? And why it matters. Hi, I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Welcome to the news and why it matters. It's our Friday show. Yes. And I wanted to do something a little bit differently in light of Glenn's new book coming out, Addicted to Outrage. September 18th, just kind of go over the recent stories that are in the headlines currently that are great examples of, okay, maybe we need to stop and take a look at this and decide if this is the direction that we want our country going in. So the latest controversy is over Florida gubernatorial candidate Ron DeSantis. Of course, I know we've all heard what he said, what the controversy is, but let's go ahead and watch it. He is an articulate spokesman for those far left views and he's a charismatic candidate. And, you know, I watched those Democrat debates. None of that. It was my cup of tea. But I mean, he performed better than the other people there. So, so we've got to work hard to make sure that we continue Florida going in a good direction. Let's build off the success we've had on Governor Scott. The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state. That is not going to work. That's not going to be good for Florida. If I had pearls, I would clutch them right now. I am so shocked and offended. If you don't know the controversy there, you know, he called his opponent English by saying he, a cup of tea and related to. I see, you know, what he said, of course, is monkey it up. And, supposedly, when you say monkey, you're talking about black people, which I don't know anyone who's done that and I don't know, what is it, 50 years? I don't know exactly what the timeframe would be. The first thing you equate when you hear that, doesn't that say more on you? Yes, it does. Absolutely is. People keep bringing up the point of that, you know, only dogs hear dog whistles. You know, only people who are constantly obsessed with race are going to hear a racial dog whistle. And, you know, I don't think there's any evidence at all or any reason to believe that he meant anything racial by that comment. As Pat, you kind of pointed out on the air today, or was it yesterday, I guess, that he was talking about the subject of the sentence. Is the policy, the agenda. Yeah, he's specifically talking about the agenda. Yeah, if you would have said, my opponent is a monkey. Well, okay, you might have something there, or you might be saying, the guy's just hyperactive. I've called my kids monkeys. I've called my kid a monkey many times. A lot of times, they're all white. I don't know if anybody's seen him, but they're white. They're super white, like, super mega doppler, right? They're too white. So, you know, when the subject is not even the person that you're trying to make it racism about, then it's just, it's a manufactured bunch of crap. I'm tired of this. It is. And it's interesting too to think about, basically, the accusation here is he's trying to say he's racist without actually overtly saying it, right? Like, he's super racist, and once people think about how bad black people are, however, at the same time, he's trying to hide it from the voters. And this is what's so interesting. Real racists don't have a problem admitting their racism. They actually want you to know about it. Richard Spencer has no problem talking to you about why white people are better than black people and why white people should live here and black people shouldn't. When you sit down and ask him about it, he will just openly tell you. He will openly tell you because he is a racist, right? And you know what, it's an ideology that was around, George Wallace had no problem talking about it either. Didn't need a dog whistle at all. Exactly. And the reason why people don't want to say these things overtly, they don't say racial things overtly, is because they know everybody, everybody thinks it's terrible, right? Like, you, including them, if they thought it was good, then they would say it. But, you know, there's a lot of things, like, you know, think about how divisive an issue like abortion is, right? There's a lot of people who absolutely think you should be pro-choice and a lot of other people on the other side that say pro-life. Well, there's plenty of voices to find. Well, you know, there's plenty of people who will talk about it and take a strong stand publicly and put their name on it. That's not something that you're embarrassed about. The bottom line is you're trying to find these mistakes that you can turn in to racism. You're trying to say, well, secretly, in the back of their mind, there's this little idea bubbling and it just spilled out just a little bit in that speech. When in reality, these people aren't racists. You know, you're just, they actually have to watch themselves to try to not make something that you can turn into racist. And that's something completely different, it's a different standard. Well, hold on really quickly. Former RNC chair Michael Steele actually disagrees with you. Let's watch what he said. The assumption was that he was, that he didn't misspeak, that it was 100% a racial dog whistle. Why? Is it because he's connected to Trump? He didn't get the benefit out from any people, including Fox News. Because he's connected to Trump. It's because it's how white folks talk about black men who are successful. What? What? From Michael Steele? Michael Steele. He's taken up a bit of a position as an anti-Republican Republican. But how is that not racist? Like what he just said is over racist. It is, right? That's how all you talk about. No, give me a thought. That's how white men, white men, white men. You people. Isn't that what he was just saying? He's basically saying he's a typical white person. Oh my gosh. You know, it's the same thing that Obama said. Wow. That's embarrassing. A lot of this is like, he just, and Glenn talks about this a lot in his book too, is just look, just take a step back and have some frickin' common sense. Just think critically. Like no one thinks critically anymore. Actually, when you take a step back and actually look at this, do you really believe that a guy that's about to challenge, that is about to have a, in a gubernatorial election, that he's going to say something racist on the number one cable news network in the United States? No! Especially since he's moving into the general. That's really dicky. Even if he was racist, he wouldn't say it. Right, not now. No! He might say it, you could argue he's going to say it before in the primary because he's going to try to win over all those racists. But now he's going into the general. It's the last thing in the world you'd want to do. Even if you were a racist, because there's so many racists, they're going to swing the election for him. And that's the thing. These voters who they say are so racist for voting for Trump and all these candidates aren't racists, because if they were racists, they would vote for the person who was saying the racist things. Instead, what you're telling us is all of that will turn away from this person if they did something racist, which is generally speaking true, which shows that they themselves are not racist. You know, it's like, you know, I just wish the media would kind of get over themselves a little bit and get to the point where they could understand that their credibility is on the line with these things. You know, if you, for the very rare time on this program, we can actually say there are sports fans sitting around this table. But if you had a commentator who was calling the games for your favorite team and they were always saying the positive thing and always praising every single player and always saying how good every player that came up from the minor leagues was, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, they'd have no credibility with you. If sometimes they said, look, I mean, this guy just doesn't throw hard enough to make it in the major leagues, you would be able to have a little bit of credibility. And if the media would just say, hey, look, this one, this accusation against this politician or Trump, racism, this one's dumb. You know, this one's stupid. Brush it aside. Let's wait for something real. And not only that, but how much better would it have been for the candidate to say, look, I, we've, you know, we've got a spirited battle here, but I don't think that's what he was saying. First of all, I wasn't even the subject of the monkey comment. The agenda is, so let's just move on. I mean, wouldn't that have been nice and refreshing and adult of him to actually admit that when he's got to know that that's not what DeSantis was doing. What's crazy with the media nowadays, it's, it almost seems like they've adopted like media matters tactics. Like that wasn't mainstream tactics before. That was like media matters. Like they, they would like listen to an interview or listen to like whatever opponent or someone would say and they would seize on one little thing that they would say completely take it out of context and then try and blow it up. Now it's like all of the, all of the media, mainstream outlets and even newspapers now are doing the same thing. They're waiting for one little thing that they can take out of context, blow it up and hopefully everyone gets outraged about it. Yeah. Years ago, Pat and I were on the air one day and we were talking about Keith Olberman and saying how he was to blame for a mass shooting because the person was a Democrat and was echoing many of the sentiments that Keith Olberman said on a show every day and we said it was his fault. Keith Olberman was responsible. By the way, obviously what we just said was ridiculous and we stopped and we paused and we said by the way that this is what they do to us and they made that point. Media matters took the clip and ended it when we paused and then put it on the web and tried to get us all fired and it wasn't until we called them out on the air and there was a big deal that they had to write a correction and all this other stuff. But that is a tactic that Media Matters does. They don't exist to expose something that's real. They look to try to find the thing that they can turn into something that enough people will believe is real. That's a totally different thing. It's activism, not journalism. Yeah. And just to bring this all full circle, there was a certain 2008 candidate who may have said something similar, let's watch that. I come from Chicago. So I want to be honest, it's not as if it's just Republicans who have monkeying around with elections in the past. Sometimes Democrats have to. Oh, racist. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's why it's so clear it was not racism, right? I mean, he's right. He obviously mixed up the phrasing a little bit, but saying monkey around with the success of Rick Scott, which is what he's talking about, or throw a monkey wrench into the operation of a successful Scott government. And also there's Muck It Up, which would also have worked there. He just seemingly combined a couple of those phrases. It's blatantly obvious it was not racism. Which we've all done. Yeah. I've done it on here. Anybody's done it. Many times. Yeah. All right. So J.D. Martina's is apparently Pat's new favorite piece of layer. I fell in love with him. I fell in love with him yesterday. Yes. Head over heels. He wrote a tweet in 2013. Here it is. And somebody dug it up. And, you know, because that's a new hip thing to do to Major League Baseball players. You look for Super Old tweets from when they were much younger. And then you put them out there and you try to get them fired, I guess, from their Major League Baseball team. He put up this tweet, which is obviously the picture of Hitler, to conquer a nation, first disarm its citizens. Okay. That's why he's always strapped everywhere he goes. So he carries a gun. Oh, oh my. Oh my. So obviously that's horrific that he's a gun owner and he doesn't mind. He actually should be fired just for that. Yeah, right. So that came out. People started tweeting about him. There was the fake outrage as there always is. And he's stated, yeah, I still feel that way. I stand by the tweet. I'm for the Second Amendment. I'm a proud American and I still feel this way. I stand by that statement. That's awesome. And nobody does that. What usually happens is that you equivocate or you apologize or I've changed since then none of that. And you know, he's got a lot on the line. The guy has a pretty sweet gig right now and he's doing pretty well. And if he would have apologized, it wouldn't have mattered because then the next thing that he did, they would have kept bludgeoning him until they got whatever they wanted. They keep going, keep going. It never matters when they apologize. Even if it was something like when we saw with James Gunn, I mean, he had apologized and sort of tried to repent years before people dug up tweets that he had written that were so insensitive and they still just bludgeoned him to death. You know, the same thing with Laura Ingram not so long ago with David Hogg and you know, in his hit squad. So he apologized, he gave in and they were like, you know what, we're just still coming after you. You know, it's like, come on. It's interesting we did the same thing about Tiger Woods recently where we were saying he was kind of staying there and stood by what he believed even though people were criticizing to speak up more against Trump and all these things. And part of this is if you're just, there's a certain level of being really good at a sport that frees you up to do these things. I mean, JD Martinez is arguably the best player on what might be the best team of all time. I mean, they may win more games. They've had a little bit of a slow streak here recently, but they might win more games than any team has ever won. And when you get into those sorts of MVPs and MVP season for that team, he could say whatever the hell he wants at this point. And Boston doesn't, they will protect his life with their own. Yeah, that's a good point because I was reading and I can't recall the guy's name, but there is another, there was another baseball player who is something similar happened with. They dug up some old, you know, social media posts and they were, they did inappropriate. Yeah. And so he had to like undergo sensitivity training and he was forced to apologize. It's been two of those guys recently. Yeah. So I guess that, cause my first question was, well, maybe these sports figures are untouchable, but I guess it's only if you're a sports figure, but you're good. Yeah, there's a level. Really good. It gets so good. Eventually you can stop it. I also would say like, where are these agents? I mean, how on earth do you let one of your major league players without telling them, Hey, dude, every tweet gone before you're drafted. Every single one, you're never going to know which one's going to burn you. All of them go. No social media history. You are a zero starting right now. Yeah, once you get famous, you might want to just eliminate your whole account and start over again. I mean, it would probably be advantageous for these people to do that. There was one kid in the NFL draft, I think. I don't know what they think. Yeah. He got caught from sending tweets when he was like 16. He was the quarterback from Wyoming. Yeah. Josh Allen. Yeah. That's right. That's right. And yeah, he was a kid when he sent these things. He was like, come on. It was one of the pitchers. Both of, in fact, I think both of the pitchers that had to go through the sensitivity training, it was from eight years ago when they were 17 years old. Yeah. I mean, silly. It's insane. Silly. Back in a minute. You know, you bought it. Hey, it's Pat Gray. If you like what you hear on this program, you should check out the Glenn Beck program. The podcast is available wherever you download your favorite podcasts. Oh, out. Guys are still just sitting here talking about sports stats, which... And? I am a sports fan, but there are only so many stats that I can take. You're not a nerd. This I get. Right. I'm not a sports nerd. So moving on to our Addicted to Outrage special, Brown University. There was a researcher who released a study about transgenderism and gender dysphoria. I think you were just talking about that earlier. Yeah. Something on the show on Thursday about that. Yeah. And so teens imitating their peers by turning trans. So it was a study about how many of them were possibly doing it to... Because one of their friends recently said it. Because there was one that said feeling uncomfortable in their own skin or feeling like they don't fit in. So, you know, just kind of nonspecific symptoms, which could be a part of normal puberty or associated with trauma. And they actually found that there was a large percentage. There was a correlation of children who felt this way at the same time that one of these other factors was going on, which led them to believe that it was more about imitating their peers instead of actual gender dysphoria, which is, of course, a real thing. And so the left, of course, torched Brown University. And Brown University. Or corporate conservatives if Brown University. Right, exactly. And so Brown University pulled down the article with the research and issued a statement. And part of the statement they said... Oh my gosh. School of Public Health has heard from Brown community members expressing concerns that the conclusions of this study could be used to discredit efforts to support transgender youth and invalidate the perspectives of members of the transgender community. They're racing science. You have to disavow science now. Yeah. We're the science-deniers. We're the science-deniers. And now they are at every turn are denying science. That's incredible. That's insane. Wow. So I'm working on something from Glenn right now about cultural Marxism. And so basically just a really quick history lesson on it. Social Marxism were a group of Marxists that were pissed off that Marx's revolution didn't engulf the entire world. So they were like, what's the... Why didn't it happen? And so their idea was, well, the reason it didn't happen was because everyone was brainwashed culturally for capitalism. So their way to combat that was is to come up with a bunch of different social justice issues that could make people feel like victims. So they're like, okay, well, they didn't have gender dysphoria then. But then it was environmentalism. They wanted to make it to where Western culture and capitalism dominated the environment. So they'll make that an issue. Then it was like feminism. They wanted to make it look like Western culture and capitalism dominated... What was one of your sentences? Women, feminist feminism. What, what? One, one, dominate women. So they made all these different social justice things. But I just read just before we came on here, one of their leading philosophers said that he said that whether things are true or whether there are facts or the science behind it does not matter as long as we make people feel like they're oppressed and that Western civilization and capitalism were their oppressors. Boy, we are there, huh? We are exactly where we are. And this is the perfect example of that. Yeah, postmodernism at play. All right, so up at theblaze.com, I just saw this the other... I guess it was yesterday that I saw this up at theblaze.com. There was a college that is being accused of rejecting an applicant for following Alex Jones on Twitter. So this particular student got called into the admissions office for an interview. And I'm sure he's thinking like, hey, I get to talk about my academic achievements and I get to talk about maybe what I want to major in or whatever. And he got asked by the admissions person why he follows Alex Jones. So they actually asked him in his interview why he follows Alex Jones. Now keep in mind, he had not ever retweeted anything that Alex Jones had said. He had never liked any of Alex Jones tweets. It was the simple fact that he followed him on Twitter. So this is what they're alleging in the particular lawsuit. And this student's lawyer went and did a background check and found that the admissions director follows Bernie Sanders. And of course that she followed other political groups and causes that are known to be politically left on Twitter. And I know that this kind of goes in line with some other stories that we've heard in the past about all of these universities, you know, really censoring or suspending or revoking admission to their universities because they're beliefs, what it comes down to political beliefs. So what's the school again? Did you mention that? I don't have it on here. I mean, if it's a, particularly if it's a state school, this I think is a real problem. I mean, look, if it's a private school and they think, I don't want to have people who they think are conspiracy theorists on their campus, I guess they cannot have them. They can make those decisions in theory, those it's kind of wise. Is a follow really like, well, the, the question, there is an, I didn't jump on that one because you said they did ask why, right? Yeah. So why do you follow Alex Jones? Do we know what his answer was? Because I believe not everyone was an inside job or because I think it's funny because I mean, I, I look, I probably have retweeted Alex Jones because I think he's hilarious. Same, you know, a lot of people like follow though that I don't agree with on a myriad of things and I, I don't know. Well, I follow him because I'm tired of them putting stuff in the water that turns the freaking frogs gay. Right. That's why I follow him and I think that's the correct answer when you're asked. They keep me up at night. Right. They're gay frog stuff. Yes. Yes. Speaking of the youth. Now normally I don't care what the frogs are doing on their own lily pad, but when it gets involved in my sleep pattern, it's outside your window. I have a problem crossing the line. Yes. That was a 10 year old North Carolina boy who came home from school. Tuesday afternoon, it was a lovely Tuesday. His mom was like, Hey, how was school? And she could tell that something was wrong with him. So she kind of dug in for more information and he said he got in trouble for saying yes, ma'am. I love this story. Yes. So he was forced by his teacher who did not appreciate him saying yes ma'am in North Carolina. He was forced to write the word ma'am four times per line on both sides because she instructed him not to say yes ma'am and the worst part of this story really makes me mad. The teacher had also told the boy when he said it that if she had been holding something, she would have thrown it at him. Wow. That's unbelievable. 10 years old. Calling her ma'am. For saying yes ma'am. Unbelievable to me. Would skank have been better? What should I say? I mean, I'm from the south. So I get it that some people are not raised to use the word ma'am. But doesn't everybody generally know that's a term of respect? Yeah. That's right. Especially when you're 10. Yeah. Right. I mean, this is the issue is the teacher is trying to unteach something the parent has taught. Right. And that is not something that should be that's not what you're supposed to do. You're supposed to be assisting the parents and bringing them along with some of the educational basics. Yeah. Not trying to unteach what my kid has learned at home. You've got to do that outrage that a 10 year old. That comes right out of Glenn's book. He said the Woodrow Wilson quote was the purpose of I think he was talking about universities. But now it looks like they're adapting that all the way down to elementary school is to make the purpose of education in this system is to make your kids more unlike your parents as they can. Yeah. And it's exactly what that is. All right. We're doomed back in a minute. Done. Done. Up next.

This is a very controversial item. A MAGA hat. Oh my gosh. Can you believe it? I understand these mystical powers of the MAGA hat. Well, it's a symbol of hate. I've. Yeah, it's a symbol of hate. It's true. Radiates hate, I guess. Yeah. I'm glad that you're not the only one who feels that way. Right. So I believe we have we have a clip of it's and it's very blurry, but we do have a clip of the altercation as well as her justification. Let's watch. That's a racist and hateful symbol. Joanne Butler is now facing two counts of battery, one against her classmate and another against her teacher, who deputies say she slapped as he escorted her out of the room. Butler says she made the scene to express her political beliefs. Maybe just wake people up in some type of way because it's not cool the environment that our classroom is in. It wasn't handled the way I'd like it. I don't agree with, you know, grabbing someone's hat and verbally talking to him that way. But as far as the issue being brought up that maybe this is something that needs to be not just needs to be brought up. What? What needs to be brought up? Taking people's hats from them. It was physical, but an altercation maybe. Since when did high school students feel compelled to express their political views? That was not me. Was I just that disconnected? Me neither. I think it's just a trendy thing now, right? It's like it's a thing where like they, this is their way to feel important at the moment. So they jump into these things, act as if they know what they're talking about on all of them. And generally speaking, get fawning attention from the media. Oh wow, wow, this person taking a stand, they're getting involved. It's like, you know, maybe childhood isn't the time to be involved in politics. You're going to be in it the rest of your life and it sucks. The worst thing that you're right, the worst thing they could have done is put her in front of cameras like that. Ever since David Hogg got famous off this, every single one of them is waiting to do something crazy so they can get on camera. Well, and her dad is justifying it. I mean, he gave a, well, he gave a week, I don't condone physical, physical violence, but then he also gave credit to her, you know, well, we need to discuss the environment. Like, why? What do you think the environment is? You're throwing a hat. Like the thing you're worried about is physical violence and you prove that by jumping into physical violence. I mean, it's ridiculous. It's an antifa tactic. And, you know, I mean, it's a silly, look, it's also a silly high school girl and, you know, we shouldn't get all that worked up about it. But as a parent, I mean, I think you got to call that out and you're going to say, look, this is not something that you should ever do whether you're right on the issue or not. I mean, you might hate Trump. That doesn't mean you start punching people and slapping teachers. I mean, that used to get you expelled. It's really bad. We should obviously lower the voting age. I think that's a great solution. Yeah, that's what we should get. More kids involved in. By lower, you mean raised to 35, I agree. That's what I meant. Yeah. Okay. All right. So I don't know if you guys have heard this, but there is a really big problem with the new animal crackers, cage-free box redesign, as you probably recall, because we talked about it on the show. They did free the animals from the cage, which was huge. It was a big step toward animal abuse all around the world. It was really, really big. But box has decided that this doesn't go far enough because the new art doesn't address any of the underlying issues about ethics, exploitation, and corporate greed, and racism. Yeah, throw that into. All of the buzzwords. Well, look, there's a monkey on the box. Oh, you said it. I said it. I said the M word. Oh my God. You know, can we just go? Can we have a good shame on you? The big issue is the lion is just about to slaughter the giraffe. The gorilla is probably going to about to strangle the zebra. I mean, chaos is just about to happen. The moment we say action, right there. This is a real piece that was written. And I was like, huh? So in reading more, the author's basic point was that redesigning the box does not remedy the inequalities in play with the gender wage gap of Nabisco executives. So, I mean, you want to talk about a reach. Yeah, I get that we all have to try to get clicks. I know you got to churn out a certain amount of stories every day, but I mean, this is one of those where boxes isn't even trying on this. I mean, they're just throwing something out there. What's your crazy take? Yeah, go ahead. What would that box look like? If you were to address all those issues. Yeah, what would that box even look? I mean, it'd be a bigger box, which might mean bigger cookies. So we might want to sign on to this, actually. That's a win-win. All right, thanks for tuning in. Remember to, if you haven't already, subscribe to our podcast, rate us. I mean, only if you're going to give us a high rating, rate us. And have a safe Labor Day weekend. We will see you guys Monday. I want animal crackers. Not that box. So, I want that box. Like what you're hearing? Become a Blaze Premium subscriber and watch the show anytime, anywhere. Live or on demand.
