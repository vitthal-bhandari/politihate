I'm here to help guide you into the fulfillment of this new way, into the fulfillment of your deepest desire, the desire to remember who you are and be that in the world so you can finally reintroduce yourself. Tune into good mornings with curly, Nicky every morning. It's five minutes to peace. I've minutes to the new you. I love you. In a world of fake news, this is news you can trust. Comedy without the communism. You're listening to the Babylon B with your hosts, Kyle Mann and Ethan Nicole. Yes, welcome everybody to the Babylon B podcast. Very exciting and special episode because we are here digitally across the inner waves, inner tubes, yeah, the web webs with Adam for it. We're already following for it. Adam Ford has joined us. He's broadcasting from his secret underground bunker. Is just in there in his long underwear with his giant beard. Yeah, drinking is throwing back beer, and shine shooting guns in the air. He's like a prepper. He's a total. Yeah, so I imagine just hiding in this concrete box. Yeah. Ethan, I love how whenever you like talk about where you think I am, you think I'm in like in the side of a mountain, somewhere in Metro Detroit, you're like in the town of 100,000 people. You're like a prospector. I know. I don't know what it is now. I'm echoing. I don't you just that that image is there in your brain and it just can't get shaken. I love it. Yeah. Well, that's what we all think. It's like. Yeah. Because you're so secretive, I think you're like, even though you're really not anymore, I guess not here I am coming out. I am. I think I'm one of the few people in the world to have ever met Adam. For that person. And it was the mountainside bunker. Was it? Yeah. Yeah, he stayed at my bunker. He fought off some cougars. He's like, you guys like in the middle of a conversation. He's like, hold on. I hear cougars. Hang on. He played. He played video games with my kids to this day. He's still with Zelda or whatever and smash. He's still like the gold standard for my kids. It was hilarious. I showed up to his house and his kids are like in awe. They're like, this is Kyle. What is this thing? Video game? They knew about because we had played like online. Did you bring the video games to? No, well, we had played Smash Brothers online and then we showed up and we played Smash Brothers in person for the night. How do you play video games with 30 kids? I assume you have 30 kids. Yeah, 30 kids. Very funny, Ethan. I love it. Yeah, no, but so now when we talk about video games, which I don't play video games, but when my kids talk about video games, they there's like the scale is like how good are you are is from zero to Mr. Kyle. How good are you? Absolutely awesome. Nice. So speaking of underground bunkers, I just got back from a libertarian conference that I spoke at. I thought you smelled like weed. Yeah. And like all the stereotypes you think of of libertarians, they are true. I can only think of weed and Ron Paul obsession. I don't know what else true true. What else? What are what are the silk road? What was that silk road? Rain, Rand constantly quoting rain, rain, rain, rain, rain, yeah. Taxation is theft. Yes. Right. There were very there were shirts of those for sale. You could buy. Oh, I think so. T-shirts tax free because the libertarians don't pay taxes, right? That's right. Yeah, I mean, sorry, I didn't mean to say that, Kyle. But the one thing I did notice was that it was a lot more diverse and eclectic than you would expect. Like a bunch of there was a bunch of families with like six kids that just brought their kids and they're just sitting in these sessions and the kids are just running around. You know, so there was the people you would think of as libertarians and then there was just it was interesting. It was like I've gone to conservative conferences and it's very like everybody you would expect to be Pacific Islander, lesbian, Lisbatarians. Yeah, it was a Lisbatarians. You just you invented a war. It's not that should be a part of that party. A lesbian. Yes, but basically the Frank Fleming article libertarian Christian fights vigorously to legalize various sins. That was basically the gist of it. But no, it was the guys at the Free State Project who were all trying to move to New Hampshire and turn it into like a libertarian utopia. Heck, oh, yeah. Oh, yeah, and New Hampshire. I've heard of that. I was interesting. It was super interesting. So I've heard in Michael Malice talk about that place on his show. Yeah, the new state project or something like that. I was talking to guys that had listened to our podcast and you're like, you got to talk to Michael Malice. You got to meet Michael Malice. He's like revered as a prophet. Yeah, the Libs. The Libertarians Lib short for libertarian. The Libbers. Adam always referred to me as a Lib. Liberts because I said I lose. I got you. You know, so we owning the Libs. That's Mountain Heamer. And speaking of libertarian chaos, my children are here today. Yeah. So if you hear a small voice, you know, he says back there. If you hear a squeaky voice, it's either anything or my three year old running into the room. So how dare you. All right. So we're going to get in the news because we have Mr. If you guys don't know about Adam Ford's other endeavor discern his news aggregator. Is that the right thing to call it? Do you call it a news outlet, but that works as well. Yeah, they write like original stuff. Yeah, you got rid of the stuff too. But it's like what I love about discern is you guys keep it all pretty bite size and like, you know, you can get through like a you send out an email every day with this list of kind of most of the important stuff that happened the day before with links to bigger articles. If you really want to dive in, but you kind of get a rundown and also it's run by great guys. Adam Ford. Thank you. Guys, thank you for us. It's not run by the Libs. I forgot to mention I did give discern a plug at the libertarian conference because they did a Q and A and someone was like, well, with the news being fake, you know, who do we listen to? Yeah. I said, I'm glad you asked. Kyle, you are the man. So is there a discern theme song yet? The discern theme song. Listen, where you go to get. Oh, no, what's your, what's your motto again? Short brief, smart faithful, brief, smart, faithful, brief, smart and faithful. How did I end up here? Not know what you were getting yourself into. California guys, man. It's like a musical. You just go on about your day and you just start singing and stuff. Yeah, if you've ever watched La La Land, that is basically I have not nor were I ever. Okay. That's our lives. Okay. It's not weekly stories, shall we? Let's do it. Every week, there are stories. These are some of them. CNN condemns D day soldiers for lack of diversity. Adam, you're supposed to laugh. You know, we can't laugh at her. Ah, ha, ha. They got us drinking coffee. Everybody's taking a break. So this week, Trump tweeted out a photo of his task force for it was a for for the coronavirus for the coronavirus and they were all white people. They were all white and that was the big article that was sent out. It was like, oh, here we go again. That's terrible. What was the what was the actual headline? Coronavirus task force, another example of Trump's admits Trump administration's lack of diversity. Yeah, CNN's headline on this. I like the idea that someone walks into that room like stop what you're doing right now. We're starting over. We're starting over the diversity. People are dying. Stop. Yeah, the diversity police break in SWAT team falls in the ceiling. The first thing I saw that I was this concept. They would never pull minutes away from a cure. They don't matter sniper. Do you have 60% of the white people in your sights? Hey, they would they would bust down our door right now. Probably. Yeah, they would. Well, you're two white guys. I mean, plus Dan's very white too. This is very problematic. And we have three white. This is why they say you hear all the time. It's almost like a cliche now that that reality is beyond satire. Or, you know, not the Babylon be it's on. It's it still shocks me though. That's it's unbelievable that that was really a real thing that CNN really published. Yeah. Yeah, and they're serious. It's unbelievable. Like this is an excerpt from the story. It's a statement that's as predictable as it is infuriating. President Donald Trump's administration lacks diversity. They communicate a patronage network that everyone is operating under. As Eric Yellen and associate professor of history and American studies at the University of Richmond told the Washington Post last year about a different set of photos. Okay, so they've been talking about these photos for a while having that network be interracial is really important. Anyway, I like the idea that someone's dying of Corona virus. And they're like, wait, hold on. Hang on a minute. Yeah. Can I know how many or the year you have in your or like that they were task putting together the task. Force. They're like, okay, here's the task force like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What are all these black doctors doing here? Get them out of here. Get them out. Get them out. Yeah, like Trump is like, we need a task force to fight only white people. He's like, call me white people qualifications. You must have a doctorate and you must have studied in this field. You must be white. Yeah, because we're going to hurry, but we're going to really zero in on race. But you kind of think that that's kind of how it is with other groups where they. Yeah, do you think the KKK has a tough time putting a task forces for Corona virus? Well, I was thinking the other way, like under the Obama administration, did they sit there when they came up with a task force like this and go, yeah, we don't want the most qualified people. Yeah. Let's just get it. Let's make sure that there's some diversity. Who knows? Yes. Yes is the answer. The task force really should look like the Burger King Kids Club where you have the one guy in the wheelchair and you have the, and you have the black kid that plays basketball. Yeah, the Burger King Kids Club. Remember there's one kid who looked like me. It's a big fat blonde hair. So you felt accepted. Oh, they accept me. He's white. Yeah, that's that's it's a religion is what it really is. You know, the the call it whatever you want to call it. People call it cultural Marxism or neo Marxism or whatever. It's it's like a religion and everything else is subservient to that. Doesn't matter what it is. Yeah. Yeah. Everything else is subservient to that. It doesn't matter if everyone on planet Earth dies of a disease. It's. Well, wait a minute. How exactly how diverse is the task force? You know, do we have a transgender 14 year old who's handicapped? I mean, they should be represented on this task force, you know, and it's the way they hear it is. Oh, so you think minorities aren't aren't good enough to be on a task force or if you if you assembled the best people in the world, they're all going to be white. No, no, that's the that's the team right there and it just happened to be white people and I can't believe we're even talking about this. The first time when they put together like the dream team of a basketball, basketball, anything was like, hey, wait a minute. Wait a minute. We need more pudgy white guys. Yeah, exactly. Well, Elizabeth Warren knows all about the diversity. She's got she said she would run her department of it or secretary of education by a transgender teen. I was just going to mention that. You guys have a show? No, sir. Was I just made the connection, but did you see this? I missed this. Elizabeth Warren assured everybody that that her when she picked her secretary of education, she would run it by a transgender team to make sure that the transgender final random one. Yeah, it's just like the ultimate. She wasn't kidding. And that's why it's so easy to laugh this off like that CNN article laughed it off, but this is really real. She said she would pick an education secretary and then she would give a transgender child the power to veto her pick. If the transgender child didn't feel that the person was accommodating enough that is just one of the frontrunners for the Democrat party right now. This is real life. Oh, man, I like my own podcast going. I just rant about this stuff forever. Isn't the goal to get to the point where we could create a task force and nobody even thinks about race? Right? Isn't that like the ultimate goal where I'll try to get to the only a racist would say that. That's what no, but I'm think. Yeah. Aren't they saying to that wouldn't they say that's like their ultimate like right now. They're just supposed to be doing damage control fixing all the racial divides, but somewhere down the road isn't the goal to be like. We wouldn't even think about it because everybody's so cool. I don't think that's their. No, I agree. That's not the opposite of the literal opposite. But then I want to know what is the goal like to their goal is to. Well, the goal, the ultimate goal is virtue sick, but but the stated goal is to have representation of every single cross section, every single intersection. So imaginable, which control is ultimately the fatal flaw in that particular worldview because there aren't there are theoretically an infinite number of intersections. You can never account for every intersection. You can divide people by race, by sexual orientation, you know, hypothetically, infinitely by age, by attractiveness, by weight, by hair color, by until you get down to what. The individual, which is what people in the West figured out hundreds of years ago is that the individual is what matters. That's why none of it makes sense ultimately. We should come up with a new intersection right now. Go ahead, do it transgender person who likes string cheese and can't whistle very good. Well, that's problematic right there because cheese is made from cows. And so then that means you're not a vegan. Oh, are non-vegans not people to? Well, they're problematic people. So it's intersections of oppression. So we have to think of things that are. It seems like people that are into this way of seeing things is like they found this guy who's like the street magician or no. He's like the guy in Gremlins has like a tink, a shop of trinkets. He's like, these glasses will help you to see the world. You'll be angry at everything and you will have enemies. Yeah, see all the evil in the world that's not really there, but it'll make you feel great about yourself. Thank you. Then they put it on and they're like, oh, I feel so good now. Do we do an article about no problems will be solved? No, we did. No, great. I thought we did a goggles or an article about like oppression goggles or something. I think I have pitched it many times, but it's never quite hit. I feel like to run it today, man. We did. I don't know because I remember this Photoshop of like the green and it's like white male. A press. Oh, yeah. You did. I don't know. It's all blur. All right, let's move on to our next story. How about you read this one, Kyle? Oh, Sanders campaign texting Gulag for you to people who aren't voting for Bernie. We talked about these last time. The real though. Yeah. That's a big headline. Yeah. We need to start a website discern or be or something where you where you mix up the discern. And why is the try to pick? I saw that so many have that. Really? I don't know if a fan really said that on that. Oh, she's leaked video. The guy who literally really said that for people who were playing the first the first guy we played some of his clips last week, but we got some new ones. Do you have the clip? Yeah, you want to hear the clip? Let's hear it. Let's do it. We got some no one's playing these. So we want to hear these. My fan art goes syndical. There's a lot of means in the Bernie campaign. It's truly not for people. I'm ready to start tearing bricks up. I started fighting. Team tape now. What's in the same? Already on Twitter following numerous groups around the country that are ready to play. I play here, Tifa on yellow vests, all that, but people not in the back right of the way. I'll start a armed, I want to strike my shoe from the train. I came this with someone who's an anarchist. I'm a anarchist. I was part of the left. You can't get this with someone who's more of a Marxist than a Marxist. I'm a communist, I believe. I'm pretty much an anarcho-thimtic, I'm a communist. You are actually a man, really free. I'm a lot of the stories we're called in the United States and out. A lot are exaggerated. Our prisons in the United States right now are far worse. We have more people in the prison in this country right now. That's kind of what Bernie's like, whole f***ing look. I have to admit, a lot of that's very hard to understand. Do we get a transcription? That's very scary stuff, man. I heard dragonby about in the streets, start things on fire, pull things, and pull the tear the bricks down, something like that. He said, drag them out in the streets and light them on fire. Yeah. With those very, very far lefties who are to each their own politically. They're bullshit. They even hate MSNBC because they're not left enough. So he said he's going to kill all the MSNBC guys. You know, you don't see this in the media anywhere, do you? Yeah, that's the weirdest thing about this. There's no comment from the Bernie campaign. It's terrible. Apparently these guys have, none of these guys have been fired or lost their positions. How unbelievable is that? No media is covering it at all. Yeah, we discern is covering it. I'll tell you that. Yeah, none of the corporate press is covering it. How unbelievable is that though? I mean, we should get that like a little hissing snake type voice that goes, go off. Or something like whenever we say it. Let's get Michael Malice to say it. Yeah. And then we can use it as a press. Yeah. Corporate press. Sorry, I interrupted you Adam. Can you, sir? I lost my train of thought. It's all right. I don't know if I was going anywhere other than to say, I can't believe that that's also that that's a real thing. And the guy saying the gulags weren't that bad? Yeah, that was hilarious. You know, I, you got a living away. I'm not exaggerating when I literally that is in my approximation. That is literally as bad as someone saying the same similar things about not. See Germany. Yeah, no, if you imagine union was just as murder, more, more, 100 million people communism is killed. The Soviet Union was every bit as murderous as Nazi Germany was. And these, and this guy's saying good things about them. Like this is, this is, this is unbelievable. Yeah. And you just imagine, you know, a secret camera catching some Trump supporters talking anywhere near like this. It would be the bomb, bombshell of the century. The guys saying ship people off to gulags who don't vote for Bernie and that there's a reason they had gulags and they're actually, you know, re-education camps that we're going to have to do here so that Trump supporters can stop being Nazis. Yeah, and violence is sometimes all right. You got to do it sometimes. And this is the only thing they understand. Dude, this is crazy stuff. I mean, this is crazy, Bill. Just because, you know, we don't learn about the Soviet Union in school nearly like we do in Nazi Germany, which is obviously every bit as horrible as it's made out to be. But we don't hear anything about the Soviet Union. Like how many people have read the Gulag Archipelago? Have either of you guys read that? Read the Gulag Arch. That should be every high school student in the nation should have to read that. Every person listening to this, go read the Gulag Archipelago by Alexander Solzhen. It's a, it's a Nobel Prize for Literature winning book. It's not like some outlier type thing, but it just, the guy was in the Gulags and it's just his first-hand account. And it was instrumental in sort of opening a window so people could see into, to Soviet Union under Stalin. And it's absolutely horrifying. It's terrible. And these guys, man, they just think they're like, they just think they're like edgy and cool and dangerous or something like that by saying these things. And it's just like, no, dude, you're just a fool. You're just a loser. Stop. Like, what are you thinking? You're, you're advocating for a system of government that's killed 100 million people. And you're trying to bring that about in the United States of America. It's, man, I'm telling you, people listening to this who, who think that that stuff is okay and think that it's okay that Bernie hasn't said anything about this or a parent like this or apparently fired these people, you need to do 20 minutes of research, you know, and you'll be, and rethink your position. You're going to say this gets me fired up. Well, you don't think like, this isn't all the people on the left. This isn't probably even a majority of Bernie supporters, but if I, you know, I would hope that if guys on the, on the right of the conservative side, if there's these outliers that are talking like this, like we've got to drag them out in the street and got to tie them up, concentration camps, yeah, they're living weight. Yeah, pretty good. Right. You're right. Labor wasn't bad or whatever. Booted so fast, you know, and that's, that's what I'm saying. I would hope they would be booted. They would be ostracized, kicked out like no, we're going to talk about violence. The moment we're going to talk about violence, get out. Yes. And I don't know why these. That's a major distinction between the right and the left. And there's this, I saw Jordan Peterson talk about this one time and I think I've made Kyle watch it. I'm like, do this is nine minutes long, but you have to promise me to even a lot of this. But one of the things he was saying was on the right, there's boundaries have been drawn, and you can take some of the leaders, you know, from, in the, from the past, like Buckley or President Shapiro or whatever. And there's a, there's a clear line in, in one of the main lines is racial superiority. So if you go there, you're not with us. Yeah. We're not claiming you, but on the left, you can go too far left, but there's not really a line drawn where it's clear where it's like, okay, I mean, it seems to me that a fairly obvious line would be you're advocating for a Stalinism or Soviet Gulag. Sorry, you're not with us, but they won't even do that. Yeah. It's pretty crazy. I wonder, I don't know. I wonder what the disconnect is where people look at Nazi Germany where, you know, they killed 15 million or whatever it is. And then you look at the Soviet Union where it's a hundred million, our communism altogether with Mao and Stalin and everybody in the 20th century. And maybe it's because we're dealing in millions and we just can't wrap our minds around it. I don't know. But I don't think so. I think partly it's because of the optics. Nazi Germany was much more, um, visually available to the world. Yeah. Yeah. In Soviet Union was kind of closed off and like sort of like China right now, they control all their information. They control the optics. They're not, you know, kind of expanding and taking over all of Europe. You know, and partly I think it's because, you know, on the left, they're terrified of being seen as not woke. It's that religion of wokeness. And if they slip once, then the whole group is going to jump on them and just eat them alive. I think that's part of it as well. Yeah. It's probably part of that call out culture and stuff. Well, next story. I don't think we're going to solve that one. Yeah. I know. Like what happens if if someone, if, if Buttigieg or Warren is like comes out and says Bernie, you know, you got to, you got to fire these guys. They're talking about the Soviet Union as though it's a good thing. Yeah, they get canceled. Do you think that people would share that? No, people on the left would jump on them and say, what you're not, you're not, you don't want equality, you don't want equity, you don't want, you know, a living wage, you don't want billionaires to be held to account blah, blah, blah. That's what would happen. Just trust me. Yeah. Yeah. I'd appreciate if you'd stop firing your machine guns in the air while you're talking to us. Am I making noises? No, I'm just kidding. Oh, sorry. I'm just picturing you ranting about communism when you're bunker while you fire your scenes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I'm with. Are you in, do you have a tank like Alex Jones where he shows up with all these, uh, wait, Alex Jones is a tank. Yeah. He shows he pulls up at all these rallies, like liberal rallies and he'll show up in the tank and pop out of the hatch with a megaphone. It's the armored vehicle thing. Yeah. We got to get a tank. Yeah, we're going to win again. The Babylon beating would be sweet. You can go around to the, the, the antifa rallies out there in California and yeah, y'all threw a bullhorn like Alex Jones. Hillary Clinton is a reptile. Hey, we need to isolate that. Make sure you remember we're that story three. Trump to deliver state of the union in scuba gear to avoid drowning in liberal tears. What a lit Photoshop. I saw that one because someone who, well, okay, I won't humble brag because I noticed it and because Trump Jr. tweeted it and someone sent it to me and I was like, the first thing I thought was that's a lit Photoshop. Lit. Thank you. You are a wizard, dude. It's the only thing to do. Funny about the stops. I actually mean, I'm telling you back in the day, I used to be so jealous of the onion and I would, I used to think, man, we've got all these janky Photoshop and the onions out here with these. And then now we're unquestionably better than them in the Photoshop department. I think that's a good one. But thank you. I don't want to insult the onion guy by accepting my compliment. That's what I'm, my own concern. Oh, don't worry. We're all Photoshopers out here. My, I actually made up this joke and I thought it was so dumb when I made it up. But to me, the funniest part of it is just his hair poking out of the scuba. Okay. I actually cut his hair out of a different photo and, and tupped it in there just to make it sticking out. And to me, that's the funny. I like the kind of space. Yeah. And I wrapped his lips around the scuba things. He's talking through the oxygen tank. Well, that's what makes Trump humor work to me is that it both, it makes fun of liberal roles. Yeah. For me, trigger by everything he does. But it's also him just being so blatant and like, yeah, I'm triggering. I was trying to be. If you read the article, I was trying to make fun of the whole mug of thing, you know, since he totally, he totally owned the Senate or whatever. And now he's going to totally on the beginning. He's got to get ready for a torrent of tears because they're all going to cry. Anyway. So we actually were, because the state of the union is tonight, right? Yes. Yes. But this, this will air tomorrow. This will air tomorrow and the state of the union will already have come out. So what we're going to do right now is we're going to predict what the, what different people and media will respond to the state of the union. So we actually have predictions. So you once this comes out, you'll be able to tell if we were right. Okay. So some official responses that probably have actually already been released before the address snopes entirely false. That was an easy one. Yeah. New York Times detailed analysis of every person who makes an okay hand sign during the speech. All right. Buzz. Can I join? Yeah. You got anything to go for? I pulled. Yeah. Yeah. Buzzfeed. Take this quiz to find out what emoji best represents your opinions. Max boot. I don't know if you guys know who that guy is op ed. I was going to be a Republican again until this speech. That's good. Because every single op ed he does is like, Hey, I was thinking about becoming, coming back to Republicans, but no, Trump's terrible. That's like his whole stick. We need to do an op ed. We need to write an op ed by Max boots hat. I don't know who the next boot is. He was like a wapo. He's supposed to be their like conservative reporter, I believe. But he's just like, yeah, every one of his articles is like Trump is destroying conservatism. And it's always the same. Yeah. Every time. He always makes it sound like he was good. He was about to come back like conservatism is just waiting for his return. And Adam doesn't even know who he is. So owned. That's funny though. It's like the guy who's supposedly a GOP strategist who was on CNN with Don Lemon. And he was making fun of every Trump supporter by using a fake southern accent and saying they were all stupid and dumb. I've run across him a couple of a couple of times since then, the headline will be like, leading Republican. Yeah. Yeah. Says something terrible about Trump leading GOP strategist says Trump's going to now click the art at him. It's like, you guys got a big riggles and I know. Yeah. They always try to do their favorites to use too. Because he's so he just likes to rag on Trump. Yeah, they do that a lot. They'll try to paint the guy that agrees with them as a bigger figure than they actually are. They did that with when Christianity today came against Trump, you know, was like a leading major thought leader in evangelicalism. You know, it's like nobody really. That's like a leading conservative or something. Yeah. And then Alex was talking about when he talks about the commas. What do you call that? I don't remember. And aside or whatever, like kind of like they do it in a negative way. They did it with Joe Rogan, like Joe Rogan, who has been known to make racial and homophobic slurs. I don't know what his term is for it. But yeah. Oh, yeah. So like they'll frame it in a certain way. So if you know, let you know. All right. So we should think of this person. Alex Jones's response to Trump's state of the union, he criticizes Trump for saying not one word about how the water is turning the frogs. You could have done that in his voice. I don't want word. I've never really listened to him. I don't know. How water turned the frog gang. There you go. I've never tried to do Alex Jones. I haven't either, but I want to try. Not one word about the water turned in the friggin frogs. Yay. What was the what was the clip we always used to look at Adam where he talks about Obama being the or Hillary being the devil woman or something. What was that? I forget. I forget. Wicked. Wicked. And then he goes. Ah, I refuse to go along with this. I'm seeing through all your lies. Barack Obama, you wicked, wicked devil. The super saying clip. Oh, yeah. When you go super saying, yeah. Can't keep it. Oh, Bob, you wicked devil. Wicked wicked. Mike Pence's response smiles nods with an orange slice in his mouth. That's an old reference to an old joke. Yeah. Whose turn is it? Seeing. Seeing in laughs uncontrollably. Don Lemon Fox News on all this victory. Well, that was wild. That was good. That was very mortal combat. Marianne Williamson pipes in. She says, to really know the state of the union, we must consult with these Himalayan salt crystals I got in Etsy. I would love to see a Marianne Williamson state of the union, Indra. She made it a lot more fun. I wish she was still great. Great at Thunberg. We actually have audio of her response. We have audio. Yeah. I don't know what you were saying. She said. I don't know. How dare you. Oh. Kind of a one note. How dare you. Hey, she got the Nobel Nobel Peace Prize nomination. He said. He said. Like a goat. How dare you. How dare you. You're still my soup can. The loonly goat. Yeah. How dare you. It's like a fusion. Showing the sheep man. All right. What is box? You got to love though how a high school dropout is like a thought leader. I'm like she doesn't go to school anymore, right? She's 17 now. She's too smart for school. She's too smart. She said, you know, this is a major problem. And this is actually smart. How I'm going to solve this problem is I'm going to stop going to school. She's going to save the world and then go back to school when she's older. She'll be like Billy Madison meets Al Gore. I actually sing that song to my kids like on every Monday morning back to school. Yeah. That's like me too. Back to school. Yeah. How dare you. Kyle's never seen any Adam Sandler movies. He missed those. Was OK. Who's going Vox? I wasn't allowed. I did catch Happy Gilmore though. Vox. Vox says buy these special 3D racism glasses to see all the racism you missed last night. There's my joke again. I look you just doubled up your joke. Yeah. And we have our last one. You want to read Jordan Peterson's response? Adam, it's your fam. No, it's London broil. Is that a steak? It's kind of me. He just treats a lot of me. Jordan Peterson's on this list. So listen, where is he? How is he? We miss him. Is anybody know? You know what's sad? We just hung out and talked to Dave Rubin and we didn't really get a good clear update on Jordan Peterson. I don't know why. He just kind of said it's sad and I wish he was back around. Yeah. That was it. This guy came out and like took over the world and influenced so many people. And then his wife got into all this stuff with cancer and it was very serious. And then he had to go to rehab when he tried to get off of the Benzo that he had been prescribed. And I'm surprised more people aren't asking where he is. Listen, people listening. My email address is Adam at discern.com. That's Adam at D-I-S-R-N.com. Somebody email me and tell me what the deal is with Jordan Peterson because I missed the dude. Yeah. Nobody knows. Yeah. I got it. I'm always weird about asking quite like I'm sure they get asked constantly for an update. So but I was like, you think they'd be sitting on one asking because his daughter follows me on Twitter now and I was thinking about asking her. But who who who? Where's our name drop? Kayla Peterson follows me on Twitter. Name drop. It was because of Babbel B. I guess they liked that last. I can't remember the joke was we did an article about them. One of our last ones. Oh, the Oscars one or the he was a repost? Yeah, we said that he host the Oscars. I think that was Adam. We had a few of them here. We had the Longer Adam Ford original photo shot there. America's Got Talent was mine. Yeah, anyway. That was our Hail Mary to get a mention by Jordan Peterson. Yeah. Because we were going to that thing. We were going to the conference to meet Jordan Peterson and we were like, let's come up with a great joke. And we did him hosting America's Got Talent and nobody shared it. Yeah. That's funny. I remember he rose so fast. The very first article that we did was him telling his laundry to sort itself out or something like that. Yeah. And I was telling Kyle, like no one's going to get this. Like, no, this is very niche. Like nobody really knows who this guy is yet. I don't. It's just a Hail Mary. I'm just going to do it anyways. And some people knew it. But and then like a few months later, he's one of the biggest names in the world. Yeah. Yeah. I was trying to find a. Anyway, continue. You guys, I'm. You are truly, you are truly prophetic. I'm not as good at searching stuff on my phone while I talk as Kyle. I'm so good at it. I hope he's all right. Yeah. Me too. He's a we love that guy. Oh, yeah. There's also archaeologists discover original stone tablets containing the 12 rules for life like Jordan Peterson. Was that your words? Yeah. Yeah. I've never written a Jordan Peterson joke because I don't know much about him. It's a good book. It's a good man. I read someone. I don't remember who it was, but someone some Christian thinker described him as common grace on fire. And I thought that was an apt description. Hmm. Kind of like that I sort of in the same vein as Rush Limbaugh, which how about Rush Limbaugh? That's just the saddest thing. Yeah. Yeah. He's got some cancer and he's he's like, I come and I hear your kids. That's hilarious because like common grace on fire, he's he's just you want him to come to the Lord and to know Jesus, you know, but even while he, you know, apparently doesn't or if he doesn't, he's got common grace from God to be just so influential and so wise about so many things. I guess he's got advanced lung cancer. Is that right? Yeah. I heard that that can be brutal. So it is. Yeah. It's a stage, but he did say advanced and lung cancer. I read it kills more more men and women than any other cancer. And from what I know from I had a neighbor who died from lung cancer and it was inside of a year after she was diagnosed and just talking to that family. Apparently, you can't really. There's no, there's no real signs. You can't really tell that you have it until it's quite advanced. So that's one of the reasons why it's so brutal. Well listeners, pray for Rush Limbaugh. He would come to know Christ. Yeah. And that he would his cancer would be him for sure. All right. You want to move on to our topic of the week? Let's do it. And now the Babylon bees topic of the week. Well, this week we wanted to talk to Adam, Mr. Dessern, Mr. News aggregator, the modern day. Wait, I blanked out. I almost said Breitbart, not Breitbart, the other guy that aggregates news. Drudge, drudge that guy. Only drudge is modern still, I guess. I was going to say I can modern to he's still he's still doing his thing. The modern day. Bruce Wayne. No, William Randolph Hearst. Yeah. Clark Kent. Clark Kent. I get Clark Kent in the moon. But it's not a journal. Yeah, he's an internals. Beautiful introduction. Thank you. Yeah. So I think it's a common question. I think there's a lot of people that just tone out the news completely. Some of us try to keep up. A lot of times it feels like you're just like a hamster running on a wheel trying to keep up with all this news. And maybe you're just getting sucked into something. You are very passionate about the news and being informed on all this stuff. And so we thought we'd talk to you about that. Like your perspective on it, we'd all kind of weigh in with ours. And you know what? And from a Christian perspective, what is our responsibility to being informed on this stuff? Yeah. That's a big question. That's a big question. And I wish I had taken time to think about this question. We have our... Unfortunately, I got busy writing news and stuff all day. But it is a good question. And obviously... Why do you do it? You're passionate about it clearly. Yeah, I just love it. I mean, that's another question that could take a while to answer. But I think... I will say that I think you can... I know you can go too far either way. You can make an idol out of being informed and just having information flying at your face all day every day. Or I mean something I see all the time. Politics is a very... What's the word? It's a very potent, very potent, vital, because there's something new happening every day. And it can keep you sedated because there's always something going on. There's always something to be angry about. There's always something to be happy about. There's always something to argue about. It can be a potent little gee god. But I see no virtue. I don't see any Christian virtue in being utterly uninformed. To have no idea what's going on when especially if you're married or if you're a parent and you have some sort of responsibility to take care of your kids. You need to know what's going on in the world. You need to be an informed person. I don't see any real godly precedent in not having any clue what's going on in the world. You get what I'm going with this. Now I'm more... I'm up to my neck in the news cycle every day, but that's... I'm not just a casual consumer of news. I'm that way because it's my job to be in part of one of the things that I feel called to do at this point, this window of my life is to stand there and take the firehose of news headlines that come across every day and distill it down for people, Christians, conservatives, whoever wants to be informed in a way that's not overwhelming and exhausting. Yeah, I think there's a real service in what you're doing and that's boiling things down because I think the media is set up to get a certain response out of us and to send us down a certain path. In a lot of ways, you're standing in front of that path. There's a big sign that says outrage this way. Let's go and everybody's supposed to just run down it and you're like, now you're standing in the path holding it, you're like, you're like one of those sign spinner guys that works for sprint or something and you're like, no, no, there's a calm down. This is the truth, bro. That's you. That's quite an illustration. Did you draw that for me? I don't like drawing crowds of people. I would charge you a lot. I was going to use the metaphor of he's jumping on the grenade for us. These grenades of news come in and he just leaves. That's a lot more noble than licks on it. Oh, no, you don't need to listen to this one. It's signs. But then when I appreciate that you feel like it's such a sacrifice for me, but I love it. I mean, I love it. It's exhausting and I work way too much, but I thoroughly enjoy it. And this is what I'm doing right now. When I was John Comics, that was my life. When I started the bee, when I was running the bee, that was it. And that was just a natural transition to news from the bee because I was in the news all day, all day, every day, to stay up on what was going on so we could mock it. And I just love it. I just love it. I don't know why. It's just how I'm built. I don't have, if I get free time, what I want to do is work. It's weird. Yeah, same here. That's kind of who I am. Yeah. That's the only way you can do a job like that. You have to love it. Look, you can't. You can't muster up the energy. Maybe you could get paid a million dollars, I guess, actually. I take that back. Even that money, you can't really do it. Yeah, you'll still phone it in because you know you're going to be a million bucks. Yeah, exactly. I guess I'll say that there's wisdom, though, in the moderation of moderating what you consume in terms of news because I was always disconnected from the news. And I didn't care about politics. And I was interested in politics. I kind of leaned towards libertarianism. But you know, libertarians, we have this tendency to just tune out, you know, not participate because we're like, ah, it's all screwed anyway. And we don't, you know, we don't engage. And so I think there is some wisdom in that perspective of saying, this news is temporary and nobody's going to remember about it tomorrow. And knowing what it is you're supposed to care about. And that is why I like to CERN. And I promise this isn't a 30 minute infomercial for CERN. But I'm all right with it. But to certain and similar sites, you know, there are sites that do this kind of thing where it's just a link to somewhere or they'll do a brief summary. And it's a little it's a it's less bias and that kind of stuff. I do think there's wisdom in that of knowing what matters and what you should think about, you know, things that do have long term implications versus something that, you know, I have to do this at the Babylon V where where I have to figure out what's worth making a joke about. It's like, is there people going to be talking about this tomorrow? You know, and if not, maybe it's not worth it. Yeah, true that. Definitely. And it's important to know it's important to find sources that you trust and to trust them, you know, it's important to find you should have some people where when there's something crazy going on, you don't have to digest, you know, you don't have to spend four hours reading everything. That's what people that's what pundits are here for. That's what like my newsletter is here for. So you can kind of get an idea of what's going on. There's people that are someone who is like you, who's going through everything and pulling out just what you need to know. And then that saves you the effort of and the madness of having to digest everything yourself, like at full length. Yeah. It's amazing. You look at an old newspaper, all the news that was going on that was completely forgotten. Yeah. How much of it, the 1% of it may be still mad. But the stories that the thing I find fascinating is the stories that stand the test of time. It's less because of the physical details of what happened. It's because generally that story points to something true and wise and real in an eternal truth. So it sticks out just in the way that a non-true story does. A great fiction stands the test of time because it points to a deeper truth. So I think that that's one thing we have to think about when we're looking at news and stuff. And that's one reason I'm a huge fan of GK Chesterton is because he was a journalist of his day writing about things going on. I just dropped the name of GK Chesterton. Hold on. We got the button. We got a push. Hold on. We're not very slick at our... Dan was looking at his phone. GK Chesterton. So many of his essays are still meaningful today, even though you don't even know who he's talking about in them. You've never... Because he's talking about eternal wisdom and truth. That's good stuff, man. And that was another motivator for getting into the news business for me. Because how many Christians are you getting your news from who understand that, who understand the big picture? You know what I mean? And how so much of it is not going to really matter that much in a week or a month or whatever. And I'm not throwing shots or anything, but so many of the Christian news outlets are like, for the day, this athlete in between his string of cuss words said, thank God. And so what an inspirational story that is. Amen. Amen. You know what I mean? Yeah. So there we are. There we are. So what's our advice for leaving our listeners with on this? Well, I guess I want to say too, like I was talking to a girl at this Libertarian Conference who was saying that she didn't read the news and went off social media for a year. And she said, I just got back on and I'm learning all this stuff about impeachment and thinking about it. And I'm like, if I had missed the news for the last year, how much would it have affected my life? Yeah. You know, I have taken, well, very little, you know, it wouldn't have mattered. It's not like I guess I lean that way towards not caring, except that's my job to care. That's where I lean to. But I think that the thing is that you're the your kids, your culture, they're all consuming this stuff. Yeah, I do. I want to be a voice of reason in that. And like Adam, the guy with the spinner sign along that trailer, he's just brazing over the cliff like lemmings. I guess it's like they you will be made to care, you know, that kind of you can't just ignore it. To me, that's one reason I enjoy the being on the Bell me because I do think it's a service to mock a lot of news because a lot of news is garbage and a lot of stories are going to be garbage and it's worth taking point that out and be like, this is so stupid. Yeah, let's laugh. Pretty little laugh. Absolutely. Yeah. I mean, conservatives and Christians when they don't pay attention when they're uninformed. I mean, look at look at look at the societal rot we're experiencing right now with conservatives and Christians engaged. Imagine if everyone just disengaged. Yeah. And would not be good, you know, and people unfamiliar with the idea of wisdom and eternity and just all this kind of stuff. They see these stories and I think this is all this is new. This is the new path of humanity here. This is the new evil. And it's like, no, read Ecclesiastes. This is this is peeing in the wind, friend. That's not exactly what he says, but basically something like that. Well, it's good to I don't I have I have three sons. They're 10, eight and six. And when they ask me questions about this stuff, it's good to have answers. Yeah, I think because what they're being fed elsewhere is very far from the truth most of the time. Yeah. Yeah. So I mean, beyond just knowing the news, I think that keeping somewhat up to date is good. I don't it's not maybe not for everybody. There's some people that it's just not for them. And I don't you know, I don't judge them. But I think deeper than that, knowing what your what your deeper truth is, you know, like what is wisdom and what is the Bible teaches and what is what is truth. Those are the things that you apply to your discernment of the news. Hey, that's the name of your website discern. The job. Yeah, I agree. I disagree with Kyle, though. I think he would have missed a lot if you would have taken the if you would have read the last year, but that's kind of historical times we're living in right now. Yeah, but what what would have affected my life? What would have affected the way that I, you know, treat my family and the way that I lived out my Christian life? Like, I don't think it would have affected anything. I guess we'll never know. 99.9% of humans that have lived on this earth never took in the amount of news that we take in now. They knew their local new like, oh, the haberdasher down the street killed his mule today. Yeah, but then I think the other the other side of it that I do agree with is if you have your head in the sand, yeah, you know, things like the rise of Nazi Germany and the rise of communism, we can't recognize those trajectories that we're on now. Yeah, you know, like the rise of socialism and how we can fight that if we just ignore it, you know, yeah. So I think over the grand sweep of 10 years, 20 years, 50 years, the news matters. But I think, you know, latching on to every single controversy has huge outrage. Yeah. And it really diminishes when the real stuff happens. It's like what the left does with Trump when they're upset about every single thing he does. And it's like, and then when he actually does terrible things, we don't we don't we don't care. Yeah. You are so right on that. It's like the boy who cried wolf. You know, I've said before, like in my newsletter, it's, you know, they call him Teflon Don and it seems like that's the term of endearment or whatever. But it's not really it's like nothing sticks to him. And that's that's a main reason. One of the main reasons is because if he sneezes, you know, they'll say, look at this clip of Adolf Hitler sneezing in the exact same fashion. This is a dog whistle, and so if they really have something maybe a valid point, nobody cares. Right. Nobody cares because they it doesn't mean anything anymore. And he'll say, yeah, he'll say, remember they I sneezed and then they said I was Hitler and you'll say, oh, that's right. So, you know, how can you trust anything they say? Absolutely. They overplayed their hand, man. That's they're they're in they're in a hot mess over there. And how about Iowa? Dude, just going on over there. Absolutely wild. Absolutely wild. The apps are crashing. Nobody knows who won Pete Buttigieg is like, go in two months. Did you hear? Did you read that? Oh, man. That app together in two months. Do you know the name of the company that built the app? Oh, shadow was a shadow shadow. Shadow ink. That's just sounds like a very nice trustworthy and like Pete Buttigieg is like involved with it or they paid for the app or something. Like Hillary Clinton somewhere in her past, someone from her campaign or something was involved. It's just beautiful. I mean, it's like, imagine the smile on Mr. Trump's face. Trump's tweet about us. We're talking about this is Trump is like giving the state of the union now after impeachment has collapsed and Democrats are in chaos. And he's got these huge approval ratings. It's like Lib's worst nightmare. Dude, and they were supposed to last night. I actually, I've been sick. And so I fell asleep early again last night. And I kind of felt bad because I was going to try to stay up to like midnight to report on the caucus results, you know, when they came in. And I woke up and I was like, what the heck? It's still in my hands. Yeah. You know, there's this jumbled, this jumbled field over there in the Democratic Party. And we were supposed to sail through the Iowa caucuses. And then we're supposed to have a real clear idea, you know, of where things stood at least we still don't know anything. It's just so funny. Yeah, one more thing I can say on the news thing before we can wrap up the topic. But one thing I respect about you, Adam, this is the only thing I respect about you. But is that your way gun collection? Well, that too. But he you unplug. Yeah, intentionally. Yes, I think that's like you find the balance, like, you know, the girl, maybe a year off is that's if you're new, that's probably too much. Dave Rubin does a month off every year. Yeah, but like Adam will go out and he'll email out that for newsletter and you do this with the BAML on B. Like, I'm not running it this week. I'm out in the mountains. Okay. And it's just like this unplugging of, and then maybe we need that. Yeah, I think you need that like, you got to, man, you got to. You're doing daily like, you know, I'm just compartmentalize your news and take off and then try to set aside. I've been trying to like turn my phone off at five and nice cigars. And it's too hard for me, but I'm trying. So, anyway, you got to do that, especially if you take in as much external stimuli as I do every single day. It's just constant. You got to give, you know, like, what was this? Some years ago, I something hit me and I was like, you know, I always, I always get to maybe it was for comics. It was either comics or to be I was at the best ideas when I'm brushing my teeth or when I'm in the shower. I thought, why is that? Oh, that's the only time I don't have 17 screens in my face, where I can actually form thoughts, you know, that are independent on what my eyeballs are looking at. So that was kind of an epiphany for me. So not only the week off when I go to Tennessee or wherever I'm going, but daily, I, for instance, when I go on a run, like most people listen to music or podcasts or something like that, I don't intentionally don't I don't take my phone with me nothing. I just think while I'm running, you know, or I go for walks around my neck just with no phone, no nothing. It's like recharges you and, you know, your brain needs time to process stuff. You can't just be you know, taking stuff in all the time. You got to you got to have some time to process. Right. Yeah, I like when I read the Bible in the morning, when I remember to, that is, that it's a sense of like, I'm being anchored in things that are eternal and transcendent. And then I'm going off to war and this crazy chaos of things that are going to be here today and gone tomorrow. So I feel like that time is super important. Absolutely. In conclusion, in my opinion, the best time to read the word is in the morning. In conclusion, sorry, go ahead. I'm trying to give the in conclusion, subscribe to the Adam Ford newsletter. Yes, Adam Ford newsletter.com and get your news at discern.com. That's D I S R N dot to calm. And if you sign up right now, if you sign up right now, it's free. Yeah, that's always free.

All right, we got some reviews this week. So who does the best Beavis and but had impression? I think that would be Ethan. I wasn't allowed to be this and there's but had. Well, what's this? We had somebody respond with last time we said Beavis and but had and they were very upset that we said the word but had they wanted you to say they felt that was the swear word bottom head. So I don't know if they still they still listen. They're going to be very mad right now. Because we've said it like four times. We do flower bed. Hey, flower bed head Beavis and flower bed. So but it like, oh, that's pretty good. And then be with this. Okay, so I like this reviews. These good. I like this review because it's a five star review, but it's kind of a backhanded like it's a five star view, but his wife gives us a one star, I think. It's like my wife hates it. So I love it. Five stars. So let's let's hear. So then the this is from Megadido Megiddo. Five stars. The title of the review is Beavis and the other guy because you know, the bad bad word, I think. I'm an evangelical minister. My wife explains her lack of interest in this podcast as they are Christian Beavis and butt head. Yes. And that's why I listen faithfully. That's pretty good. I like that. Is why does that make me if you're being in the butt head? Yeah, who would you be? I don't know. You're King of the Hill. Yeah, you're Dale from King of the Hill. Boom hour. Yeah. Boom. Dangle dangle. Yeah, I like that his wife is trying to she's like, I hate those guys. They're like, they're like Beavis and butt head. And he's like, yeah, exactly. They came to Christ and got their lives together. He's like, perfect. That's exactly why I like them. That's funny. Are we that bad though? That feel bad. I would do gig. I mean, I noticed when Michael Niles is on and whenever he'd laugh, he'd hide his face from the mic and do it silently. Yeah. Like, is that professionals do you don't laugh audibly at all? He kept tossing his head back and like, yeah, trying to hide in the mic. Like, why do you want people to not know you're laughing? Yeah. That's so, but then I also know that eventually might get annoying if you're like trying to just hang out and you're just guy snickering your ear all day. All right. This is by this review is our last statement for the day. Our second and last. Forst to read the subject line. Yeah, go ahead. Cowards. A vast. You cowards. Hey, Babylon, but if you're going to make fun of Doug Wilson, you should do it in person where he can respond to the whole civil war thing instead of making fun of him where he cannot respond. You cowards sincerely, Jack. Well, his name, his name is it's on iTunes publicly. Jackson, Crapoo Chetty's. He says, Crapoo Shea. Crapoo Shea. See the names, it sounds. Crapoo Chet. We had a farmer better. Does that make sense? The name is referring to a word you're looking at can't sound away. We did not make fun of Doug Wilson. Yeah. Our guest, Joe Thorne, made fun of Doug Wilson. Mm. And we're gonna have Joe Thorne and Doug Wilson on the exact same time. I like this idea that we criticize anybody. And then we've got to drive. We hang on a second. Do you have a Idaho on the planet? Let's get Doug Wilson on the plantation. Yeah. What we should have done is we should have sprung it on Joe Thorne where we had Doug Wilson secretly on the line. Yeah. Then we say, Oh, it's interesting that you say that Doug Wilson is on the line with us right now. Doug. And then you guys and Cauard. And then you guys and Cauard is in next room right next to you right now. He's walking in, look behind you. Yeah. He said, No, no. Well, those are iTunes reviews.
