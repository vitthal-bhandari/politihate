    "text": " Today on the mat wall show a fully weaponized FBI raids the home of a former president and future 2024 opponent Is this a totally unprecedented and shocking? Turn of events as most people on the right are saying or is it a totally predictable turn of events in a country where all of our institutions have been captured by the far left also speaking of captured institutions the Democrats are building an army of IRS agents to make your life miserable plus a mom looks on in cheers as her child works the stripper pole at a pride event That and many other important topics we're gonna talk about today, but first I want to talk to you about something You know we started the mat wall show in my car We did the first many shows just like that. It was a low tech low budget low-fi operation back in those days Talking into a webcam from 1995. I think I had the budget of 50 cents at a toothpick basically and it was just me in a random parking lot Screaming at my dashboard confusing all the other Walmart shoppers And the worst thing is that no one ever told me I had a terrible haircut back then I don't know how my wife let me out of the house like that But eventually she invited me back into the house and we moved into a home studio And an odd thing started to happen is that people started watching and listening and we started to grow and eventually We moved out here to Nashville and that's when things really started to take off over the last year Thanks so much to all of you. We have become the fastest growing conservative podcast in the country One of the fat one of the one of the biggest news commentary podcasts in the country one of the biggest podcast period We've got the best documentary of the year. We've got a LGBT best-selling children's book We're saving abuelas. We're saving Virginia. We're doing all of that, but here's the great thing.

It's not a sheet That's even as a real banjo behind me, which as you know, I can really play so we come we come a long way and we aren't even close to done yet but there are considerably less joyous events happening this week across the country unfortunately starting with the news that broke last night that agents with the FBI 30 of them reportedly Rated the Florida home of former president Donald Trump Now news of the raid first came from Trump himself who issued a statement saying in part quote These are dark times for our nation as my beautiful home Mar-a-Lago and Palm Beach, Florida is currently under siege rated and occupied by a large group of FBI agents after working and cooperating with the relevant government agencies this unannounced raid on my home Was not necessary or appropriate Trump added that the FBI henchmen had even Broken into his safe though his son Eric reported that they found nothing of interest inside it, but they broke into it anyway So what were they looking for? Well the New York Times passing along the regime approved version of events says that the FBI conducted this operation in order to recover classified material that Trump had allegedly brought to his house after leaving the White House Reading from the lindelia wire reported says agents with the federal Bureau of Investigation Excuted a search warrant Monday at the Florida home of former president Donald Trump that appeared to be connected to classified material That was allegedly at the home the investigation is quote focused on material that Trump had brought to him I brought with him tomorrow Lago his private club of residents after he left the White House According to the New York Times report those boxes contain many pages of classified documents Multiple reports later confirmed that the raid was connected to the missing White House records the report said that Trump delayed returning more than a dozen boxes of material to the National Archives Which included documents that were quote marked as classified national security information So the federal Bureau of Investigation took the historically unprecedented absolutely unheard of mind-boggling step of raiding the home of a former United States president all on behalf of the National Archives Now leaving aside the fact that other very prominent former White House officials Hillary Clinton comes to mind have been caught up in scandals involving their handling of classified materials and yet never have been raided by the FBI as a result Even leaving that aside This explanation makes little sense for the simple fact that Donald Trump as president Could declassify literally any document he wanted whenever he wanted As the chief executive that's the power that he had now does this mean that Joe Biden Reclassified the documents and then promptly had you know sent the feds to raid his predecessor's home on that pretext well perhaps But the operative word here is pretext This of course has nothing really to do with the National Archives or classified documents This raid is two things One it's a fishing expedition in hopes of turning up something, you know a bit more explosive than an alleged potential violation of the presidential record act acts and and two this is a shot across the bell. This is an exercise of might. This is an act of political warfare It's a statement an announcement that we live now in a third world banana republic The FBI along with all of our federal law enforcement agencies along with the entire DOJ Has long since been ideologically captured by the left all the complaints about Double standards and so on all that comes back to this No, the DOJ won't do anything about democrat corruption It wouldn't do anything about Hillary Clinton. It won't even take a second glance at the current president's crack-addled son We'll do any of that it certainly won't prosecute any of the people in Epstein's little black book. Have you noticed that? that Even years later still to this day none of the people Who were involved in Epstein's sex trafficking? Business have been arrested or charged with anything Now The FBI has a long history of showing no interest in apprehending sex traffickers especially and serial rapists Let's not forget the agents who knew that Larry Nasser was raping the girls on the Olympic gymnastics team and did nothing at all to stop it And then later lied about what they knew The DOJ always looking out for its own then declined to prosecute those agents of course a few months ago Activists in DC uncovered physical evidence that an abortion clinic in the city was murdering fully developed children Already born fully developed children. This is infanticide the systemic systematic slaughter of infants The DOJ refused to investigate No FBI raid was conducted Maybe they'll wait 30 years like they did with Kermit guys. No before they finally decided to look into that into the situation The DOJ has no interest in any of these crimes But it'll bring down its wrath on its political enemies starting with Trump, but certainly not ending with him I mean at least Trump has money and fame and a loyal following all things that give him some amount of protection No, though, obviously not complete protection The PTA parents recently labeled domestic terrorists by this same Department of Justice don't have any of that insulation And so we see that as a consequence of the ideological capture of the institution We cannot really say that there is a double standard because there is in fact one standard They will try to destroy you if you oppose them politically That's the standard. That's the overarching principle that the FBI and and and all the rest of the federal law enforcement agencies believe in And they actually follow that prints that principle with rigid consistency But here's the point this goes far beyond the Department of Justice The fact is that all of our institutions are being held hostage by the left all of them They are all being eaten alive from the inside by the same disease Every institution from academia to the medical industry to the churches and everything in between One cannot help but but take note of the timing of this rate actually because it comes only a day after the Democrats passed the bill Which would see the IRS doubled in size with 87,000 new agents hired If there was ever any question about what this new fleet of tax goons will be doing Well, I think those questions are answered now after what happened at Trump's house They will be focused just as they were under Obama on tracking harassing pilfering and plundering from the enemies of the regime and from the middle class generally which the regime considers its enemy This again is how every institution operates in this country every single one They all have their guns whether literal or figurative or both Pointed in the same direction pointed at us So what can we do about it? Well, here's what we don't do We don't simply whine about double standards and then just leave it at that as If we've achieved something merely by calling our opponents hypocrites as if the charge means anything to them like they care If you have if you haven't noticed when you say to the left, oh, you're a bunch of hypocrites. They don't care Doesn't mean anything to them You know, we don't We don't do that We don't become impotent fatalists and doomers Naysang all efforts to improve our situation Insisting that nothing will ever get better all is lost well with me, etc. We don't do any of that what we should do instead is Fight back with a ferocity intensity and ruthlessness That may have seemed distasteful to conservatives in years past and Some conservatives even still today But they're gonna have to get over their squeamishness Part of that fight though certainly not the whole fight, but part of it is political That means ensuring that the red wave indeed comes to pass in 2022 But more than simply electing Republicans generally we must specifically elect the sort of Republicans who have the gumption to act Decisively and wield their legal power Actually use it rather than talking about using it actually use the power that they have and To do so in service to what is good and just and true We need the kinds who will do all this in spite of the sustained attacks they're gonna face now I Realize that the list of Republicans who fit this qualification is somewhat limited But this is the sort we must be looking for and Once they've taken power we must push them to do more than hold hearings and assemble committees and all the rest of it What we want to see we need to be very clear about this is corrupt government officials arrested Okay, so you can you can have your hearing if you want if it makes you feel better But we want to see people in handcuffs Arrested and frog marched in front of cameras We want to see entire agencies gutted and disassembled We want to see a demolition derby metaphorically speaking And we should be very clear about that now let's get to our five headlines You've heard me talk a lot on this show about how important it is to get your kids away from the public school system and main and Also mainstream kids content Marxism socialism critical race theory and trans ideology all of that is what we have to deal with the left is pushing a persistent and loud attack on truth And they're starting with your kids There are a lot of ways you can protect your kids from these not-so-secret left as agendas you can homeschool you can get them involved in a religious community You can give them the right books to read like my best-selling children's book Johnny the walrus But one of the easiest and simplest ways to protect your children is to take five minutes tonight to write a will with epic Will a will gives you the power to say who will raise your kids should something happen to you and your spouse it can in certain cases Being the only legal defense standing between your kids and the persistent indoctrination attempts from the left epic will is an online Will platform that costs less than your next trip to the store They can set you up with a will in as little as five minutes and they can start at $119.

They're $740 billion inflation redoubling act Part of this bill. I mean the whole thing is a disaster obviously, but the worst part is like we talked about the 8,000 new IRS workers that will be hired because of this And this is the Democrats big election season push. This is their grand idea. Okay heading into the midterm elections This is what they've come up with when we've got inflation the economies and shambles People are living in cities You know afraid to leave their homes because of crime is running rampant and everything is falling apart and the Democrats They're they're pitched to the voters heading into the midterm elections is a we're gonna get more IRS agents and audit you But they say that this is that it's not what it appears to be right it's it appears to be a war on the middle class Hiring more stuges to audit and pilfer middle class Americans No, they say it's not that the IRS will focus on on rich people they say Except the problem is that every Democrat voted against an amendment requiring that the new IRS agents only audit Companies and people who make over four hundred thousand dollars a year So they could have put that into the bill and an amendment saying that all these new IRS workers that were bringing on none of them are going to be concentrating on auditing middle class Americans and given that the Democrats said that that was this their intention the whole time was to not do anything with the middle class Then they should have signed on the dotted line for that amendment, but they didn't every Democrat voted against it Because their actual intentions are quite clear Senator Ben Cardin though of a Democrat of Maryland Says that even so okay, maybe they're gonna focus on the middle class. Maybe we're all gonna get audited, but there's there's still There's nothing to worry about let's listen to his reassuring words Can you understand how? 87,000 new IRS agents would scare the heck out of millions of Americans Millions of Americans aren't gonna be impacted by that other than getting better service from the IRS having their telephone answer getting the questions They need in order to comply with our tax laws the auditing is gonna be Focused on those of high-income the large corporations, etc So there's no reason to be fearful and if you have paid your taxes and if you comply with our laws You should want to make sure everyone else does that? Ah Well, what are you worried about if you have nothing to hide then there's nothing to worry about You know if you paid all your taxes nothing to worry about as If as if a you know an audit is just a pleasant Even enjoyable experience if you've paid all of your taxes Of course, there's a very good chance that Especially if your income is not solely from if you if you if you have you know if you only make W2 income then More than likely, you know your audit's gonna come back. Okay, although it's still not gonna be a fun process But if you have some non W2 income then you know, there's there's a relatively decent chance that you've made a mistake here there You've you've you've whatever you've lost a paperwork or something So what what they're proposing here is that there are like two categories of people right there are the honest good people who pay all their taxes and and and every last penny and then there are the tax dodges and the tax cheats and who intentionally are Defrauding the IRS for millions of dollars every year like those are the two categories of course There's a lot of room in between and a lot of middle-class people find themselves on the in-between area But again, even if you have paid all your taxes and on it is a miserable incredibly stressful experience There's a reason why it's used, you know, it's it's the term is used We use it like we use the term root canal just to just as a as a stand-in for a miserable That's what that's what the that's almost the definition of the term now is a miserable experience and on it But Ben Cardin says that oh no really it's just gonna be better service Right because that's what you want from the IRS is better service They're gonna answer your phone calls first of all on the answering phone calls bit Let me just be clear about one thing it doesn't matter how many IRS agents they have I mean right now they've got 76,000 people working the IRS and if you try to call the IRS nobody's answer You're not gonna call the number that they have available That you can find on a website and you call up of IRS and someone just picks up the phone. Hey IRS speaking who's there? So that doesn't happen now you hot you double the size of the bureaucracy No, it makes service worse not better This is something that we've all experienced that The bigger anytime especially if you're trying to get in touch with someone if you have a problem of some kind And this goes for government agencies and also private companies as well Like the cable company or your cell phone care whoever it is The bigger the bureaucracy the worse the service the more difficult it is to actually talk to a human being The more impossible it is to find someone who cares about your situation and Especially the more impossible it is to find anyone who is accountable if a mistake is made Because that's part of the reason that's part of the point behind the enormous bureaucracies it is to the bureaucracy grows Eurek mysteries grow because they're cancerous tumors and all they can do is grow right Unless they're given some some very harsh treatment otherwise they're gonna grow so they grow because that's what they do But also they grow in order to insulate It grows in order to insulate itself from accountability the bigger the the more people that there are involved then the more difficult it is to pinpoint who is responsible for anyone individual thing and If you're just some sap calling on the phone then it's gonna be totally impossible for you So it's quite the opposite It's not better service when you add more bureaucrats. It is worse service always every time But speaking of service, you know, you know the service that I want to see from the IRS I would like to see the IRS Disbanded that's the service I want to see like self-destruction by they are that that's the to me. That's good customer service If I call it the IRS and they say oh we sorry we're packing up we were yeah, we're done with this whole thing That's good service as far as I'm concerned By the way Colin Pruitt posted this interesting graphic from 2019 And this is pretty this is pretty I mean, this is stark here. Okay. This is a stark illustration So this shows Where in the US you're most likely to be audited by the IRS and so you can look at it there and of course the darker red Then the more the more IRS that the more audits that they have in that particular region of the country and what you see is that It's kind of fascinating That this is also basically a map of the red states It's a this this almost doubles as a map of of red states and also a map of where the most poor people live Another are some exceptions so there are a good amount of audits happening over in California would seem But for the most part you can see it there and it's nothing but gray you get up into the Northeast and it's nothing but great It's fascinating how the Northeast Corridor which is Boston, New York, Philly, Baltimore, Washington Not covered in red Even though that's where you're gonna find the densest population in the in the whole country That's where you're gonna find a lot of rich people too living From Boston all the way down to DC Not a lot of red there Isn't that fascinating? So the question we have now Heading into 2024 And I go back to what I said in the open Which potential candidate will not just complain about the 87,000 IRS agents But we'll actually fire them Not hold hearings. I've already heard we've already heard from Republicans saying they're gonna hold hearings We're gonna we had so many hearings about Kevin McCarthy said All you guys better get ready because when we're in charge there's gonna be some hearings. I tell you what? They're gonna have all kinds of hearing we're gonna hear we're gonna be hearing a lot of stuff. Okay No, I don't need hearings. I don't need ranting about it. I don't need tweets about it I don't need anything like that. Are you gonna do something about it? Are you going to actually fire these people? Okay, it's not gonna be difficult to determine Which of the you know once Republicans are in charge of the government? It's not gonna be difficult to determine which IRS agents are part of the 87,000 crop Are you just going to boom you're all gone you're all fired And further than that Which Republican is actually gonna start calling for the abolition of the IRS completely? I mean first of all you want to talk about a popular position to take you cannot get more popular than that To abolish the IRS And it only sounds like pie in the sky Unthinkable because we take for granted that the IRS exists and that we live in a country where there's an income tax And there's a withholding system and you know the government they take our paychecks and they take the bit that they want Of right to paychecks and they give us the remainder so like they get their hands on our paycheck before we even do so we take all that for granted But it was not always this way. So this is a relatively new arrangement And there are other ways of going about it It's not as though if you don't have an IRS and you don't have an income tax then the government has no way of taxing people That obviously is not the case you can go to a consumption based tax system Which wouldn't necessarily require a centralized behemoth tax collecting agency? When are we gonna hear Republicans start talking about that is the question Speaking of amendments to bills I wanted to play this for you to Marco Rubio tried to add his own amendment to a bill a few days ago And it led to this rather fascinating exchange watch this The senator from Florida, Mr Rubio moves to commit the bill HR 5376 to the committee on health education labor and pensions of The Senate with instructions to report the same back to the Senate in three days not counting any day in which the Senate is not in session with changes that one are within the jurisdiction of such committee and two would contain a definition for the term Pregnancy that limits maternal and infant related program resources to biological females Mr. Senator from Florida is recognized Mr. President the only people who are capable of being pregnant are biological females and therefore I think federal Federal pregnancy program should be limited to biological females and that's what this would do Thank you, Mr. President a Few minutes ago. I look back across fifty five hundred years of human history so far every single pregnancy has been a biological female and so therefore the only thing I'm trying to do is make sure that federal laws clear that since Every pregnancy that's ever existed has been in a biological female that our federal laws reflect that and our pregnancy programs Are available to the only people who are capable of getting pregnant Biological females very simple. I would accept a unanimous consent if they want to offer and we can move on and not waste any time Senator Murray is ten seconds left When we are facing the challenges we do in this country when we're facing This country and helping our constituents to lower costs it is outrageous that Republicans are trying to define pregnancy of all things on this floor on this day after hours of voting on amendments I urge a no vote outrageous I mean this is outrageous to She says we can't we can't define pregnancy. She says now I think that I appreciate the effort by Marco Rubio and and and anytime the Republicans Take advantage of an opportunity to highlight the fact that Democrats are a bunch of anti-science pagans there a bunch of lunatics a Gaggle of lunatics who believe that men can get pregnant women at penises I mean absolutely take advantage of every conceivable opportunity to point that out That's another hint going into 20 22 2024 As I've been saying forever and some Republicans are finally starting to clue into this though not enough This is a winning issue It's even a it's even a bigger winning issue than abolishing the IRS although that would also be a winning issue but You know speaking out against this insanity is a winning issue and you're putting Democrats in a position that they absolutely Don't want to be in because you have to remember is that Very few of these people though. They are beholden to the radical left though They've adopted this posture because they think they have to very few of them Actually believe any of the trans ideology stuff very few of them actually believe it They have to pretend that they do and They really wish they didn't have to pretend it They don't like it that they have to pretend that they they agree with it Like they don't enjoy here's the thing that you think they enjoy being held hostage by the trans militants. No, they don't like it That's the position they put themselves in and so any time We can make them even more uncomfortable in that position than we should do that So that part I like And that's why I appreciate the effort However, I don't think it's semantics to point out That you kind of you you ruin the whole thing When you use the term biological female instead of just saying woman So it should have been an amendment and obviously it wouldn't have passed this way either It'd be even less likely to pass but then at least you're making you the point that you want to make You know if the amendment was to to to stipulate that maternity services are only given to women Because only women can get pregnant Then you've made the point that you want to make and then you've put the Democrats in the position of having to get up there and say well No men can get pregnant too When you say biological female You you give them a lot of outs first of all Then you give them the opportunity to say well There's a difference between by all of sex and gender and these things and it's so complex and you can't possibly understand So you give them that that out when you use the term biological female instead of just saying woman But also and this is something I have to constantly remind myself as well Because it just becomes a habit to use terms like this But when you say biological female You know it's it's it's a qualification that isn't necessary and it makes it sound like there are other kinds of females Well, this is a biological female It's the same mistake that a lot of conservatives made and still make when they say traditional marriage as opposed to other types of marriages Well, no because the argument that you're trying to make is that marriage is a certain thing is to find a certain way And there aren't any other types of it This is just just what marriage is if this is not the traditional form is not the biblical form This is just marriage And so it's the same thing here You know if you're saying if you're saying female biological is not necessary It's it's like saying um a you know a geometric circle Well, yeah, I mean true right it is a Geometric circle fine, but that's but we're talking about geometry. We're talking about shapes So we don't really need the geometric part. It becomes confusing. It makes it sound like okay a geometric circle as opposed to one other kind of circle We're talking about So same thing here and and that's and and it does it again It might sound like semantics, but it's really not you have to keep this in mind You have to think carefully about the language that you're using And unfortunately these days our language is full of booby traps Because so many of the words and terms that we use that have been given to us by the culture They've been given to it to us by the left And simply by using those terms you're already surrendering the point that you're trying to refute All right want to read this this from the New York Times And I haven't really said much if anything at all about this story and one of the reasons is that frankly I just don't care all that much but All the same Here's the latest from the New York Times It says immediately after a Moscow judge handed down britney grinders nine year prison sentence thursday Calls grew louder for president joe biden to find a way to bring her home The reverend al-sharpton said in a statement we call on president biden and united states government to redouble their efforts to do whatever is necessary and possible US officials and analysts had been resigned to a guilty verdict for griner A basketball star who plays for a russian team during the wmb off season But the cold reality of her sentence on a drug charge was a shock and renewed calls for biden to secure her release Even as critics fumed that offering to swap prisoners with moscow Rewards russia and its hostage taking practices Um, the result is a painful quandary for the biden administration as it tries to maintain a hard line against president flatter mr. Putin and uh so on and so forth now A lot of people have said that this is Unprecedented, you know for an american citizen to get this kind of sentence for having drugs or drug paraphernalia in russia, you know as is unheard of and and uh and You know puteness doing this to make a political point or he's doing this because he wants a hostage for a for a prisoner swap And both those things might be true by the way and it's clearly part of what he has in mind But even so it's actually not unprecedented at all Um, have you heard the name mark fogle? And I ask you that because I had heard that name until just a couple days ago when I happened to read an article about this Um Mark fogle is an american citizen currently in in a russian prison right now On drug charges 14 years in prison and this is a recent thing too. This is not from years ago So this uh bbc article says a russian court has sentenced a former u.s diplomat to 14 years in prison For large scale cannabis smuggling Mark fogle had previously worked at the us embassy in mascau But was employed as an english teacher in the city at the time of his arrest fogle was sentenced in the same jurisdiction That's hearing a marawana related case against us basketball star britney griner cannabis is legal in many parts of the us but remains illegal in russia Uh quote the american citizen fogle has been found guilty a court in mascau Moscow suburb of kimki said in a statement the news release said that the english teacher had committed large scale drug smuggling in addition to large scale illegal storage of drugs without a commercial purpose So how many how much drugs that he actually have well fot says that fogle is in his sixties Had around 17 grams or uh about half an ounce point six ounces of cannabis in his luggage when he was caught on the 15th of august 2021 And then it was just earlier in the summer actually when he was um Found guilty and sent us the 14 years in prison for this And for whatever reason You know, we hear all the hand ringing and people are in tears over britney griner the basketball player Uh, but we don't hear much about mark fogle Or any of the other american citizens for that matter who are in prisons not just in russia but across the world for breaking the law or Allegedly breaking the law in the countries where they were visiting or spending some time in And that's the thing here, you know, this is um Well, we have to keep in mind that this is the law in russia And it has been since forever and they've been doing this since forever Where if you come into the country and you've got drugs and you're breaking their laws, they're going to throw the book at you This is what they do Because they take drugs very seriously in that country Now you don't have to like it But what I can't this is one of the reasons I haven't said much about this story because when I first heard about it, I said well I mean that's unfortunate to do nine years in prison in russia. I wouldn't want to do that But then again, I wouldn't be bringing any kind of drug paraphernalia or anything into russia Because i'm not an idiot And it's this is russia we're talking about This is this is not los angeles And so you must you must at some level know what you're doing and yet you do it anyway because I guess you think well You know, i'm britany grinder i'm a wmba star If such a term even makes sense, but they're not gonna do anything to me And then you learn that well Actually, they don't care about that over in russia And as far as their drug laws and I know that we um Have heard a lot about how unjust and everything the drug laws are in russia, well, I should note that This might be part of the reason why their overdose fatality rate is a fraction of what ours is We have one of the highest overdose rates in the world I mean we lead the world that's one of the categories one of the unfortunate categories where we are you know, setting setting that we're setting the benchmark in overdose deaths Well, not in russia. I mean there's this infinitesimal in comparison ours. It's a fraction of ours And yeah, we have double the population that they have But even taking into account even if we looked at it per capita Still the overdose rate for them is quite a bit lower And part of the reason for that again is that they just are not gonna mess around with this stuff If you get found with it You're done and that's it Um Now the we're supposed to take a lesson from this and this in fact some some people on the left have been saying that uh, well They've kind of started to make what sounds like almost the same point and saying that well why why are we talking about bertney griner When when in fact there are but what about people in the in the united states who are in jail on drug charges? So we need to take russia as an example and do more of the opposite by making our drug laws even more relaxed But I kind of take uh I I have a very different takeaway. I take I take the opposite lesson away from this Which is just that if you actually have I mean, it's one thing to say zero tolerance But if you actually have a zero tolerance attitude towards drugs And you're waging a real war on drugs and i'm just saying it but an actual one Then you are going to see some of these problems mitigated to a certain extent I mean if you if you punish an activity and you punish it severely and consistently you will get less of that activity That's just a fact of human nature All right, let's see what else we got here. Um A woman uh some of the other wire woman and an lgbt pride event of pennsylvania cheered on a young boy working a stripper poll Uh video posted by libs of tiktok shows Photos confirm the 30th annual central pennsylvania pride celebration held in harrisburg on july 30th featured drag queens and a stripper poll the event where the shocking video sourced was taxpayer subsidized I think we have the video of that let's play those play the video here Yeah This video was posted I think but the most important thing to keep in mind here And to take from that is that the video was posted by Not a concerned citizen who happened to be walking by and saw this happening But uh was posted by the boy's mother And she said she was very happy about this and put it up on tiktok. I think it's been taken down Since then that shows by the way the the bubble these these freaks live in that she posted this video and Didn't expect any backlash at all. I mean she's got her young son on a stripper poll being taught had a strip by a Almost entirely naked man at a gay pride rally and she thought that she would get nothing but high fives and smiley emojis in response And she got some backlash and then she deleted So she posted it and she said uh central p.a. Pride had a poll set up with an amazing instructor to assist my kiddo is a natural You know we hear about the groomers in the public school system We hear about groomers in the media and academia and and hollywood and all these other institutions And um, it is true that all these institutions do have a grooming problem. No question about it But the really dark reality is that there's also a grooming problem in the institution of the family In many of these families. That's where the grooming starts And it's really unthinkable to those of us who are normal decent people. It's like just unthinkable that A parent would engage in this kind of activity a parent would groom their own child in this way, but that's what the lotte's parents do Which is all the more reason Why the good guys Have to step up and speak up For these kids because they have no one. I mean what what what what what chance or hope does this kid have That this is the environment is in this is what his mom is subjecting him to I mean someone should have showed up And I get if you're a normal person you don't even want to walk through an event like this, but Were there no? Just bystanders who happened to be walking by and would have seen this and could have just Went over to that stripper pole and knocked it over and said you're not doing this here This is not going to happen I'm not going to allow you to do this. You're not putting kids on a stripper pole you freaks That's what we need Someone to step up lots of us to sit Actually, let's get now to the comment section Do you know that name? You know according to feeding america one in six children experience food insecurity food is Obviously important to busy students studying playing and practicing all day before heading home with rising inflation food security Get even worse over the coming weeks and months our friends and good ranchers Won't stand idly by while america's children go hungry, but they need our help That's why they're on a mission to donate 100,000 high quality meals this month to children in need help them reach their goal By ordering your next box and good ranchers dot com slash Walsh good ranchers will donate a nutritious meal to a child I need for every box ordered through august 31st help them donate 100,000 meals and Get 30 off plus free shipping at good ranchers dot com slash Walsh All right lots of comments and you might notice a theme in these comments I don't know it's a little bit subtle But first comment is you cannot just make a man a giant walrus and not give it to him This is disgusting hashtag give matt his walrus katty says everyone of the daily water needs to be arrested For causing matt Walsh anxiety due to his lack of giant walruses Crystal says why can't I have my walrus matt is asking the real questions in life Ross carpenter says knowing matt's wife had never heard of reddit is the best thing i've heard all week Also matt if you can't get your walrus that I cannot support you as a theocratic dictator get it done Jay san pizza man says if matt doesn't show up on camera tomorrow with a giant plush walrus The entire dw staff is canceled hashtag give matt his walrus The magic wish says I couldn't stop laughing when matt said yeah, I want my walrus give the man his dang walrus This dusted says matt there's literally nothing more important in the world than getting your walrus the sweet baby gang shall not rest until dw fulfills its responsibility to our sweet daddy Um marcello says a thousand episodes second set of twins what is a woman Johnny the walrus that one million subscribers I mean what's left just give sweet daddy Walsh the person of the year award right now. Thanks for all you do well What's left? Marcello is my walrus Which I still have not been given as you can see you can look around in this beautiful studio And there's lots of space in the studio. It is quite spacious Okay, this is this is not my car anymore and it's not the closet they had me in before Um, there's plenty of places where a walrus would fit and yet if you could see for yourself No walrus is here. I do appreciate how the sweet baby gang has mobilized around this issue um And spoken out so passionately about that it is very meaningful to me And I assure you that and i'm but i'm going to need you to continue To cry out in one shared voice give matt his walrus Uh the giant stuffed walrus was made for me. It belongs to me by all rights And I will have my vengeance in this life or the next I will have my walrus in this life or the next preferably in this life though I will say I mean I did make a mistake. I have to admit I made the mistake and I can't believe this is like a rookie mistake I can't believe I did this but it really it was just I was so I was so excited about the walrus and the and and You know the knowledge that eventually I will be giving it and so I wanted to show my wife I showed my wife a picture Of the giant walrus and said we're gonna i'm bringing this home soon. Okay once I find it i'm bringing this home And she looked at it And she said that if I bring that thing home, I could no longer ever complain about all the pillows she buys And I said this isn't a pillow. It's a walrus. Thank you And she said that the walrus will take up a lot more room than the pillows though And I said well that's an incredibly reductive like degrading way to look at the giant stuffed walrus taking up room There are many spaces in our home many nooks and crannies that are not really being used for anything Why shouldn't there be a walrus in those spaces? So so the better question is not like the burden of proof isn't on me. Okay The better question is Don't ask me. Well, why do we need this walrus? It's no I think the question is why don't we have one already? Okay, we've been married for almost 11 years and through 11 years not once Have I brought a giant stuffed walrus home and I bring one home in 11 years and it's a problem Makes no sense Anyway, it doesn't matter. I want my walrus and I want it now and I will have it Today is a Tuesday like no other because this is the 1000th episode of the mat wall show You know what they say if you make woke leftists the object of your contemptuous ridicule Then you'll never work a day in your life. I think that's a saying somewhere That's true of the show and that's certainly true when it comes to my documentary what is a woman? It has more than 5,000 audience ratings of ron tomatoes and even five reviews from critics who are brave enough to touch it This month we the month rather than we released what is a woman the daily wire gained more members That at any other time in our history Just goes to show that if you make something worth watching unlike most hollywood movies and drag queen story hours everything else People will watch in droves if you haven't seen it yet go to what is a woman dot com to watch right now That's what is a woman dot com now. Let's get to our daily cancellation Well Wanted to leave a little extra time for this today An important issue slightly more important than the walrus if anything could be Back in may a trans activist and influencer by the name of eli earlick announced a felony conspiracy on instagram earlick excitedly told 40,000 plus followers about a brilliant plan to circumvent state laws banning doctors prescribing hormones to gender confused minors earlick's genius scheme which was laid out in strenuous detail and remained published on instagram for nearly three months Before libs of tick tock finally noticed it and reposted it to twitter The scheme was to gather leftover prescription hormone pills and mail them to anyone who wants them No questions asked we're told Here was the actual post it said there are over 20 states trying to criminalize hormone therapy particularly for trans youth So my friends and I had an idea Sending out our extra prescriptions around the country If you need hormones, I'm working with a distribution network to get you access Everything is free. No questions asked. We have hundreds of doses of testosterone estradiol and Sperano lactone I think is whatever it is All that is available right now all are prescribed by doctors and unused Each package comes with information on dosage obtaining blood work, etc I realized this is a band-aid solution. We need full access to affirmative medical medical care for professionals immediately However, missing a single dose of hormones can be devastating especially for trans teens and those new to hormones These laws are outrageous and I can't wait for them to be overturned in the meantime DM me if you need HRT or if you have over over prescribed hormones that you'd like to send out Now in a response to a question posed by a follower Erlich confirmed that this black market drug network can realistically ship to anywhere in north america Which means that the drug smuggling operation is international This is not a new thing either in september Erlich made something of an anniversary post on instagram celebrating 11 years on hormones in commemoration of the big event and as a wise old trans sage Dispensing morsels of wisdom. Erlich shared 11 mantras for harm hormone use and mantra six was redistribute your extra hormones to people who can't access slash afford them This mantra by the way was explained in a youtube video posted a few months earlier Where erlich offers what looks and sounds like a confession that you'd hear during the plea bargain phase at trial uh, let's listen Every month for the past several years. I've ordered a double dose of hormones and testosterone blockers I save all the extra pills for my best friends my closest lovers and my worst enemies I just hope these little pills can bring some joy into their lives I have the opportunity to give life-saving medication to people who need it and it basically cost me nothing A few months ago. I posted on instagram asking for testosterone for a friend who actually already had a prescription His doctor was out of town and you couldn't get a new one Within hours my store was taken down and I received a warning by the administrators Now of course, I know it's against instagram rules to share substances and I wasn't particularly surprised it was removed But I was still upset So yeah, I know it's illegal. Duh So is changing my social security to female about medical treatment. So was crossing the street outside my apartment instead of using the crosswalk Oh, yeah, I mean jaywalking is exactly like Trafficking and prescription pills illegally, right? Now in that video having apparently only just developed this fetish for announcing federal crimes on the internet Early was a little more cautious. There's a disclaimer quote unquote early on claiming that the whole thing is merely hypothetical But after getting a little taste of self-incrimination and having apparently enjoyed it so much Early became far more brash and bold and subsequent pronouncements leading up finally to the instagram announcement In which the whole drug distribution enterprise is laid out in detail yet As acknowledged in the clip that we just played All of this is illegal. It is in fact so illegal that it would be impossible for me to count all the laws that it breaks It is illegal to share your prescription medication with anyone who it was not prescribed for It is illegal to facilitate the exchange of other people's prescription drugs It is illegal to ship controlled substances through the mail. It is illegal to distribute drugs across state lines It is illegal to send them to other countries All of these drugs are illegal for anyone who is not a doctor or pharmacist to distribute period And for good reason The substances being shipped across the country by earlix ragtag group of drug peddlers are dangerous potent Lated with potentially severe side effects and they make irreversible changes to your body In participating in this scheme not just participating but organizing it Earlick has violated dozens of state laws federal laws and international laws Making the purpier Eligible for decades and federal prison This has been done and talked about openly on every available platform yet up to this moment There has been not so much as an instagram suspension in response Much less a raid by the dia Why Well because elyerlic is in a privileged class the most privileged class that has ever existed in the west That's why the confessed drug trafficker responded so brazenly when I first started tweeting about this issue on friday after libs of tiktok reported on it um And I started tweeting about it and talking about it and and from earlick there was never any denial Still to this point no denial none Instead earlick defended the criminal activity telling me that these drugs are lifesaving medications Which is just more confirmation that you're doing what it appears that you're doing which is illegally Uh distributing the drugs when I remarked that this response may be the first time in my life That someone has tried to dunk on me by publicly confessing to a federal crime earlick replied. It's an honor mat Earlick also thanked us for advertising quote unquote the trafficking operation and fully embraced the label drug smuggler Said it might go in the uh in the bile Now should be noted for what it's worth that earlick was slightly less excited to embrace the label accused sexual abuser Threatening to sue me for libel when I repost when I reposted reports from other outlets Noting that earlick has along with being a confessed drug smuggler Uh has indeed been accused of sexual assault by multiple alleged victims And you know that's that's the fact that's that's the news there. That's the the accusation has been made I don't know if it's true or not, but There was the accusations So I suppose we can add the law to the list of things this person does not begin to understand Thinking that I could be sued for libel for reposting a news report But no surprise coming from someone who casually captions their selfies with criminal conspiracy confessions But go ahead and file your lawsuit. You lie. I have I could please do. I have a feeling that discovery might be a very interesting process now Eli I admit that um You have some justification for being so brazen After all you've never been held accountable for anything in your entire life You are privileged and spoiled and literally never in your life. Have you been held accountable for anything? So why should that change now? I mean why should justice catch up with you now you ask Well Part of the reason why people like you skate by enjoying your own set of rules is that so often People like the rest of us have grown to simply accept this absurd state of affairs There's no reason why the system would punish someone like you if if nobody even bought bothers to demand it because we assume it's not going to happen And maybe that assumption would be correct. Maybe nothing much will happen even if we do demand Or maybe you would actually be made to face some sort of consequence for the first time in your life either way We're going to find out Because I am not going to simply accept that being trans makes you above the law even less Am I going to accept the illegal distribution of dangerous drugs to minors? I'm not going to let this go or shrug my shoulder and say well, not that we can do and move on Uh, no, no more of that I'm going to use the resources at my disposal Which are considerably greater than the resources at your disposal to make sure that justice is done here Why Well, because you're distributing dangerous drugs to minors across the country and this is only the tip of the iceberg Thanks to predators like yourself kids have many avenues for obtaining these substances without any doctor's approval much less parental consent This is what parents have to worry about now that their children will in secret begin to medically transition with the help of drugs They obtained through instagram Now I doubt that you're the country's most prolific illegal distributor of prescription drugs But you are the one that we're going to make an example of Because we have to start somewhere Also, you lie. I should note that I just don't like your attitude. I think you need some humility in your life And I am generous enough to help you develop that virtue so Here's what's going to happen I want anyone concerned about this criminal activity to do the responsible thing And report it to the relevant authorities if you see something say something how many times have we been told that And let's start with the dea You can easily find the link on google, but here is the url. We'll put it up on the screen for you dea.gov slash submit dash tip From there you can submit a tip either anonymously or not. It's up to you And you can note that there is someone by the name of eli earlick who has announced an intention Um to participate in the illegal distribution of prescription drugs across the country We're not finished early despite not understanding math statistics the law or for that matter human biology Is a phd candidate at the University of california santa cruis The university ought to know And ought to act upon the fact that one of their phd's is an admitted drug trafficker So yesterday I reached out personally to the chancellor of the university sinthia calireve To ask her about this matter and I haven't heard back yet Now, I'm going to give her the rest of today to respond And to explain what steps are being taken to address this very troubling situation But if I still could not get ahold of her after today then It will be my duty and responsibility as a citizen to share the publicly available contact information For the university administration and encourage all of my thousands of listeners and viewers and the millions who follow me on social media To call and email demanding that the university take action I hope it doesn't come to that and but but I have a feeling that it will after all the university said nothing earlier in the summer when erlick posted a tweet Calling for the assassination of supreme court justices They remind they remain silent then too But silence will not be an option anymore What is it that that they say again? Oh a silence is violence We're not done yet. Erlich have a new social media and instagram in particular to coordinate this criminal activity Should be indefinitely suspended there has rarely been a more deserving candidate for deplatforming as this account is an actual danger to children Reason enough for a permanent ban So we'll walk you through the steps to file your report with instagram You go to instagram first go to eli earlick's page Then hit the three little dots dots at the top of a right of the screen and select report and from there select report account And then there's select it's posting content that shouldn't be an instagram And then select sale of illegal or regulated goods and finally drugs Everyone listening to me right now should do that What should happen from here is that Eli is kicked out of school deplatform arrested and put under criminal investigation by both federal and state authorities. That's what should happen That would be the just and right result here Will any of that happen? Well, there's only one way to find out And even if every institution decides to accept earlicks trans your way out of jail free card A very distinct possibility after all these institutions are ideologically Ideologically captured as previously established But even still At least by using all of our platforms to amplify this story We could ensure that whenever anyone googles this person in the future potential employers or anybody else They will immediately see that eli earlick is a confessed drug peddler This is already working. We've already prompted several news outlets including fox to cover the scandal And um, we're going to continue because we can make sure that this creep Is branded by these admitted crimes For eternity And that's something at least But most of all We can send a message that we do not accept the hierarchy that our society has put in place We are not going to bow our heads submissively as the privileged classes break the law and harm our children at will We're just not We're going to fight back And that's what this is and that is also why eli earlick who again has confessed The distributing drugs illegally across the country to minors is canceled And we'll leave it there for today.
