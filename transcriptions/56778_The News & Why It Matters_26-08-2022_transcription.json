    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash the blind. Today, the Department of Justice releases a heavily redacted version, as expected of the Mar-a-Lago search affidavit, Mayor Bowser bans unvaccinated students from receiving any type of education and lives of TikTok uncovers, yet another hospital that is after your children. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Friday. I am Sarah Gonzalez and we got a full table today. It's going to be a good one. We've got in studio for you, Eric, July, Blaze TV contributor and founder of Ripiverse Comics, which is still killing it. Great job. And we've also got reporter from the Daily Caller Jorge Ventura or if you're white George, but that's not the same. It's for me. Big Buddha Latino. Yeah, Ventura in studio and of course the reference made because we are sitting here next to Alex Stein, Blaze TV contributor and host of conspiracy castle. And I like to call him the El Salvadorian saint because of his border work. So it's the saint of El Salvador. So thank you very much, Jorge. Exactly. But can I just for a second, speaking of Jorge's hard work, I do want you to tell to remind everyone about the latest documentary if they haven't already seen it. Yeah, guys, check it out. The new documentary is called Narco, Fornia. It goes into the cartels and the legal marijuana up in Northern California right now that is just terrorizing working class citizens, ranchers, farmers. So it's a fascinating story for those who don't know. And it's an important story because this was all done under Gavin Newsom and as we guys know, Gavin Newsom is setting his sights on that White House in 2024. So it's an interesting story. So check it out guys, narcofornia.com. Is there any nudity in it? He's not even dignifying your question with an answer. I don't only watch movies with nudity in it. Sorry. Sorry. I can't see it. Can you get your eye on my only friends? Okay. Yeah, there we go. Cheers. Oh boy, we're devolving quickly on Friday. It's Friday. Let's go. This morning, the Department of Justice released the redacted version of the Mar-a-Lago search affidavit. Obviously, it is so heavily- This is laughable. I mean, it's comical at this point. It's so heavily redacted. You can't- There's nothing that you can find out from this. There's no pertinent information. It states that the government is conducting a criminal investigation into improper removal and storage of classified information in unauthorized spaces as well as the unlawful concealment or removal of government records. It also said that the FBI believed that there was probable cause- The FBI believed there was probable cause. There would be, quote, evidence of obstruction at Mar-a-Lago when it searched the premises, along with additional documents that Trump and his legal team did not initially turn over to the DOJ. And look, the DOJ also released a separate court filing that said that the- They justified the reasons for its redactions by saying things like they didn't want to expose a, quote, significant number of civilian witnesses, end quote, and their identities or give parties information that could be used to obstruct the investigation. It's the perfect crime, right? It's the perfect crime. You do this to a former president who has already declassified things, which he has the ability to do. Please tell all of your leftist friends who don't have brains in their heads. The president is the one that can just choose to declassify whatever the hell he wants to, and then it's declassified. But to then be able to say, oh, we want to be really transparent with you, but we can't show you that because it's top secret and it could threaten national security. So you're just going to have to take our word for it and trust us. We do have a great track record. It's not like we would use our own agency for some sort of political weaponization. We would never do that, all right? So trust us, we're here to help, just like the IRS. I want to get your thoughts on this gentleman, but I also want to share with you Donald Trump, of course, responded to this, all of this releasing of the heavily redacted affidavit. He says on his platform, Truth Social, affidavit heavily redacted. Nothing mentioned on nuclear, a total public relation subterfuge by the FBI and DOJ or our close working relationship regarding document turnover. We gave them too much. Judge Bruce Reinhardt should never have allowed the break in of my home. He recused himself two months ago from one of my cases based on his animosity and hatred of your favorite president, me. What changed? Why hasn't he recused himself on this case? Obama must be very proud of him right now and then followed that up 15 minutes later with a note that just said, which hunt? Although, I'm not sure I can say he's wrong. Yeah, we talked about this was a Monday and then out many days running them together. Yeah, I guess that tends to happen when you raise like over $3 million. I got maybe that has something to do with it. My days run together because I have two children who don't sleep. That's it. You just walked right into it. I did. I did. I think it. I think it. I can take it. No, but seriously, we discussed it. You know, we talked about how, you know, the weaponization of the FBI has to be expected and they use this as a CYA, but it doesn't really cover anything because there's nothing revealed anything. So it's basically useless. But I think the American people that still believe that I don't know the agencies be it the FBI, CIA, talk about IRS, there's plenty of federal agencies that aren't used to be, I don't know, political agencies per se and used to punish their political enemies. I guess more accurate really putting it just complete nonsense. And that's how they are able to, it means it's kind of scary that they're able to get a former president, but they do this sort of railroad on people all the time that are certainly far smaller than him. And it's was like, hey, you got to trust us. We found something and then we're going to criminalize you because of it. So I think it's an institutional issue, but good luck trying to convince American, the American people that those need to be either dissolved or something else because oftentimes just we need to play a little bit of musical chairs to get the right folks and then they can be used for good. And I think something like the FBI is as rotten as it is. And I know we can talk about even what was revealed with Mark Zuckerberg and Facebook and how they, that to me is probably more important than the infiltration of the Milago, which we do have. So yeah, let's watch that. How do you guys handle things when they're a big news item that's controversial? Like there was a lot of attention on Twitter during the election because of the Hunter Biden laptop story. The knee we have to. Yeah, so you guys censored that as well. So we took a different path than Twitter. I mean, basically the background here is the FBI, I think basically came to us, some folks on our team and was like, hey, it's kind of wax. Just so you know, like you should be on high alert. There was the, we thought there was a lot of Russian propaganda in the 2016 election. We have it on notice that basically there's about to be some kind of dump of that's similar to that. So just be vigilant. A lot of people are still able to share it. We got a lot of complaints that that was the case. Obviously, this is a hyper political issue. So depending on what side of the political spectrum, you either think we didn't censor it enough or censored it way too much. But we weren't sort of as black and white about it as Twitter. Interesting. But like I said, look, the FBI, the DOJ, these government agencies are here to protect and serve you. And they would never use their agency, their own organization to go after their political opponents. That's the next thing you're going to tell me that the deep state actually exists Jorge. And I know that's a crazy conspiracy theory. We're slowly turning it into, I mean, if we're not already there, you know, Venezuela. This is what Maduro was doing to his political opponents like a Han Kugaido is using the kind of the FBI of the Venezuela to attack them. So we're already there. The FBI, I mean, to me, I've never trusted ever since my guy, Malcolm X. And I think it's great that they've continued to expose themselves. And even it's been shocking. But even like the Washington Post has come out and said, hey, we don't really see this even making sense. And if anything, you guys basically just won Trump, the presidency for 2024. I mean, that's just the way I view it. But we're basically going to slowly we're not right there. You're you are the conspiracy theorist. Yeah. And I don't. But you guys are the conspiracy theorist today because listen, I think that a Facebook can do good enough job censoring. And if Hunter Biden ever did anything illegal, he would already be in jail. It's pretty obvious. So obviously Hunter Biden has never committed a crime. He's never done illegal business dealings with Burisma or any Ukrainian companies never done anything illegal with China. That's all fake news. So I'm actually mad at Twitter and I'm mad at Mark Zuckerberg for not censoring in these fake stories. Those are fake crack pipes. Right? Yeah, those are fake crack. That's a crack pipe. That's a CGI. So in the Asian those fake, that's fake. The hookers are real, but that's okay. State where that's legal. So let's not arrest him for that. Hunter Biden's an American hero. Thank you, Hunter, for all your hard work. So in that that Mark Zuckerberg clip, which, you know, those of you who are just listening to audio and couldn't tell the voice, he was, of course, speaking to Joe Rogan on Joe Rogan's podcast. He did go on to say that Facebook was wrong to censor the story since no fact checkers could actually prove that the story was false. But it really fascinated me that he like I listened to that and I was like, why did he just admit this? It felt, it felt like he, I don't know, it felt messy to me. That's what happens where you get in there and you kind of get loose and you get the problem saying too much. I'm willing to bet he got a whole lot of messages after that and saying like, Hey, man, you probably say that, but even the way that he words it, it's almost as if the FBI, I mean, if they said it in a way that he said it was more like, it was coercion. If anything, you probably, you know, you might want to be looking out for this type of type of stuff. You don't want to be responsive for the threatening democracy. Exactly. So and look, I know the American leftists like to approach fascism. They basically guy that has a heart next to his name doing thing that I don't like, but fascism, historically speaking, as if you actually have read the doctrine of fascism by Mussolini and Giovanni Gentile. It's basically the merging of corporate and state. So this is why this whole, Hey, private company stuff, but I'm going to I'm going to an article capitalist. So I'm all about the privatization. But when you have a government agency trying to pimp that private agency to do their own bidding, that's not privatization. That's not capitalism. That's more accurately putting it fascist. Yeah. And we even saw it last year with Saki coming out in public and saying, Hey, Instagram, Facebook, you better, you know, you better take away all that misinformation, whatever when it comes to cobra. So you're literally seeing the state collide with these corporations. I mean, we're not even in democracy. I got like a corporatocracy. Yeah. Oh, I'm at this point. Yeah. And that question definitely drew him off sides. I don't think Mark is expecting that. But I think Joe should even gone harder on him. Like, come on, you know, Zuckerberg knew that they definitely briefed him that 100 Biden information. He's trying to say, Oh, something similar. So that's why, you know, I was so sentiment held like it's weird how he said it to Joe Rogan at a vault because something that serious would be done like one on one CBS interview, like something like that would have been worse. It's just like how it came out. Like I was like, why did he just like the biggest pop. Like the biggest pop. It was like, you know, yeah, the I feel you know, Joe gave him a pop Brownie. So he was so high. That's a key. Elon Musk. So I want to, I want to throw one more story in here because as we're talking about the Hunter Biden laptop, you may remember another Biden who had a piece of information stolen from that. Well, they say stolen from them. That was Ashley Biden, daughter of Joe Biden. And there was the diary, the infamous diary with the weird entry, which by the way says, I remember having sex with friends at a young age showers with my dad. And in parentheses, it says probably not appropriate. Okay, so this is what the entry said. And of course, this again, this, this is, this is conspiracy theory land. This is Russia collusion. This is all of the things that they call everything. You know, and turns out that actually two people now pled guilty to stealing Ashley Biden's diary and selling it to Project Veritas for $40,000. Now, let me give you the facts on this case. In September 2020, one of these people moved into a delray beach, Florida home where the daughter of now President Joe Biden, Ashley Biden, had recently lived and temporarily stored some personal belongings. And she basically just left it there. She abandoned the diary. And now they're saying that they stole it. They pled guilty. This is an actual thing that happened. I would ask why is nobody talking about it? But I guess I know the answer, which is then they would have to admit that showers with my dad, probably not appropriate, is being said about the president of the United States who by the way, also says children. Yeah, well, as a person that writes in his diary every day, whatever you write in a diary is 100% factual. So I do believe that whatever she wrote is true. And I think she wanted it to be found. That's why you leave it. The laptop too, right? It's like, why are Joe Biden's two children who both, you know, drug addicted, like apparently had some problems? Why are they both leaving these things for people to find? Well, they want to blow the whistle, but they're too afraid to do it. So they're just saying it's an accident. And now, you know, you look at Joe Biden, I think he picked a reporter today and then they immediately shut down the press conference that he was. Yeah, which is kind of unusual. So Joe Biden doesn't even he doesn't even know left, right, up or down. So I think that's why they're kind of like leaking the stuff, doing the laptop. They probably feel guilty and they want to get this information out there. That's just my opinion. Yeah. Do you guys agree? Yeah, I actually think the bigger story here is that they're trying to make it a crime to do journalism. And that's what they're trying to do is saying, hey, if you guys, I mean, they're literally just publishing, I mean, Project Veritas is doing journalism. They're just publishing documents, right? You know, same thing with Julian Assange. So anytime you do that, they're home. So what I'm thinking is they're trying to make it a crime and almost sending a message to Project Veritas to say, Hey, don't step too close. But we're kind of, I mean, James O'Keefe has already been coming. And I want to make this point, and she left it in a mutual house. That's not necessarily stealing. Well, I know that's what I'm saying. Like, if you left it and abandoned it, like, who's fault is that? I don't think that that's that. Yeah, I don't know the line. Let's call that that either. Eric, last word on this. Look, I can say it's it's this criminal sort of activity by way of the federal government is something that runs deep. It's something that this family, be it through Biden or whoever you want to pick and choose, man, or any of these kind of establishment hacks they've been involved in this bullcraft forever. You don't go into something like a public office coming out as rich as these guys have come out without doing some grimy grimy dirty stuff. And we know that. And I know we'd like to pretend like these guys a whole some just want to do right by their people. But there's nothing attractive about a public office that allows them to even do that to make a change per say that would be any positive they can get in and where they fit in and certainly line their own pockets. So when you do stuff like that, of course, there's a lot of grimy crap that happens. I wouldn't put it past them that something criminal that body was involved in had something to do with his daughter. And I hate to hear stuff like that. But it's not like we're ever gonna we're ever gonna know if we see something like a diary that has something that kind of inappropriate anybody, you know, certainly if it happened to anybody else, it'd be like, Oh, we're looking into it. We're gonna send everybody to investigate this problem. And it's been none of that what they're trying to unfortunately emphasize is how this was obtained and not even really looking into what the content actually said. Yeah, I mean, and to your point, I know we got to go to a break. But to your point, just think of I think back on how they treated Brett Kavanaugh based on completely unfounded accusations that couldn't be backed up and also Donald Trump, when CNN paraded around women who were accusing him of sexual misconduct. But again, couldn't back any of it up. Just just refresh yourself on those. All right, we've got to take a quick break. First, we want to thank our sponsor Bank on yourself. So everyone kind of dreads looking at their 401k and their IRAs right now, because their account balance keeps dwindling lower and lower. You may think that there is nowhere you can hide and it's going to affect you all of this recession and inflation. That is not true. The truth is you can build a financial bunker that will grow and protect your money during even the worst economic times. The bank on your self retirement plan alternative is going to let you escape all of this financial carnage. And by the way, I'd like to point out it has never had a losing year in over 160 years. I would call that a really good track record. So now is the time to bypass Wall Street and bank on yourself. They are going to let you reach your financial goals and dreams without taking any unnecessary risks. This is also going to let you take a tax-free retirement income. And unlike the government controls your 401ks, your IRAs, all of those types of things, you're going to control the money in your plan, not the government. I talked to these folks, they because I'm like, how are you doing this? How do you have such a winning record? How are you getting this? You got to let them explain it to you guys. You're going to be like, I can't believe I've not thought of this. You got to go to bankonyourself.com slash matters. You can get a free report with all of the details of how they can help you take back control of your money over at bankonyourself.com slash matters. Yesterday, DC Mayor Muriel Bowser, who was just a peach, said that students 12 and older must show proof of vaccination against COVID within the first 20 days of the new school year to continue. So here's the deal. It's to continue learning in person at both public and private schools. So you may be thinking, well, they're going to give them virtual learning so that the unvaccinated children can't spread this very deadly virus to children. I'm just kidding. It's not actually deadly to children. It's just all about power and control. And we can say that on YouTube now, by the way. I don't trust the terms of service. So she admitted that they can go to school, but they need to get their vaccinations. Their families will be alerted as to the dates. We are not offering remote learning for children and families will need to comply with what is necessary to come to school. Just a reminder here that like 40% of black children ages 12 to 17 are not fully vaccinated in DC. So those black kids can kiss their education goodbye unless their parents decided to give them a job that is not effective in preventing the transmission of COVID. Also, the virus itself does not actually affect children. Did I say that in a YouTube friendly way? I think that's good. I've said it a million times. I'm the back to back strike champ on YouTube. So it works out for me. Well, maybe we'll have you call them. Yeah, I can hear them. I'll make a couple calls. Yeah, we'll make it happen. But now this this hell for here, man, is something else. Think about that. You know, it's not just public education. She's talking about private institutions as well. The fact that this woman has the the power to even do that to me is like what the hell are you all doing is DC though, you know, it's a crap hole. So I kind of got to give them leeway like well, you're kind of now kind of brought this upon yourself. But doesn't change the fact that there are going to be people that go without in terms of their education. I would make the in the public sense I would make it's probably going to be a net positive for them because I don't know if you want to go learn with those crack heads over there anyway. So it might be a net positive for them to not be be there. But let's just the sentiment is hey, you're not worth even unless it's homeschool, I guess, unless they make that illegal too. But we will don't give them any ideas. But seriously, like the fact that even going after private education basically saying it's just not going to be offered, you're not going to be allowed to your child to allow to learn unless you go get this jab. That is extortion by any, any similar to the actual definition of it. And look, man, your beloved founders went to with the war for a lot less. I'm just going to say that. Yeah, a lot less. It does seem absurd that it's like, are she trying to red pill the black community? This is my favorite story because you have a black mayor stopping black kids from going to school. And this only impacts the working class kids. So now you're going to leave them out of an education. What's interesting is, you know, I'm coming from my home state of California, you know, good old Gavin Newsom. He actually had a walk back of Axie Mandate because a lot of Latinos and black parents got together and said, Nope, LA County said, Nope, we're not doing it. And then Newsom has had to be like, All right, I guess we don't have to do it. So hopefully we see those parents here unite. But this is a, it's racist. I mean, what would they say to a white mayor who did this? Well, listen, myocarditis is not that big a deal. That's all I'm going to say. Dr. Peter McCullough says otherwise. Well, you know, Dr. Stein says otherwise. So I'll just put it this way. Mayor Bowser is also the same mayor that freaked out when like one busload of immigrants came up there and said, you know, it's a federal disaster. So, you know, she's not the smartest or sharpest tool in the shed. And I think they want these kids actually to be far behind. I don't know why, but I think they want them to be, you know, they're going to be, they're going to be dependent on social services because they cannot survive in society. And that's what they want. No middle class. They want you to be ultra poor and to, you know, suck on the government's teeth, as I said. Well, they also, I think, want, they don't want your kids safe. They want you to be punished for not complying. That's all this is. Oh, it's all the balls down. It doesn't make sense. You tweeted out the Rockefeller manuals that they want kids just to basically be, you know, slaves, you know, and that's this kind of, you know, if you won't get the vaccine, then you probably won't sit at your desk all day and do your job. So it's just like, it's exactly the next step, the domino. If you want to do the vaccine, then you won't comply with everything else. So, it's all about compliance, not about health. Why are we forcing these kids to get the job here in the Southern border? We're letting in as if we're speaking right now, thousands of migrants unvaccinated into the country and will be released. And know that Joe Kavich can't come here and play tennis. He can't help but if you're a Ukrainian refugee, you don't need to come here. It's a Mexico get to Mexico and crosses the U.M. Arizona. I'll pick you up, bro. It's wild. She has the perfect last name. Bowser. So, so talking about the back the vaccine this morning, Moderna, sued Pfizer and bio and tech over the COVID vaccine. They said that Pfizer and bio and tech infringed on patents filed between 2010 and 2016 that covered its mRNA technology and that they copied its full-length spike protein formulation for coronavirus, which Moderna had created years before COVID-19 emerged. All these companies, every last one of these pharmaceutical companies have abused what is known as these IP laws historically. So this is very rich that now they're kind of stepping on each other's toes. But if you wonder why certain medicine in this country is as expensive as it is, you could point to this practice exactly in terms of what they're doing. Often they don't step on each other's toes, but you get these companies that basically buy the IP laws effectively a monopoly. They get the monopolized. Even if someone's willing to create it and do it for cheaper, you basically have monopolized this sort of idea is how these guys operate. Yes. And I say this doesn't know it's going to be people that say, well, you're a musician. What about? No, it's the same thing. You know what I mean? Like the fact that they're able to do that is why we have the pharmaceutical company is enriched as they absolutely are. It's not because the market demanded. So it's because they have been able to use a wheel basically IP law in this country to monopolize certain products and then charge whatever the hell else they want to. So it's hilarious that they would even do that. But I say let them fight all of the criminals. Yeah, I'm just rooting for interest. Yeah, let me do what they do. I hope they bake or up each other. Yeah. Bufauci, tell me it was all about saving lives. And that's the sad thing is that health care is nothing about health. It's all about profit. I mean, that's the upside down world we currently live in. It's actually it's worse than that because it's not just not about health. It's the exact opposite. It's about making you sicker so that you take more medicine that they can profit from. It's really sick. See what I did. We got to take a quick break.

Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there.

Miami, Florida is holding a gun buyback, but they're doing it for Ukraine. Okay, the city's website says the city of Miami has set up a voluntary gun buyback program to assist in providing safety and defense equipment to Ukraine. Your donations will be used to assist the Ukraine support efforts. Receive a gift card starting at 50. Wow, 50 whole dollars for an old unused or found weapons. No questions asked. Don't worry if you have that illegally. Wink, wink, just turn it into us. And you know, that's the first step in taking away all of your gun rights. Do your part to make our streets safer. It also says, by the way, that you can receive a $150 Visa gift card if you turn over what they call a high powered assault rifle. So AR 15, AK 47. And you can get a hundred whole dollars for a shotgun or regular rifle. I got to tell you, I don't think that any of my ARs that I absolutely lost in a boating accident, it was very tragic. I don't think that I paid $150 for them. In fact, I think it was quite a bit more. Yeah, so they want you to get ripped off with taxpayer dollars, which is hilarious. We're not getting ripped off. They're going to Ukraine. So we're benefiting. Allow then, I guess, give it to their own citizens out there so they can fight war. That's not at all hypocritical at all. Because considering that they're trying to take our weapons away. But this is hilarious. I know people that kind of end up doing 3D printing and making fake guns to get free money. Basically, it's what it amounts to a lot of folks that do. A lot of people do that type of stuff, but it doesn't actually help when you look at it in the long run, because it ain't like it. They spend any money that they give in it too. They don't got no money. Getting out of there in the air or there, again, just stealing it from the citizens that they're certainly around. But you're not getting any. That's a ripoff. Under $50 for my AR 15? No, no. Michael Scott said the best. I don't know if you can put a price value on a $150 gift certificate. It's priceless, especially from the government. It might be worth the trade. Don't do it. Don't take Alex's advice. Don't do it. Maybe. I don't know. I mean, it seems priceless. I mean, if it's from the government, that's like memorabilia. But on a serious note, Miami is a hellhole as well. So that place is really not doing well. And Florida is a conservative place. But Miami, you know, they probably need more guns in Miami. Protect yourself, in my opinion. Do not give your gun away. They just flipped their school board, though. I know they've gotten more conservative. They haven't. I think the mayor is more. But I'm just saying it's, oh, Miami is, you know, the cocaine and cowboys. It's always been kind of a wild place. You might want to be stay strapped if I was living in Miami. I just love this idea of these boomers who haven't touched the pistol in like over 10 years, turning them in. It's actually going to be used in Ukraine against a Russian missile. I mean, CBS had a report said even not like 30% of the weapons that the billions of dollars even go to the front lines. Well, other cities and police departments have done the same thing. And they actually have come out after them said, um, they actually, these can't even be used for war. And we don't even know how to deliver it to Ukraine. Spoken stupid. What is the UPS shotgun? What did you guys think of talking about Ukraine? I saw a tweet from Governor Abbott here in Texas that he tweeted out that like they put Ukraine flags at the state at the governor's mansion. Yeah, the governor's mansion to show support for Ukraine. And I was just like, are you? I think getting me. No, it's like it's happened, man. That's where jar clothes. I didn't say it. I could say a whole lot of things about that guy. That probably on a pro for this show. Well, let's say this. I'm happy that he's more worried about the border between Russia and Ukraine than Texas. Because that needs all of our attention. That is the most important border that that border between Russia and Ukraine. So thank you, Governor Abbott for caring about the Ukrainian citizens. And there's a lot of beautiful Ukrainian women that I would like to come over to America. So I really appreciate that, Abbott. I mean, just doing that to just shows that it's like you supporting an active proxy war, like Abbott's smarter than he knows that. But the whole Dallas has a lot of Ukrainian vibes, man. And you know, just driving around just flags everywhere. The whole thing. So it's so interesting here, man. It is so wild. And by the way, I do. I mean, I'm going to give Greg Abbott some some jabs from time to time. But I mean, definitely vote for him if you're in Texas. Because the alternative is not it's much, much worse, obviously, with Robert Francis overwork. And Alex and I know this personally. They're going to change the Texas flag with the Ukrainian flag. Oh, yeah. And if you're concerned about the open borders now, oh boy, just wait until he would get in charge and at the helm of things. I want to cover really quickly. After the Supreme Court ruled the law this last term, if you guys remember the New York gun issue with the Supreme Court, they ruled that the law concerning concealed carry permits in New York was unconstitutional. The state has now enacted new licensing standards. So the key change in New York's law was eliminating the proper cause standard concealed carry. It's so bizarre to me that this was actually a thing. They concealed carry applicants had to prove in order to receive the permit. And so if an applicant couldn't demonstrate a special need for self protection, distinguishable from that of the general community, they couldn't qualify for a license. It's so hard for me to wrap my brain around New York's crazy gun laws because I mean here in Texas, it's like, wait, that's what the, it's just the Second Amendment. Right. That's you don't need us. It doesn't say you need to demonstrate a special need. And this only applies to people who have a need distinguishable from that of the general community. Like none of that is a thing. It's so weird to me, but they adopted a new rule governing concealed carry permits. And besides eliminating that particular proper, proper cause language, they also require applicants to include four character references and a list of social media accounts they have in the last year. Here we go. They're going to have to sit for an in person interview and undergo a firearms safety force. Can you imagine Alex doing that? Yeah, sir. What do you mean by big booty listening? I'd be sorry. They might shoot me. I'm gonna have a gun now. So it makes you like this. They're just blatantly like, yeah, we don't care. Yeah. We're gonna work on it. We're gonna do it on constitutional stuff. It certainly doesn't fear its citizens. I mean, considering where they're at, they have no they do blatant stuff like this. Like the basically you're effectively having an ask for permission to be able to protect yourself. And I go back to what I just said, like you found your beloved founders went to war for a whole lot, a whole lot less. It took just a little slight little text that did for them. And you have these little tyrants going around doing exactly what they're doing to the point to where they're saying, hey, in order for you to protect yourself, you've got to ask us. And we'll make the decision. You know what I mean? It's probably gonna be no, but at least you get to ask us. Like imagine being that cocky to where you play such a role on millions of people. That's just to me insane. You got to talk about this. Chicago where guns are basically outlawed has the worst gun violence. So and then they also have a similar bell reform system to what is happening in New York. So they're gonna know cities are gonna have a gun, but I guarantee the criminals and the cops will have guns. So you know, it's just you need a gun to protect yourself, whether you're in Miami, New York, Texas, Dallas, it doesn't matter. I believe the more guns we have, the safer you are. And don't be condested. They under New York understood the assignment. They just don't care. They just don't care at all. They're gonna do it anyway. All right, we've got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. That's my thing is like, you read this one? Like, they're like, they're like, they're like, they got it. Lips of TikTok obtained exclusive audio of a phone call with Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C. that confirms that they do perform gender affirming hysterectomies on minors. Listen. Hi, I was calling because I'm looking for information about the gender affirming hysterectomies that you guys offer. So I was just wondering, I've contacted quite a few hospitals already. It seems like it's difficult to find one that does the operation for my 16 year old. And I was told that you guys do do that. So if you do it for 16 year olds, then yes, I'd love to schedule an appointment of consultation, whatever you need. If you don't mind me, I ask, what is your child gender change into? So I can point you to the one direction. Yeah, well, he transitioned to male. You know, he already had the top surgery. And now we're looking for the hysterectomy. Okay, so I'm trying for you to the G1 and nurse line. One of the nurses would give you a call to give you more information and to let you know the steps and the protocol that they do for that. Okay. Okay. So they do, so they would do it for that age? Yes. Wonderful. Wonderful. That's great. As Alex said earlier, health care is not in fact health care. It's quite the opposite. That applies here as well. I'm trying to avoid pissing off at it. That was eerie. Very eerie. Yeah, I'm just trying to. I think a way to stop illegal immigration guys is to show all the immigrants that video. Like, this is what you're coming into. It's just going on an art. That's a great point. Hispanic. That's part of the reason that the Hispanic community, it's like they're they're pulling with the Hispanics so low because they're like, we're not going to do this crap to our kids. You guys are psycho. Yeah. I mean, and I imagine that surgery is pretty expensive, but why would you even need to give a child a hysterectomy? I mean, it's just it's really it's demonic. It's satanic. Now, you just heard you heard that phone call. You heard it right there and you could tell that the hospital worker, I felt like she approached the conversation with a little bit of like hesitation of whether or not she should admit it and then was convinced somewhere along the way. Well, they said on Twitter, the hospital itself, Children's National Hospital said that they do not perform gender affirming surgery for anyone under the age of 18. It's just that they just admitted that they did. So somebody's doing it. And the fact that it's it's talked about in this country. So just effortlessly and like people aren't ready to burn uncle box over this, it just goes to show how far we've certainly come. Yeah. You know, I've seen some of these gruesome pictures man of these youngsters getting these top surgeries and it's like, you know, this is irreversible damage that they're doing that they're doing to these youngsters, even if they are, you know, teenagers, you know, just extremely young kids and they think that that's okay. And now we've lived in this world where everybody's being gaslit to make it seem like you're the crazy one for saying, okay, yeah, this is not okay. If you are an adult, I might think it's as goofy as all get out that you want to do something like that, but you're an adult. If we can't even agree, like right now, I feel like that should be universal should be up for dispute. That probably children having this irreversible damage done to them is not okay, right? You think that we could at least agree to that, but it's such a bizarre sort of world that we're in where now that's under question and you're like, oh, you're a bigot for not affirming your gender, the gender of your child, which is what they're also arguing at the same exact time that 18 year olds who take out student loans aren't mature enough to understand like the financial risks and like we have to pay it back for them now because they can't understand that. But a 16 year old should have a hysterectomy. Like what? Well, to your point though, how you said earlier how healthcare is not about health, you know, I was just watching the Stephen Crowder, one of his changed my mind and they pulled up the status like 0.000016% of children are born intersex, right? With with, you know, either both generals or some sort of general mutation. So the hospitals have had these procedures since they've always been able to do this to children for that reason. But now they've used that into doing it for 16 year olds and they've just extrapolated it to young adults that are confused and have gender dysphoria. So that's why it's really evils. I get the small 1.0000 application of it and now they're applying it to just young kids that are confused and that's the evil part of it. You know, they talked about top surgery, which I think is absurd. Let's call it what it is. They're chopping their breasts off. The most grotesque part about that in itself is that these people are so mentally ill that they do that and they're so proud of it that they take a picture and post it all over social media as if it's something that's like awesome to look at. And it just makes me like, I'm like, I want to vomit and I can't tell if I want to vomit more because it just looks horrible. Or if I want to vomit because this person like is that proud of what they just did to themselves, they want to show other people like it's to me sad because it's like the kids are being used as like virtual signal points for the parents social media. And we saw that a lot with like the, you know, with the whole jab of kids that crying out wanting. But the mom like, I got it and I see a bunch of these these videos from like Libs with TikTok where these parents are like, Oh, well, my son is a girl and we can't wait to turn and it's like, you're just using your own kids like for political points and likes. Like that to me is like the most disgusting thing. And if you do go through with that surgery, you just mess up your own kids mental health for the rest of their life and their identity. There's a famous story. I highly encourage the audience to look at it. There was a Salvadoran mother in Florida, you know, she puts her daughter in public school. The school convinces her that she could get a sex change. She could be a boy. Does that the surgery is in, you know, ends up killing her killing herself because it just messes it up. And that's what's happening all over the country. But this that to me is the worst how these kids are being used for. Which is why I would advocate hear me out here. It's gonna sound a little extreme. Okay. This is clear child abuse, right? And I would say that this is the worst kind of child abuse because the person, the people who are supposed to be the ones to protect you are pushing you into this and allowing it and enabling it to happen. And it's even worse than physical abuse because you get like you, they're not hitting you forever, right? Like you're not getting beat up forever. You can move on. This is setting them up for a lifetime of mental health issues. This is a lifetime of emotional and mental abuse that your parents actually did on purpose to you, which is why I'm a very strong advocate for like just public execution, death penalty for any parent who does that. I don't think you say that we're anti-public execution. Yeah, we're not like that. In Minecraft, in Call of Duty, she's talking about that in Call of Duty, not in real life. She wants public execution in video game. In a video game, that's how you say it in a video game. Not in real life. Yeah, just talking about the context of video game. I'm sorry, but Alex is the one. We can't call on violence. Can we just all get a little out? So that's how you do you win. Wait until you answer. Alex, it's the voice of reason. Alex, it's state sanctioned violence. I'm told that that's okay. The death penalty exists. That's all I'm saying. Well, you know, in a way, I'm almost kind of anti-death penalty because if they've convicted, if they've murdered one person wrongly, which they have through DNA evidence, I don't think they really should have death penalty overall. Well, I would just say that I would want them in life. I know we got to take a break. I would want them in life, life in prison, but then I'm just paying it in my tax dollars to keep them in prison for life when really they're no benefit to society and should be eliminated. They make license plates in prison. So they're a little benefit. Yeah, we all need license plates. We got a down-right call. We got it. Like that's the best trick for you? Yeah, I know. I don't want you to kick her. Jorge, we're always glad whenever you can make it and join us and sit at the table in between your trips to the border. Tell everyone one more time where they can find your documentary. Yeah, everyone, go on narcofornia.com. If you have trouble finding, just go on dailycaller.com. It leads you right there. There's a trailer and everything that's sent it to a family friend's great documentary. I think people will be highly educated on what's going on there. Awesome. Then Eric is, of course, he is releasing a whole series of comic books and comic-related things. Been working very hard on it. Eric, tell them where they can support you. Yeah, removerst.com. You can pre-order. I saw them. It's you number one. I'll be our first book. We'll be starting shipments actually in the next couple of weeks. You should be. So yeah. And Eric is making sure that his don't include any spider women who are in wheelchairs. Yes, no, no. No paraplegic spider women. Yeah. And I'll be in Omaha, Nebraska. This Saturday, if you guys want to come see primetime 99 live, follow my social media, you'll see the link to tickets. We're going to go insane for the Ukraine. What if I don't want to go and sing for the Ukraine? Well, too bad. All right, thanks guys."
