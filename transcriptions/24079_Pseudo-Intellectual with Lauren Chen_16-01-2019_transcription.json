    "text": " Tonight, we find out that apparently Gillette Razors hates men. I'm roaming millennial and you're watching Uncensored. Hey everybody, welcome back to the show. Today we're taking a look at the latest case of corporate social suicide. Now the trend of woke brands has been with us for a while and who can forget such classics like Kendall Jenner's Black Lives Matter Pepsi ad or that time for some reason, a beer company hired Amy Schumer to complain to us about the wage gap or something like that. And then there is of course my personal favorite, Burger King's ill-fated attempt to address the so-called pink tax. Here's a little reminder of that in case you've forgotten. Now aside from pushing a socially progressive agenda, what all those ads have in common is that they were mind-blowingly, shockingly, poorly received. So much so that I think a lot of us were kind of thinking, okay, finally we can all move past this, we can all stop injecting these far-left talking points and politics in general into everything we could just live in peace. Well apparently the marketing team over at Gillette the Razors company didn't get that message. Earlier this week they released this gem. Is this the best a man can get? Is it? We can't hide from it. It's been going on far too long. We can't laugh it off. Making the same old excuses. But something finally changed. To say the right thing. To act the right way. Some already are. Because the boys watching today will be the men of tomorrow. Yeah, yeah, as you can probably guess reception to that was not the best. Because of filming this episode that ad has over 380,000 dislikes and counting. Which by the way, I was more than happy to contribute to. And you know what, there are actually people out there who when they saw the backlash should let was getting over this, said see, men really are toxic, this just proves it. But no, no. If you think people are mad about this video because they in any way actually support things like raid culture or sexual harassment or bullying or I think they even included mansplaining in there as if that's in any way comparable to the other stuff. But if you think that you are reaching Kardashian levels of being out of touch. And so there can be no mistake, let's take a gander at some of the comments on the video to hear what the people have to say about this. And note, we did have to take screenshots because there are some who have speculated that Gillette's team has actually been deleting negative comments as if that's going to fix anything. In the details from the comments section, some highlights are a Gillette razor, $20, soy, $5, losing your entire clientele, priceless. My wife's boyfriend and I love this. And of course, stop being men, just become women with penises, Gillette 2019 probably. And most seriously, Gillette, it's going to sting a little on your next quarterly returns. Not sure if there was a more effective way to turn off your entire market base who purchased your products. But the problem here isn't that Gillette has in some way struck a nerve with men who really do just love them some sexual harassment, it's that they've essentially called an entire gender which just so happens to also be their core demographic, predators. And yes, it's true that men are overrepresented as perpetrators of crimes and specifically sexual crimes, but still, those are the actions of a small percentage of the overall male population. So it's pretty dang insulting and demeaning to talk down to men everywhere just because of the slimy actions of a few male feminists, not even kidding with that. And to really understand why people are mad, imagine if they had made a video like this about literally any other group in the world that's overrepresented in crime, telling the entirety of people belonging to that group that they just need to do better. They certainly would never have done anything like that for any religious group, praise be toola, and they sure as hell would never do that to any racial group that's overrepresented in crime. Heaven forbid that would happen, that would literally be riots. And before anyone says, oh no, that's different, you can't treat races or religions like genders. Mmm, nah, nah, that's not what's going on here either. It's not okay to generalize based on genders because people sure as heck aren't allowed to generalize women. Imagine, if you will for a moment, what would happen if a large multinational corporation released a plug like this? Ladies, I know we're all trying to do our best, but maybe we could be doing a little better. Whether it's having the financial responsibility to stop spending money we don't have or trying to control ourselves so we don't molest and rape our young, vulnerable male students we really need to push ourselves here to strive for more. I mean, what's with us performing so poorly when it comes to mathematical ability and not wanting to work the long hours that our male colleagues do? Kind of seems like we're just being stupid and lazy, you know? And gosh, don't even get me started with how unbearable we can be during that time of the month, just ooh, nelly, moody town population, us, am I right? So girls, let's hold ourselves accountable for our actions. Can you see one of your friends being difficult and shooting down every possible suggestion for a place to eat yet not coming up with any of her own? Say something. When you see your sister being mad at her boyfriend for something she dreamed he did the night before, remind her that that makes no sense. Be better, ladies. Be better. People would freak out if a company aired that and rightfully so. And especially by the way, if an ad like that targeted at women was directed by a man. Which yeah, the Gillette ad hating on men directed by a female director, Kim Garig, who incidentally was also responsible for the Viva LaVova ad for a feminine hygiene brand called Lebresse. So pfft, natch. She's clearly a great choice to sell razor blades to men while addressing the issue of masculinity. I mean, who knows more about masculinity than some postmodernist female film director, right? And look, it's not like I'm saying that the ad couldn't have addressed things like sexual harassment and me too either if they did want to show support to victims who had gone through that. They absolutely could have, but there was probably a way to do that that didn't involve essentially accusing all of your customers of being harassers or at least potential harassers. Or I don't know, that's just what I think. I'm no marketing expert though. But anyway, since that Gillette ad or some might call it, middle finger to men everywhere was released, people have actually taken time and looked through Gillette's old ads to show that the company wasn't always like this. Apparently run by out of touch man-hating feminists, that is. There was a time specifically in 1989 when the company actually affirmed positive aspects of masculinity and to a slow mo 80s power ballad no less. Here's that. The shot. You're looking good. You've come so far. And we know how to make the most of who you are. Father to son. It's what we've always done to let the best of men begin. All the so many faces made of the most. And we know how to make the most of who you are. Father to son. It's what we've always done to let the best of men begin. All the so many faces made of the most of who you are. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. Father to son. All the so many faces. It's plain to see. We give you all we have to do for all of them can be. to go with our consumerism. So with this whole thing honestly, to me, I'd like to say that the moral of the story for brands, particularly their executives, should be just because you guys are in all likelihood, coastal leads who live in little afluent politically correct and progressive bubbles, who have not so much as breathed in the vicinity of a blue collar worker for what, a decade? That doesn't mean all your customers are like that too. So this assumption, all you guys seem to have that the majority of consumers out there will actually agree with your pretty fringe, to be honest, far left sensibilities. You might want to reconsider it. That's not to say that everyone hated the ad though because there are of course the leftist elites in the media who loved it. From The Guardian, the headline reads, Gillette hashtag me to add on toxic masculinity, cuts deep with men's rights activists. Yeah, it wasn't just men's rights activists who had a problem with the sad, I mean, check the dislike ratio. But as CNN also reports, Gillette's new ad isn't about shaving, it's about men in the age of me too. And according to that article, quote, we expected debate. Actually, a discussion is necessary. If we don't discuss and don't talk about it, I don't think real change will happen. Pangaj Balah, Gillette's North America brand director told CNN business. He said he hopes men who watch the video will be inspired to act like role models and show younger children how to stand up to bad behavior and treat other people with respect. And that article, interestingly enough, also mentions that, quote, Gillette's team consulted men across the country, conducted its own studies and spoke to experts on masculinity according to the company. If by men across the country and masculinity experts, they mean the gender studies department at a liberal arts college, then yeah, that makes sense. Otherwise, though, I, I really, really question that research. Ultimately, since the ad was released, obviously a lot of people have announced they will no longer be purchasing from Gillette. And now I'm not going to tell anyone what they should spend their money on, but at the same time, I know personally, I no longer feel comfortable purchasing from Gillette in light of how they have mistakenly reinforced the false gender binary. I mean, did they even ask all of the people who appeared in that ad whether they even identified as men in the first place? How can we be sure? And that's not to mention, and this part is actually serious. They literally uphold the pink tax. That's right. 18 pink disposable razors from Gillette do cause more than 18 blue disposable razors. How? Ow! Did that get by the mighty corporate progressive activists over there? Seriously. But anyway, that's all for this video. Thank you guys so much for tuning in, and I'll see you next time. you"
