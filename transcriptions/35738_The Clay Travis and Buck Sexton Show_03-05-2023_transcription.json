    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in Wednesday edition. Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show, appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll into what should be a very illuminating and fun show. Buck is here in Nashville. As we mentioned yesterday, we are in our Nashville studio. Having a good time here. We appreciate all of you giving you a little roadmap where we're headed. Governor Stitt of Oklahoma will join us in the second hour, then Raymond DeRoyo from Fox News. Many of you see him on more Ingram show. He will be with us in the third hour. Lots of different stories. The border is falling apart. We have stupidity from Whoopi Goldberg on the view. Go figure Nordstrom shutting down in San Francisco continuing the ridiculousness of San Francisco falling apart. Tucker Carlson under siege as more and more leaks continue to come out about him. But as the last 30 minutes or so, a breaking news story from the Washington Post about Hunter Biden and potential charges that may be coming. And I want to just give you some of the details from this story that just came out in the last hour or so headline. Prosecutors near charging decision in Hunter Biden case, a meeting between prosecutors and defense lawyers comes towards the end of an investigation. Of course, this is the four year long investigation into the Hunter Biden laptop and potential charges that could have been proved based on that laptop. Here is the opening paragraph from the Washington Post. Prosecutors are nearing a decision on whether to charge President Biden's son, Hunter, with tax and gun related violations, according to people familiar with the matter, the culmination of a four year investigation. Republicans have sought to portray as evidence the Biden family is corrupt. Story says Biden's attorneys met at the Justice Department last week to discuss the case with US Attorney David Weiss of Delaware. According to people familiar with the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing criminal investigation, typically according to the Washington Post, that sort of meeting in which the defense lawyers urge prosecutors not to seek an indictment or to seek reduced charges comes towards the end of that investigation. People familiar with the matter said Weiss nearing the end of his decision making process. OK, they cautioned the probe has taken longer than some officials thought it would and that law enforcement officials have been frustrated. What do you think, Buck? This would have obviously very significant impact on Joe Biden's recently announced presidential campaign. What I have been saying, I think for over a year now, maybe even a couple of years, is that I expect that there will be some form of charges brought here. Now, this obviously would be unprecedented for a sitting president's son to be facing felony charges. It would also significantly add a monstrous amount of attention and also legitimacy to Republican arguments, which I think are very legitimate, that the Biden crime family has been involved in many different crimes. So, Buck, how do you analyze this Washington Post story that just came out? Anybody who understands just as a as a way, I think of prefaceing the whole discussion that we're getting into now about what's going to happen. And then understands the purpose of a special counsel, why special counsels even exist should first be reminded that this is why a special counsel exists, by the way, this is one where there has not been the appointment of a special counsel. But when you have the sitting president's son, yeah, under possible federal indictment, that is why because the idea is quite obviously you can't trust the White House, which oversees the Department of Justice to right now, what do we have like? We have Merrick Garland, Biden employees, word that he will allow this to proceed without any political interference or pressure whatsoever. Does anybody believe that it's already taken longer than anyone thought it four years? Right. So that is suspicious to begin with, there should have been a special counsel appointed. There has not that decision was political. Just wanted to start with that. Where this goes. I've been saying since we've been talking about this, they will do some sort of absolute bare minimum, no jail time, no, probably if they can get away with it, no felony, deferred prosecution, pay a fine admit to some very low level financial, which could be what that meeting that they're the Washington Post is reporting about is involving the negotiations about what exactly might transpire there will not be a trial. But see, this is where it gets really interesting. We don't know what happens in that room and what kind of offers are being discussed right now. We'll find out what comes out of it eventually. I think we all know it's going to be a sweetheart deal for a hunter Biden almost almost certainly. When you're talking about millions of dollars of on I mean, there are a lot of accountants. I'm sure who listened to this. And I would just put this out there all of you if any want to call in and tell us if I'm off base here, if you have an if you are an accountant, you have a client who says, look, I may have set up a bunch of LLCs. And I may have gotten millions of dollars of payments from foreign foreign government intermediaries that I just didn't declare any taxes on for a number of years and then used to pay a whole bunch of expenses. The count is probably a heart attack, right? Not declaring income from any source, but from foreign sources to the tune of millions and millions of dollars. That's what people go to prison for. Just got to talk to Wesley Snipes, by the way, right? That's what people for those who are always a big Wesley Snipes fan back in the day, Major League blade. And he went away for, I think it was three or four. You have to be super rich, first of all, to even be able to owe millions of dollars in back taxes, right? Most people, even if they didn't pay their taxes for years and years and years would never be able to accrue a tax bill like this. You're usually in a in a tax issue. There's the, well, I thought and Mike, and that's real, by the way, because the tax code is so opaque and thousands and thousands of pages. But it's, well, I thought I could do this or I wrote off that and maybe, but if you're just like, I didn't make this money and I'm not paying taxes on it, that's about as bright red letter violation as you're as you're going to find. And so I think that you're going to be able to do that. And you're going to see a, a pretty obviously sweetheart deal for Hunter Biden, but I would just say this clay as long as here's how I see it playing out. Even even up to let's say there's something a little bit more serious, let's say he pleads to a felony, but there's no jail time, which is that would that would be a little bit more than what I would anticipate. But he pleads to felonies, but no prison time as part of the deal. That's the thing. He'll pay some massive fine. Even in that situation, the firewall they have is the hunter to Joe Biden, the president's connection. The letting Hunter Biden twists in the wind a little bit here if it comes to that becomes for the media. And you know how they're going to do this. They're going to say, Oh, it's just he struggles with addiction and Hunter is only, you know, surviving son and Joe just loves his son so much. They will turn this into a sympathy point for Joe Biden that the wayward son that remains are the Biden. Now I'm saying what the media narrative around this will be. But I think that'll be reasonably effective until you get money from Hunter to Joe until you can show the crime family in operation. And by the way, they'll do everything to fight that from coming out. I think they turn this into a sympathy play for Joe Biden, no matter what the outcome of the trial is. So I think they're going to have to bring charges. I have just, you know, I've got the Marco Polo report buck for people out there who know what I'm talking about. This is like a, you know, 600 page investigation that somebody published and you can flip through it. And you can see all the detailed crimes. I actually think that if they bring charges, which I believe they will, this could be the beginning of a monstrous collapse for Joe Biden. And let me just let me just lay out the possibility here. So first of all, as soon as there are charges brought any argument of, oh, that laptop is fake is out the window, right? I mean, it is, it is out the window. And so Secretary of State Blinken for instance, and everyone else who helped to spread the lie that this laptop was not actually real. They're on the clock too. I also think it emboldens and enforces reinforces perhaps all of the other potential criminal entanglements involving the Biden family. Because once you find one little tendril of truth and you keep pulling it, it gets harder and harder to deny. And I just think that Hunter is the lynch pin here because if they charge him, first of all, it would take a year, right? I mean, we know these cases don't move rapidly. Now your point, if he pled down to a charge and this thing, they tried to just put it away. I actually think that's the smartest play for the Bidens is he admits to some illegal, illegal behavior and it just vanishes. If he doesn't do that, it puts his dad really on the clock because do you think that Hunter would get a, would get a pardon from his dad? I kind of think you would. And then we get into that really politically toxic idea of giving that. And I think I, I think that reelected he could do it. Yeah, but, but there's, that puts so much more faith in the system's willingness to uphold the rule of law without politics. Remember, remember my theory though, that if you charge Hunter, even if it's a low level of offense, it allows you to charge Trump because I think this has been my big argument for a while. Merrick Garland wants to be able to say when he charges Trump, we're applying the law without favor. This is whether it's the president's son or the former president of the United States. No one is above the law. If they charge Hunter with relatively low level offenses, which aren't that significant, it opens the door to, I think, high level charges against Trump. But I think that's, that's really significant, right? When you're saying they're bringing charges, they could bring charges that could send him to prison for years. Or they could agree to a plea deal where he just pays additional fines and admits some level of financial and propriety. To me, the second one is still a sweep away and they say, okay, we're all done here and it doesn't even factor into it. Well, it allows them to then claim that nobody's getting preferential. Right. But we, but I don't know how much we care. Well, maybe they're trying to play to the independence, right? We know, we know there is preferential. So this is why. So there, this is a little bit like when they were running the, you know, the January 6th Liz Cheney specials. We're sitting here saying, you know, who cares about this stuff? Well, they were going after 1%. It was going, it absolutely worked. And it's very frustrating. And, you know, a lot of us felt like, how could 2022 have gone that way? They were playing a very, a very dirty, but very effective game in how they presented what was going on in the country. Look, it's a whole different situation now with Donald Trump's already been indicted, right? To bring the first indictment being a federal conspiracy to commit sedition. He's going to be charged with, in my opinion, with the election fraud effort in Atlanta, Georgia this summer. Yep. Because why not? Right? I mean, if you're, if you're a Willis, I keep forgetting. I think it's a Will's or Will's. Thank you. If you're that prosecutor, what's the downside of bringing that kid? There's zero. Yes. Yes. Zero. Are you kidding me? You're going to get a million dollars. The next deal. Democrat also statewide elected official. Probably a run for governor, right? And you become a hero to the, to the Democrat part, or you know, run for some statewide office. So there's no downside to it. It is interesting that I think the, in the, in the proud boys trial, I saw a Julie Kelly updating on this. They haven't yet gotten a definitive on whether seditious conspiracy is going to go through a bunch of charges are going to go through. And those guys are facing a long time in prison. But they really want to get us a discious conspiracy charge on the record because then it's kind of like the mafia. There's the mafia, you know, soldiers and then there's the mafia boss and their whole story at the Merrick Garland level is going to be Donald Trump is the mafia boss and, you know, told everybody to do everything on January 6. So I think you're seeing multiple multiple charges coming against Donald Trump. And now that he's so far out ahead, I think it makes it even more likely that that all this is going to happen. Right? This is the way they're going to put on the Hunter Biden. But on the Hunter Biden issue. So you're on the right. You don't think that there's going to be any charges brought? Where would you be now? I've been saying all along. They're going to, it's going to be little, it's going to be like the equivalent of parking ticket stuff. So, which you think they'll just defer like the, they're going to do. They're going to do a look, they're going to say, there's going to be a headline that'll say, charges against Hunter Biden. This is what I thought all along. And then it'll come out that in the plea agreement, it's, he's going to pay a $500,000 fine. He's going to lose, you know, his legal license or, is he a lawyer? I think he is a lawyer. I don't know. He still has a license. Which is amazing. Yeah. I want to see his client. He went to Yale Law School. I think I know. Isn't that a phenomenal, phenomenal, how the school is taken? I believe he's in a legal school grad. Yeah. I think I think one of the Cuomo's went to Yale Law School too. Anyway, it's a fascinating to see how that plays out. But he's going to pay a fine deferred prosecution, prosecution, no prison time. And then Garland and everybody says, they say what you're saying, which is, see, you know, you're saying, you're going to pay a $500,000, you're going to pay a $500,000, you're going to pay a $500,000, you're going to pay a $500,000, you're going to pay a $500,000, you're going to pay a $500,000, you're going to pay a $500, you think that only you, I think that the American Illinois who doesn't have a job at it can't even start getting out of there or go to school because you have it can't actually handle that for fighting, right? You. I don't think it, it is a big good budget to think about. You know, Tesla does not have that. They have that the gold on the whatever. Well, I thinkliberty, but not a business total for me. I goNew York. And again, let you know how Caribou\u0101 is judgment Coup He has suffered family tragedy in the past as well. No, several family tragedies. But he has leveraged that politically in ways that have been- His entire political career. His whole career. He's lied about, so he lied about how his first wife died. He got sworn into office in his kids, in his kids hospital room with photographers present. I'm telling you this. This is my concern is that this becomes, oh, the drug addicted son of Joe Biden. He's such a good guy. Grandpa Joe stands beside Hunter, and it may not work out the way that some people would anticipate politically. Well, let's also- We gotta come back. And we also got some audio because Hunter's actually in court right now over this illegitimate child that he had in Arkansas with a stripper, and we got some audio. Also known as, you know, President Joe Biden's grandchild. That's right. This is a statement of fact. I don't know why he would disown. It's not the grandchild's fault.

We're really enjoying it. And we're going to be taking your calls later on this hour, 802.82, 2.82. How do you think the Hunter Biden situation plays out now? Are there? Again, I think Clay, the big separation is, is there a possibility of prison, because I don't think it takes a plea deal necessarily if there's real prison time attached, but it's a tax issue unless they go for the money laundering stuff, which they could, but they won't. So that's usually not prison time if there's a plea deal involved. So, do they just sweep it away? We'll get back into this in a second. And then also Clay has updates on hundreds in court having nothing to do with tax evasion. Interestingly, claiming that he can't afford to pay child support for his stripper baby mama, illegitimate child that Joe Biden refuses to acknowledge. Can you imagine if one of the Trump kids had had an illegitimate child with a stripper in Arkansas? How much more attention that would get? Cell phone service becoming increasingly important. Do you need it to work well everywhere you are? If your cell phone service provider's peer talk, you've got 5G nationwide service covering 99% of the nation. Every bit is good as the service you might get from Verizon, T-Mobile or AT&T, much more cost efficient, because peer talk uses the same towers and the network, same network, just a lot cheaper. $30 a month price includes unlimited talk text, plenty of fast data when you switch to peer talk, you'll learn just how aligned the company's values are with your own, because their CEO is a US veteran. Pure talk cares about supporting veterans and our military. And when you become a pure talk customer, you have an option to support America's Warrior partnership to help prevent veteran suicide. Here's how you do it. It takes very little time. Dial pound 250, say Clay and Buck, say 50% off your first month. That's dial pound 250, say Clay and Buck, start saving now. Welcome back in Clay, Travis, Buck Sexton Show. We're gonna dive into this story here in the next hour to a large extent, because we're also talking to Governor Stitt of Oklahoma about a trans bill that was signed in the state of Oklahoma, but the Nashville Police Department, and we are doing the show today from Nashville, I wanna give you guys an update. They put out a tweet saying that they will not be releasing the Nashville transgender manifesto statement. And again, I'll only read that. And then I also wanna go back into this Hunter Biden mess. Due to pending litigation filed this week, the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department has been advised by council to hold in a band's, the release of records related to the shooting at the Covenant School Pending Orders or Direction of the courts. That's cover up. That's out. It sounds like too many of you, I'm sure, a cover up of the motives for this trans shooter who killed six innocent people in the city that we are doing the show from today. So we're gonna get into that in a big way in the second hour, but big picture, national political discussion, Washington Post reports charging decision near. Remember the Washington Post buck prior to this was interesting. FBI agents saying that they were frustrated because they had all the evidence of the crime that they had turned over to the Department of Justice and there had yet to be charged as filed. Remember that the FBI took possession of this Hunter Biden laptop in December of 2019. So we are dealing several years that they've had this laptop and known it was real. Now, there are complicating factors because Hunter's life is such a mess. He now has a illegitimate child with a stripper in Arkansas and there is court hearings over his failure to pay child abuse that has been going on this week. Karine Jean Pierre was child support. Child support, what did I say? Child abuse. Oh, sorry. Yeah, child support. There is right now Karine Jean Pierre is in was asked about this yesterday and this was her response. I wanted to ask about the child by not an Arkansas with Hunter Biden and the child support of the president and personally monitoring that and how come they haven't acknowledged the seventh grandchild? I'm not going to speak to that from here. Wow. Go ahead. Okay. So they are dodging this story. They won't even acknowledge the seventh grandchild but the Hunter mess is leading, I think, to some openings into larger Biden family dynamics. I think it's really dishonorable for grandpa Joe to blame the child is completely blameless. Yes. This is the baby. It's his grandchild as much as grandchild as any other grandchild. Why is why would anyone think that this is acceptable for the White House to go through this pretense that somehow this doesn't count in the Biden lineage? I mean, you know, you look at Hunter Biden, you look at the mess that he's made of his life. That's one thing. But I think that there's something really dishonorable about the way Joe Biden himself. Although it's so easy to deal with this too. Just be like, oh, it's my grandchild. I'll go visit at some point too. But he won't and I think it's because they don't really know how to deal with the connection that Hunter Biden creates to Joe Biden is itself a problem for them. So I think they just always want to limit the amount of media attention that anything Hunter is getting. And they certainly don't want to add new stories into the mix because public attention demands more accountability and more accountability means looking into. So what exactly was Hunter Biden doing? And what was 10% for the big, you know, it goes back into the 10% for the big guy, the laptop stuff and everything else. So they're just hoping to ignore this stuff as much as they possibly can. But I think it shows you who Joe Biden and the leaders, I've always said, everyone knows Joe Biden's not very smart. The biggest lie about Joe Biden and you go back and see what he says, you see how he's operated in his career is that he's a really nice guy. He's actually not a really nice guy. That's very apparent. I would also point this out. If Hunter Biden had any good advisors or anyone who was actually trying to steer him in an intelligent way, he wouldn't have been selling portraits or paintings, whatever you want to say for hundreds of thousands of dollars. I think half a million dollars. Hunter's finger paintings must be really amazing. Clay, he's really captured that Van Gogh aesthetic. But where is his money going that he's not able to pay this child support? And look, I think it's interesting that someone, I know we actually have a caller who called in to ask, how could they find Hunter Biden if he can't even pay child support? First of all, child support stuff. There's a whole other discussion we had here for the way Family Court works and the back and forth and the way it's tilted actually against men in a very negative way. That's I think legally very dubious. But beyond that, there's a wrangling that goes on about how much child support, what can you do? But if Hunter had to pay a fine, let's say, for his tax issues, I think you would just see a Democrat donor just give him the money. I think people would just step in to help him as long as he keeps quiet and does what he's told to do from here on out. You have to be careful there because remember, my understanding is that he's already had a Democrat donor pay off much of his tax bill. Yes, right. That's that, yes. And so how does he not have the money to pay child support? And I'm not an expert in family law. I'm not an, well, and that could be an argument as well. I'm not an expert in family law, but it's not that complicated typically to figure out child support. There is a formula in which it is plugged in and Joe and Bethlehem, Pennsylvania is asking this question. My point on it, Buck, is if you were giving Hunter Biden good advice, my number one advice would be, hey, don't go to court with your baby mama in Arkansas because you're refusing to pay child support. Even if you're trying to argue the child supports too much in the grand scheme of things, whatever he's having to pay for this child, one, he should have to pay for it because it's his child's been established. But two, the amount of attention that this draws on you in general is not favorable at all. And it also then to me draws even more attention to your other criminal related activities. Right, but you have to also remember in the background of all this, and it's not about how our people listen to this show will understand these things, right? It's about how this gets processed by the big media out there that's Democrat aligned in an election year. Right now there's a trial for Donald Trump for rape. So what they're gonna say, right, that is what is going on here in the city. That's going on right now in New York City. So what they're gonna say is, okay, so Hunter's a mess, whatever. Look what Joe Biden's done. Joe Biden stands by his family. I'm just saying there's a narrative creation here that they're going to do on the one hand, minimizing everything about the Biden crime family possible. And we should just be prepared for this. The dishonesty, and look at the Hunter Biden laptop thing. They will lie in the most place. So 100% real and anyone who has looked at any of it from the moment we saw it. And on the other side, the Trump side of this, I've been saying it and I think that people, you know, cause we all people who certainly support Trump see this for what it is, but their plan is to get a New York jury to say, yeah, based on our preponderance of the evidence, we think Donald Trump raped this woman 30 some odd years ago based on no evidence of any kind that I wear her story. Other than she says this happened. She's got a couple of people that she told that it allegedly happened. That's the entire case so far as I can see from her evidence perspective. But then it becomes every time, you know, there's a round table on like, you know, one of these Sunday shows and every time he's going to the general election and we say, Hey, the Hunter Biden thing, he just got the child out of wedlock attacks issues, the Biden crime family, Joe is getting kickbacks and all this. So what I want to mess all this is, they're just going to shout, Donald Trump is a rapist. And that's supposed to be their counter to be fair. There's a pretty credible argument that Joe Biden also committed sexual assault, except he did it on a staff member while she was employed for him. And that story basically has been. By the way, that's a very important point to add into this discussion. The Joe Biden sexual assault story is just based on the stories, entirely credible, entirely reasonable. And the, and it's just a, you know, they, they, they liked Joe Biden. So they believe him when he says he didn't do it. It was a staffer, she had constant access to him. They spent a lot of time together. There's no quite the facts about their basic relationship are not in dispute. It's just, he says that this thing never happened with her given Joe Biden's behavior, by the way, around all the people in general with the sniffing and everything else clearly had weird habits. That's not the same thing as sexually assaulting somebody, but it is indicative of a guy who doesn't really understand boundaries with Donald Trump, you look back and you say, okay, what exactly is the basis for this? And we played the audio of E.J. and Carol saying on, on a, she thought rape was sexy. Yeah, I was trying to remember it was an interesting Cooper show. So I'm just, I'm just trying to, trying to put out right now so we can all get ready for it. How they're going to try to spin this stuff and how they're going to play it. I just, look, I don't think the hundred Biden stuff, no matter how bad it gets, unless they have illegal money going from Hunter Biden, which by the way, I'm not, I think this exists out there. I just don't know, you know, it's alleged unproven. Unless they get money from Hunter, from China, going into a bank account that Joe Biden, and even then they'll just say it's, you know, a deep fake or something else, but that, you know, I don't think that the Hunter Biden thing takes down the Biden reelection. I think, I think it could buck. I think, I hope your, I hope your, by the way, Joe in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, what you got for us? Is he still there? Well, we got to Joe's question and we kind of, yeah, Joe, was there anything else you wanted to add? I, I shouted out your name. So I figure we might as well let you also weigh in here for a few seconds. Oh, he's gone. Okay. All right. Well, we took Joe's question. Joe, I appreciate a Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. If, if everything starts to fall apart for Joe Biden, this is the time it has to happen. It has to happen right now. Just for the timeline because they don't want this to happen next year buck when Kamala has to be the nominee. If they were going to order a hit, this would be, by next year they go into full on laptop denialism, whatever they have to, they'll say anything. Yes. They will say the sky is, you know, neon purple, if they have, it does not matter. The code red has to happen right now. Just want to put it out there, the timeline.

Geek out with the guys on the Sunday Hang with Clay and Buck Podcast, a new episode every Sunday. Find it on the iHeart app or wherever you get your podcast. Welcome back to Clay and Buck. Just wanna remind you, we're gonna be talking to Governor Kevin Stitt of Oklahoma in just a few minutes about a bill that he signed that is gonna protect children from the transgender surgeries and gender mutilation processes in the state of Oklahoma. Democrats is continuing to push for the opposite in their states and this bill, by the way, would hold doctors accountable. He'll give you the full rundown on it. I think it's really important. There was also yesterday in Texas, a protest slash occupy shrieking activist group that gathered in Austin, the state capital of Austin, Texas about this. So we'll come back into that in just a few minutes, talk to the Governor of Oklahoma about it also. When we talked yesterday about the shutdown of the Whole Foods in San Francisco, Clay mentioned this at the top. I do wanna get to this in the second hour of the program with all of you. There are two Nordstrom stores, or I should say there were Nordstrom, kind of fancy department store, if you wanna buy the husband or the wife at expensive sweater or pair of shoes or something, you go to Nordstrom, shutting them down because they just can't, the theft is so out of control. And in addition to the theft, the employees are under siege and are under threat. I mean, this is an arctic third world stuff. I mean, this is what you would expect to be going on in the midst of some country where the police are a joke. It's amazing, it's happening. I just really wonder, we were talking about this a little bit last night at dinner buck. I really wonder when San Francisco residents, because I believe in the most recent election, 7% of San Franciscans voted Republican. And 100% of them probably lied to their friends about it. Yeah. So we're talking about a city that is more left-wing than almost any city in America. They can't blame anyone other than themselves. And when you're out there and you can't even keep a Nordstrom or a Whole Foods, or like we've talked about, every single product is under lock and key. So if you want to, you suddenly realize you need toothpaste and you've got to run out to a Walgreens or a CVS or whatever it is, and you have to request them to unlock the barricade, basically, so you can get toothpaste. What do they say to themselves? I mean, I worked for the intelligence division of the NYPD for 18 months on our rotation from the federal government. And if you gave me 18 months as the mayor of San Francisco and let me pick the police commissioner, let me set police policy and let me pick the prosecutors there, I could clean San Francisco up in it. You could too. That's what Rudy Giuliani basically did, right? You just have to have the mandate from the people and the will to do what is necessary. This is not complicated. You clean it up, you enforce the law, you have people be accountable for the stuff that they do. But I also wanted to get to this Clay because we talked yesterday a bit about the border. We're gonna get into the border a lot more next week. We're gonna have Steven Miller on who was Trump's top border advisor. It's just a very sharp square-to-way guy, friend of the show. And we're gonna have Julio Rosas, who's gonna be down at the border for the expiration of Title 42. Did you see Cree Jean-Pierre, which he said? Yes, 90% decline. Can we play clip one, so everyone hears? Does the Biden administration live in a truly alternate reality on a range of issues, but specifically on the Southern border, it's like the one. He has tools that he's used to make sure that we do this. We actually deal with the immigration system in a humane way, in a way that actually deals with what we're seeing at the border. And that's why you've seen the parolee program be so successful. It has, when it comes to illegal migration, you've seen it come down by more than 90%. And that's because of the actions that this president has taken. I mean, this is, I saw recently there's a clip going on out of Jordan Peterson, where he talks about the different kinds of lies and talks about anti-truth. Anti-truth being the exact furthest opposite of the truth, right? Not just a lie of omission or anything else. This is anti-truth from the Biden administration that the border is down 90% is the opposite of reality. It's gonna be impossible to defend. And I think it's gonna be the number one story, even on MSNBC and CNN. That's how bad it's going to be next week when Title 42 is officially removed. There are already tens of thousands of people that are preparing to come across the border. You know this buck, the amount of sharing that's going to go on throughout Latin America of, hey, the United States border is officially open now. It's already spreading like crazy throughout those countries, the number of people that are walking. This is always the time when the travel is easier. This is gonna be an unmitigated disaster for Joe Biden next week. And even MSNBC is gonna have to cover it. They're going to lie to you about what has been happening and what is happening. They're gonna pretend that they are bothered by the massive influx of illegals that they have encouraged for two years, but we will tell you the truth and we will get the word out. And we'll talk to Governor Stidt of Oklahoma in just a moment."
