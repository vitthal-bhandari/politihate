MUSIC On this episode of Newt's World, Queen Elizabeth II passed away on Thursday, September 8, surrounded by her family at her summer home, Valmarle in Scotland. She was 96 years old and had been Queen for 70 years, longer than any other sovereign in the history of the United Kingdom. Prime Minister Liz Truss was just photographed with the Queen at Valmarle two days before her death, a poignant moment when the Queen welcomed the third female Prime Minister in British history and the 15th Prime Minister received by the Queen. Before the Queen's passing, I originally want to talk about Prime Minister Liz Truss and the economic crisis the United Kingdom is facing. But now we're going to talk both about the Queen and about the new Prime Minister. And to do that, I am really pleased to welcome my guest, Niall Gardner. He is the Director of the Margaret Thatcher Center for Freedom and Bernard and Barbara Lomas fellow at the Heritage Foundation. Prior to joining Heritage in 2002, he was the foreign policy researcher, performer of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. He served as an aide to Lady Thatcher from 2000 to 2002 and advised her on a number of international policy issues. He's also, I have to say, an old friend who we go back almost two decades in trying to pursue conservative ideas. Now, welcome and thank you for joining me on Newsworld. It's a great pleasure to be here. Thank you very much. You know, yesterday we heard the sad news of the death of Queen Elizabeth II. She died on Thursday at the age of 96. Her reign for 70 years and seven months, starting on February the 6th, 1952, made her the longest reigning British monarch in history. And I must say, I think she became beloved all around the world. There were some amazing photos of her released yesterday as a young queen with Prime Minister Winston Churchill and as a frail queen, meeting the new Prime Minister Liz Truss for the first time. It's extraordinary how much she lived through and witnessed in her 70 years on the throne. Let me start and ask you your own thoughts and your memories having worked with Lady Thatcher, knowing of her close relationship with the Queen. What's your feeling about what we're now experiencing with Queen Elizabeth? Well, thank you very much for having on today's show at such a historic moment course for the United Kingdom for the British people. And this has been an immensely sad time, of course, for the British people that passing away of Queen Elizabeth II. This is the end of the second Elizabethan era and the Queen really, such a huge presence in the hearts and minds of the British people over the course of seven decades. It's almost impossible to imagine a world without the Queen. In fact, it's hard myself to really imagine such a world because the Queen has been such a huge figure, really, and she will be tremendously missed and had the opportunity to meet the Queen. Actually, it's Lady Thatcher's 80th birthday party in London. And I remember a Lady of Tremendous, warmth, charm, wit. And of course, needless to say, Tremendous, dedication and selflessness. And I think that's what the Queen really embodied, this sense of service to the British people, this sense of duty, dedication, over the course of an incredible 70 years. You have to go back to 1952 to the premiership of Winston Churchill for the beginning of the reign of Queen Elizabeth II. And it is just staggering to think about just the scale of her reign, longer even than that of Queen Victoria. And beginning in the 1950s, really, if the British Empire was beginning to end, in fact, India had already gained its independence in 1947, but the rest of the Empire was to end really in the 50s and 60s. So stretching from the end of empire through until today, the Brexit era of the 2020s. And this is the time span for Queen Elizabeth II. So someone who, in my view, really was the leader of the free world for seven decades. She not only, I think, touched the hearts and minds of the British people, but also the American people as well. Queen is an immensely popular figure here in the United States. And Gallup polling, actually, emphatically proves that. And Gallup has polled the Queen's popularity over the course of many decades. And consistently, she's polled around 70 plus percent support among Americans, which is far higher than most U.S. presidents get. So the Queen, her passing is the end of an era, really. And we have a new king now, King Charles III. But it's a different chapter for the royal family. And it is, frankly, it's heartbreaking, of course, to see the Queen passing away. And also at the same time, unimaginable to think of a world without her. But that's where we are now, Anude. You mentioned that she was in many ways a large figure, but she was actually a tiny large figure. Yes, exactly. Physically very slight and stature. And very beautiful as the young lady, when she first became queen. I remember Kristin and I were in Singapore a few years ago and went to Raffles, the famous hotel in Pahr. And when she visited Singapore, she had stayed at Raffles. And they showed us the room that had been set aside and never used again, that she supposedly stayed in. But they pointed out that actually, because of her size, she swapped with her maid. And she stayed in the smaller bedroom, just off the main big bedroom, while the maid stayed in the big bedroom, because the queen was more comfortable in the smaller room. The remarkable story. I just thought it was an interesting story about the degree to which she was at one level very practical. Yes, and also very humble as well, actually, and you know that that story amply illustrates that. Now, I have to ask you, Kristin, I were very fortunate to have an opportunity to meet Prince Charles. And I am curious, because he was very pleasant, very positive. What kind of king do you think he will be? That's a great question. In fact, I was just watching the news footage from London of the king arriving at Buckingham Palace, having just traveled from Balmoral in Scotland. And upon his arrival, there was a huge crowd of people gathered outside Buckingham Palace, thousands of people. And the king, upon disembarking from his car, proceeded to go on a walkabout. In front of Buckingham Palace, shaking the hands of dozens upon dozens of people. Now, I was very surprised, actually, on two fronts. Firstly, the security aspect must have made his mind as very nervous, I think. And I'm not sure whether this was planned to walk about, or not, but he simply went out and greeted hundreds upon hundreds of people shaking their hands. And secondly, I was struck by the spontaneity here, because King Charles III is not known as a sort of spontaneous person. He's not necessarily known as a particularly sort of warm figure. And certainly, the British public have not necessarily warmed Charles over the course of many, many decades. I think this new beginning, of course, for Britain, and also for the king himself. And I think what I saw today was very impressive, actually. He was in mom's shadow for his entire life. Very important factor. I think that with King Charles III, he is going to be leading the monarchy at a critically important time, because after 70 years of the Queen on the throne, and that stability in place, and the massive presence of the Queen, to now have a new king generates a little bit of uncertainty, actually. And I think that many will be concerned about the monarchy being weakened under Charles. So I hope that Charles will rise to the occasion that he will be a leader of significant strength and fortitude. Although at the same time, he must be wary of getting involved in political matters, as he has done in the past, as Prince Charles. And as the sovereign as a monarch, he has to remain completely outside of the political fray. And this will be a challenge for Charles, who has been very outspoken on environmental issues, immigration matters. In fact, he's been condemned on a number of occasions in the past by especially conservative MPs who have not been happy with his political intervention. So it's vital for the monarchy that it does not engage any kind of political talk discussion, because that would undermine fundamentally the monarchy. And Charles's reign will be incredibly important, because there will be those on the left who will try to tear down the monarchy. With the Queen departing the stage, there are the socialist elements who don't like the monarchy, who want to take it down. Also, there are campaigns in parts of the world where the Queen is still head of state, and one thinks of plays like Australia, New Zealand, Canada, and Brazil. There are campaigns to remove the king or queen as head of state for this country. So this is a precarious moment for the monarchy, and an vitally important one. And I hope that Prince Charles will be a strong and robust leader who will really ensure the long-term continuation of the monarchy as such a vital institution for the British people. I think he can do this, actually. But there will be a lot of skeptics out there who do not like King Charles, and they will contrast Charles's personality with the hugely popular personality of the Queen. So this is going to be challenging a few months and years ahead. Two thoughts about that, though. One is, if I remember correctly, at least the popular imagery is that she came very close to endangering the affection for the monarchy right after Diana's death. There was a fair amount of conversation with then Prime Minister Blair to make sure that she was seen as sufficiently engaged and sufficiently concerned. I don't know if that's a mythology, but certainly that's been at least the popular media version. There's actually a lot of truth in that. And of course, there's been a lot of media portrayal of this and also Hollywood portrayal as well, but the Queen, which was a very successful film in the mid-2000s, actually, with Helen Mirren playing the Queen. And I think the Queen face a tremendous challenge, actually, following the death of Princess Diana. And the monarchy really was under threat at that time. I mean, Diana was a mentally popular figure. And her very untimely tragic death actually prompted a lot of attacks on the monarchy. And the Queen herself was criticized. And the Queen basically embarked on, I would say, a slightly different approach in an effort to reach out to those who were critical of the monarchy. And I think the Queen was very, very successful in doing so. And actually, the film, The Queen, I think, quite effectively shows this in many respects. I think it's quite accurate. And the Queen really made a concerted effort, I think, to enhance the wider popularity of the monarchy among the British people. And she succeeded in doing so after an incredibly tragic moment with Princess Diana's death. We were very fortunate. Kristin and I were on Broadway for Helen Mirren. And I think it was called The Appointment, where they started with Churchill and showed you each prime minister who had met with her at that time, which I think was up to about number 11 or so. And of course, Helen Mirren's an amazing actress. But it also gave you a sense of the scale of the Queen's relationships and her knowledge. I had an opportunity once to chat with Tony Blair about it. And he said, every time he went out to meet with her, which was a weekly event, he found himself learning. Because she could give him advice from Churchill, or she could give him advice from Wilson. I mean, she had been through so much that clearly, she was his mentor in private. And that he found it to be remarkably powerful. Yeah, that's a great story. Tony Blair actually was a very staunch monarchist as prime minister. And he was determined as prime minister, I think, to basically enhance the overall popularity of the monarchy with British people. So I think Blair played a big part in that. And Blair certainly had his political faults on most multiple other fronts. But I think he was somebody who firmly believed in the greatness of the British monarchy and the tremendous importance of it for the British people. You know, you're coming about now, King Choy. I guess he's not technically king yet. Does he doesn't have to be coronated? Or does he become king automatically? Yeah, this is an interesting point, because there's been lots of speculation on this. He is actually already, I believe, King Charles III. But there will be an official coronation, of course, to the official sealer. But he is already carrying the title King Charles III. I was not surprised by his ability to reach out to people. Kristin and I, when she was the ambassador to the Vatican, we had the opportunity at the canonization of John Henry Newman as a British saint. And Charles was there. And afterwards we went to a reception with him. He was remarkably relaxed and affable. And chatted personally with every person, reminding me of some time we had met when I was speaker. Both Clist and I were just really abreasted. Whatever his public image at the time, in person he was a much more charming and engaging person. Yeah, and I think that's an excellent pointer. Yes.

From your perspective, in contrast to the Hollywood version, what did you sense was Lady Thatcher's relationship with the Queen? I'm glad you asked that because I did actually watch the latest season of the crown, in fact, in fall twice. Not least because it was asked to deliver some media commentary and analysis of it. And so I watched every episode of the show. I watched every episode very, very closely, especially all the scenes involving Lady Thatcher. Now, I have to say that with the crown, some things they get right, some things they get badly wrong, and maybe some of that's deliberate because they would simply want to create good television or good theatre here. And the crown does depict the relationship between Margaret Thatcher and the Queen as tents. And as the two leaders is very divided, now my understanding is very different. Having worked closely with Lady Thatcher at a later stage, I was able to gain a lot of insight into her thinking with regard to the Queen and the monarchy. My understanding is that Lady Thatcher had a far closer partnership with the Queen than what you see in the crown, for example, where there's a lot of division that's showing there. And it was a very similar relationship between Margaret Thatcher and the Queen. And there's a lot of division that's showing there. And in fact, Lady Thatcher always had huge admiration for the Queen. And I think that the Queen had a great deal of respect for Margaret Thatcher as the first woman prime minister. They were the two most powerful woman in the world in the 1980s. And they were alongside Ronald Reagan, the leaders of the free world, really. And so sometimes, undoubtedly, there were disagreements between the two. There may be some disagreements over the issue of sanctions against San Africa, for example. But in terms of the big picture, they were very, very closely tied. I know that Lady Thatcher placed great weight upon the advice that the Queen always gave her. And the Queen, I think, was always very keen to hear what Lady Thatcher had to say. And it should be noted that Prince Philip, of course, the husband of the Queen, was a huge admirer of Margaret Thatcher. He was a real Thatcherite. And so I think Prince Philip's view probably carried a lot of weight in the royal household. But I was struck by also a couple of things. Firstly, that the Queen attended Lady Thatcher's 80th birthday celebration, which I think was back in 2005. So it was held at the Mandarin Oriental. The Queen hardly ever attended birthday celebrations of politicians. It was very, very rare, extremely rare. But the Queen made a point of attending that celebration. And I just simply remember having a conversation with her and how she swept in in magisterial fashion into the Mandarin Oriental hotel. And so the Queen made a big exception of Margaret Thatcher. Secondly, of course, the Queen tended the funeral of Lady Thatcher. And again, the Queen rarely attended funeral of the politicians. You know, I think it would be fascinating for Americans to understand it's obvious how the Prime Minister has power. And how does somebody like Queen Elizabeth who's very sophisticated? And by that stage, had been Queen for a long time. How does she exert leadership and power? That's a great question because the monarchy does not engage in political matters or party politics. But the Queen throughout Iran was hugely important as a symbol of British leadership. And her role in terms of advancing the US-UK special relationship, I think, was very important because she constantly engaged with Ronald Reagan. And her friendship with Reagan actually was very close. Just as Margaret Thatcher's partnership with Reagan was extremely powerful. I think the friendship between the Queen and Ronald Reagan was so important, I think, on so many levels as illustration of the strength of the ties that bind the United States and the United Kingdom that the beating heart of the free world in so many respects. And so the Queen really has the symbol of that, that's the embodiment of the special relationship. I think that was very important on so many levels, actually. And also sent a message as well to the Russians and to the Soviet Union that the United States, the United Kingdom, really together united leading the free world and absolutely shoulder to shoulder, really, in confronting the might of the then Soviet Empire. So the Queen was a very important figure, I think, in terms of the special relationship. I may be wrong, but wasn't that the first Prime Minister of Funeral since Churchill? Yes, I believe that's the case, yeah. We were at that funeral. It was very striking to have the royal family show up. Absolutely, Newton. In fact, I was also there at the funeral, and I think I saw you there at the funeral in St. Paul's. And the Queen's presence was absolutely so powerful at that the funeral. It was a mark of the huge respect that she had for Margaret Thatcher. I didn't think there was any Prime Minister who gained more, you know, I think tremendous respect or admiration for the Queen than Margaret Thatcher really. So Churchill and Margaret Thatcher were, I think, the two Prime Ministers that she really saw as the most consequential and important of her reign. I mean, you had a unique position because you actually helped Lady Thatcher write statecraft. And by the way, Henry Kissinger has a new book out on leadership, which has a really powerful chapter on Lady Thatcher and her strategies and how she operated. What was it like to be able to work close to her? I was with her on occasion in the 80s and 90s, and our mutual friend, Gay Gaines, was very, very close to her. And I always learned a lot from Thatcher whenever she would show up somewhere. But what was it like for you to work with her on a regular basis? Yeah, thank you very much for asking that question. And as you mentioned, I had the chance to assist Lady Thatcher with her final book, Statecraft, which was published in 2002. And so I worked for Lady Thatcher in a private office from 2002 to 2002, really the final years of her public life when she was still very active, giving big speeches. She was travelling a lot. She was hosting a lot of, you know, a lot of politicians, and she was working on her last book, which became actually the Genesis of Brexit. In fact, in Statecraft, she called on the United Kingdom to renegotiate its, or renegotiate its relation with the European Union, and she said Britain should leave if it didn't get what it wanted, which is exactly what happened. So she was always decades ahead of her time, and that was what Margaret Thatcher was like, she was always thinking many, many decades ahead of the moment, and she really was the architect of Brexit in many respects. And I found Lady Thatcher to be a leader of tremendous conviction, courage, principle. She was very steadfast, always, in her views, but at the same time, she was always open to debate, and she would welcome a wide range of guests to her private office, sometimes added the chance to sit in on some of those meetings. One of the guests, actually, that, in fact, on the second day that I started working for Lady Thatcher, Nelson Mandela actually arrived to see Lady Thatcher for a cup of tea, and although, so ideologically, there were differences between the two, they actually got on like a house on fire as well, actually. It was, you know, like old friends greeting each other. That was what Margaret Thatcher was like, really. She enjoyed discussion, debate, exchanging ideas. She didn't always agree with everyone she met, but she loved to talk about important ideological political matters, and she would be engaging with both those she fully agreed with and others she didn't, and that was her style. She was actually, I have to say, a very motherly figure when I worked for her, and I was at the time the youngest member of her staff, and she was, I just remember a leader of tremendous kindness and warmth, and she took tremendous care of her staff. She treated them as her own family. I think the Queen was very much like that as well from what I hear from those close to the Queen, and I think they shared a lot of similar personality traits, actually, in some respects, and I was struck by the fact that Lady Thatcher was just so, it was probably hard working, and, you know, she worked all the time. And I worked for her ten years after she left Downing Street, but she was still constantly giving speeches. She was always on the campaign trail supporting conservative candidates, she was travelling the world, and she had a very advanced age. She was very hard working, very well informed, always reading books, newspapers, she was always up to date and everything. I was also, I have to say, greatly impressed by the way that she prepared for speeches. She would, even though she was one of the best orators of modern times, with vast experience, she always practiced and rehearsed her speeches, to make sure that every single line was absolutely right, the delivery spot on, and she was somebody who really took the art of speech, making speech delivery, speech writing incredibly seriously. There are a lot of politicians today in you, as you all know well, look at the modern world of politics today in you. There are so many political leaders today who don't have a grasp of the policy issues, who don't have a grasp of the data or the details, who don't prepare before they give big speeches. And one thinks of figures like Joe Biden, for example. Classic example, you know, you don't see well prepared at all. I think President Obama was very much like that as well. But Margaret Thatcher, much like Ronald Reagan, of course, always did the homework, the preparation, knew the brief, knew the details, poured over the documents, and prepared immaculate speeches, delivered immaculate. And so this was Margaret Thatcher's always the highest standards expected from herself and for those who worked. Of course, it does help to be as smart as she was. Yes, exactly. That was a huge advantage. There are very few politicians who could have gone to Oxford in chemistry at a time when women didn't do that, and then rise in the Conservative Party that was overwhelmingly male dominant. Yes, extremely intelligent, extremely smart, and also actually, I would say, quite witty as well. So, and she had very good sense of view. To your point about her kindness, that's one of the things that Kissinger emphasizes. He said that however tough she was in public in fighting for her positions, that in private she was remarkably pleasant and kind and genuinely cared about people. She definitely did, and I found that working for her, and also she didn't make a distinction between the Postman delivering the male who she had often conversed with and the doorstep, and some head of state visiting her. So she treated everybody the same. I was very struck a few years back. I read a very small book by Claire Burlinski called There is No Alternative Why Margaret Thatcher Matters, and I was struck with the degree to which Claire made the argument that Thatcher saw socialism as immoral evil and set out in 1975 as the brand new opposition leader to destroy it as an acceptable alternative. And by 1985 had succeeded so that no overtly left wing leader has become prime minister in 40 years. I mean, that's an astonishing cultural achievement by a political figure. It is. I think that Margaret Thatcher really slayed the dragon of socialism, and that was her life mission really to defeat what she saw as the evil of socialism and to ensure the British people would be free. I just published a book called Defeating Big Government Socialism, and candidly it's modeled on Margaret Thatcher. I mean, it's just my effort to pick up what she did in Britain and suggest that Biden is giving us a chance. She had the winter of discontent. We're going to have four years of discontent under Biden. It's nice of you. I'm so glad you mentioned that because, you know, when I look at what's happening in America today, and I've lived in America now for 20 years, but I really fear for the future of America because the United States is going down the path of big government socialism that was going to be a part of the world. And I think that the American government socialism that has been so destructive in the past in Britain, across Europe, the British freedom cells of the shackles of this, but the Americans are now going down the path thanks to Joe Biden's disastrous policies. And I think your book will be a very important wake up call, I think, for America. So I very much look forward to reading it. I'm reading a book you in 2013, author book with Stephen Thompson called Margaret Thatcher on Leadership Lessons for American Conservatives Today. Do you think that book may actually be even more relevant now than it was in 2013? I think so, actually. Yes. From time to time, I reread the book and, you know, I have to say, the leadership lessons outlined in that book are more relevant today than ever for Americans. Sure. The Biden era has been just so fundamentally disastrous. And so this book basically outlines exactly what Margaret Thatcher thought of the specter of big government socialism. It outlines leadership principles for American Conservatives to follow. I think it's even more relevant today than it was when the book was put out, actually. If you can talk your publisher into republishing it with a new chapter on the Biden era, I'm going to volunteer to write the introduction. That's very kind. That's a wonderful idea. Unlike many American politicians, I think ideas really matter. I mean, ideas are at the heart of it far more than raising money or whatever.

But Liz Truss actually had ties directly to Thatcher. Well Liz Truss actually, of course she was the Foreign Secretary, she was the International Trade Secretary. She is a self-described Thatcherite today. I mean she's a big admirer of Margaret Thatcher. I don't think she ever had that sort of direct connection to Lady Thatcher, but she is somebody who has aspired to walk in the footsteps of Margaret Thatcher. And her campaign to become the leader of the Conservative Party was fought based upon Thatcherite principles, Thatcherite conviction. And clearly Liz Truss, I think, looked very carefully at how Margaret Thatcher led the British people over the course of three premierships. And also she looked carefully at how Margaret Thatcher won elections as well. And Liz Truss ran a stunningly good election campaign to be leader of the Conservative Party. So she learned a lot from Margaret Thatcher. Interesting with Liz Truss, she actually started out originally on the left. As a young student and young activist, she started off as a Liberal Democrat growing up in a left-wing household. It was only later in life that she switched to the Conservatives. She also actually, originally, was not a Brexit supporter, and in the 2016 referendum, as a Minister and David Cameron's government, she actually sided with the Remain camp. Now, having said that after the Brexit victory, Liz Truss was one of those who very swiftly embraced Brexit and has become a devout born-again Brexit hero. So Liz Truss is somebody who's gone on a real political journey, but I would describe her today as a very strong Conservative with very overall, mostly very sound policies. And I think that she's quite a radical, I was a revolutionary-style Conservative politician in the vein of Margaret Thatcher, which is a very good thing because at the end of the day, Margaret Thatcher changed the course of British history. She saved Britain from absolute destruction, decline, and she restored Britain's self-confidence. Britain's in a difficult situation at the moment because there's an economic crisis, energy crisis, soaring inflation, big challenges. The trade union is a threat to sink the country again. The socialists are on the rise. They are part of leading the world. How much of this has been a result of Boris Johnson's astonishingly incompetent leadership? Yeah, so with Boris Johnson, who I had the chance to meet on many occasions, had I hosted him at Heritage a number of times, Boris, on the one hand, a very brilliant man. He delivered Brexit. He won a stunning 2019 election victory. He showed tremendous leadership on the Ukraine issue standing at the Vladivaputin. But on the other hand, Boris oversaw some disastrous economic policies, huge amounts of government spending, taxes, rose. You had quite left-wing environmental policies introduced. And so a lot of things went wrong with his government. And also, Boris wasn't very interested in the day-to-day job of running the country, I think. In a very good campaign, but he got bored with the day-to-day job of being prime minister, frankly. And so he really wasn't in four controls going on at Downey Street, as we saw the party gate scandals, which played a big part in bringing him down. So, Boris has record very, very mixed, but Liz Truss has vowed to really restore Britain's finances to roll back the frontiers of the state, which is what Margaret Thatcher always used to say. She's pledged to cut taxes. She wants to reduce the overall size of the government. So, in principle, what she's saying is very good, really. Now it's a matter of putting those in practice, and she will be held to count on that. But certainly what she has said is very encouraging. Thatcher always had what they called the wets, the people who didn't quite believe in Thatcherism. How much will trust be faced with a significant minority in the Conservative Party who are profoundly committed to exactly the wrong policies? Yeah, the wets are always around the 1980s when Margaret Thatcher was prime minister. They're still around today, actually, although they're not as powerful as they were before. The wets, or what you call an American, are more liberal types. They're still a problem. And those are the Conservative Party who still believe that the party should be raising taxes, spending more money, building up the welfare state, and there's this sort of thing. And you also have some, even in the Conservative Party, I mean some individuals who are wokists as well. One of the very good things about Liz Truss is she's very anti-woke. She's big on the culture war issues, and she has vowed to defeat wokism in principle. That's one of the reasons why she won the Conservative Party election, because Conservative Party members who aren't generally on the right, they like her message. They don't like all this left-wing culture stuff. And Liz Truss really understood that well. She's pledged to really slay the dragon of wokism in Britain, something that Margaret Thatcher would have done, of course, had she had to face the work as well when she was prime minister, say. In the parliamentary system, you have much greater capacity if you have a majority who actually drive through change on a scale that the American system slows down dramatically. It's a very good point. The Conservatives have a majority of 80 seats, and that's one of the achievements of Boris Johnson and his legacy. The Conservatives have a massive majority in Parliament. They can easily pass legislation. When do they have to go to a general election again? The next generation has to be held, I believe, by January 2025. She can make a huge impact. At least two years to really get Britain back on track, restore the health of the economy, cut taxes, etc. So Liz Truss has a lot of time. I think she'll be a very good prime minister, really, but there will be those who will try to drag her down, and the night is already out in the British media and so on. So it's going to be tough for her, but I think she's the best person right now to lead Britain, actually, among the Conservative Party leadership. It's a fascinating moment. It's one of those rare occasions where you suddenly have somebody show up who is the right person. In 1975, the Conservative Party burned out on moderate leaders who kept trying to accommodate the welfare state. I think almost in desperation had turned to Margaret Thatcher, who turned up to exactly the right person at the right moment. I have a hunch that Liz Truss can maintain her balance and maintain a sense of cheerful warrior, which is part of what Thatcher had. For some reason, Thatcher was really comfortable fighting. And that's very important when you get involved in this kind of scale of change, because inevitably, legitimately, everybody who you're trying to change is going to fight back. Yeah, exactly. Margaret Thatcher was a real fighter, and she fought in the trenches against the left, and she won. She was somebody who was not afraid to fight, stand to her ground. Now Liz Truss, I think, you know, has some of those qualities. It remains to be seen exactly the extent to which she's able to successfully implement all of the pledges she has made, but she's tough. She's resolute. She's not weak need. I would say Liz Truss is a politician of the Thatcher Mall. And that's what you need right now, because you've got to take on the left. You've got to fight and defeat the socialists. You've got to take on the wokest on the Cold War front. You've got to defeat the trade unions who are trying to bankrupt the country. And you have to manage the transition from what has been an astonishingly stupid policy of relying on Russia for energy. I mean, all of Western Europe has gotten itself into a total mess. Yes, fortunately, the British have avoided, I think, the worst of the European disaster in that sense, because the UK is not very dependent on Russian energy, but most of Europe is, especially the Germans of French, the Italians, for example. And they have become basically almost subservient to Moscow, really. You look at what Macron constantly says about Putin groveling to Putin. It's because the French are so dependent on the Russians. So Macron's position on Putin has been absolutely disgrace. He's basically shining Putin's boots, really, in manual crons. But that's what happens when his country is basically blackmailed by the Russians. Compounded by an American president whose energy policy is suicidal. Yeah, and absolutely disastrous, isn't it? Just shockingly bad. Biden doesn't seem to learn anything rules happening in Europe right now. I'm not sure Biden is currently capable of learning anything anyway, so.
