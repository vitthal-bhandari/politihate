    "text": " Welcome into the second hour of the Clay Travis N. Buck Sexton Show, everybody. We will be addressing the comments made by White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki on Friday about mask wearing for kids outside, but also the current briefing that is underway. We'll tell you the latest from all that, and we have much more to get you with you from the issue of criminal justice and what we're here and what we're seeing about that in cities across the nation. The Democrats running scared from the reality of it all. We've got Dinesh De Sousa with us now, though. He is the host of the Dinesh De Sousa podcast. He is a filmmaker, a best-selling author and friend of mine. Dinesh, thanks so much for being here. Hey, it's a pleasure. Great to join you guys. Dinesh, we've been talking about a lot of major cases in the last couple of months, right? Written house trial, a mod, arbori, just as small at one case, though, that you would think would be right alongside it in terms of media interest, the amount of coverage that it would get, the amount of times people would pan with times people would spend on panels talking about it is the Gila Maxwell trial, the associate of and right hand woman, so to speak, of Jeffrey Epstein. What do we know? What's, what's, give us the backstory here just to put this in context for everybody about why this is such a big deal? Well, by contrast with the, the other cases you mentioned, which basically involve people in the ordinary walk of life, Kyle Rittenhouse, of course, just a kid, you know, in his teens, defending himself in the middle of a riot, or the arbori case where you've got these three guys who chase down this one guy. The guy was probably up to no good, but nevertheless, it appears they gratuitously killed them without, without a legitimate authority. Now, this is all different than the Gila Maxwell trial. Gila Maxwell was sort of the madam, the pimp, if you will, for Jeffrey Epstein. And over a long career, Epstein, you know, kind of navigated this so that he had access to some of the most powerful people in the world. I mean, there he is sitting, you know, with the queen, there he, there he is at Buckingham Palace, there he is, so he's got European royalty, he's got influential figures from all walks of American life, you've got Bill Clinton, for example, having Epstein over to the White House on multiple occasions, not to mention taking multiple trips on his jet. So what's interesting about this story is, you've got this socialite, Gila Maxwell, the daughter of a billionaire, Robert Maxwell, famous publisher in Europe, and she agrees for reasons unknown to become the procurer of young women for these apparently willing older men. And so the obvious question is, who are these older men? What was their exact role? And remarkably, this is all, a lot of it has been left out of the Gila Maxwell trial. So the real news of the trial is the dog that didn't bark. It's the names that have not been introduced. It's the narrowing of the scope of the trial merely to say, Hey, here's Gila Maxwell, she's sex trafficking. Let's get her, but let's protect everybody else and sort of, you know, what you may say, let's redact their names so that they're they don't face embarrassment, let alone public accountability. The Nash appreciate you coming on. My understanding of this case, and I've tried to read about it, obviously, because it's not being broadcast, which is an interesting angle in and of itself, is that effectively there are four women that are testifying that, as you said, Maxwell was effectively the madam that was trying to procure these women in order to have sexual interactions with Jeffrey Epstein. Those four women and based on my reading, and I don't know how closely you have followed it, it doesn't sound like the government has even put on that good of a case given these four women. They have variety of different ages. Some of them were not even minors at the time that this incident was occurring based on the definition of where they were located. She may not even be convicted here, right? I mean, have you what are the chances that she is not even found guilty? Well, this is a very odd turn of events because normally in these cases, they have got the goods on you, and there's very little way to wriggle out of it. It also seems like, in this case, the guilt, the guilt of Epstein and the participation of Maxwell is sort of like an established public fact. And so all you would want is the government to show the enormous evidence that's already there, but they appear to have sort of taken a very lighthearted approach to this, use their second or third tier of prosecutors. Obviously, Gillan Maxwell has very good lawyers. And so I don't know what the outcome of this is going to be. It looks like once again, you've got, I mean, going right back to Jeffrey Epstein's own suicide, an incredible botching of the operation on the government's part so that they what should have been a slam dunk is now turning out to be an open question. We're speaking to Dinesh D'Souza. He is the host of the Dinesh D'Souza podcast, also best selling author and filmmaker. Dinesh, from what we do know of Jeffrey Epstein, there was something along the lines of a massive surveillance and likely blackmail operation that he was running for a lot of these often illegal sexual interactions with young women, right? Somehow, none of that information, none of that surveillance tape footage, or just the, you know, the information that we would get from all of it has come out in trial. Gillan Maxwell, as far as I know, and you've been following the case very closely, so I might be missing a detail, hasn't been told to name names, hasn't been bringing people into this at all. How are we, given that we know that it was surveillance and blackmail operation Epstein was running, supposed to find that credible? Well, the strange, the strangeness of this case is that normally, Maxwell is kind of like the person who knows where all the bodies are buried and knows all the people whose names are in the various Epstein books and logs, and yet you would think that the prosecutorial approach would be to offer Maxwell some sort of a deal to spill the beans, so that all these people, far more important than Maxwell, would be drawn into this web of pedophilia and corruption. But evidently, the government has decided not to do that, and obviously in going after Maxwell, Maxwell herself is going to climb up. She's not going to be cooperative, because after all the government has made her the target. So you can see right here that there almost appears to have been a deliberate decision up front not to bring in, you know, Prince Philip, and not to bring in Larry Summers and not to bring in Bill Clinton. Let's leave all those guys out of it and choreograph this as nothing more than we couldn't get Jeffrey Epstein. So let's go after Gillian Maxwell and then quickly close the book on the whole matter. Who makes that choice, Dinesh, prosecutorial decision. They found four women that they are trying to tie to Gillian Maxwell and bring her down. But as you said, there are a lot of bigger names that are not involved. You can think usually this is the opposite of what happens in a case. And let me give you an example that I'm sure you followed somewhat when they had the massage parlor case and I believe it was Jupiter, Florida. Almost all of the attention was put on Robert Kraft, the owner of the New England Patriots who had paid $20 for a massage. And ultimately, that case gets dismissed, but they were trying to get as big of fish on the line as they possibly could to draw attention to what was going on. It seems that the exact opposite is occurring here. Who makes that decision? How high up does this go from a prosecutorial perspective? Now, in theory, the person who makes that decision is the head, the US Attorney for the Southern District of New York. These are the people who are the, this is the prosecutorial wing. But they are going to be working in conjunction with the Biden Justice Department. So it's naive to think that Merrick Garland and the Attorney General are removed from this kind of high profile prosecution. So my guess is that it's the US Attorney making the decision that the SDNY, the Southern District of New York, but in coordination with the Biden DOJ. Would it look any different in your mind if Donald Trump is president right now in what is happening to Maxwell? Without a doubt. I mean, I think that, you know, the left loves to sort of, when you know, when you bring up Bill Clinton, they go, what about Donald Trump? Because there are, there are some photos of Trump. Trump did meet and know, um, Jeffrey Epstein. And apparently, on one occasion, took a flight on his plane from New York to Florida on his way to Mar-a-Lago. But this is a whole different matter from taking multiple trips to the so-called Lolita island, where the little massage girls were all waiting in tow. So I think under Trump, you would have, Trump was, by the way, one of the guys who turned Epstein in. And I think you would have seen a much more neutral prosecution of following the evidence where it leads, rather than what we're seeing now, which is some sort of a cover up. Check out the Dinesh to choose a podcast. And Dinesh, thank you so much for being with us, my friend. We appreciate it. My pleasure. What happened to our nation on September 11, 2001 can be defined as the worst terrorist attack to ever take place on American soil. On that day, 2,977 people lost their lives. In the face of that horror, tens of thousands of brave Americans responded. Many even stepped forward to enlist in our armed forces. Since then, more than 7,000 US soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice. Those heroes were part of the war on terror America's response to 9-11. They fought for us, but never came home. The Tom the Towers Foundation honored those men and women who gave everything by reading their names aloud for the first time ever in a new annual ceremony on Veterans Day last month. Tom the Towers is making sure their sacrifice is never forgotten. The foundation season of Hope runs from Thanksgiving until New Year's Eve. At least one mortgage-free home a day is being given away for 37 days to honor America's greatest heroes. Do good in their honor. Donate $11 a month at t2t.org. That's tthenumber2t.org. Welcome back in Clay Travis Buck Sexton show. Good editorial today in the Wall Street Journal. The headline is the real cost of Biden's plan. Build back better. The Democrats are trying to ram this through. Remember, it's passed in the house has not passed in the Senate. They're trying to get 50 votes. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is holding it up. And there was a significant detail that came out over the weekend. Friday, this kind of got buried into the news. The CBO, which is a nonpartisan congressional budget office, was asked to get the actual cost of the Joe Biden plan. Remember, they're trying to say that it costs zero that it's going to be paid for. And the way that they've sunset different provisions makes it seem like it's going to cost. And this is a direct line. The 18 programs itemized in the table and is led to Congress will add just shy of $3.5 trillion over 10 years to the total cost of the House bill compared to Democrats saying it's going to cost $889 billion. And so this idea that it's fully paid for is not true. Why is this significant? Well, Joe Manchin, a senator from West Virginia has been saying, hey, it doesn't seem to me, and I think he's right, that spending trillions of dollars extra is the best response when we've got a 6.8% right now inflation rate, the highest since 1982. And so he was asked just now in the last hour about whether he's likely to support Build Back Better, big day, because he is scheduled to meet with President Joe Biden. And this is what Joe Manchin had to say. The limits of what we can afford. And that means having a tax plan that's fair and equitable and keeps us competitive, but also makes everyone pay, especially the wealthy pay their fair share to see what that spins off. And if that's in that one seven range, then we should be spending whatever in that range as far as I'm concerned. If it's a whatever plan it would be, then it should be 10 years. It should just be one year here, three years here, five years there. And that would be, that would be, I think it would be very transparent for the public to see exactly what they'd be getting for overspending for 10 years. Inflation is real. It's not transitory. It's alarming. It's going up, not down. And I think that should be something we're concerned about. The Democrats have been lying about this clay to sell it. I mean, the Biden administration's lying when they say this won't add a penny to the deficit, that's a lie. No, no, no serious person believes it. They can try to come up with projections whereby they'll set up massive government programs, universal pre K paid for by the government. And then it's just going to go away. They're just going to take it away after five years or whatever it's supposed to sunset. No, of course not. They should be honest with the American people about what the real costs are. They should be honest about what the projection will be for inflation and then let people vote or, you know, either vote or support their elected members of Congress one way or the other. Right. So it pushed them one way or the other. Instead, what we have is this is the chocolate cake that doesn't make you fat that you never run out of and that always tastes delicious. It's just not real. There's no way you can spend the kind of money they're talking about and not have the downside effects. And it's a huge tell, I think, that they can't even be honest about it. I mean, you're talking about what the projections are. That's from a CBO now, right? We've known this for a while. But these are the official number crunchers looking at the budget saying, look, guys, if you start these outlays and you continue them, you don't just decide suddenly in a few years, oh, yeah, the government's not going to spend that money anymore on the program that it's when does that ever happen? Right? It's not going to spend the money it's set up on a program. Then you're looking at what was it? Three, three trillion dollars added to the debt. That's big folks. I mean, I know we're almost at 30 trillion, but three trillion dollars. Obama's entire stimulus that started this tea party was 900 billion dollars. It's the question here now and it's interesting, Buck, because if you read the Wall Street Journal, they're basically the editorial page, editorial page writers of the Wall Street Journal are having a daily conversation with Joe Manchin, making the case that he needs to stick to his guns and that the overall cost of this build back better bill is massive. In fact, their closing argument here is all of this gives Mr. Manchin and other Democrats hiding behind his skepticism. Ample ammunition to call the whole thing off bill passes. They'll own all of the deficits, debt and inflation that results. And we just have to hope at this point, because we're in a 50 50 Senate where every senator is effectively king, that Joe Manchin and or Kirsten cinema, who's a little bit hidden as well, are going to be willing to stand up to this. And you would hope that at a minimum, Manchin is going to say, Hey, let's push this into 2022. And the truth of the matter is this, Democrats are going to become increasingly nervous about trying to pass this bill in a year when the midterms are happening. The flip side, that's why it's significant. If they don't pass it, what the heck have the Democrats done since Biden became president other than mess everything up that they've touched. Peter Ducey, by the way, over at Fox News, Clay was just asked about this during the White House press conference about the CBO scoring of build back better. Here's what he said. The president says that the build back better is not going to add a penny to the deficit. The CBO has this new score where they assume that social programs are going to be made permanent. And in that case, it would add almost $3 trillion. So does that mean the president Biden will commit that these programs are not going to be made permanent? What we're you're talking about here is a fake CBO score that is not based on the actual bill that anybody is voting on. This was a request by Senator Graham to score a bill that is not currently being debated. But it's important to understand that when anybody raises a question about this new CBO score, it is a fake score about a bill that doesn't exist. She's lying to you folks. Lying 100% lying. I mean, the reason why Senator Graham to his credit requested the CBO to score this is because Democrats are trying to camouflage their excessive spending by making it seem like these bills, these entitlement programs are just going to stop after a couple of years. And so they say, oh, it only costs, you know, like there are some examples in here of the difference. It's pretty wild. If you say, for instance, oh, we're going to say the child care allowance, Democrats are saying it will only cost $185 billion because it ends buck after one year. Instead, it's going to cost $1.6 trillion over the next 10 years. That is real significant money. It seems like a big difference to me.

It was expansive definition there. That was getting some sort of funky synthesizer 80s stuff going on. I mean, I celebrate the 80s. Don't get me wrong. I love 80s music, but that was that wasn't what I was expecting there. All right. 800-2828-2. There are a few areas where that's the phone lines you want to call in just to be clear. And there are a few areas where I think the Democrats in 2021 because we're coming in here, folks to the you know, this week, we're trading off a couple of days on the air, taking you right up to Christmas, but Clay's going to get a couple of days of R&R same here. And then we're going to be turning it over to some fantastic guest hosts toward the end of the very end of the year between Christmas and New Year's. So we don't have a ton of time with you. So I do have a little bit of a feeling of the retrospective of 2021 here. Something we'll continue to talk about. But on the border on crime, on inflation on COVID, Democrats have had a bad year. I mean, when they're in charge and their decisions come to fruition and one way or another, you see what the results are and they can tell you whatever they want me. They can make stuff up. They can say things aren't that mean. Here's here's a perfect example. I can take any number of these topics and I want to drill down on the crime side for a second. And I do think I want to throw a party. Yes, I celebrate Christmas and the birth of Jesus and it's a great time of year. I will also be celebrating my birthday. I will also be celebrating 40 folks for zero. And I will also be celebrating a departure from office of mayor Bill de Blasio, which we'll be getting to in a second, which is a great day for New York City. I even care where Eric Adams does. It can't be worse than de Blasio. Everyone agrees on that. But just just on the you don't know what's really going on, America, the Biden Democrats are super smart and know what's going on. Jen Psaki, we're looking at the economy right now. Clay, we're just talking before about the budget and inflation and the build back better effects. Here's Psaki telling everybody, guys, it's like really good. You just don't understand how good it is. The way people experience it and the president just said this as well is not by looking at charts in the paper, right? As much as we love charts because it's important for us to note, it's about their monthly budget and how much it takes to fill up their their tank of gas, how much it takes to buy meat to have burgers for a barbecue. That's what I was saying. What we're seeing in our data is is people's psychology on the economy, on how they're experiencing things in the country right now is related to COVID and the fact that COVID, we're still in a fight against this virus. People expected it to be over sooner and people are looking to get back to a normal version of life. Can we just play? I mean, this is this is what they're relegated to this. You don't know, America, how smart we buy it in Democrats are and what a great job we're doing specifically with the economy because COVID vast majorities of red states have zero COVID impact in our lives now, other than when we go to the airport, nobody's having to wear masks. Nobody's having to change behavior really in any kind of substantial way. And what Jen Psaki won't acknowledge is with inflation at 6.8%, the highest it has been since all the way back is 1982. The reason why inflation is so high is because of disastrous economic choices that are being made inside of the Biden White House and the overall rate of wage increase. This is pretty big, Buck. And it doesn't get a lot of discussion because the Biden administration strikes out this was the best economy we've ever had. That's what they're pitching all the media that are coming out and saying it. The average wage is up 4.6% in this country right now. That sounds good. The problem is cost is up 6.8%. So the American people understand they might be making more money, but because of the overall inflation rate, they're bringing home less than they were before COVID. They even noticed this over at the quasi commie CBS news where because this is data right where these are numbers we're all working with. They can tell you whatever they want. But when they calculate the number for what inflation is when they're calculating CPI when they're calculating these things, we are working from the same number set. And here's CBS news talking about exactly what you just laid out, which is, okay, yeah, wages are going up, but they're not keeping up with the cost of living specific, which is even more specific than inflation. And what are expenses like right now for a family? Are you thinking, think about this in broad terms. Oh, you know, it's up 8%, but some sectors higher and some sectors lower and some. Okay, if you're a family of four in America, you need food, shelter, transportation, and you know, a few other basics. What's that like for you right now? Apparently it's about $4,000 more. We're going to begin tonight with the staggering inflation that is hitting Americans right in the wallet. Prices were up 6.8% in November compared to a year ago. That is the biggest increase in nearly 40 years. The cost of pretty much everything is surging. Food, gas, electricity, housing, cars and clothes. And those who received raises this year are seeing them wiped out by skyrocketing costs. Listen to this, by one estimate, expenses for a typical American family have shot up by about $4,000 in the past year. That's a lot of money. It's real money and it's a natural consequence of pouring all of this money into the economy while simultaneously saying, Hey, we've got to pay workers more because this is what's so infuriating and frustrating to people who understand basic business. When you go to McDonald's, and a McDonald's worker is now making, let's say $15 an hour, the way that that is handled by the business owner is they increase costs of their overall products. So you pay more, which means that your overall cost increases. And unfortunately, the inflationary spiral that we have hit is even with the increase of wages, it's immediately getting passed on to consumers because the business owner has to pay increased labor costs. That's a simple example. But if you go out to McDonald's, for instance, I go to McDonald's probably far more often than I should with my kids, a Chick-fil-A or wherever you may go for relatively low cost rapid fast food, eating the cost on those menus have gone up massively, because their overall cost structure. And by the way, it's not just wages. It's how much they're having to pay for chicken or beef or whatever product that they are producing inside of their store. And they don't take losses because in capitalism, they pass that cost on to the consumer. And so when they have efficiencies of scale and the costs come down, they can make their food product cheaper when the costs go up. They charge more and everybody is seeing it. By the way, gas is the easiest place to see it, because it's up, I think, right around 60% over last year, even me, Buck, when I'm standing there filling up my car, I know you've got the scooter. So you don't have this experience. Whoa, hold on. The scooter is RIP clay, okay? The scooter is the thing of the past. It got stolen by a hooligan. I will stand there and just watch the dollars continue to roll on the gas station. And I'm like, I can't even believe what it costs now. Never has happened like this to fill up my car. And I know there's many people out there listening to us right now have the same experience. There's people filling their cars right now talking to us, Buck, looking at those numbers going up. And they are saying to themselves, this is a direct reflection of the economy that Joe Biden has created. Let's be very clear about something. It's, it's obvious, but it's easy to forget it in the maelstrom of misinformation that they're intentionally putting out a really the distraction that the mass distraction techniques they're always using. If they had really positive things to tell people that would resonate about the economy, about any number of issues right now, honestly, about how well they're handling COVID. If they had really positive stories, they would tell them they're actually in a position where their best option because things are going so poorly is to tell you what you're experiencing isn't really what you're experiencing. When you think things at the grocery store and at the gas pump and paying your rent, by the way, and paying, you know, your, your different costs, when you think that's more expensive, just know that Jen Psaki knows more about balancing your checkbook than you do. And there's, you know, some hocus pocus here. You have to play it. It doesn't work. And this is why Biden's poll numbers are so low. I'm just worried that there'll be some kind of a snapback effect next year where it can't get much worse than this. Right. That's, that's, so I don't, I don't want people getting complacent because I feel like the Biden regime is crumbling too rapidly. I want them crumbling right around November. We're actually right around October when people are really making their final decisions in a November of next year. I just don't see it how it's going to get a lot better. But it is a, a strong point. I think by you that it's so awful that the way people experience the Biden administration were at the absolute nadir, the absolute positive, I mean, least positive point we can be, it may well start to come back, not be good, but just not be as bad as it is right now.

That we could potentially read at some point. We will encourage you to give us five stars. We'll come back out on any review that references the scooter theft clay. It's too soon to too raw. I will personally encourage you to mention the scooter in your five star review as much as you can. We have got a bunch of you that want to weigh in on a variety of topics we've been discussing so far. Just know at the top of the third hour, we've got unbelievable audio from Jen Psaki defending kids eating outdoors in the fridge and cold as well as Dr. Fauci trying to terrify you. But one of the big topics we've had, we talked about JK Rowling coming out against so many of these ridiculous rules relating to transgender issues right now. And last week, we talked a lot about University of Pennsylvania who has a male swimmer that is potentially going to set all time records for women's athletics. He has decided to become a woman after three year swimming as a man. One one race by 38 seconds, another by nearly 15 seconds dominated at the most recent meet now swimming as a woman. And I believe Monmouth County, New Jersey, we've got a mom of a swimmer who wants to weigh in. D apparent of an accomplished female swimmer in Mama County, New Jersey just crossed the river from me. Hey, Dee. Good afternoon, gentlemen. And Clay, thank you for great reporting from your group on this. So I definitely have a way in on the absurdity of allowing a biological man to compete in girls swim. These girls have been putting in time and mileage in pools across the country for years. In many cases, like my own daughter, since they were little girls, in many cases, also getting up in the dark hours of the morning to put in mileage and laps in a pool while every while their peers are still sleeping in many cases. They do this to shave off fractions of a second in many cases, or full seconds would be big accomplishments off of their times. I mean, these girls live in improvements of fractions of seconds. And now to have their hard earned records shattered by a biological man, like you just said, one of you gentlemen, by 15 seconds, by 38 seconds. It's really an epic slap in the face. As a society, we can't possibly accept that testosterone blockers or that estrogen supplements are going to make a man a woman. No pharmaceutical intervention is going to make up for the athleticism that this gentleman who is calling himself a woman now is bringing to the pool. None. And the only proof we need are the numbers that you just mentioned. 38 seconds, 15 seconds. This is unfathomable in terms of breaking records. It's unacceptable. And frankly, maybe more of the parents of these girls need to get involved, much like the parents got involved in intervening in the CRT in schools. But this sort of you know, vokeness being placed on us and forced on us, you don't need a shovel for this. You need a full blown plow. And it's just totally disgusting and unacceptable. From New Jersey, like, like, you think, well, I mean, I just think to me, this is such an interesting point because title nine advocates and feminists have allowed women to compete at the highest level on a relatively equal playing field with men, but obviously men's and women's sports. D, why do you think so many people are so terrified of actually speaking out? Because here's what's interesting to me, D, the story that we did, hundreds of thousands of readers also was on Fox News, millions of readers there. Not one person really pushed back against it because I think almost everybody who's a sports fan, Bock indeed, like they were telling us about funding, right? So it's about funding for women's athletics being equivalent to men's. Yes. But theoretically, these transgender athletes could get female scholarship. Of course. Well, but this is what I mean, right? So it's all about the money that's going into it. And, you know, like, I think these, uh, exhortation for other parents to speak out on this is absolutely critical because without an outcry, Clay, people are all scared. I mean, do you know of parents who are frightened to speak out? I think that, you know, none of us, the lokeness in the country is at an all time high, right? We all have this sensitivity to speaking out because it could potentially pour over to your career, right? You don't want to be the person whose name is on the news as being the one who spoke out against lokeness and to whichever one of you just mentioned, you know, why the coaches aren't doing something, why the women's athletics aren't doing something. I think at a high level, these coaches write their salaries, their success is almost entirely driven by W's next to their name. And if this coach is going to be propelled to a higher level because he's got more W's next to his name and that W doesn't have an asterisk, what's the stop? Any coach from doing that? Dee, thank you so much. A great call. I would say Dee's right, by the way, if you could be forced into a position where you have to cheat and win and it's not your fault as a coach, that seems to be what's going on with the U-PEN swimming program so far as you've seen it, Clay. And just one thing that we do here, which I think everyone's, everyone's already aware, right? But we should say it out loud, we are the reality defenders here. We defend objective reality on this show every day. You look at a lot of these issues, whether it's defund the police or the transgender swimmer or you name it, they're not living in reality, Clay. No doubt. And I would just point out, no one is really fighting in favor of this. It's a conspiracy of silence that's allowing this to occur. That has to change and it has to change now."
