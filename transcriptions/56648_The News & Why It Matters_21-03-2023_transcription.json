    "text": " Today, as the whole world waits with baited breath, Donald Trump is still a free man for now. And another biological male dominates in another women's sports competition. So congratulations once again to the patriarchy. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and Donald Trump was not arrested today, not because the Soros backed DA Alvin Bragg had a change of heart about, you know, devolving into this whole banana republic thing, but because the grand jury had not finished listening to testimony from key witnesses. The latest reports say that the indictment and arraignment will come next week once the testimony has concluded, but that didn't stop the media frenzy outside the courthouse. Mainstream media hacks desperate, frothing at the mouth, drooling over the possibility of getting a glimpse at Donald Trump and cuffs. A glimpse at really what would be the end of our American justice system as we know it. But hey, think about all the clicks and views, republic be damned. In response to the House Judiciary Committee's insistence that Bragg turn over all documents related to the investigation and testify before the committee, Bragg's office released a statement that read, we will not be intimidated by attempts to undermine the justice process, nor will we let baseless accusations deter us from fairly applying the law. Ha. In every prosecution, we follow the law without fear or favor to uncover the truth. Our skilled, honest and dedicated lawyers remain hard at work. I mean, sure, unless the defendant is a Black Lives Matter rioter or a violent criminal or a felon or a domestic abuser, then we don't follow the law at all. We just let you go. And despite Trump calling for his supporters to protest, media members far outweighed the number of protesters and even counter protesters. Daily Beast reporter, if you want to call on that, Zachary Patrizio pointed out, tweeted out, due to the post January 6 paranoia, Trump supporters gathered at Trump Tower to voice their support of the former president. They're now being accused of being feds by fellow Trump supporters. Post January 6 paranoia, gosh, I can't imagine why a conservative would have paranoia about the FBI being weaponized against us. They're only allowing political prisoners to rot in prison for wearing red hats. They're only raiding pro-life activist homes in front of their children. They're only putting us on domestic terrorists watch lists for believing in, you know, less government or not wanting a public school to sexualize our children. Why on earth would we have anything to be paranoid about? This is typical leftist gaslighting. They abuse their power. They create the problem you then become paranoid about. They want you paranoid, by the way. Then they mock you for being paranoid about who to trust. And as we have proven time and time again, as much as the left wants to claim they care about election interference, it threats to democracy. They only care when they think it's something that interrupts their gaming of the system. They will not rest until they get that perp walk from Donald Trump, until they interfere in the election, and they will not rest until they get you so riled up they can convince you to follow their lead in seeking revenge. And then they'll use it as an example of why you are that evil person. They always said you were. Don't take the bait. Here to discuss this and more are Jakubuians, Blaise TV contributor and host of the bottom line and John Doyle, Blaise TV contributor and host of Heck Off Kami. I also believe, I think, Donald Trump's number one supporter. Yeah, true. That's also true. I would say. So it's good to have you both here, guys. It's been fascinating to watch this play out because the media is just so hung up in when, when we're gonna get this big story, when we're gonna get Donald Trump in cuffs, when we're gonna get this perp walk. They're lined up at the courthouse. They've got cameras all over the place. And no one, none of them at least, seem to be, I don't know, at all concerned about this two-tiered justice system. Or again, the interference in the 2024 election, which very clearly this would be, I mean, you had the, the entire left. They were so, remember when they loved James Comey because they thought that he was, you know, anti-Trump. And then James Comey came out and said the FBI is still investigating Hillary Clinton and they hated him. And they said, you can't do that before an election. That's interfering. Um, hello? Where are those people now? I, I kind of want this monologue to continue because it was just absolutely brilliant. I'm sitting here going. The girl can write. I mean, it's amazing. Honestly, look, I think strategically it starts way earlier than that though, John. They only hire at these liberal media outlets. Those who they know will live and die by their mantra, who have no personal conviction, who don't care about this country, who don't care to report about fair and balanced justice system, justice that is, justice that's blind. I don't care about that. It is, it is this movement, this blob moving in the direction. So for them, Donald Trump, who's still the most persecuted president in history, maybe in all history, the man, the fact that he stayed standing until his last day in the White House was a miracle, an act of God, they want to see him in cuffs because a couple things. To them it would prove CC. There was no collusion. See there was no foul play. See, it's a self vindication because they know. They know. Deep down, it's a sham. The whole thing is a sham. They're reporting is a sham. There's no true investigative reporting. They don't care about the justice system or any American. So it's actually a self gratifying event. And that's why they clamor like bees around a honey pot, right? Because it's all CC. We were right. They did the same with masks. They did the mask shaming. Bad person, bad person to make themselves feel good. So my personal opinion, you're not seeing him arrested. You're not seeing him in handcuffs. I don't see that happening. But they would love to and they don't care about our justice system. I'm disappointed to hear you say that. I would like to see it happen, not because I wanted to happen. Imagine that that would be the most significant photograph in the history of photos. I mean, like what that would represent as like America, you know, one of the most consequential nations in the history of the world. Something that was built upon this idea of liberating ourselves from that authoritarianism, embracing self governance for that country to then devolve into a banana republic and then went along with Donald Trump at like the forefront of that being the leader of the opposition party then being in handcuffs and having that mugshot photo taken. That would be something for the college dorm room. But it's exactly as he said, you know, we've got this situation where the right is so ill equipped to deal with our political enemies because we can't conceptualize like the cunning and viciousness of these people. We're always expecting to have to play by the rules and these people are like, well, it's okay when we do it and when you do it, it's not okay. I'm like, well, wait a minute. Oh, come on, that's not fair. It's like it's actually very consistent in a way because their principle is that. Their principle is it's okay when we do it and not when you do it because they don't care about equality in terms of, you know, equality of thought or representation. They only care about hierarchy in the sense that they get to rule and you don't. Yeah. Yeah. You know, it is fascinating because they set these unlivable standards that they know. They're like, yeah, it's unlivable because we never intended to live by them. We just we just want all of you to live by them. That's we're better than that. We're above you. And our key for the sake of causing anarchy and for that reason, you know, mainstream media, remember they don't they don't hear from the powers that be. They just follow their little worker bees, worker ants. They they just puppets. Sorrows in these guys. I've asked myself this question. Do they actually and people will say, yeah, they do. Do they actually want to see him in handcuffs or is it the slow, erosive, discrediting process? I think the latter because actually seeing him in handcuffs does not really benefit because it's not going to stand in and it will galvanize his followers. So that really does not benefit, but discrediting him and never stopping continuing to chipping away at him. I think it's probably a smarter play. But that's why I don't think they actually arrest him. I really don't. But nor do I think this stops. I think there's more of this. They will continue and they will never stop. They may not stop when this guy's 90 years old. They will go after him because he's their nemesis. He's their kryptonite. It's it's it's hard to figure out who this ultimately will benefit because I know that they think that they're making him look bad by getting that perp walk or dragging him through all of this. They're making him look horrible. But I mean, the fact of the matter is everyone knew who Donald Trump was before they voted him in the first time. Right. I mean, we had we had the grabber by the tapes. We had we knew who we knew who he was. We knew he had had affairs. We knew he was a playboy. We you know, we had all of that evidence and America still decided this is the right man for the job at this time. And so it's just fascinating to see them constantly try to drag this stuff up. Like the same people who voted for him the first time who already knew all of this are now going to be like, oh, no, he paid Stormy Daniels for an NDA to. I mean, honestly, when I hear that that he paid Stormy Daniels that money and she took the money and now she routed him out. Anyway, the first thing I think of is can he get that money back because like she didn't hold up her end of the bargain. Is it a good thing to do? No. Should he be having affairs? No. But my point is you persecute a man enough. And the rest of the country starts going, okay, you know what? Like, I'm kind of tired of you guys doing this to this man. Like, and I kind of just want to take a side now. I mean, and that's where I'm at. And obviously I voted for the guy in the last election, but you know, you hear them go through the just just pick apart his character. You you see how they weaponize the FBI against him. You see them raid Mar-a-Lago. You see how they're trying to destroy his life. And then you hear him call it a witch hunt and you're like, it is. It is. It is. And so I just but then but then but then just play devil's advocate. But then you have the president leaning into this, right? You have him telling his his his supporters to take to the streets to protest. You have him going off on truth, social, writing, all. I mean, he's clearly very angry, which he has a right to be. But the tweets were what turned independence off the first time, right? Or the second time. So who who ultimately benefits here? It just to me, it feels a whole lot like nobody does at the end of the day. My concern and this is going to be probably not well received at this side of the table. My concern is this. The biggest loser here actually ends up being Donald Trump. I worry that it is. And it is. And here's why. His former tactics are not working. It's not working on Ron DeSantis calling Ron names. Ron's playing above it and he's getting angry. And when a man gets angry and gets emotional, you make mistakes. You make big mistakes. And he hasn't really given the left fresh information to hit him with. It's old stuff, right? I'm concerned he's about to give them fresh stuff, like big mistakes by tweeting something, you know, off color or something or tweeting on truth, social, what it. But you know, true, true thing. Yeah, truth. That's my concern is that he actually ends up being. The loser here, not because they're trying to indict him or whatever, but because of his frustration for his former tactics gaining ground and it and this time around, I don't think that's going to work. And it's frustrating to see because I want to let you respond, John, but it's frustrating to see because like I said, who can blame the guy for being frustrated? Who can blame the guy for feeling like everyone's out to get him? Who can blame him for thinking all of these things? It's all true, but the independence you need and if the independence don't like those, don't like that. Remember that was, ah, but she tweets mean things like I thought his tweets were great and hilarious, but they don't like them. So who ends up benefiting from this, John? I don't even know if that's true to be honest. I mean, the issues that we win with independence on are issues like immigration, trade and foreign policy, which were the issues that Trump emphasized in 2016 and 2020. I think the reason he lost in 2020 fortification aside is because he pandered too much. He was dealing with the Black Lives Matter stuff. He started pandering to like the LGBT stuff and you've got all these like white middle-class voters who are wondering like how they're benefiting from releasing convicted Black criminals from prison, having Jared Kushner like, you know, govern the White House basically. So I think that's why he lost. He lost that edge. You know, ironically, he started surrounding himself too often with a class of people who write the note cards for Ron DeSantis. And I think that the attacks are working. I mean, his gap with him and DeSantis just keeps widening. And I think that DeSantis's response to everything yesterday was terrible. I mean, all over Twitter, even people who were pro-DeSantis are like that was not good because why people love Trump is because he does represent that anti-establishment sentiment. And when the establishment targets him, I think it is going to help him ultimately. So I think it's going to be. I want to ask you this. Sure. I want to stop asking what Donald Trump needs. And I want to start asking, what does this nation need? What does this country truly need? And this country truly needs vision again, vision and unity. And I'm not talking about, you know, case or rasara. I'm talking about really coming together because we are focusing on the triage. Meanwhile, cancer is eating us away and we are losing our families. Our fatherless right now for the youth has gone to 90%. We're going and you can't blame all that on the left. You cannot. Our fight. You know, sexualizing children. That's not just the left. We arrest as many pedophiles that are conservative as liberal. So while we're focusing on the, the, the topic of the day, the nation is crying out for an identity again, the nation, America, the home of the free, the land of the brave, the flag, unity under God, that galvanizing unity better be the focus or you're going to see, you're going to see a bloodbath within the conservative movement. It's going to be a bloodbath and that's not healthy for, for the country. That's my concern is we got to get back to God, nation, not individual. I think that Trump is still that guy. I mean, you know, the idea of making America great again calls back to that identity back when we didn't hate ourselves. And, you know, the type of statements that you hear from the pre-Trump GOP and even like in someone like DeSantis or this idea about, you know, freedom or combating like, you know, the left and stuff like that. It's like, okay, that's great. But Trump, I mean, even like with the immigration issue as a whole, he didn't do that because of, you know, even security necessarily or economic reasons. He did that because he knows that if you change the composition of the nation, you're going to change its identity. So I don't know, I like DeSantis a lot, but you know, in terms of the governors that the Republicans control, I think we have like 25 or 26, he's the best. But overall, the situation is not that good. I mean, he has significant majorities in both chambers of Congress. He could be like cranking stuff out much more so than he is. And he's just not. And I mean, this guy, you know, when he was in Congress, his voting record pretty much was like the average Republican. Now he sees where the tide's going with the whole Trump momentum thing. He does a campaign commercial in 2018. Oh, look at me. I love Trump. Elect me. He beats Andrew Gilliam. And I don't know. This guy seems to just want to go where he senses the party trends going. And I think he's doing great, a great job. But I don't know if he's going to carry this. So I want to play devil's advocate for a second. And then I know I know we need to go to break here because it could be that. You could be absolutely right. However, in the last three years, the left has also swung so far left. We've seen unprecedented abuses of power. We've seen them trying to force people to go get an injection. We've seen them trying to force people to suffocate and cover their faces. And so I do think that the last three years has given these politicians maybe a fresh perspective and maybe turned them a little more based. And I'm not even talking about Ron to Santa specifically, but I'm just saying, I'm willing to give a pass to someone who previously maybe had a meh voting record. If they really have seen like, holy crap, I see where we're going. I see what the left is doing. And I'm done with it. And I feel like because the left has gotten so radical, we do have certain people in the party who have perhaps maybe strengthened their convictions on things because they realize that they need to. So what I'm saying is I think we will have the opportunity to find out if that is the case. But I just know just from even people that I talked to that like were not based at all before and now the last three years they're like super based because the left has gone so crazy. I agree. I think that's very possible. But you know, you look at Trump, he's been saying the same thing since the 1980s on what he thinks the country should do. And now we're finding out that he was correct. So I would trust him before I would trust someone who just came around in the last few years, especially when people who've been making so much money on people. I would have been a Democrat in the 1980s. Are you kidding? He was a Democrat but until much further. And I mean. Funded the Clinton campaign. Listen again, again, he delivered on his campaign results. He did exactly what he said he was going to do. He was the best president of our lifetime. Absolutely. Absolutely. Without a doubt. Are you the best president? Wow. Ever. Ever. Right. Right. While Trump was a Democrat in the 1980s, Ronald. He wasn't just the 1980s though. That's just incorrect. Party affiliate, the issues are what matter. We have switched issues so many times in this country's history. The party of the nation. He's pro abortion. He's not. He was. Now, in my opinion, did he redeem himself? Did he redeem himself by? I remember what the Trump administration did. Okay. So that's why I'm saying did he redeem himself by this framework? Yes. I just want to be accurate here. John, hold on. You can't say, well, a guy that was pro abortion. What did the Trump administration do? Phenomenal work. Yes. But then you've got to also give the Republican that was not based and now is based the same treatment. Let me go change of heart. You got to be fair. I mean, let me just finish. Yeah. Let me let you finish your point and then we have to go to break. I'll give you last word on this, John. Thank you. If you look at all of the people who sold out this country made a lot of money doing so during that same time period where Trump was talking about the issues, maybe as a Democrat, but still the same issues, these are all the people now, your Bush's, your whoever, your Paul Ryan's. These are all the people that are cozying up to DeSantis. So either we know something about DeSantis that they don't and they're foolish for giving him all the support and he's going to turn out be our guy or they know something that we don't, which is that he's in bed with them. I guess we'll see it. Or Trump just broke people, but we will see. Who knows? All right. So let's go ahead and take a quick break. Want to thank our sponsor, Patriot Mobile.

So make sure that you are subscribed and a comment for that algorithmic engagement if you would. So earlier that, which by the way, I enjoy having these conversations with you guys so much because we're all friends and we can all, I don't even know what, in the Trump to Santa thing, I'm just, first of all, I don't like the infighting, but mostly I just, it's nice to hear from two differing perspectives where we know like we all love and respect each other and, you know, we're not writing each other off. So I appreciate that. I appreciate John who's an amazing intellectual. I love John, but to your point, I also say this, I also don't think the Santa's taking the angle of we're not them. That's also not the answer. I mean, it's not enough Sarah. So just to say, well, we're not the woke ones. That's not enough. Yeah, I agree. I agree. I agree. And so, so I want to, to your point, that's not enough because we're at a precipice here. Where Donald Trump's right when he says like, they're not, it's not me, but like, I'm standing in the way of you because they, like, they want to destroy you. Absolutely true. Kasein Point, the FBI, apparently in DC, spent nearly 16,000 more hours on the clock following January 6th than it did in the aftermath of all of those fiery but mostly peaceful BLM riots. So this report comes from the Heritage Foundations Oversight Project and they actually went in and calculated the number of hours that these FBI agents worked. 16,000 more hours between January 4th and 17th, 2021 than when you're looking at the summer of love in 2020 between May and June, they worked far less. I just, we're at a major precipice here. Look, I don't want to sound too gled-bekish in gloom and doom, okay? But I just want to, I want to stress, I don't think it's, you could stress enough how important it is for everyone to understand the significance of the FBI. Not just weaponizing against Donald Trump, but against the average American. I said it at the top of the show. We're talking about, you know, their, their rating pro-life activist homes. They're putting them on trial, even though they know that there were no, there were no charges in the locale, you know? I mean, it's getting really, really scary out there and for as much as they want to call us paranoid, I mean, 16,000 more hours, what more evidence do you need that the cards are stacked against you if you are a conservative or if you are a white Christian male as well? I'll just say. I'd say this. That agency has finally stepped into the destiny it was created for. It was created for from the onset to be weaponized against the American people. That agency was corrupt. This is not every FBI agent because we've got incredible friends or agents who fight and do great work, the hierarchy, the leadership. It's been there and now it's just gone full monty. It is weaponized and this is, I'm with you. I'm with Glenn. This is a fire alarm 911 call, which is why, John, I say, a man. The Santas Trump, whoever does not fix this problem, a nation has to return to God, family by family and start taking ownership of their communities, their schools, etc. To think that, my concern is to think that a person can step into the white house and for the ladies watching a woman as a president, can step into the Oval Office and fix this problem? No way. Doesn't work that way. Not culturally. You're going to make dense. You're going to swing the economy. You're going to be tough on China. You're going to build a wall. We're going to shut down the border and these things do help, but you've got to ask yourself, its parents taking their children to drag shows. Its parents taking their children. Its pastors caving to the LGBTQIA alphabet. Culturally, we're sick. We're sick and we need a bigger solution that we're not woke and we're not them. We need God, honestly. Yeah, I completely agree. To clarify, I don't think that Donald Trump is going to save America or save the world or anything. No, you didn't say that. I do think there is something to be said about. The size of the government we have now is necessary to maintain how backwards our culture is. Its kind of funny now how eating healthy and going to church and having a family. These are now all described as very far right positions, but its just like normal. This is just what people are supposed to do. The government has to be as big as it is and have this vast archipelago of a bureaucracy in order to cram down everybody's throats what is so abnormal, whether its when they're in school and they're learning things or when they try to start a small business and they have to jump through all these hoops. If you had a guy who could actually govern as an executive, the executive branch under Trump or even under Brandon or whoever is really different than the executive branch under a Lincoln or an FDR. If you had a guy in there, I don't think this is Trump. I don't think he's really politically efficate enough to know how to do this. I think a lot of his advisors are as long as he doesn't have personnel issues. If you have a guy who can get in there and actually wield the power that the executive does have under our constitution, you could delete a lot of those three letter agencies. You could purge them, replace them with loyalists, which I know sounds scary, but that's normal people, right wing people, God-fearing people. That's what you would need to do. Then all of a sudden people were bringing their kids to these events. Maybe sheriffs would feel empowered, DA's would feel empowered to go after these people. You could cut off the influence of sin and of degeneracy that is being, I think, imposed on American people from the top down, and then I think we can really start to heal. Look, you need strong leadership. I'll say this. I always say, a tough one now. Sometimes the people have the leadership they deserve. I agree, though. That's tough because it takes a little accountability, a little time in the mirror, man in the mirror. Michael Jackson fan, but can I face what's in the mirror? Have I really taken account the 40% of Christians that didn't vote? Hey, it's on you, man. Stop blaming the woke culture. Where were you? Did you show up? How are you when Sarah goes out to go virtually raid a drag show for kids? Ask her if there's 10,000 moms showing up. No, they don't. No, they don't. That's my concern, though. A president doesn't do that. Yeah. You know, the people need to take some ownership here. Yeah, I totally agree. All right, let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be right back. How about the pastors who refuse to pursue the politics? Please media. The elites in Silicon Valley think it's their job to control what you see online. They don't trust you to be able to tell fact from fiction, so they throttle our content, delete our videos, and suspend our accounts to keep you from the truth. And a problem this big requires a big solution. Head on over to theblaze.com to see some exciting updates and learn how you can help the fight against big tech censorship. Congratulations. Well, congratulations, Yaku. Congratulations, John. The patriarchy has done it again. A biological male has won a women's cycling division in New York City. There was a... I wish that we had the picture of this biological male who was towering over the second place and third place women. But this is... Oh, no. Why is the last name Thomas again? This is Tiffany Thomas. Any relation to Leah? I'm not sure. But so Tiffany Thomas is a member of L.A. Sweat, a cycling group for women. Thomas' biography on the team's website states, Tiffany is a scientist by day, athlete by night. Her favorite organ are the blood cells. Hmm. You will never see anyone with a bigger smile than when she sees a beautiful electron microscope picture of a red cell. She has never met a barbell, a bike, or a dog that she doesn't like. She is so incredibly excited to race and represent the L.A. Sweat team this year. Now, the thing that is so fascinating to me, I'll tweet out this picture so you guys can see it, the thing that is so fascinating to me is the second and third place women are so happy. They're smiling. They're excited. They're celebrating while this biological man towers over them and steals their championships. This woman's cycling team hosts this person on their website and pretends like this man is a woman and oh, she's so excited. I feel like I'm in the Twilight Zone. When I look at these women, I cannot even relate one Iota. I don't understand. I really do feel like, what am I missing? I feel like the only one these days who isn't willing to go along with this charade, who doesn't understand that this is really robbing women of all of the things that our ancestors fought for. I'm drawing a blank here. What am I missing? I don't get it. Are they just this stupid? What I want is when that starting gun goes off for everybody to stay and there he goes. Or just don't show up. Or just don't show up. And don't show up. But this is where I want to teach my daughters. In racing, we say rubbing is racing. Why some of the women didn't just nick a back tire somewhere in the race, just send him off into the ditch. It's time to fight back. Honestly, it's time to fight back. I mean, why you let a guy like this come in and impose and completely degrade. It's not even about cycling anymore. Look at that. I mean, there it is. It's in your face. You don't matter. That's a bulge, man. You value. Oh my gosh. It's disgusting. It really is. Absolutely disgusting. It's disappointing to Sarah that women are not outraged. Look at their faces. Look at their faces. Tell me that that's fake. That's not fake. They're celebrating. They're genuinely excited at their. And what they're doing is what they're doing is they are now complicit in degrading all women because they're not standing for women. They're not fighting for their people. So all of a sudden, oh, at least I've got second. You, you're a loser. Right. Other women. And I'm chumming up here with dude over here. So I don't know. I mean, it's like 100 years of feminism has come full circle because they wanted to be equal to men. Well, now men are going to be equal to you too. And we can just switch teams. So I don't know. This is like so absurd in the most literal sense of the word. This is just so crazy that you can't help but just kind of like laugh at it and kind of I don't know. I don't know along with it, but it is just sort of entertaining. Like this idea that like men have conquered everything. And now we're going to like conquer womanhood and then maybe the stars or something like that. And the fact that women like you mentioned are so willing to go along with it because and they're like hierarchy of needs. They need to be perceived as a virtuous person by celebrating this person who is obviously delusional is greater than the need to like feel the glory of victory. So if like, you know, I don't think, well, the biological component is real. But say you had a woman who were just like really good at some sport and she were actually like beating the men or something. I don't think men would go along with it as easily because we'd be like, wait a minute. I know I earned this. You shouldn't be involved in this competition. But I think women because they're more agreeable and more susceptible to that social pressure. They're like literally now having to go along with their own, like you mentioned, erasure because it gives them a greater sense of validation than if they wanted to, you know, get first place in the competition. But men won't have to, men won't have to go through that because as we know, men are stronger than women. And so they're never going to have to face that. And that used to be like a totally acceptable obvious thing that we could say is well men are stronger than women. So they would have the obvious advantage. Now it's like, whoa, wait, you're not allowed to say that because men and women are equal. So you can't say that. You can't. But Sarah, you know, we say women should stand up. But honestly, men in this country should stand up to you. There's the men defending women. I mean, honestly, and we are, but we can't go, never go along with it. This is, I just, I don't know guys. I come from a different, I'm from Africa man. You take a guy like that behind the shed and you straighten him out. That's what you do with the guys. You straighten the guy out. I mean, you're just like, dude, you're not going to go compete against the women. Come race us boys. And if you come in a hundredth place, that's where you belong. Pick on someone your own side. Absolutely. He's absolutely right. The problem with the way that like education has sort of devolved, they've removed the ability for young men to socialize each other by like, I call it sexual McCarthyism, you know, when you're a gay, you're just like, stop being gay. No, you're gay. Like that, you need to be able to do that. That's how men check each other. It doesn't mean you're being homosexual. You're just being gay. And then you correct the behavior and you move on. But now you can't do that. It's offensive. That's me. No bullying, zero tolerance. And not coincidentally, we've produced like the most bizarre generation of people ever. So yeah, I mean, but now they bullying women, the degrading women. So the watchmen, this is again, this is Ezekiel 33 seven, the watchmen on the wall are not warning the bloods on their hands. It's disgusting all around. And that I go back to the beginning of the show. A person doesn't fix that. That's culturally morally. We've cut a real problem. This when you don't uprise against this horse crap, okay, of degrading women and letting some dude press and prance his way into dominating girls. No, dude, I'm sorry. The rest of the world are laughing at us. We are looking so weak. I mean, why wouldn't China think they can take us? Well, I just want to state for the record. I would be very happy if I, as long as I live, I never had to see another transgender woman in cycling pants. Just like Dylan Mulvaney says, you know, the bulge is natural. It's perfectly normal. If you're a guy. Did you see the video of him as like a gay man prancing around to and then the only difference is now he sees a woman? Yes. You know, on it and, oh. Well, there, I mean, they're racing gay people too. Well, that's the thing. Gay people have always been like really annoying and people forgot. People forgot because trans people came around. People forgot that that's how gay people lacked because trans people are telling me I'm wrong. John, wait. There, anyone can be annoying. You can't just say a whole subset of people are annoying. I can't. I can't do that. I'm not on my YouTube channel because I don't want to get in trouble. John, you're never annoying. What are they going to do? They're going to come take your trophy. You know, you're going to have like Sam Gonzalez come hosting. All right, we're going to take a break. We'll be right back. Cut his mic. Audio. So the city of Philadelphia has now agreed to pay $9.25 million to more than 300 people who claimed that they suffered physical and emotional injuries during the violent protest following the death of George Floyd. This is in regards to the protesters that were gathered along with it. There was an interstate, right? They're blocking traffic. They're gathered along interstate 676. Traffic has stopped. Police arrested them, which they should have. They're lucky they didn't get run over because I may not have been so patient and at least here in Texas, if you fear for your life, what are you going to do? So the plaintiffs are residents of West Philadelphia and others who took part in that protest. However, this one is a fascinating one because the money will be given out, doled out to 343 plaintiffs and mental health counseling will apparently be made available to residents along an unspecified radius, not just plaintiffs involved in the protest. So if you live nearby where people blocked traffic and got arrested, then you are eligible for mental health counseling over it. I feel like this just goes back to your point that you were just making earlier. It's like we're so soft as a society that a city is agreeing to pay these people millions of dollars because they were blocking traffic and authorities used tear gas and pepper spray on them because they wouldn't freaking move. Yeah, it's like the people that glued their hands in museums, you're removing them and they go, I lost skin. Right, it's like, well. Glue to a freaking hand, buddy. That sounds like a consequence of your own actions. I'll never forget. I told our daughter it's now eight. I told her when she was five, she wanted to keep getting up on the stove. And I said, hey, she'll do it one time. And she burned her hand one time and then funny enough, she didn't do it again. Not that I want my child to burn, but I mean, you glue your hand, you sit in traffic, you get pepper spray. But that's how soft we have become. Not just that, there's reparations nonsense. Where does that end, by the way? So the next time the 405 shuts down in LA, a whole bunch of Californians can get emotional damages and emotional harm for missing meetings and sitting in traffic. And in the city of Los Angeles, I have to pay them, that probably will pass because some scumbag lawyer will take the case, form some sort of a class action, and rake in the money from every average American that's willing to pay taxes. Let me give you the Philadelphia mayor's statement. The pain and trauma caused by a legacy of systemic racism and police brutality against black and brown Philadelphians is immeasurable. We hope this settlement will provide some healing from the harm experienced by people in their neighborhoods in West Philadelphia and during demonstrations on ICE 676 in 2020. So that's just not true. I mean, it's like crazy how the more things change, the more they stay the same. I read an article from Time Magazine from 1958, and it was talking about the problem of black crime in cities. And all of the leadership was saying that this is because of police brutality, this is because of, they didn't use the word systemic racism, but the way they described it was how we would now understand systemic racism. And it's like this has been a problem forever. And for some reason, leadership within that community has never wanted to really like clamp down on it and has always just continued to be a problem. And instead, they want to redirect attention towards America or the system or white people and just think that if we keep throwing money at this community who's obviously hurting, that's going to somehow like fix the problems. But that's obviously not the case. And I think we've spent like a trillion dollars in the war on poverty since the 1960s. It's actually gotten worse in terms of the crime rates, in terms of the gap in home ownership. Like the test scores, nothing has improved and we're just like rinsing money away for nothing. So it's ridiculous and it doesn't do anything to help. It just divides people more. Money does not solve a single problem. It is a tool, a very functional tool, a great tool to have, difficult when you don't have it. But it does not take heart, heart away, never kind of fix a racial conversation, right? Look at South Africa, 26 years of a black government running that country that's now in shambles. We are basically back at civil war yesterday, strikes throughout the country, riots, and it's black on black. The whites are just onlookers. They're not even involved because now it's like a black community saying, you're stealing from us. You lie to us and they've thrown billions in the truth and reconciliation commission and reparations into the black community. Heck, we had a president that promised that every single black person would get a washing machine from the government and then he couldn't deliver. And then they got mad at him. And now 26 years later, still no change, it's worse. It's never going to work. But the left run those cities and they do this. This is the Jeremiah rights, Lewis Farakons, the Jesse Jackson's that they are the racist that perpetuate the narrative because they rake it in. These are the guys. They don't want this is why. Every single city that's run by Democrats somehow has black on black crime. You know what the biggest scam is too that no one will even touch this because of how consequential it is? The pastors and the churches. These are people who drive like very nice cars, they have very nice suits and jewelry and watches and everything they live in. These big houses because the church pays for it all. So on paper, they're broke. And they'll sell certain messages to the people who they're preaching to. And instead of selling something that's more positive and more, I guess, taking action towards bettering the community as a whole and not airing grievances and pointing the fingers, they won't do that because if any person comes in and tries to win an election in that district or so, they will meet with these people. And it's like your junior Al Sharpton's and they'll basically have a conversation and let's them know like, hey, you're going to have to give me money here. Help me out here. Because if you don't, I might go tell my church that you're trying to hurt the community or whatever. And they know that they can sway these people's votes like that. So yeah, there's got to be a huge conversation pretty soon because otherwise things are just going to get worse. Speaking of pastors, I've got quite the video for you after the break. We'll be right back. I should say. Reverend Dr. Caleb J. Lyons has gone viral on social media for proclaiming that drag is holy much. Drag is holy. There has been an assault on the rights of drag performers in this country and we must call out the hypocrisy and the injustice. Jesus called himself a mother hen longing to gather up her chicks. Gender is a construct, you see. And if Jesus can be a mother hen, then you can dress in drag. I've even heard it said that Jesus was and humanity is God in drag. So let me say this again for those of you in the back, drag is holy. And his whole church dresses in drag. That is blasphemy. He should drop to his knees and thank God that he's not struck by lightning where he's standing. Smoked into a pulp. There's no biblical reference for it. I'm going to say this and I'm going to shut my mouth because I don't cuss and I'm about to light up a storm here. He is attacking the man I serve which is Jesus Christ. He is attacking the truth. He's sending people to hell literally with his words. Sexual immorality according to Jesus which he quotes and God is an abomination to God. John? We got to take him behind the shed or something. I don't know if he's going to take him. Another one behind the shed. By the way, nobody's after drag queens. We just don't want you sexualizing children. I don't know how that is so hard to understand. I'm after. Stream and subscribe to more Blaze Media content at theblaze.com slash podcasts."
