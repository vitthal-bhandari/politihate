We have our friend Chadwick Moore. He is a contributing editor at the spectator. He is a New Yorker man who knows a thing about some stuff or stuff about some things Chad. Good to see you. Hey Buck great to be here. All right man. Let's let's let's get into this first off. You wrote a book. So you've been sent to diversity training. I got a wonder first of all have you ever had to go through diversity training? Because I have at many levels yes in college then in the federal government then local government the NYPD and then you know a little bit on the corporate side not as much. So tell me about this. Oh I should have interviewed you for the book. I did go to a four year public university. So that was four years of diversity training even you know how long ago was I graduated. But I've you know I've been so removed from the corporate world my whole life that was sort of on purpose I wanted to design my life so I never had to go into an office. So I was really fascinated about what was happening in corporate America because I think corporate America sort of interesting and all of its all its mundane actions. And I but I did go to diversity training when I was writing for magazines other liberal magazines I went to an NYPD diversity training seminar which is a very interesting thing. Which I included in the book and wrote about that. I've had to go to one of those because I worked in the Intel division but keep going. Oh yeah yeah so you know it was about yeah that was a that was a really fun and interesting experience. But also that was that diversity training I went to was in 2015 and that was before the summer of our Floyd which of course across the spectrum both in private and in the public sector. Diversity training took a really nasty hateful and very racialized take after the riots of summer 2020 and after George Floyd's death. So a lot of that a lot of this stuff in the book is I was talking to people during this time or meet the right afterwards so they were noticing how things had changed and how HR had sort of ramped up the really sort of grotesque racial rhetoric that has no place in well anywhere in society but especially on the job and in the public sector. So what did you find you wrote this book the research the book. It's worth your thought right that's that's I have a feeling we're going to that direction. Well it's interesting because you know I like that fun so I knew this would be a fun thing to write about and talk about and I wanted to mock these people I want to talk about the ridiculousness and I wanted to get every day people's perspective. So I talked to guys on all rigs I talked to police officers I talked to guys in the military talked to people who work on you know retail sales floors IT directors. So all walks of life across the economy and just sort of wanted to know like what's your experience with diversity training what do you think is going on here. And a lot of people were you know we're so it's such a part of our society now they at first they would sort of say like why don't we know why you care about this stuff you know here's what happened here's my experience and the more they thought about it the more they remember the more they talked about it the kind of more disturbed they got that by what they sort of been forced to sit through and it also it's you know but my favorite was this guy who I called Jeremy of course nobody I interviewed one to be identified by name because they're all scared of being fired from their jobs if they speak about these things. But he worked on oil rig he works on oil rig off the coast of Newfoundland in Canada in the Atlantic Ocean. And the first thing he says to me is I you know I said so tell me about what's happening on the job with the diversity train he said well just yesterday we had pink shirt day on the rig. And I'm like excuse me. Yeah all these guys in the oil rig had to wear pink shirts for some diversity cause this was during COVID so they end up pink face masks. And then they had to take pictures of everyone in the pink shirts to send it to corporate because corporate you know it's the oil industry so of course they're in the cross hairs of Canada's Liberal government. The resources minister of Canada is from that area so he's the representative from Newfoundland. So they really got to like you know cozy up the way that the oil industry in particular and I documented this not just in Canada but around the world. One way the oil industry is is cozying up to Liberal governments is through this diversity stuff. You know there's gay pride is very big in the oil industry for these guys on oil rigs. They have to work a pride t shirts in June and take a photo. The Canadian resource minister who I just spoke about this guy is in charge of of course handing out all the drilling contracts. He's openly gay and it's a big deal for him. So when you start looking at things like that that's just one example you start to see really what corporate America gets out of all this stuff. You know we talk about like why is corporate America so woke obviously like the CC sweet executives are probably conservative. They're probably conservative people but yet they let their corporations go so completely blindly woke and then you start looking more into the political favors they're trying to gain from it and it starts to make a lot more sense. Of course the detriment from what I've seen in the corporate world and also in the administrative upper rationalons and academia and even in the federal government. Certainly there are people there are many different levels of why the politically correct pressure or the wokeness whatever people want to call it why it is so powerful and one of them is that it's really the only way like once one person on let's say the board of a company is a racial Marxist let's say or gender Marxist a woke person. Everybody else on that board lives in fear because that person wields a certain power that can destroy the reputation and possibly career of everybody else around them. Just just but that's the power that is wielded in these room. So so yeah you know the CEO maybe is a capitalist let's just say and some of these places that's not even really the case but the CEO may be a capitalist. But if his chief marketing officer and certainly chief of you know diversity decides that that CEO is insufficiently devoted to the cause and go to the board and say you guys either get rid of the CEO or you're all racist bigoted and in on it too right and it's very hard to get for a lot of these places it's actually hard to get fired. The only way you get fired is by upsetting DEI in HR. Yeah that's exactly right and if there's one thing that that top executives never ever want it's to be the subject of a Twitter mob or to have their face in the paper unless it's of course some fluffy business article praising them for great leadership. So they will do anything to avoid that sort of attention it doesn't matter if there can what their political persuasions are but you're you're right when you mention that one person on the board because that's just sort of a microcosm for our society that we're living in anyway where there's the tiny tiny vocal but absolutely terrifying minority that has nothing better to do and basically nothing better to live for than to take on these causes because it somehow feeds them or makes them feel worthwhile or gives their life meaning or whatever and they turn it into absolutely a religion and a belief that they enforce with religious fervor which of course means that anything they do is justified means to the ends and they have no problems whatsoever destroying people's lives and going scorched earth for their very strange and so I think that's why I called social religion. Yeah I'm fond of reminding people that in the Russian Civil War and the beginning of the Soviet Union you know there were the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks the Bolsheviks took on the name majoritarians essentially. Even though they never represented any majority of any part of the society really in fact their Mensheviks would have had more popular support if anyone actually looked at what was going on in the country at the time but they call themselves the majority and then they were just the most committed and saying radicals and essentially ate all the other fish in the aquarium. That is how they, that is how this stuff plays out that's how it works like it's not actually I think people sometimes confuse political even in the corporate world political power with the agreement or even a majority agreement of everybody involved like you have a couple of committed leftist Marxist types in the upper echelons of a university of a corporation and they can turn the whole place upside down. That's the actual reality I think that people see and also the DE on the DEI side you know they they're hiring and hiring based upon these very explicit criteria of you know gender and identity diversity and racial diversity and all these different things. Well that has an effect too right I mean the CEOs of these companies whether it's you know Twitter or Disney are scared of the 25 year olds you know threatening to stage some kind of a walk out and create bad press. I mean 25 year olds who work for them. Right. Yeah yeah they are yeah it's the insane bratty children who are running the asylum and you know I remember this back when I was working in liberal media and it was you know the the older editor of the program. The older editors who are maybe a few years older than me were very liberal but not insane and definitely not woke and would certainly support having a more conservative view in their publications or at least you know going to do that. And and and things I would write that were maybe more conservative they defended but you would see the 25 year olds in the office. Literally signing online petitions against publicly against their employer saying that they don't support this and this is hateful blah blah blah blah blah blah. And it's just so astounding to me I could never imagine going against your boss like that even if you disagree with these young people have absolutely no qualms because they know they have the mob to back them up. What you're mentioning earlier not just with Russia I mean it's as far as I know your your background and this is much better than mine. Almost every time there's been some sort of violent sudden revolutionary Marxist takeover of any country it's always been that tiny percent. Yes. And pretends that they're a majority. Correct. Every single time. That is your 100% correct that is the playbook. These these extreme and they try to co-opt other groups or more moderate in the beginning and say yeah this is about the people and the workers and then it's you do what we say we control everything. We control everything or relying you up against the wall and shoot you. That's always the way that this stuff actually goes but you know power the people power the people sure. I want to ask you chat about the the activist LGBT community and the gay community specifically and how this drag queen story hour for kids thing is somehow always being turned into the struggle for like by Democrats and by activists. They always compare this to like the struggle for gay rights and I want to I want your take on this in in just a second. We'll get into we'll get into this. Okay friends I want to prepare you because things are going to get rough out there in the economy. The recent bank failures or the nation's largest collapse of a financial institution since 2008 $200 billion plus was held just in Silicon Valley bank. So you know you can get rocked right now and who knows what's going to happen tomorrow. So if you've been on the fence about buying gold and silver now is the time to make that call and to take action. Gold and silver can be a protection for your portfolio but can also be used as currency and we could use them for currency at some point. Why not just have a little golden silver on hand in case and protect your portfolio. I've got gold and silver here at home now is the time to call the Oxford Gold Group here what they have to say the phone calls free. That's why I get my gold and silver from securing your IRA or 401k with real gold and silver is a portfolio protection plan and Oxford gold has made it as easy as one, two, three, one app, one call and you pick your precious metals. That's it. You now own real precious metals just like I do mine came from the Oxford Gold Group like I said years ago so I've done really well. I'm going to keep doing well. Call the Oxford Gold Group today about our additional free bonus opportunities you could be eligible for 833404 gold. Get some gold and silver today. You know inflation gold and silver you want to hedge 833404 G.O.L.D. Our chat explain this to me as a gay man. What is the response of the the majority would you say of your friends who are also from the LGB TQ community? When you have Joe Biden say you know what we have to do about transgender surgery for kids. We have to you know do a thing like we did for marriage equality. And I'm sitting here and I just I'm like a 13 year old having puberty blockers and a double mastectomy because she thinks that she's actually a man is a very different thing than two consenting adults who want to get married. I mean I think whatever one that I think that's pretty straightforward but there's always this effort to connect these things. Yeah so the reaction of the gays you know publicly is obviously a petrified silence because of course they're terrified of saying anything that goes against once again that vocal minority we're just discussing but privately it's horrifying. I mean not just any I mean any normal sane person and of course there are plenty not all but plenty of normal sane gay people would look at this on so many levels as the disgusting Joseph Mangala level experiment that it is on children. This transgender beautiful mutilating mutilating excuse me of kids. One thing though that is sort of particular to the gays that they rarely almost never would say in public but absolutely 100% say in private is this looks like conversion therapy it looks like medical eyes conversion therapy. It look you see I think you see a lot of gay people saying like you know I was maybe a more feminine little boy or maybe I was a more butch little girl like a little tomboy. And what if I had some Harvard professor parents that said well you know you can be a boy you can be the other sex if you actually what you might actually be that. How would I react and I probably would have said oh yeah sounds great yes let's do it. And then absolutely you know signed yourself up for a life of medical dependency and mutilation and sterility and everything that comes with that in psychological care. So it's really scary and disgusting on that and you know another thing that's interesting is the country in the world that performs the most sex change operations well the second most versus Thailand the country forms the second most sex change operations is Iran where of course it's illegal to be gay they will kill you. And the reason for that is the government base for sex change operations because they look at it as a cure for your homosexuality. So that's interesting when we're thinking about what's happening here with the left with this whole it's so bizarre because the people who are pushing this stuff. It's it's mostly trans old trans activists who started too late so they don't quite look the way they think that they should look think that if they just started his children their lives would be perfect. And then you have straight people and particularly straight liberal moms that are really pushing this it's almost like they want a little transgender pet that they can show off at cocktail parties they want to feel special and unique and diverse by having this in their family. Maybe it's like a kind of munchaus and syndrome by proxy I don't know but you have these parents are pushing this and it's so pathetic and so strange and you see these moms taking their kids to drag shows. And I truly think that they believe it's some sort of civil rights crusade that they're embarking on by taking their children their toddlers to see half naked gay clowns dancing around to pop music. They almost think like they're marching on Selma or something. It's super strange but the only thing that does same with the trans stuff the drag queen story hour it hurts gay rights it hurts gay people. Well no problem with gays they got a gay neighbor a gay hairdresser who knows no problem live and let live attitude but then you have this being forced upon society and this becomes a face of gay now you have to bring your kids to a drag show. And no one can support that actually creates a more discord and miss more hatred if there is any towards gay community. It's something it's truly bizarre and six situation I also think it's interesting that like so many arguments made by the left and by the activist class of the left. They went from this isn't really happening why are you so focused on it to now it's all over the place. I mean the the Attorney General for the state of New York. Let's just you James is sponsoring a drag queen story hour for children right okay so so we're no we're way past this all why are you talking about it it's not really a thing no no they've made this a thing. And you know if if a normal like date you know if a thirty five year old woman wanted to wear fish nets and a thong and shake her butt in front of five year olds. Literally as we see in these videos and things like four or five year olds with their parents you know there. I would think there was something deeply wrong with that woman. A man with like you know is is. I mean I can't with the fish nets and like you know the man thighs and everything else shaking is behind in front of small children like this is grotesque. And yet if you break you have any you know antifa has started showing up protecting these these things as well I mean this is become a central cause for the left. And what's amazing is that if you take it all up the White House level I mean Joe Biden. Mr. like I'm a union guy from Delaware centrist moderate Democrat grandpa which is all bull crap but that's his whole that was the whole branding pitch. He's on board with drag queen story hour for kids and for drag shows for children. Yeah and I keep finding myself thinking you know like like I love drag as adult nightlife entertainment you know I love. Yeah I love the the the the campiness and I love you know the riddle tree and I do think that you do have some talented drag queens out there. I know our straight guys who really enjoy going to what they have a ray with the ladies that are not really much in clothing on in who dance. Sometimes people call their bills but they're adults. Right of course and I just I never thought I'd see other of these things in my lifetime this pretty children into it is so sick and weird. I tried to grapple with like who are these drag queens that are doing this that would actually perform for the children and the best thing I can come up with is I mean first if you watch the videos and you know anything about drag like they are. They're not they're not the top of the totem pole when it comes to talent they're kind of like the lower like booger drag queens. So there's that they're probably really poor they're probably like oh I need 50 bucks of these this library is going to be able to show up. They're probably extremely low IQ they're not very smart people but also in their mind I can't I'm going to give the benefit of the doubt and say that they're not all pedophiles. And I know that a lot on the right it's this whole rhetoric and grooming which is you know a very real real thing especially with teachers. I have to believe that they're not all pedophiles and they're just sort of stupid and poor and also I would think that they have some thing in the back of their mind they think that there's some gate in the room that's going to see them and then feel more comfortable so they think they're doing some sort of good service. Or they also justify it on the grounds of well I'm sort of dressed like Beyonce would be dressed and they probably see Beyonce doing this on TV so it's fine. That does excuse any of its grotesque and children shouldn't even be seen Beyonce doing that but I struggle to under I I don't understand why anyone would sign up to perform for children in that manner. Can I have you get the parents are doing this and I don't even even understand their psychology and I think they're pathetic for it but. If the if the response to this was you know from from the activists and the left and whatever was all right fine you know no more with the kids we're just going to do. No one's complaining about drag shows for adults. That's like not even a thing and they like to pretend that it's anti LGBTQ and anti trans entity that there is nobody on the right who is making noise because we weren't making noise about drag shows you know the last 20 years nobody cares. Some people like it. Some people go to it that's fine. They're adults for children. We're talking about for kids and what's interesting is that they double down on it. You know even now it has been called out there saying no this is I mean the attorney general for New York state right I mean this is not some fringe political figure. It's it's really it's crazy what's what's going on and I think it's it. Go ahead. No I was I was. No I think I lost my shirt on. They. Oh yeah yeah well in the same vein also they absolutely love it they absolutely love it because they can cry hatred and oppression. You know now it's you know you see like what's that show who pulls your average I've been watched a long time but. You know other posts like drag is under attack now in this country it's like no it's not it's just the children but they love this because they desperately need fundraising they desperately need. Things to to to to to to to to to why they need issues they need things that they need issues they need issues status and but what I was going to say is the same the same the same thing kind of happens with the books that are in some of the kids libraries. They always say the Ron DeSantis for example in Florida is banning books. That's just a lie it would be like saying we're trying to talk about banning drag no one's trying to ban drag shows. It's about the appropriateness of a of content for children and did you see that he did it was brilliant Ron DeSantis did a press conference they started to put up on the screen photos of some of the books that were in that were being given to these kids from their school sharing you know sharing wall library whatever they have and it was so pornographic that the news cameras had to turn off. Oh yeah. Oh oh the left crying about book burning is my favorite thing ever there suddenly care about speech when it's a pornography graphic novels for five years old now they care about speech but don't you dare crack a joke on Twitter because then you deserve what you're getting as well as to be fired from your job just wonderful just wonderful. And I remember the left this whole recent spade of banning books in schools started with the left I believe it was books like Huck Finn and these American classics and use words that are now outdated. Now they're editing the map of the fact is you know they're going back they're changing rural doll they're changing they're changing Samuel Clemens Mark Twain you know they're changing these different these different authors. You mentioned something by the way joke on Twitter not seeing a lot of Chad for those you don't know used to use to throw fiery bombs all over the place on Twitter we're not seeing as much these days I want to ask what's going on there.

Yeah. Where you been buddy you're not really you're not really throwing down anymore. What's going on? I'm not man you know what I mean? Okay. Well I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm I'm Yeah, if you're 12 years old you can have your little cat filter from snapchat But you know once you get to be an adult this so I always thought that snapchat was was preposterous And all the other thing too is I was like hey this it all disappears. It's the internet. It doesn't disappear It goes somewhere they have whatever you're sending it goes somewhere So that was the other part of this is like oh people were like you can just send whatever photos. I want to be like Oh Don't worry it's gonna be totally gone. No one's story somewhere in a black So yeah, no, I just I wonder you know I feel like we've had in some ways It's almost like we finally broke into the party here You know we finally got past the bouncers for social media on the right after being really shut out for the last few years And this party is looking kind of dead right now. It's not a lot going on the kegs are running dry You know they've switched from a live band to like the you know Shlumpy DJ. It's not good It's true and maybe a part of that is that the left is more they're not as fun right now because They're well, they're subdued because they got their guy in office But also they're seeing how crazy and insane everything is so they don't have that fervor They did during the Trump years which made it so fun to torment them and and see what sort of crazy things They're saying maybe if we have a Republican president after this one then the left will get newly entertaining and social media But did you get some Trump retweets back in the day? No, I never got a Trump. Oh So I'll tell you this was the I got I did there was I got six Trump retweets in a row was It was like my Trump's Just bucks exit and and it was funny because I remember I got like weird text messages from people Who I don't know from work anymore, you know from from media world anymore whatever like high school classmates were like Hey, man, like I guess the big guy really like you know What is this but the best part of it was that in that that was the high point of Twitter in a lot of ways Even though the left was cheating and doing all kinds of stuff and they use it to steal the election That's a whole other conversation but the one of the high points of it was That if you got in the Trump even if you didn't get a retweet from him But you just kind of got into that like Trump hashtag world all of a sudden some like a third tier actor from like 1994 that you saw in some B action movie would be like talking smack to you You're like wait you like like yeah How did this happen like the guy from one of the guys from one of those SV you shows was like girl Like maybe if you actually loved your country bub I'm like It's like aren't you like aren't you like you know detective? You know, mccollie or something like what like how did this happen? I? Remember when I got like a retweet or a follow from not so not not a mean one But a nice way is it from Kato Kaitlyn. Oh, yeah My Twitter Kato Kaitlyn amazing. Yeah, okay. Oh great childhood You know, I mean he's I mean he's obviously well established in conservative circles, but through Twitter I got to know Oh Kevin Sorbo cuz I used to love the Hercules legendary journey shows when I was a when I was a kid I thought that was a lot cuz I love Greek mythology Some other fun ones like other Twitter people. I mean James Woods James Woods is one of the only people who on Twitter I mean, I'm like I'm agreeing with all this tweets, but sometimes I'm kind of like oh That's like a that's like a curb stomp like It hurts to watch that, you know, you know, they have some of those videos We're like a you know like a gymnast will fall a certain way or something and they just like and you're just like or even more skaters a skater will you know hit the rail and And you just like those gym videos where they break an arm like mid curl Some of the James Woods tweets against the Libs. I just felt bad for the Libs. I was like, oh man He he goes he went he went rough in the paint like that's a guy that threw some elbows back in the day So anyway, there's so much talent on Twitter. There's so many people were so good at Twitter That is an amazing thing definitely, you know what I mean? I hope they bring it back and it gets to be fun like it like it used to be it's got all these problems now But we'll see but Chadwick will come back if it's fun. Maybe he'll make it fun.
