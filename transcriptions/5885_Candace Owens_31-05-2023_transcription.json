    "text": " All right, guys. Happy Wednesday. Question of the day today. If a family member of yours, maybe your son, your daughter, your husband, your wife, did something illegal, would you report them to the police? Am I be thinking, can this? How illegal? How are we talking? Just anything at all. Maybe, you know, they were drunk driving. Maybe they've done something more horrific. Maybe they harmed somebody. Maybe they stole from somebody. Would you report that individual? And I'm sure a lot of you guys are watching this and thinking, of course I would. I would, of course, I would do the moral thing. But I think there's something else bubbling beneath the surface there. And I think that's easy for us to judge on the outside. But clearly, when it comes to our biology, it's not as easy as it looks. And I'm counting myself among people that judge. I look at situations and I say, how could you stand by this person? How could you go to the courthouse and sit in a pew next to this individual? I mean, the whole thing just seemed so crazy. Plus, I'm around the show and almost further to that point, we're going to be discussing Jill Duggar because she has spoken out to reveal how her father, Jim Bob, tried to cover up her brother Josh's molestation of her and her sisters to save the family's reality show. That was what was driving her father to cover up some very serious crimes. Let's talk about all of that and much more today on Candace Owens. So I've got family on my mind today. Well, family's always on my mind. I am not a person that believes that you can count yourself as a conservative if you do not believe in the family unit, the true biological family unit. And if you're supporting wombs being created by science and saying that we don't need women anymore, we just need artificial wombs to create children. I'm like, mmm, doesn't sound like to me that you are a conservative because when you really get into conservative ideology and you start to realize what it is that we are conserving, it automatically brings you back to family in every single regard, which is the only way, as we speak about on the show all the time, to make sense of what the lot is doing. Everything that they're doing is to destroy the family unit. Welfareism, destroying the family unit, marrying mothers to the state, marrying fathers to the state and telling them not to marry one another. When we talk about atheism in general, why there seems this push to create false idols, like Beyonce, we talked about the Beyonce mass last week. Well, that is because they want, they can control Hollywood, they can control the state and they can give you false idols. They don't want you to believe in God or believe in a source that could possibly be higher than something that the state can control. The LGBTQ narrative, obviously, children mutilating their bodies, lesbians, marrying lesbians, gays, marrying gays, of course, they're not going to be able to grow up to have productive families. It is a disruption to the family unit, of course. The entire queer movement is disruption to the family unit. Climate change, even encouraging children to be fearful that they are not going to have a future and at the same time telling them that it would be irresponsible for them to aspire to have families. How dare you want to have a family? Why would you want to have a family? Don't you realize the plan is going to be dead in 10 years? Don't you realize that kids create carbon emissions? You don't want to be creating so much carbon emissions. Why don't you agree to have no children over and over again? You see this. I'm starting to wonder whether or not the left has been successful in destroying the family units. Because when I look around me and I examine the things that seem to seize our attention the most culturally, when I see the headlines that are being grabbed, it usually becomes the most compelling story when it is a family that has been destroyed, hence, Prince Harry and Meghan and my general anger and frustration at how despicable he has to be to have quite literally for a dollar sold his family out. For millions of dollars, he said, you know what, I have an amount I am willing to sell out my niece. I am willing to sell out my brother. I am willing to sell out my dad. I will dance on my mother's dead grave for the right amount. And he did it. He wasn't about fighting races. I moved on for free. He was spoken about it in left and resumed his life. It was all about the almighty dollar, which of course is utterly demonic. And then I saw this headline, which is Mel Gibson's younger brother. Of course, you guys know Mel Gibson. He is probably most famed for the passion of the Christ. And his younger brother, Donald, maybe it's something about the second brother, Prince Harry dynamic going on here, is speaking out and revealing that they have a bitter rift. And of course, because I am human, I saw this headline, I instantly clicked it and I wanted to read because I realized that there is something really backwards and really wrong about a brother speaking about his own flesh and blood to the press. What could be driving this? I asked myself as I curiously hit the headline. Of course, I knew the answer was going to be money. But this got way more despicable than I could have ever imagined. So it's important to note that his younger brother is 65 years old, right? He is, well, he's a senior citizen now, right? You would think that that would imply that he had reached some sort of maturity, but spare yourselves, guys, don't from that thought because that is not what we are about to come across. So I'm 65 years old, Mel Gibson's younger brother by a couple of years, shares the same piercing blue eyes, the article, right? And the rugged good looks that made his sibling a global superstar. They were once so close that Mel gave Donald apart in Braveheart and encouraged him to pursue his own Hollywood dreams. I don't remember that. So Mel found success in Hollywood and then he yielded his success by trying to help his younger brother by giving him a part in his movie Brave Heart, which is an incredible movie. If you haven't seen it, Mel Gibson is a star. He has the IT factor and he's incredible. So now they have a rift and he is speaking out in this interview and saying he can't fathom that they're not talking. He can't fathom that they haven't been in touch for years. They used to share a bedroom, he says. We did absolutely everything together. And now he feels that something changed his brother. And the reason why he is choosing to speak out now is because his devout Catholic brother, Mel, is about to start working on a sequel to the Passion of the Christ. And that sequel is called Resurrection. Stay with me. Remember that the sequel is called Resurrection. Now, in case you forgot, when the original film The Passion of the Christ was released in 2004, which covered the final 12 hours of Jesus' life known as the Passion It created a firestorm. Some people perceived it as anti-Semitic, which obviously as a Christian, I think that is an absolute garbage take. We have to be able, of course, to discuss the Bible, to discuss these historical events without being accused of anti-Semitism. But, and clearly, the world agreed with me because it ended up being the highest grossing independent movie of all time, taking in $612 million worldwide at the box office. And Mel had self-financed this film. So, he became worth hundreds of millions of dollars overnight. And his brother was very upset by this because he claims that his Hollywood career, which was his brother giving him a part, him having a few speaking roles because he was going around saying a Mel Gibson's brother, went down the drain and he was blacklisted because of these sins of his brother. He says that I was getting, quote, I was getting regular work before The Passion of the Christ, but I think people thought Mel was an anti-Semite. So, they thought that I was too. I believe I was blacklisted and Mel was okay because he had millions that were pouring into the bank. He says that he was incredibly angry by this and that he believes that his brother should have stayed away from making this sort of a religious film because religious films always divide people. Now, the reporter who was speaking with him, the journalist that was speaking with his with Donald asks him like, you know, are you suggesting that you would have reached the same acting heights of your brother who brought you to Hollywood and gave you a part? Had it not been for his film The Passion of the Christ? And he says, quote, I believe Mel's actions meant that I couldn't get work. The Gibson name was toxic. My agent dumped me and the phone stopped ringing. He said that Mel offered to help him out financially and offered him a small family-owned flat to live in. But he believes that because his brother made this film, he should have compensated him for the pain and the suffering that he and his wife, Shanna's, claimed to have endured because he couldn't get any acting roles because obviously he feels that his brother, I don't know, maybe upset the wrong people, not because he didn't have the same talent or his brother or as his brother or of the same work at the guy's brother. But now he feels that his brother should have taken care of him, should have taken care of him for the rest of his life because his career never took off. Is this sound completely crazy? Well, it's because it is. He then goes on to intimate that every time he asks his brother for money over the last 20 years, his brother became angry with him. And at this point in the interview, he starts basically making his brother sound like he's completely off the handle. He says, Mel shouted at me, telling me that if I was so upset by the Gibson name, I should just change my name. He screamed that I can't guilt him into this and that my problems are my own. Yeah, that sounds about right. Why would your brother have to take care of you financially for the rest of your life because you won't go get a real-world job because you think that you are owed the success that he has for a film that he invested in and that took off and that he is now creating a sequel for called The Resurrection. He says that this, of course, destroyed their relationship and that he feels that his brother owes him something and he has decided that now is the time to speak out because he is making the sequel. You're not going to believe how he's doing it. Well, obviously what happened here is Donald saw what Prince Harry did and he said, I want to do the same thing. If Prince Harry can write spare, I can similarly write a book and sell my brother down the river. So he's writing a book and guess what he's entitling the book? The book is going to be entitled Resurrection. So the second part to the passion of the Christ entitled Resurrection, Donald thinks this is my big chance to make money essentially trying to extort his brother, his brother's fame that is. And I'm going to sell a book by that exact same title. So it is called Resurrection by Donald Gibson and he's going to give you all the dirt that you want to hear about Mel Gibson because he doesn't understand why Mel Gibson just won't give him money. And by him houses, it sounds like his brother might be a socialist. And at the ripe age of 65 years old, he is intending to put some money in his bank account by being a rotten individual. And this story infuriated me reading this, first and foremost because Passion of the Christ is just such a wonderful, beautiful film. And to hear him speaking about this film this way, not because he believes any of the things that he's saying, but because he wants to extort some of his brother's wealth isn't very reading. But beyond that, of course, and why this is of interest to me is because we keep seeing this happening in the media. We keep seeing siblings that have a rift that's common, of course, sibling rivalry is a thing. But seeing family members that speak out for a profit, right, the almighty dollar that is corrupting family members to speak out against each other and to see if you can acquire wealth by doing this shows me at least reveals to me that left has been successful in misaligning our values, really, misaligning our values. It used to be family first. It used to be you never go against the family, right? If you're talking about the classics, you never go against the family. And now it seems like you definitely go against the family if the other side is offering you the right amount of money. And will he find success? I hope not. I hope that Prince Harry was a phenomenon because of the royal aspect and because of an American interest in the royal family and because they thought that they were going to get more than what he actually delivered upon, which was that a spoiled rotten prince who's never worked for anything in his life thinks that he deserves a lot of money with his wife who is willing to pretend that she's suffering as a black person. I hope that that was the meaningless exchange that took place and we're not going to start seeing these sorts of situations where a family can, as I said earlier, sell one another down the river so that they can enrich their own pockets. But I don't know. I don't know anymore. I really, I feel so disbarried when I look out and I read what's happening culturally when I see that people don't have those values and I examine the divorce rates when you hear about families being torn apart because of political differences. Now you're seeing families that are being torn apart because of success and jealousy. That's what's really at root here. And we, I would say as a culture, we just, we need God. So I'm looking forward, I guess, as the way I'll wrap this to the sequel of the Passion of the Christ, which will be called resurrection. And that's all I'm going to say about that. President Trump recently issued a warning from his Mar-a-Lago home. He said, quote, our currency is crashing and will soon no longer be the world standard, which will be our greatest defeat, frankly, in 200 years. There are three reasons essential banks are dumping in the US dollar inflation deficit spending and our insurmountable national debt. Fact is there is one asset that has withstood famine, wars, and political and economic upheaval, dating back to biblical times. And that's gold.

That's Candace to 9898. All right. Now it's time for some topics to show. Okay. Shiny, happy people. The Duggar family secrets. That is the title of what suggests will be an explosive Amazon Prime docu-series looking into the Duggar family. Obviously, they explode onto the scene as this happy wholesome Christian family. And then things really came crashing down when the brother in the family, his name is Josh Duggar, got caught up in a series of scandals and the biggest one being obviously a child pornography scandal, which I honestly do not have the stomach to even recount on the show. I don't even want to speak about it. He is put away in prison. He should never receive a light of day. I actually, personally, for the stuff that he went to prison for, if you're on the fence, pop a death penalty, you read something like that and you suddenly are able to jump to one side of the fence and think that I don't know how people like that live. I really don't. It's beyond disgusting, but pausing that or parking that to the side because I really would rather talk about this series. Joe Duggar is basically speaking out and she's sobbing in the series revealing how her father, Jim Bob, tried to cover up Josh's various scandals, one of them being that he molested her and his sisters. And what she's saying is that Jim Bob, it's her father, did this because he wanted to protect the family empire. So first, let me just show you a teaser of the docu series. Take a listen. You've probably heard of the Duggar family. Everyone knew who the family was. We were part of my BLP as early as I can remember. The biggest feature of Bill Gothard's teachings is authority. Kids obey the parents, lives obey their husbands, everyone. Bill Gothard. Gothard turned every father into a cult leader and every home into an island. I first read the Hamies deal in college. I was like, this is my life. So again, I don't know what is motivating this series. Obviously, aside from public interest in this matter and people are interested in seeing people fall from grace, there was a phenomenon where you just want to see, watch people fall and seeing what's happened to this family and then prying and getting this sister to talk badly about her father and having her cry and saying that the interviews she did were done under duress. All by the way, which could be true. But what I found really interesting about this is that we see this theme over and over and over again. And I was actually discussing this with my team of people that are caught up in these sex scandals, even ones as sinister as sex scandals involving pedophilia. And it seems like the instinct of whether it's a patriarch of the family, the patriarch of an institution like the church or an educational institution, the principle is to cover it up. And I really had a thought about this. What is driving that? Why do people, when faced with something so abhorrent, why isn't their instinct, especially when it comes to a child, to immediately expose this, to immediately put sunshine on this and to get the police involved? Is it because these people are so hideous and so evil and that they themselves condone pedophilia, which I think for a very long time, I thought this. And then I said, it just, it can't possibly be that everyone around them agrees to this as well. Rather, they're being driven by self-interest in some of these categories, which is, well, we must preserve the institution. We've grown so big. If this ever gets out, we're all going to be ruined. They don't even think about the victim. They don't think about the child. They think about themselves and preserving what they've built, I think, is one side of it. And then circumstances like this, Jim Bob, obviously, I don't think no one has ever accused him, the father of committing any sex crimes. And yet they are saying that he did cover up for his son. Is that being driven by biology? And I'm asking this as a question because I, obviously, you guys know I read your comments and I want to hear your feedback. I think the answer here has to be yes. I am so reminded of the various serial killers and the people who have been involved in something horrific who stand by their family members. You will see them in the courthouse, sitting in the courthouse pews. And they're still supporting the person and they'll say, I don't support they did, but this is still my brother. This is still my sister. This is still my son. And I really had to ask myself this question if my child did something horrible. And I'm not talking about even a sex crime. I mean, even if it was, your child gets involved in a drunk driving accident, there was recently that story of the girl who killed a bride and a groom on their wedding night. And her parents are visiting her in prison. Well, of course, like, do you still stand by your child and try to rescue your child's life? And I think the answer is yes. There has to be some component of biology here where parents are looking at this and they're not thinking about the victims, they're thinking about, this is my child. And I have this biological impulse to protect my child. In this situation, it gets really twisted because Jim Bob was protecting one child while harming the others in his protection of him, right? Maybe there was some guilt in the association thinking, I raise this kid. What did I do wrong here? Can I fix him? Can I personally fix him? Or he was just thinking we built an empire and maybe yes, I'm saying to these girls, I am trying to cover this not because I agree with it, but because I think in the long run, what is will help you, what will help the family is for us to maintain the empire we've built. Again, I'm just riffing here off of the cuff because it's hard for me to imagine this scenario. I can't, I literally can't imagine this scenario. I can't imagine what parents feel when they're in these predicaments, when their children really actually do something horrific to ruin their own lives and trying to figure out how we're going to navigate it because it seems so black and white to me. For me, I feel like morality is so black and white where I say, I would instantly walk my child into the police station if this ever happens. But clearly so many people are not doing it that it begs the question like we should be asking ourselves, what are they motivated by? So it's an interesting series. I'm wondering now what Jill is motivated by is it because she has felt this anxiety building and she just genuinely wants to speak out? Or is she now similarly in the same way that she was being, there was this financial incentive for her to keep her mouth shut about what she suffered as a child, which is horrific. There's also now a financial incentive for her to open up about what's happened when she was a child. Who knows? I don't know. I know nothing anymore. I just read the media, I read the headlines and I talked to you about it because the human condition is not, you know, isn't great right now. I would say that we are not in a good state. Need more evidence of that? Well, you're not going to believe this video. It's the craziest thing I think you'll see on the internet today. There's a Twilight star and I'm putting that in air quotations because I've definitely never heard of her name. I don't know if it's Raquel or Rachel Lefevre, but apparently she was in the Twilight series and she played a vampire and therefore you should know who she is. Again, I have no idea who she is, but she is very, very upset about Target Gate. She is so upset and she's not upset like we're upset. She's not like, hey, what's what's up? We don't need tux swimsuits. We don't need these shrines dedicated, focused to children, selling these little pr- this pry clothing. She's on the opposite end of the spectrum and she had this experience where she recently walked into a Target and she didn't see a shrine dedicated to homos and she's freaking out. She's not having a good day and I'm just going to let her take it away because Rachel Raquel Rochelle Lefevre is upset, ladies and gentlemen, hear her in her own words. So I just walked into Target and the right behind me here where you see all these lovely swimsuits. That's where the pride display used to be and I came in here two days ago and my seven-year-old who's non-binary saw it and said, look, mom, it's pride. Look, they're going to celebrate me. And because some people complained and threw some stuff to the ground or I don't know what happened, they have moved the pride section to the back of the store. So the next time my seven-year-old comes to Target or rather I can't bring them here anymore, at least for the entire month of June, because if they walk in and all the other people who walk in and go, where'd it go? I'm going to realize that they are being successful in trying to erase them. We could do so much better than this. We're not supposed to negotiate with the terrorists. We can do so much better than this. She's having a mental breakdown in Target, not because they've done anything to offend her, but because they haven't built a personal shrine for her non-binary child. Oh, we actually have built a personal shrine for her non-binary child. It's just that they've moved it. They moved it a couple of feet. And so now she's saying she can't go into Target for the entire month of June, because how is her child to walk in and say, mommy, this shrine is for me and my non-existent sexuality and my non-existent gender. And thank you, mommy, which by the way has become a meme, like every time someone tweets, my four-year-old just looked up at me and said, mommy, what's happening? Why is it Hillary Clinton, the president? She's actually pulling one of those. My seven-year-old said, thank you, Target, for building this incredible shrine for me. And now her seven-year-old, when he walks into Target and he doesn't see a shrine reminding him that he's special. He's just going to walk 30 more feet to the back. It's disgusting. It's absolutely disgusting. And so for the entire month of June, she's not going to go in there. And I wonder what her experience must be at other stores that don't have shrines for her child, rainbow shrines. Typically, I would say grocery stores stay out of the Pride game, because her daughter just not going to the grocery store, she can't go in. And she can't buy fruits and vegetables for the whole month of June, because her child, who she's clearly raising to be a brat, I would say it's a bratty thing, if you can't walk into a store and without seeing a shrine dedicated to how you feel on the inside, even if the way you feel on the inside doesn't exist, because your child, even if you call your child non-binary, I'm going to bet your child is bound to one of two genders. Guessing, guessing here, I'm going to go, you either have a boy or a girl. Crazy, but I think your child is bound. I think it's very binary. In fact, and it's, to me, like I said, you show me a child that believes that they're non-binary or that they're a special fish or a special snowflake or whatever other animals and cats and dogs think they are, it's a scientific unstable adult. She looks unstable. She's just about to just cry in the middle of a target, because something's been moved 30 feet. That's not normal. That's not a woman that should be in public at all. She's not well. And she, of course, turned the comments off, because people were probably going to tell her that she's not well, even for gay people, even for people who are ludicrous enough to think that they're non-binary, this is a little much. They're like, okay, like we can shop without having a shrine to ourselves. This isn't really what this is about, right? Moving on to the story, guys, I am shooketh to my core. I'm sure you have been following this, because how could anyone not be following this? I have been following it for years, and now that it is going to be turned into a documentary, I am not going to be able to look away. Have you heard this story about the Ukrainian dwarf named Natalia Grace, who essentially this young couple adopted only to discover that Natalia Grace was maybe not a little girl and actually an adult? If this sounds like a movie to you that you may be seeing, a scary movie a long time ago called The Orphan, that's pretty much exactly what happened to this young couple. This all sounds crazy, but you just need to take a listen to the trailer. The truth. I will pre-warn you. You might not like the truth. We were a very tight-knit family. April 26, 2010, that's a day that we adopted Natalia. We had no idea what we were dealing with. She's not six. She was an adult. You could just tell. I'm like, whoa. Natalia was told her new birthday at the orphanage in Ukraine. She threatened to stab my sons. I definitely didn't feel safe around Natalia. You've adopted a kid, and now they're trying to kill you. I mean, it's the stuff of a horror movie. She tried to poison and kill my wife. One night, I opened my eyes and Natalia is standing at the foot of the bed with a knife in her hand. She's tiny. These stories don't make sense. You just don't know what your burn is. The prosecutors went to Ukraine to track down Natalia's biological I'm charged with two pounds of child neglect. Is that correct? Maybe there's more than one villain in this story. Michael accuses Christine of beating Natalia. My mom is definitely not 100% innocent. Bye-bye. Do lie because she told you the lie. Yes. It's like a Rubi's Cube. Just when you think you have a solve, you find out you don't. We were all abused! I hate you. Did you want to hurt him? It's all going to come to light. Be very good if you just quit talking or in safety trouble. Well, kicking down the stairs, we said we're not going to say right. Oh, ****. I stole my microphone on. You got a seatbelt? **** **** up. You guys, I'm in. I am in. I will be watching this. As I said, I have followed the story for years. It seemed unbelievable. But yes, they adopted a Ukrainian dwarf. They got her home. They started realizing that she was getting her period that she had that she just didn't. She wasn't a she was a woman. I guess that's the best way to say it. They took her to the doctor to get her bone tested to see how old she was. They determined according to them at least that she was an adult. Then they sort of obviously kicked her out of the house, but then they got arrested for child neglect because, well, she says that she's six or seven or whoever old she is. And then the neighbors all turned against them. They get divorced. I mean, we are in for a while right here. It's one of these things that you can't even make up. And it really, I think more than anything is going to expose the horrors of the adoption industry. And we are in a circumstance what was the family motivated to go overseas and Ukraine adopted dwarf. There's probably some, it's just interesting what the financial considerations are going to be for that. It sounds like what they're implying in this trailer, which I can't confirm is that maybe the mother who adopted her was also abusive. So many twists and turns, but I just had to cover the story because I have been obsessed with it for such a long time. And it's hard for us to follow if any of this could take place, but it indeed has taken place. So definitely look out for that. I will be watching it and I'll be commenting on it in future episodes. All right, guys, I have to wrap here by pointing you to my favorite new follow. You guys know I don't follow the people on social media, because I think it gives you ADHD when you're following everybody else's life and then you don't live your own. But there is a Tiktoker and her name is Yuri Lasmabella. Now, I'm not on Tiktok. I follow her on Instagram. She's absolutely hilarious. She does spot on parodies of the various members of the Kardashian family. And I can't stop laughing at them. So I just wanted to bring it to you. So you guys can have a laugh today. Take a listen. Oh my God. Kendall and Ben broke up. Nice. Well, that didn't last. Lasted longer than 72 days. Courtney is obviously struggling with something else. My organic chips last longer than that. You know, but she literally did everything for him. She was like watching Univision, Tela Mundo, not Tela Mundo. If you tell her to study the Chili's menu, he was just a lot. Yeah. Like he would go from mad bunny to sad bunny. Yeah. Like glad bunny. Yeah. Too many bunnies. Yeah. How did she do it? She said, wait, hang on. Us avocado. Not an avocado. It's like an organic avocado. I'm sure she said a cup of dough. Literally. What does my 72 days have anything to do with this? I am sorry. Give that girl all the awards. That is just the greatest parody. If you've ever seen up to the Kardashians, exactly that. It's exactly the music. It's exactly their characters. I'm sure that even the Kardashians are following this girl and they must find her to be very funny. I can't get enough of Chloe with the nails and just saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, it's hilarious. It's amazing. You guys already know that faith is a very important part of my life. I am always looking for ways to deepen my faith and to grow closer to God. And that usually begins with prayer.

That's halo.com slash Candace. Hello, the number one Christian prayer wrap in the United States. All right, guys, let's jump into some of your comments from episodes past. First, a few comments from regarding the segment that we did on Brittany Greiner. I have been very not happy with her for having it taken her all going to prison for 10 months in Russia to realize why we stand for the flag. But better late than never. Lady Phil writes Candace, you hit it right on the head. As an African, I can definitely say that many African youth as of today will kill to get to America, not only for greener pastures, but also to enjoy the freedom, particularly the freedom of speech in America. That is so true. People don't realize that the grass is not greener until they get there. And that's exactly what happened to Brittany Greiner and people that are on the outside looking in realize how privileged we are. And I wish sometimes we could just do a quick swap. Christopher Rogers writes, I don't believe Brittany changed. I think her agent is making her say this and stand for the anthem because she would get so much backlash if she didn't after what she went through. I get the cynicism. I do think it's authentic because she probably is more concerned about the backlash that she would get from the players. And I think that in terms of the NBA family, they're still very left leaning. So I don't think she would care too much because when the NBA got backlash from fans about all of the mass protesting and painting the floor with BLM, they didn't care. So it's a left-wing organization. So I'm going to choose to believe that she's doing it sincerely. Next couple of comments regarding Khloe Kardashian speaking out quite bravely regarding surrogacy and the feeling that it was incredibly transactional and seeing the clip of her receiving her baby felt weird and made me uncomfortable. And we spoke about the topic quite gently on the show. Blue Waters writes, my friend had to have a C-section and I agreed to hold her baby for her until she could do it herself. That baby was so quiet in my arms and felt like she was sad. As soon as my friend came through the door about little babe star to stir and get animated, I felt her energy and that bond for her mother was amazing. I will forever remember it. Khloe probably felt that also she felt the absence of that baby's spirit because it was confused and not bonding with her like she remembered it with her first baby. I just hope that things are working out for both of them now. Yeah, I'm sure with time obviously she will bond with her son and it is obviously of course her biological son but that moment of just ripping it from, you know, not ripping it from the womb but like it leaves the womb and instead of giving it to the person who's breast or about to fill with milk or giving it to someone which yeah like the D.R.D.A. might match but I've just been inside of somebody else's body for the last 10 months. It just to me is, it's immoral. That's the only way I can say it. It feels immoral especially in the circumstance just going the hostel of picking up baby and leaving. I think that maybe living in the same house at the same time and there just has to be a different solution but cutting the surrogates out right out of your life feels cruel not just to the surrogate but also to the infant so I very much agree with you. Savannah Sates says four months pregnant here hearing you discuss how you could predict and understand your baby's gender and personality was so inspiring to hear I couldn't help but smile. I also felt in my gut I was having a boy and I was right this process is so transformative and miraculous to sell it off to another would rob me of not only this transcending life experience but also the deep connection I have to my baby. I totally agree and I know that there were some people that were angry with me on Twitter for saying that I felt like it's demonic to do this process and they all shared the exceptional story of well my friend did this and they're all still friends that's that's an exceptional story and most circumstances it's literally transacting money for a baby and the baby is nowhere near the womb in which it just came out of and if there's something about it that's really wrong really dark and as I said in my in the earlier episode we don't do this to animals we wouldn't do this to an animal you have to wait I think it's three months if you want to adopt a kit and you have to wait three months so it can spend time with its mother and it can feed and so it it just seems very strange to me that we've gotten so removed from the process and of course you are happy for people whose entire lives were transformed after 10 years of trying to get pregnant and they found somebody a relative that was willing to hold the baby for them and they're so grateful and it's this amazing gift but again you're thinking about that couple you're not thinking about the baby and how much that baby stands to gain from being around the individual who they were just inside of for 10 months so yeah I am out on the surrogacy process I think that there should be a lot of stricter laws surrounding it and that's selling people's bodies especially when it comes to as I said vanity which is just I don't want to be pregnant it really makes me angry and that's what Hollywood is doing I just I don't feel like being pregnant lastly some of the people were commenting saying no kiddos you don't understand with Chloe's last pregnancy she almost had a miscarriage let me make something very clear to you this one just thing is an almost miscarriage either miscarriage or you didn't okay so I don't know how people just accept everything that they say at face value which she almost miscarried so that's why she chose to use a surrogate that sounds like bs we all know what was going on between her interests and we watched a play out in the press this is because she didn't want to be intimate with him and that's it I'm very sure that she can have a child because she had one and she did not have difficulties that Kim Kardashian had but in regards to Kim Kardashian for those of you that defended her surrogacy process you're like well she had difficulty difficult pregnancies yeah she had two difficult pregnancies and then she produced two children so it was great she wanted more children even though she already had children these are again vain reasons to pursue a path of surrogacy so I I rest my case on it and I don't feel that the mind is going to be changed on it although if you are a part of the exceptional individuals who had some amazing miracle take place I'm very happy for you a child who's always a miracle and at the end result I think will be that Chloe will bond with her son all right guys that is all the time that we have for today as a reminder a shot in dark is now available on dailywire plus so be sure to click link in the description and subscribe right now and be sure to come back tomorrow because it'll be a brand new episode see you guys then"
