Welcome back in Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show final hour of the program. Thursday edition encourage you, as we always do. Go check out Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show podcast. Tons of awesome things in that podcast feed, including the Clay Travis Buck Sexton Network of Podcasts, which is now out there. Tudor Dixon is doing a fantastic job. She was on Tucker Carlson last night. She is doing a great job of her podcast distribution, getting that up and running. There will be more to come. Buck is doing his own exclusive interviews in that podcast. Lots of stuff that you do not get. We love the 15 hours every week that you guys spend hanging out with us. We thank you. Almost 500 affiliate stations out there nationwide, but at your own speed, at your own time, maybe some of you are on the road as it spring break season in general, holiday for summer vacation time coming up before long. And you can listen at 2x speed like my wife does. And boom, you can make it through the podcast very fast. And I wanted to hit hour number two. Julie Kelly was amazing discussing the latest on the Trump grand jury investigation in New York City. There is not it appears going to be any indictment this week. So we will come back on Monday, play the same same tune all over again, see whether or not Alvin Bragg brings charges next week. But I wanted to hit this. We're having a discussion earlier in the program in the first hour about the impact of TikTok. And the hearing has not gone well on Capitol Hill for the TikTok CEO. In fact, I believe we have audio of him being asked whether or not the Chinese government is using TikTok to spy. And let me hear that audio. This is not the answer that you want to hear if you believe that TikTok should remain in Chinese control. Listen, I'm so thankful to all of you and the 7,000 TikTok employees in the US who are helping us build this incredible community in America and around the world. Now, this comes at a pivotal moment for us. Some politicians have started talking about banning TikTok. Now, this could take TikTok away from all 150 million of you. I'll be testifying before Congress later this week to share all that we're doing to protect Americans using the app and deliver on our mission to inspire creativity and to bring joy. All right. So that was the CEO in his introduction explaining what TikTok does and reading from his prepared commentary. This is cut 31 representative Neil Dunn, nailing TikTok CEO down asking specifically about spying. Madam chair, I'd like to enter into the record. This October 20th, 22 Forbes article entitled TikTok parent bite dance plan to use TikTok to monitor the physical location of specific US citizens without objections. So thank you. The project assigned this to a Beijing leader team and they were going to follow individual American citizens. I ask you again, Mr. Chute has bite dance spied on American citizens. I don't think the spying is the right way to describe it. That is not the answer that the TikTok company that that is going to be widely distributed and that is going to be something that I believe comes back to haunt this TikTok CEO. What they'll probably say, I'm sure, is that there's locational data. Again, this goes to my initial point. I'm just going to rush that. They may have your locational data in Beijing. Every app you have, if you're not careful and you don't disable it, is watching you all the time in this country. And I know you might say, Oh, that's fine. It's Americans. We just had Julie Kelly on the last hour. You trust the government and the Democratic line corporations to have all of your data, all of your information at all times. Just okay. I'm just saying, I, you know, for me, it's more like we're dealing with the smaller problem and not the much bigger problem. That's kind of where my whole TikTok sensibility comes about on this stuff. But yeah, we had a good discussion hour one. I'm sure this conversation is going to continue to encourage you to download it. I wanted to hit though this absurdity off the top here, the third hour, a transgender woman. And I'm reading the headline from Mark Harris, one of our writers at Outkick, a transgender woman won the female cycling event in New York City. By the way, transgender woman means man, the 16th victory of the 46 year old man's career. Okay, that's the headline. And I'll give credit because this is, I told our team, I'm like, we got to stop calling people like like the opening sentence here is a transgender woman, also known as a biological man, won a female cycling event in New York City. The trans woman goes by the name Tiffany Thomas. And 16 wins is pretty crazy. What's wild is this person decided to become a cyclist only in the last few years. So we're not even talking about a dude who was like a professional cyclist and trained for a long time. And now he's out here, she's out there, whatever, just totally dominating. And this is leading a lot of people to ask questions. Before we ask more questions, though, we've got a funny clip. This is from South Park. Macho Man Randy Savage deciding to become a woman, but pulled this earlier and wanted to make sure we played it. It is fantastic. So good. South Park is amazing. Here is South Park proving once again to be prescient and see into the future talking about a dude who's kicking all the women's asses in the competition. Listen, Miss Swanson, how does it feel to be competing today? I can't tell you how free I feel now that I've started identifying as a woman, now that I can compete as female, I'm ready to smash the other girls. And is it correct? You just started identifying as female two weeks ago. I'm not here to talk about my transition. I'm here to kick some **** Let me tell you something, Dingleberry, David Perry. I'm going to rule up the other women here. And I'm going to smoke them. I am the strongest woman this state has ever seen. Now with the visual. So good. So good. I think the audio might even be better without the visual, but that is the Macho Man Randy Savage South Park deciding to become a chick and just dominate all the women. You might have steroids that guy was taking back in the in the late 80s. Would have would have made a put it put an elephant under. I mean, right? Macho Man Randy Savage that guy was absolutely Jack beyond one of the all time great entertainers in American history to Macho Man. Absolutely. And then and then the funny thing of the cartoon is at the end. I'm sorry, but we were watching this morning. We're setting around. Is that the women on the podium? One of them has like two black eyes because he's bad. Look, I mean, this is because the cartoon Macho Man Randy Savage is being them all so badly in track and field. I'm sorry. It's just funny. But this is where we are. And I saw our friend Megan Kelly put out this tweet, which I thought was pretty good. But you know, you know what they say, Buck, and I've been talking about this for years because I saw this coming from the world of sports. And I think it just crystallizes the absurdity of deciding that you're a chick when you're clearly a dude. And then you just start beating all these women's asses in their sports. Megan Kelly tweeted, I'm begging, begging any college male tennis player to put an end to this farce by declaring yourself trans playing slash easily winning women's pro tennis tournaments. All it will take is one biological male to win women's Wimbledon, French open, et cetera, for this disgrace to end. And she's sharing the story of the transgender cyclist winning the New York women's race day. I mean, this is just a dude. It's totally correct. I mean, and this is, you get all these people on the left to say, no, no, you, you, that's not true. You wouldn't be able to, um, clay, you know, the another, sorry, I keep catching. I'm sorry. It's, it kind of gave me the giggles just here again. You know, it's just like, I'm sorry. It is, it is amazing that South Park, which is a satire and ridicule cartoon. So perfectly encapsulates how ridiculous it is for a dude to just to get to decide that he defines as a woman and just starts smoking every woman's sport and dominating. And the fact that they chose the macho man Randy Savage to be the voice of, of this character is phenomenal as well. It's amazing. Um, and I would just say, uh, that, you know, there's, there's someone from the, from the young Turks who went super viral. Young Turks very left wing. Some of their people very, very nasty individuals. Um, but one of the, I don't know this Anna Cusbarian and all she could be very nice. I have no idea. I don't, I've never dealt with her. Um, she tweeted this out. I just were just, just for part of this discussion, this has gotten 18 million views just for everybody out there. So I mean, for Twitter, this is ultra viral as you can get. But the reason it went so viral before is because she's a, she's a very, she's a socialist. I mean, she's a very left wing commentator. And, and she said, I'm a woman, please don't ever refer to me as a person with a uterus birthing person or person who menstruates. How do people not realize how degrading this is? You can support the transgender community without doing this stuff. She didn't say stop, but we'll say stuff. Um, and Clay, the common thread below it is really like the cell doors of the lib lunatic asylum. We're all thrown open at once. I mean, people just calling her a turf trans, uh, or exclusionary radical feminist, right? We learned that one. Um, the, the number of women who are apoplectic with rage at a leftist woman for saying, just call me a woman, not a person with a uterus is mind blowing, but also really important that people realize, I mean, this is, this is a widespread mental illness and, and cult devotion now. These people are completely, I'm just talking about random, like democrat women across the, across the board. They don't think it's okay to say, can you just call me a woman, not a person with a uterus? That's where we are. Yeah. And we've been talking about this for a while on this program because any time one of these situations happens, when a man who decides to identify as a woman, wins a championship, effectively what you're doing is erasing women's athletics, because the reason why men's and women's athletics are separated in the first place is because men are bigger, stronger and faster than women. And if they weren't, no woman would ever play on a team. No, if you just had a unisex category, right? No woman would ever play on a team. No woman would ever win basically an Olympic medal. This is biological reality. And people keep saying, well, this doesn't happen that often. And yet every week, it feels like we get two or three of these new stories from a variety of different sports. So if you are listening to us right now, and you have a daughter, or you have a granddaughter, and you are up early every morning, and you are driving that young girl to go train in gymnastics, or to go train at swimming, or to go play soccer, whatever sport you're getting up with your daughter to take her to. How do you not speak out? How do you not stand up and say, this isn't right, my little girl who started competing at the age of five to try to win in her sport and compete at the absolute apex of her ability when she's a grown 16, 17, 18 year old. And suddenly, a dude decides at 16 that he's a girl. And he's been through puberty and he starts dominating her. How do you look that girl in the face? How do you allow this to happen? But you know this, I coach little league. The first kid to get the mustache is the most dominant, right? Whenever a kid hits puberty, they skyrocket in athletic ability. And if you coach little league sports, the kid first kid with the mustache can usually throw the ball harder. He can usually hit the ball further because he is growing into a man. And so we have age limits. This is why we have the separation of sexes in competition in the first place. You'll see this with a lot of middle aged or really kind of late middle aged men who all of a sudden have gotten not have haven't like gotten healthier or lost some weight, but are jacked. Yeah, overwhelmingly, it's through testosterone supplementation, which is very, very widespread. Now, I mean, a lot of people TRT testosterone replacement therapy or HRT hormone replacement therapy, it's very common. It's medically approved. It's actually a good thing for people with low T to do. I'm not I'm not disparaging it at all. It's a good thing. There's a reason doctors do it for people. I'm just saying, though, that you can see the physical manifestation. Oh, yes. You see a guy who was 40 and had a paunch and you know, look like he had two twigs for arms. You see him at 45 and you're like, wait a second. Now this guy's, you know, he's got four arms like Popeye and he's and he's written. Yeah, some of it is diet exercise, all that stuff. But TRT makes a massive difference. And it's just the biochemistry of the individual getting changed and getting more of the stuff that makes you male, more of the stuff that separates men from women. So the science on this, it's it's interesting. You'll never hear them say this, but the science on this is actually settled. There are two genders and men have a biological advantage in strength and speed over women as a gender. There you go. Where's Fauci when we need him? And if you want to have a biological advantage that maybe is more substantial than you otherwise have, and you don't want to be the effeminate Biden administration, maybe you can go get some chalk. Maybe you could increase the amount of testosterone you have naturally in your body with supplements that will give you energy and need to get through the day. Not talking about just surviving. I'm talking about thriving chalk, which is spelled with acute natural ingredients to make supplements that benefit both men and women in a variety of ways. Leading ingredient in chalk's male vitality stack, for example, helps restore testosterone levels in men down 50% according to some studies in the past few decades. Testosterone is very good. It's buck just laid it out. It's help. It's what helps make men men. And as you age, you have a lower amount of testosterone in your body. That might mean that you don't have the energy you did in your twenties and in your thirties. Female vitality stack also helps with regulating hormone health and the endocrine system. You can get hooked up and feel better than you have in years. Thanks to our friends at chalk. And you can also, if you're a dude, let's be honest, can also avoid the ridiculous femininity of the Biden administration. You can embrace your masculinity by going to chalk. CHOQ.com is the website.

Earlier this year, an event 30 years in the making took place. My dad, Mason Sexton, who famously called the 1987 stock market crash, went live with his first public prediction in decades. He warned the top was in and revealed his unique framework to take advantage of the falling market that would follow right on cue the market peaked exactly when he said it would. Those who listened to his unusual prediction, what some called his prophecy, were richly rewarded. But now my dad is coming forward with the next part of his prophecy, his second insight that will catch even the most sophisticated investors by surprise. On Tuesday, November 14th, he's sharing all the details in an online event, including why the next six months could make or break your portfolio. I've followed my dad's work for years. He's been right so many times. I urge you to heed his latest warning. Simply go to the second insight 2023.com to sign up for free. That's the second insight 2023.com paid for by new paradigm research. Welcome back team. We got a caller wants to weigh in on masculinity for the youth. Drew and Phoenix, what do you got for us? Yeah. So me and a couple buddies, I was listening to you, but me and a couple buddies started a club. We were tired of just complaining about not having masculine role models for the young men. So we started a club and it's called Real Life Skills. And kind of our primary objective is we want to interview someone with a job where you don't necessarily have to have a four-year degree. So we've interviewed a real estate agent, a firefighter, a police officer, some local business owners. And then we also wanted to teach them some sort of these young men, some sort of masculine life lesson where they get some hands-on experience. So we've done things like how to change a tire, how to jumpstart a car, firearm safety, how to grill the perfect burger, build a fence. So we've kind of taught the young men that are looking for a masculine role model in their lives, some masculine skills that they can use throughout their lives. I love it. Good for you. Good for everybody out there. By the way, doing big brothers, good for everyone who's coaching sports and reaching kids in that way, we talked and I think it's probably a conversation we need to keep having on this showbook about the desperate desire for young boys to find masculine role models in this country and how few of them there often are. And we all need a spending man out there right now to do as good of a job, not only for your own kids, but for all the other kids out there that are not being lifted up in the process. It's incredibly important in this country. If you own a small business, you may qualify for a refund of your taxes from the IRS.

Welcome back to Clay Ann Buck. Going to be buck taking you through the rest of the hour solo. Clay had to hop for a moment. So we have the economy still to be very focused on because there's a banking crisis that has at least paused. Has it been dealt with? Is it no longer a problem or is it just a pause? That's a question that I don't think anybody can answer right now. But I have my suspicions that the situation is still much worse than we have been led to believe. In fact, I think that if we were to turn over the log of the banking sector and look at what is underneath it, there'd be a whole lot of creepy crawlies and bad stuff going on there. Here is Jay Powell talking about the banking system and saying, don't worry, everything is safe and sound. You're going to be just fine. How confident is the committee that the recent stress that we've seen and you've alluded to is contained at this point and that deposit flight among midsize lenders in particular has ceased? I guess our view is that the banking system is sound and it's resilient. It's got strong capital liquidity. We took powerful actions with Treasury and the FDIC, which demonstrate that all depositors' savings are safe and that the banking system is safe. Deposit flows in the banking system have stabilized over the last week. And the last thing I'll say is that we've undertaken a thorough internal review that will identify where we can strengthen supervision and regulation. Does that sound like this problem is entirely contained to you? He's saying the banking system is sound. That's a pretty generic, pretty broad, a sweeping statement. So is that all there is to it? Is that all we really have to know? Or could there be something else going on here? I think it's also interesting that Powell, they just raised what raised at 25 basis points. They just raised it yesterday. We announced that as the news broke. And this means that they're going a little bit of a interest rate raise. Is it enough to bring down inflation the way they want? Probably not. But you know what they're going to do? Like the Democrats are going to do. They're going to find every way possible to blame people who aren't in elected office to blame. This is the game that is played. Let me just step back for a second. Why was it impossible to get any accountability during COVID? This is something that you'll see play out in our federal government on a whole range of issues. And it's getting worse, actually, as the years go by. But one of the reasons you couldn't get any accountability over COVID was when you said, Hey, you know, Senator or governor or whatever, you can't you can't do this. This is crazy. This is a bad idea. Why are you locking down? Why do you have a mask mandate? Why do you fill in the blank with some COVID policy? What did they say to you? They say, Oh, well, it's not us. It's the CDC, which is a bureaucracy. It's not elected. And it's just advisory in this capacity. So, you know, they say, we're just doing what the CDC tells us, you go to the CDC, and you say, you know, theoretically here, you go to the CDC, say, Hey, you know, the Democrats in Congress are pushing for these mandates and lockdowns and vaccine mandates and all this other stuff. They're saying it's your fault. You've got to stop this. And they say, Oh, we don't make any decisions. We're just advisory. You have to go talk to the Democrats in Congress and around the merry-go-round goes. It's a little bit like if you ever dealt with this with a customer service situation, they say, Oh, that's that's not a sales issue. That's a tech support issue. And then you speak to tech support. And they say, this isn't a tech support issue. It's a sales issue. And you're just like, that's what I've started to lose. This has happened to me many times before, especially dealing with, you know, banking. It's like, Oh, well, this is this, is this for a business checking or individually? Well, that's that's new account openings. And you say, okay, I'll talk to new account openings. Oh, this is this isn't new account openings. This is customer support. And you talked to, and you said, well, they said you and you said, no accountability. Think about the way our financial system works. Now let's bring this back for a second. You have Powell, the, the Fed chair, who's talking about the Fed decision. Of course, it's a body. It's a, it's a, a committee decision to, to raise rates just a little bit. You know what the Democrats are going to do? They're going to say, Oh, it's, it's the evil Fed that's causing the problems in the economy or another big bad Fed people. They're the problem. Elizabeth Warren here says Jerome Powell is trying to cause a recession. Playclip 21. I've made it very clear as publicly, as humanly possible, that I didn't think that he should be reconfirmed as chair of the Fed. And I think he's doing a really terrible job. And he's doing a terrible job on both fronts. Remember, there are only two jobs for the Federal Reserve chair. One is monetary policy inflation. I think he's doing a very bad job there. And it's risking pushing our economy into a recession. Do you think the United States is headed for a recession? I think that that is where Jerome Powell is trying to drive it. And he's got two different ways to purposely trying to drive it to a recession. Well, what he's trying to do is get two million people laid off. I mean, Tapper there is like, wait, hold on a second. Tapper said that's crazy. He's trying to cause a recession like because it is crazy. It is crazy, right? So what's, what's the, oh, I saw, I saw that J. Powell's fault. He just going to cost all your jobs with his bad policy. Elizabeth Warren just speaking nonsense there. The problem here is that Democrats spent too much money. That's really at the absolute court. Really the problem is the government decided and it was pushed overwhelming, overwhelmingly by Democrats, Republicans have some guilt in this too. But elected officials just keep spending too much money because who's going to get elected? The person who says, I'm going to give you free stuff or the person who says we have to stop doing this. It's not actually free. Unfortunately, the economy right now and the debt right now shows us that the person who just keeps promising the free stuff that other people will pay for not you though, not the economy you exist in that won't be affected. The other people, the rich people's economy will be affected only, which is a lie. And, and I'll just remind you that so J. Powell was telling you, J. Powell is telling you the system is sound because what else is he going to say? Elizabeth Warren is blaming the Fed and claiming that the Fed is trying to, what do you think she might be trying to get ahead of what she knows? Because everybody knows is coming, the recession and the blame for it. Because who else is going to get the blame, the Biden administration and the Democrats. So the, do this blame shifting. They're already trying to set the narrative thing. It's like, oh, it's not our fault. It's that it's the big, bad Fed. The Fed's the problem, right? Just like, oh, it's not our fault. It's the CDC with the COVID restrictions. We're not the ones. They're the ones telling us to do this. Now, I know you could say the Fed actually makes a decision versus the CDC is just advisory, but they're both unaccountable bureaucracies, right? So it's a similar circumstance of diffusing and evading accountability in whatever way possible. And I brought up the issue of the debt. Janet Yellen, I'm just going to say it, not confidence inspiring on any of these issues. But Janet Yellen is out there and being asked questions like how much debt to GDP. I mean, the debt right now, I'd have to look it up to get it exact, but you know, it's 31 trillion in change. I don't think it's 32 yet. Is it 32? That guys, let me know. It's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. She's asked how much debt to GDP is unsustainable. This is the Treasury Secretary. You would think that she would have an answer. And here's what she says. What debt as a percentage of our GDP is too much? It depends on what interest rates are. And real interest rates have been extremely low. Could you just answer my question, Madam Secretary, what percentage of our debt of our GDP is too much? Well, this budget has debt held by the public moving up to around 109% of GDP. And that's not too much in your opinion. Historically, it's a high level. But on the other hand, interest rates, real interest rates have moved down substantially in recent decades. Historically, it's a high level. You don't say 31.6 trillion the team just told me. As interest rates rise, you know what happens? The amount of money that goes to paying the debt goes up as well. Crowds out other government spending and creates its own problems. But there's just very basic foundational fundamental truths that a lot of the people that are pulling the levers of our economy and our financial and monetary system want you to ignore. They want to pick out the bad guys, right? They want to do the Elizabeth Warren. Oh, it's the Fed, or it's the the rich aren't paying their fair share. They want to get you thinking about somebody else, something else. But fundamentally, it's that we have a political system that rewards what Bastia referred to in the law as plunder, right? That belief that you could live at the expense of everyone else, or that the money will come from someone else, that it all comes from some other person. It doesn't affect you. That pernicious belief has undermined the soundness of our money has undermined the economy and could be drawing us right now into a massive recession and the people in charge won't even tell you the truth about what's happening. They just respond with platitudes. And on the one hand, on the other nonsense. So I do I am not confidence inspired by pal by yelling and certainly by the Biden White House. I am confident despite however, by what's going on over at my pillow. Amazing stuff right now. A lot of affordable luxuries in life.

If you have a lot of money riding on the AI boom, then I urge you to listen to my dad Mason Sexton. You see my dad famously called the 1987 market crash almost to the day.

He warned the market would top out in late July right on cue the market peak. Those who listened to his unusual prediction, what some called his prophecy were richly rewarded.

What do you got for us, Amanda? Hi. So in September of 2019, there was a law in the state of California passed. It's called the Equal Pay for Equal Pay Act. And it says that women and men should get equal prize money for any sporting event that they compete in. So in cycling, men used to get well above the amount that women would get as prize money. And now, since it has to be equal, we have men who have decided that they are now identifying as women and enrolling in the female division. And they will win the event hands down because that's just what they can do. They are, you know, training as a man and now they're winning as a woman. And there's nothing that they have to do to prove that they identify as a female. I just think it's also, you know, first of all, man, a thank you for that insight about what's going on in California. And I think it's worth noting that there was a big study that just came out on Washington Post reported the study. I have to look it up to give you all the details. And maybe we could talk about this tomorrow. Oh, the teachers union strike by the way, Sacramento, California. Now I'm thinking we're going to talk teachers union strike. I mean, the short version is the teachers union is striking. They don't care about kids. They act like a bunch of of, you know, Marxist thugs. They just want the whole it's a it's a mess out there. It's an absolute mess, but three day three day strike because they want to get they want to get paid more. And the head of the teachers union in particular that's pushing this is somebody who said that it was racist for parents to want kids because because the white parents were the ones who were pushing for it. So our kids will go back to school during COVID. So it was racist to want schools reopening. That teachers union official is the one who's also pushing for the the current strike in she's the head of the Los Angeles teachers union or teachers Federation or whatever it's called. But anyway, they the short version is that teachers unions at this point should be there should be no public sector unions, you know, private sector unions, sure, public sector unions. No, no, should not exist, should not be able to hold the government hostage for services that are promised to the government when there's no actual market at play. You take the salary that the government offers or you did or you find another job. Anyway, where was I on all this? I was just on the transgender issue. I had this, I had this phenomenal point to make. Oh, I was talking about the Washington Post and the study about and what they found is that a majority of individuals who identify as trans have never even taken hormones and a vast majority have not something like 80% have not had surgery. I just bring this up because to the point about men competing in women's athletics, you just have to grow your hair long and say your name is, you know, is, you know, Susan or Sarah and they can't stop you. There's nothing else. There's no, there's no bar for so, you know, Megan Kelly tweeted out that she wants a college male tennis player to go win, win women's Wimbledon, for example. And you, there's a challenger circuit and there are ways you can actually get into the, the major tournaments really just by pretty much showing up. And it's interesting because it wouldn't be that hard to do. And there's no proof of how long you've had to be. So to the whole macho man Randy Savage saying he's competing against women in the South Park episode, you know, he's like, I transitioned two weeks ago. Remember macho man was saying that? He could actually do that. You could actually do that and compete in some of these athletic competitions. But more about this tomorrow.
