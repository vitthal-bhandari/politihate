We will discuss plus more on Ukraine and Russia and all the media, all of a sudden discovers free speech. So interesting. New York Times editorial. We'll talk about it first though. My friends.

The situation of women's sports, exactly what many of us had been warning about, which is that now you have biological males competing against women and what a shock they're beating them all. In this case, Leah Thomas, and it's very straightforward. You have the father of an Auburn University swimmer. Auburn University has a fantastic swim team and very elite, very elite women swimming for them. This is what that father had to say, but the fact that Leah Thomas is now a gold medal winner NCAA national champion this year. They asked the question how he felt about winning, when really, how did the rest of the women feel about having the stress of dealing with this, knowing they have to swim against them? So a girl that got nine doesn't get eighth. A girl that gets 17th doesn't make all American 16th. A girl that got 39th, potentially, if they took 38 girls and NCA's, she didn't get their come to the NCA's because a biological male took their spot. I think everybody's got to be civil about it. I call him Will Thomas. He's a human. I should respect that and what he wants to do with his life, but this isn't the place to do it. It's taken opportunity away from females that have worked very, very hard for a long, long time, even before college to get into this position. And it's just not right. Some of those women have been swimming competitively since they were, what, five, six years old or at least learning to swim then and beginning to get into races as they get into first, second, third grade. And for at least some of them, this changed their accomplishment. There was a, there was a woman who got third place. I already mentioned the woman who got second place. There was a woman who got third place and she, I'm sorry, would have gotten second obviously, but the, but the woman who got fourth place would have gotten a medal, but did not. And she's a senior and that's it. You know, this is the end of, this is the end of her swimming career, most likely, although there are some Olympians who managed to not manage to be in this NCAA tournament or NCAA finals, I should say. And they lost, they lost. There was a silver medalist in the Olympics who came in second here. Emma Wyatt, she lost to Leah Thomas. What is the, what is the purpose here of the left? I mean, you have to ask the question. I mean, the father's right. Of course, be civil, be decent, be kind to everybody. Everyone's going through stuff. Everyone has mental health challenges. We're talking about sports. So what does it mean for the left to say that we have to have biological females compare, biological males competing against biological females? It's a negation of truth, science and basic observable fact. Why do they want to control your ability to observe what is true and factual? If they can make you say that a man is woman and woman is a man for the purposes of competitive athletics, they can make you say absolutely anything. They can make you say that the Hunter Biden laptop is disinformation. They can make you say that two masks somehow works. It's about an all out assault on truth and the ability of the apparatus to make you bend the knee and obey. It's confusing when people tell you things that you know are untrue. It's confusing when people tell you things that you know are observably false, especially when they're in power and they're so insistent. I mean, I saw last night on Twitter, everybody who was saying this is a biological male competing against females in sports. And there's an obvious physical difference. You see the photo of the metal winners and Lee Thomas is not just towering over in terms of height, but also in terms of the broadness of his shoulders, the overall physical musculature. It is a man swimming against women. That is the reality. They can shout whatever they want about big it. And that's not true. And you know, it's about trans lives or whatever they want to say. They are the ones who are lying to you. It is a lie. And as I always say, to borrow from souls and eats and live not by lies, do not allow them to make you live by lies. And that is exactly what they are doing. Here's one Virginia Tech swimmer who had some had some. What's Bob's going to say something else, but that wouldn't be corrected in the circumstances had some goal we could say to speak out against this. They're a Virginia Tech swimmer. What did you think about Lee Thomas competing today as a swimmer in this competition? What are you feeling? What are other athletes feeling? It's a common conception that we are all very disappointed and frustrated with someone who has capabilities more than us women have to be able to compete at this level and take opportunities away from other women. Like I have a teammate who did not make finals today because she was just bumped out of finals and it's heartbreaking to see someone who went through puberty as a male and has the body of a male be able to absolutely blow away the competition and you go into it with a mindset that you don't have a chance if that makes sense. It's hard to compete against someone with the aerobic capacity, the muscle development, the body of a man. It's hard. It's hard to think about it like that. And staying positive I bet for other swimmers who are in that he is probably overwhelming. I'm not sure I can't speak for them but it's disappointed to see and frustrating definitely. It is disappointing. It is frustrating. It is also obvious truth. She's saying it. Is she a bigot? Is that we're supposed to believe? These blue check lips, they're such cowards. They all know. They all know. There's nothing to celebrate here but leot Thomas's victory. They know it's wrong. It's gross. It's disgraceful. The whole thing. They're negating women's sports. They're negating all the fights the left used to pretend to care about feminism. Title nine, you name it. We can all see it but they like to pretend because that is what the left demands. You have to embrace their untruth or else or else your problem. You're a bigot. You're a bad person. They also lie to you about the economy because it's a combination of they are really stupid to they are really dishonest. The situation with inflation and oil is one they're hoping to make go away but that's not going to happen. We'll come back into that plus a little throwback to what Trump said about Hunter Biden and the Hunter Biden laptop but I think particularly rings true these days. We'll get to that in a moment. If you want to be a real estate investor, you got to listen up. I never done this before. I never even bought a house before. Then I met my friends at Dunferreal Estate. They took me through every step of the process. They educated me. They taught me about the basics of real estate investing. Then they helped me get a house. They actually helped me pick the city, gave me a broker contact, worked with me, answered all my questions along the way, helped me get the financing set up. I've now bought multiple houses with Dunferreal Estate as investment properties to prepare for my financial future. It's been a fantastic success for me. You've got to check this out. Go to Dunferubuck.com to see how it works. I just also love the education you get about real estate investing from them as you go along and their system works. Dunferubuck.com. That website is Dunferubuck.com. Make sure you tell them to buck sent you and that I had a fantastic experience with them. I'm still using Dunferreal Estate to this day for more investment properties because they have done such a phenomenal job. Remember, oh wait, actually before I get into the Hunter Biden laptop thing. What do the Libs do when the economy is not going their way? They find a way to pretend to be socialists who care so much about everybody else. Here's Pelosi blaming oil companies for gas price gouging. We call on industry to boost production and stop hoarding profits. Oil prices are down. Oil prices are down, but the price of oil goes up. The price of gasoline goes up. And the price of oil goes down. The price of gasoline does not necessarily go down. This is not right. It's not fair. What is she even talking about? When the price goes up, it doesn't necessarily go up. When the price goes down, no, actually that's exactly what it means. What it means is that market forces are determining this. Now market forces have to account for things like regulation, government intervention, the government's propping up of if not monopolies cartel-like status for certain industries, particularly in the fossil fuel realm. Those are mistakes of government. Those are not mistakes that you can, or rather those are not inefficiencies that you can just flatly blame on the oil companies. They're trying to make a profit and stay alive and return value to their shareholders. That's how this actually works. That is what is going on here. A recent history of how Democrats, because they're lying to you right now, they're like, oh, we don't stand in the way. We don't have to buy it and came in. Banza Keystone XL pipeline. They've shut down leases for oil exploration on private land. And they say, oh, but you have so many leases that are unused. Well, maybe they're not good leases. It's not oil everywhere. It's not worth it, depending on what the market forces are at any point in time to explore there. Not every spot is the same for oil exploration. The company should be able to determine where they want to go for oil exploration. But even before that, the Obama administration came in and they were absolutely hostile, the fracking for eight years. Remember the movie about fracking that said it was going to poison all the drinking water? And they lit the, they lit tap water on fire, which it turns out actually has nothing to do with fracking, but didn't matter. It was a neat little trick. And there's a trick that people knew the water had been catching on fire because of some, there's like sediment, some kind of methane or something. I forget what it is that in the water, but the point is that nothing to do with fracking because it had been, the water had been known to do that for something like 70 years, I think. Way before there was this fracking revolution. Fracking is a technology. And by the way, it's used in something like 98% now of oil wells because it is much more efficient at extraction. And it is safe. It doesn't poison anyone or anything. It's basically water and sandblasting. But fracking, because it makes a little shake, shake noise, we all have to be terrified of it. These people are hysterical. You've noticed there's an, there's an exact correlation between people who think they're really smart and believe the science, but also think you're going to die from climate change, melting the planet. AOC just said, it'll catch the planet on fire. She actually said that yesterday. People that believe that fracking will contaminate their drinking water with no actual basis for this whatsoever. People who believe that double masking will save you from COVID, which obviously did not happen. And now that somebody with male genitalia and a male physique, but who claims to be female has no biological advantage in swimming against women in a pool. I mean, there's this amazing correlation. They're just wrong, wrong, wrong and wrong, but they get caught up in the emotion of the mob and they're very easy to manipulate by those at the top of the leftist pyramid because all they have to do is have the right buttons pushed. I want to be a good person. I want to be a good person. There's I'm one of the good folks who listens to the science. That's what they all think. So yes, there was the hostility of the Obama administration of fracking. And then when oil prices dropped dramatically, a lot of companies that had actually begun exploration, which is quite expensive and they had invested because they got ahead of where prices would be future prices. Pelosi, remember, she's better than hedge fund managers that investing somehow. Not because she has inside information as the speaker of the house running legislation for the country though. No, of course not. She doesn't understand that future prices determine current activity of these companies. If the oil companies think that they're going to end, there's a lot, there's smaller companies that do exploration. There's the huge companies that you have all heard of and you go buy gas from, or at least you know the names when you buy their gas because a lot of the gas stations are independently owned. So you sit here and say, do they not understand how this works? Those companies have to say, what do we think? We're going to go explore. It might take a year, two years, three years to get the benefit of actually producing this oil or natural gas. What do we think the price will be then? That matters a whole hell of a lot, doesn't it? So when you're having to make these kinds of determinations, the idea that it doesn't matter what the government says now or allows now because it won't affect the price. It does actually affect the price very much in the future, but also right now because they have to plan and there are market forces at work. But this is reality. They don't like reality. They like to lecture everybody. They like to complain about how it's so unfair. They're going to poison all the drinking water. It's just not true. It is just not true. And then here is the moment where we can talk about the 100 Biden laptop situation. So many of these Trump clips, you can go back and see, Trump said that gas would get to $7 a gallon and it is, it has been $7 a gallon in California. Oh, why is it so expensive in California compared to other states? Anybody want to guess? Environmental regulations. Wait, I thought the price was just a greedy oil cartels. Oh, it's environmental regulations in the state of California. That's why it's so expensive because a bunch of Libs who drive around formerly in Prius is now in Teslas. At least Teslas are kind of cool, but they drive around in these things and they don't care that it actually just makes everything more expensive and harder for the people below them on the socioeconomic chain. All they really care about is doesn't make them feel good. Do they feel good at night about what they are doing to the rest of everybody, regardless of what the actual facts are, regardless of the situation as it plays out? So I think that's quite important. It's important that we all see that. We will get back into that in a second. You've heard me say what's happening to police across the country is a disgrace. Many times there are hostile activists, there are rogue prosecutors, liberal media, misguided political leaders. Progressive policies have resulted in wrongful charges, thus facing unimaginable pressure and financial burdens on many cops. The law enforcement legal defense fund at policedefense.org educates the public on the risks and threats associated with being an officer today. And they raise funds to support police financially burdened as a result of being wrongfully charged. They can help without generous support from people like you. Go to policedefense.org, see what they're doing to our heroic officers and their families. Go see your for yourself and you'll want to help out in an era of defund the police. Learn about defending the police. Use the simulator. See the types of decisions police must make every day on the street. It's time to stand up for our men and women in blue. Help today at policedefense.org. That's policedefense.org Hunter Biden's laptop story is real. Oh, nobody's surprised. It's called Biden to criminal. Why is he is a criminal? He got God, read his laptop. And you know who's a criminal? You're a criminal for not reporting it. You are a criminal for not reporting it. Let me tell you something. Joe Biden is a criminal and he's been a criminal for a long time. And you're a criminal and the media for not reporting it. God, I miss those moments with Trump. He's totally correct about the media being just disgusting. They actively suppress the biggest media organizations in the country actively suppressed a story right before an election to throw an election for the Democrat candidate. It's not that they sat on it. They lied. That's even worse, right? To sit on a store. They do that all the time. They choose not to cover things that'll hurt Democrats. No, they went out there like like Putin's own propaganda organs that just say whatever the the state tells them to. They went out there and said the laptop stories, disinformation, it's false. They had all these former, I think it was 50 or might even more former Intel professionals who were losers, by the way, overwhelmingly idiots. Yeah, I was one. I can tell you it's true. Most of them are total clowns who are completely worthless bureaucrats. Anyway, they came out and said, it's Russian disinformation based on what? Based on trying to fool just enough people. I know for a lot of you think, Buck didn't fool me and I knew it was idiotic, of course, but they were just trying to get, you know, 100,000 people, 50,000 people in the whole country to change their votes. That's all it takes. That's all it took. Look at the election. So the lie was worth it to them. They don't feel badly about it. Make no mistake about it. They are proud of the propaganda coup that they pulled off. That's why there's no, there's no contrition for many of these media organizations. The whole purpose of this was to get away with the narrative, the lie. That's it. And they got away with it at the time. And so now it doesn't even matter. They have no credibility to protect what difference does it make to them? So, and then the New York Times writes a story today about how the First Amendment is under assault and polling shows. It's the New York Times editorial board, actually, polling shows that people are afraid to speak out about politics to think they could yell that. Yeah, because people notice reality. As much as libs like to pretend that's not true, people do notice. And the left is essentially in a, in a constant war on your ability to observe whether it is the male features, but gently of a swimmer swimming against women in a pool, or it is the reality of speaking out in a way that is contra the left dogma and see how you're attacked viciously and psychically by people who are wrong. And even when it is demonstrable that they were wrong when they yell that you don't care, because their job is to be part of the shouting mob. And that's what they do. I have so much more, but I've got to get to a three hour solo radio show right now. So, tea, thanks for hanging with me. And if you haven't already, for this is your first time listening, and please do subscribe to the Buck Sexton show on the iHeart app or on Apple podcast. Talk to you Monday. Shields high."
