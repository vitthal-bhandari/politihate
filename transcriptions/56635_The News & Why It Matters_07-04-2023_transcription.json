    "text": " Today, another trans shooter had plans to attack multiple schools. Riley Gaines is assaulted and chased by an angry mob, and the Tennessee House expels two members for inciting an insurrection. It's about time we fight fire with fire. We've got all of that coming up, and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez, and yesterday afternoon, Colorado Springs police announced that they had arrested a transgender female. That is, of course, a dude with a penis for an attempted school shooting. The arrest took place on March 31st, just days after another trans person shot up a school in Nashville, but the suspect told police he had been planning the shooting for over a month. A 19-year-old whose birth name is William, but who goes by the name Lily, was reported to police by his sister, who told police of his plans to shoot up an elementary, a middle, and a high school, and indicated he had severe anger issues. You think? When police showed up to his home, they reported they could hardly walk through the home because of all the trash lying all around alcoholic beverage containers and half-eaten packages of food with mold growing in them. There were also multiple holes that he had punched in the wall, as well as a door off of its hinges. Now, police also recovered a manifesto, a dry erase board with floor plans, a list of names, and a copy of the Communist Manifesto by Karl Marx. It's very anger issues, holes punched in the wall, a disgustingly kept house, sounds like someone with serious mental health issues, but instead of treating those mental health issues, society just tells him to chop off his... Should anyone be surprised that these people continue to implode? It wasn't the only transactive violence we heard about yesterday. Riley Gaines, former NCAA collegiate swimmer who tied in the championship race last year with Leah Thomas, a dude pretending to be a woman. See, I feel like we always need a flow chart for these stories. She was violently attacked last night at a speaking event at San Francisco State University. She tweeted out, the prisoners are running the asylum at SFSU. I was ambushed and physically hit twice by a man. This is proof that women need sex-protected spaces. Still only further assures me I'm doing something right when they want you silent, speak louder. Now here is some of the chaos that ensued after Riley was assaulted as the angry trans mob went after her watch. I'm coming, I'm good, I'm good. Trust me, I'm good. Go ahead. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Yes, I'm good. Even because it's San Francisco and being neutered is practically a job requirement to join the police force there, SFPD officers stood by and waited while the violent mentally ill trans activists held Riley hostage and suggested payment in exchange for letting her leave watch. And what we're hoping to do is to keep things peaceful and make her lose her flight and move and move forward. Yes, okay. Yes, tell her to pay us. That's the ratio. Because if I got paid for this, we can get paid for it too. On the public campus that we have paid for this. I swear out that we've been so much the end going here. We're cooperating so much next. So they need to do their job. We're really great at that. It's here. I can't speak to all of you when we're over talking to each other. We're not going to hear you. Don't let her hold. So this is called kidnapping and all of these degenerate pieces of garbage should go to jail. Every single one of them and I hope Riley uses every legal resource she has available to punish these people severely because that is what it's going to take from all of us. All right. This is it. This is the moment. Our country is so turned on its head right now that grown men are beating up women in the name of trans rights. Our female ancestors fought so hard for actual civil rights for it to all come to this. Getting beaten up by a man in a dress and just taking it so you don't upset the violent mentally ill left. We are so lost in this demonic shift that we are now seeing daily acts of trans people committing violence or attempting to commit violence against others and half the country sets back and just lets it happen. In fact, as much as they like to call us fascists, if the left were truly introspective, they would admit that they actually welcome this. They enjoy it. They want trans activists shouting down speech. They want trans activists assaulting peaceful protesters, engaging in violence against those who don't accept their delusions, forcing the rest of society to comply with their radical ideologies because of course they are the true fascists they accuse you of being. Now people often ask if a civil war is coming. Coming? No. Look around you. It's here. We're in it. The spiritual war, good or evil. Pick one right now. You don't get to stand on the sideline. You don't get to be a spectator. You pick a side right now. Brace yourselves and do not back down. Now is the time to be louder than ever. Now is the time to make them pay. Handily, I might add, for every act of violence they engage in. Now is the time to let them know that no matter how much they try to intimidate us, harass us, we will not bow down and they will not shut us up. The only way out is through. Either we fight back with all our might right now and we win or we allow them to forever alter the course of human history. I want to welcome at this time to the program Eric July, a bleasty be contributor and of course founder and owner of Ripiverse Comics. And it's just us today. It's just us. But that's okay because I have a feeling that Eric, you might just have a little bit to say about this topic of, I mean, increasing not just violence from the left but this trans movement violence. Yes. Well, I've had a big power. I've been rated on several posts of mine, my own by Gay furries and other weirdos that are into some very degenerate stuff will apparently are upset at the fact that I have claimed because it is true that there's no such thing as trans kids. It's not a thing at all. But that's how far we've come and I did a video the other day talking about kind of what you were saying regarding this line in the sand but more importantly, discussing like, look man, this is cultural rock. This is degeneracy and until this is like met and address head on, this doesn't end. It will continue to go in the route that we're going. You could imagine 10 years ago, I bring this point up all the time on the show. 10 years ago, we'd be in a world where they are advocating and defending promoting child mutilation and we would say there's no way that that's going to happen. Just some religious zealot and you're being overprotective of children and all this sort of stuff. And yet here we are and it's stemmed from because it's apparent so much in the media right now, this new Spider-Verse movie to me, the most overrated character to ever exist in Miles Morales as well as the most overrated movie, animated movie to ever exist. I'm still mad at my own audience for daring to have me go watch that the first Spider-Verse movie but there's a flag in the character's room that they showed in the recent trailer that says protect trans kids with the trans flag. Of course, that goes in all this media that of course your children are consuming and like I said, I responded to that like dude, they're putting this everywhere and again, it has to be addressed. Now what I will not allow these people to do is act as if number one, this is normal. Because you know it first started and some of them are still doing, even though we had on this show, Chloe Cole, we're talking about getting a devil mastectomy at 15 years of age, right? Okay, so that happened. You still people are like, well these surgeries, irreversible surgeries are not happening to children. It's like, I don't know, we talk to one which is happens and we see these stories come out all the time of these detransitioners and what not and then when you look at all the insurance claims, you're seeing that there are people as young as like 13 taking a hormone blocker and puberty blockers and all those sorts of things which come with his own set of medical consequences. But what that speaks to is how much the cultural right sort of runs deep because they didn't even give you that. They couldn't at least say, all right, we'll lose children alone. Right. Couldn't do it. They couldn't do it. What they do is use the children to validate themselves and you have a bunch of these little screaming brainlets doing stuff like we just saw sort of the video on where it's this mob but they've been emboldened by basically every corner of culture, okay? To be this protective sort of entity and they actually have nerve to present it as if we're the ones that are presenting violence against them. I had a guy, a little crack smoker that was on the on the tour door who did this video based on my video and he said that I'm essentially advocating violence against the LBGT alphabet community. That's like because I said I don't agree with children being mutilated but that's the it's not just against the narcissism. Like imagine being like thinking you're that high on this sort of pedestal where you're like, well, anything that you say that's disagreement with me wanting to mutilate children, which is what they want to do is somehow violence against them. So think about how deep it's run. It's not just surface level is we're well beyond okay, allowing consenting adults to do what they want to. If it was left to that, we probably don't we're not having as much of a conversation with that if they were, again, attending to their own devices, but they can't that's not good enough for them. They have to go after your children. They have to try to mob people that's in the disagree with them on these various sort of subjects because we're not like I don't know going along with whatever charade it is that that doesn't sort of presenting. That's how bad that is gotten. So the question I guess that we need to try to answer is how do we fix this? Yeah. And you have to address it head on you have to get involved sort of culturally, but more importantly, you have to be unapologetic because you see too many people talk around this sort of issue because they don't they don't dare want to offend. I love the fact that now after the Leah Thomas situation, people are more so coming out that were obviously impacted. I hate that it took that long for that sort of stuff to happen, but now people are discussing it more, but think about I don't know if you remember out kick hat that coverage where they had it was an anonymous interview of these people that were Leah Thomas's teammates and how some of them felt uncomfortable here and all these sorts of things and did it anonymously because they didn't want to come out. They much rather have the sanctity of their sport be ruined than be called a transfer. Exactly. So when how will these guys have exactly if we go if we go and treat them like that with clean go. Yeah, I guess we deserve what it is that we get until we look at it head on is like, dude, I don't have to agree with you. First of all, I don't I think it's kind of weird that you know, you live the lifestyle it is. I'm not going to apologize for that, but at minimum, I can accept as an adult, you're free to tend to your own device. And if you want to chop off whatever stuff I'd advise against it, I'm going to speak out against, let's say other people doing that because I know it speaks to some other psychological and mental issues that it is that you have, but at least at minimum, you had a freedom to sort of do that. Don't force other people to have to abide by sort of your lifestyle and especially do not use that that sort of trying to get them to validate your existence and going after children. You know, we like address that and we're like, dude, we're not bending and breaking on this issue. And if it makes you feel uncomfortable, good, well, it's going to continue to or let's say they'll continue to gain ground. And I would just like to point out, I want to talk about what's going on with the Biden administration changing title nine rules. But I would just like to add to what you said here, I think it's important to note you there's no we're far beyond having being able to reason with these people. You cannot reason with them. You can only defeat them at this point. Someone who is so deluded to think that you should be allowed to mutilate children. Yeah, that's crazy. Right. It's like, okay, so we're past the point of compromise or reasoning or anything like that. You guys are convinced that that is somehow right in your world. We all know that it's not. So we will just pack it up and just defeat you instead of trying to do that. Because you can't reason with a person that got to their position by way of emotion. It's impossible. And I think that's what a lot of people for decades really that were, let's say on our side of the aisle, no matter where they were conservative, no matter where they were libertarian, where they thought that their ideas alone were going to be good enough to defeat these evil people. And what the evil people were at least smart enough to realize that they didn't need the bright ideas. They didn't need any of that actually. All they needed was to get control of the sort of these cultural institutions and subcultures. And then they could just pump out a bunch of minions, little soldiers being through the public education system, be it through the universities, be it through animation, Hollywood sports even now. It's gotten so bad. It's everywhere. They realized if they capture that, they don't need to bright its ideas on their side. So yeah, how do you defeat an unreasonable person with reason? The harsh reality is you can't. They got to their position by way of emotion. This is why I know people, even other conservatives don't like that I'm a little rough around their edges because I love. I get that too. I go to the mud with, you know what I mean? I have no issues certainly doing that. But I would argue that that tactic is far more conducive to them changing out of their ways using mock and shame because it does appeal to their emotions and their emotion. And they got to their position by exactly that. You can't come on. They're all the facts in the world. You can slide it right across. They're going to look at it, light it on fire and throw it right behind them because they don't care. You're actually more, again, it's more conducive to trying to change their minds by mocking and shaming these. And it's not like they don't deserve it by the way, but by mocking and shaming these people and treating it like what it is. And it's bad behavior. You know what I'm saying? Bad behavior. So I want to get your thoughts then before we have to go to break here about this proposed new regulations for Title IX. So basically the Biden regime, I'm sorry, the Biden regime trying to usurp all of the states that have put into place laws that would prohibit transgender students from participating in the sport, of which whatever sex they identify with. So basically protecting women's sports. And so the education department's Title IX rules, of course, state that schools that receive federal funding may not ban biological males in girls sports wholesale, but they may exclude them on a case-by-case basis. The wording of this is really bizarre here. It says it recognizes in some instances, particularly in competitive high school and college athletic environments, some schools may adopt policies that limit transgender students' participation. However, the proposal would give schools the flexibility to develop their own participation policies. And so they are trying their very, very best to usurp these states' rights here. Yeah, I would agree that, and now I just knew that was going to happen, and that was something that, you know, that's the danger of university in general and a whole federal government being involved in the grant and loan sort of business. For one, that's why I cost so much if you want to talk about the economics of it all, but especially like everything comes with a price. So they get to say, well, you have built this entire fake economy surrounding us stealing from citizens to pay for this various other thing. That's really all university has been is colleges trying to outspend each other, and they get to do that because they have an unlimited pool of money because people are able to sort of dip into that pool. So it comes to the price, and they're going to utilize whatever they can to pimp them into doing their own bidding. They walked right, certainly, into this. So this is what the importance of trying to strip the federal funding away altogether. Yeah. Number one, it'll make college cheaper. Number two, you would have all of these ridiculous sort of curriculums that you can't even get jobs for because they're all fake anyway. But again, they're able to employ all of these weird old sort of professors and their fake jobs, which you can't even get a real job. The only job that you can get is to teach it's a positive scheme. You're going to get a job and teach other people for that degree. That's it. And they didn't get their little doctors and fake degrees, and then they go teach them what's going to happen. Yeah, exactly. So it's effectively a Ponzi's game. So we have to address that problem. I also would just like to point out really quickly the irony in Title IX being created basically to protect women from discrimination, anything like that. And now here we are, and it's being weaponized against women. I'm running. It really is. The left doesn't seem to understand. It is. It was in a conversation, guys. Like I say this from experience, I was a collegiate track and field athlete. I like to say a pretty damn good one. And this was not, and that was not that low. My last year of competing was 2014. Right? That wasn't that long ago, man. That wasn't that long ago. And this was not a thing. Nobody was like, oh, are these going to be transgender, whatever women are men have you, because it's only goals one way, right? It's not like a transgender, I guess, man. It's going to come compete with us. No, no, no. It's not going to happen. So it only goes one way. They know better. But there's no difference between men and women. Exactly. All right, we got to take a break. First one, I think our sponsor, relief factor. So if you are living in pain, I understand because I had had back problems from a car wreck that I was in, knee problems. And I understand that like, it affects every single part of your life, right? You are in pain, so maybe you're lashing out at your spouse or your loved ones. You don't have the patience that you used to because you just are constantly on edge because of the pain. You need to try relief factor. It's not a drug, but it was developed by doctors to fight inflammation, which is, in fact, the root cause of many people's pain. You can try it today. The three-week quick start is only 1995. It's a trial pack. And I think it's about 70% of people who order that trial pack go on to keep ordering more because it works for them and it can be life changing. You can go to relieffactor.com to get that three-week quick start. Again, that is relieffactor.com. Thanks to, first and foremost, police TV subscribers.

So make sure you're subscribed and comment. Comment. Let us know what you think of the news of the day. So I want to get to, Eric, this, what's going on in Tennessee. I love what Tennessee Republicans are doing over there. So we played the day that they, there was, I'm sorry, I get a little choked up when I think about it. The, the, that fateful day of the Tennessee insurrection that happened over there on the house floor. Well, Tennessee Republicans expelled two state house Democrats yesterday over their actions during all of that storming of the state Capitol building where, you know, I mean, they, they, they helped them. They snuck stuff in. It was a the darkest day. The day our democracy almost died. I mean, like these, these clowns have been telling us for two freaking years that taking over Capitol grounds, storming Capitol grounds, all of that is like the worst thing you can ever do as an American citizen. So okay, great. Then that's really bad. And we're just going to expel you if you had anything to do with it. So this is Nashville Democrat representative Justin Jones expelled from the house, Democrat Justin Pearson from Memphis and Jones here said that Republicans were leading an assault on democracy during his debate on his expulsion and set the world is watching. Oh, no, actually they're, they're not, they're not watching a Tennessee hearing. Sorry, they're just not. And he admitted during the debate to sneaking a bullhorn into the chamber under his coat, after which he was the one who led the chance with people sitting in the balcony. Let's watch him. We're putting today, ladies and gentlemen, as we are upholding our constitution, we are protecting the integrity of this body. Let's vote to expel him. That will send the case back to the voters in Davidson County. And if after looking at his conduct, they find he should come back. We will welcome him as a representative. Representative Jones. Thank you, Mr. Speaker. I didn't hear a question. Well, my colleague's statement were, was eloquent. What he was essentially saying was that Justin is an uppity Negro. Oh, Jesus Christ. Oh my God. He, he, he, that wasn't, man, he's a brace obsessive hustlers, man. Like he said nothing about that. That had nothing to do with anything. Yeah. Between the lines, you heard the dog whistles in what he would say. He just pointed out that card, man, an old favorite guy. He just reached right in the back pocket and said, well, right out to get gold. Like Jesus Christ. Um, okay. I also want to play here is a representative Justin Pearson. Much. Yes, I tell you, it was a sad day on Saturday. Oh, hope seemed to be lost. Representatives with Ron out of the state house. Democracy seemed to be at its end. Seemed like the NRA and gun lobbyists might win. But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee might last. But oh, we have good news, folks. We've got good news that Sunday always comes. Resurrection is a promise. It is a prophecy. It's a prophecy that came out of the cotton fields. It's a prophecy that came out of the lynching tree. It's a prophecy that still lives in each and every one of us in order to make the state of Tennessee the place that it ought to be. So I've still got home because I know we are still here and we will never quit. So is it like a thing where if people, if people think that they speak like a preacher, it doesn't matter what they say, it will sound like a thing. I haven't seen anybody speak like that outside of, like I said, pulpit. Like I don't, that was kind of weird. Like he thinks he's like, I guess Marlutha King. He's a preacher though as well. So I don't know who he thinks is a Reverend. Maybe he is. I don't know the man like that. Maybe actually he is. And it's just a direct crossover. And you know, he's kind of doing this thing there. But it's just for me. All right. I said this before like, okay, if you are a with the whole January 6th, right, the most the day democracy almost died. And people kick their feet up on this, the Pelosi's desk. And that was the worst possible thing that one could do. And you know, we have an instance here where it's not the nation's capital, but you know, it's a capital, none less. And you have a governmental property, right? The infiltrated the governmental property. And the difference between, I would argue that this is worse, not in terms of the impact, but worse in terms of the fact that now we have and we know that they're actually members of, right, members of the government assisting them in their efforts. Just remember they accused Republicans and They accused even though Trump said the complete opposite, they certainly accused him of leading this whole deal. So we have direct proof that they actually ate it in this, right? So one could take that as you utilizing, I don't know, I guess trying to get a bunch of mob of people to do something against your political enemies, right? Now in any other context, and this is why the whole well, imagine if it was us type of thing doesn't really work with these types because well, being hypocritical is only something that matters to people that look at that as a core set of like ethics and values that they find, let's say obnoxious or find bad. These guys don't at all. The analogy that I've used in the boxing ring that you heard me say all the time, where it's like entering in a boxing ring with someone that I told you, I'm going to low blow you. By the way, I bought off the referees and I bought off the judges and you go into there and think, well, I got all this integrity and I'm going to, they don't care about it. They don't care. They have let you know we fight dirty. And what they anticipate is that you actually wouldn't know, I took it back, what they do is actually use your set of values against you, against you because they know that that's something that you value and care about. So they're like, well, they don't, they don't care at all about that stuff at all. So they'll use it certainly against you. And this is where, whether it be your Republican, whether it be your conservative, whether it be you, let's say you're not one of these sort of weird old sort of Democrats, you need to acknowledge the landscape and how it is that they play. Because you know, going back to our first segment, you can't defeat sort of an enemy unless you understand that. To take it back to video games, which has nothing to do with this, but there's a game called your actual eyes. So you're going to take it to the audience. So I get to do it. It's a game called Ghost Tsushima, right? And the main character, you know, they were fighting Mongols based on that sort of era or whatever. And as they're fighting these Mongols as they call them, they, the uncle, right? The, of the main character is like, we don't fight like them. They do all these dirty tactics. And Gee, man, character, he's like, I'm trying to save us. I don't care. I'm going to do all the sneaky stuff that they be doing to us. I'm getting all, I'm doing all of that. And it was a real kind of depiction of kind of how real world politics and real world culture kind of, kind of manifest itself because a lot of people go into it thinking that it's admirable to just play fair with people that play unfair. But that's actually going to cause you to lose a battle. So this is one of the instances where they're saying, all right, y'all, y'all made the rules before. So how about we just play that game through all the hypocritical stuff? No, you're going to play your game. You can live by the rules that you created. See how you like it. See what happens next.

The Arizona governor Katie Hobbs vetoed legislation yesterday that would protect newborns from infanticide after surviving an abortion, regardless of whether the baby is likely to survive. So the bill changed the language of fetus to infant and delivered to born alive. And those who fail to comply would face legal consequences. It's hard to understand the reason for vetoing such legislation other than just this is literally a death cult that we're dealing with. So current state law only requires that abortionists offer lifesaving care to those babies born alive after 20 weeks. But it just what would be the harm Eric if you are if you are a person who believes in people's I don't know right to like live and be born. What would be the harm in saying you know what if there's a botched abortion and a baby ends up coming out and it's still alive. What do you say we not kill it even if the chances are small that that might happen. What do you say we just I don't know try to let it live now that it's alive. Man these people are evil people for sure. Now again it's just it's just crazy how we discussed this in terms of like legislation because this stuff should be like common sense stuff. If we weren't such a degenerate culture it would seem like an obvious thing and pretty much every individual no matter where it's out of the political aisle would look at something like that and it's like oh it's a baby. And if it can be saved save it under any under you know under those circumstances. But you know the fact that I look at it like that the fact that this stuff has to even be yeah put in a legislation and on other hand like you have people that you don't. Yeah that would be an opposition to sort of that. I think against speaks to the cultural issues it is that we have and that's why I don't believe that you know my I'm pretty sure there'll be people on the network that would disagree with me on this. This is why I don't believe that the government certainly is going to save us from a lot of these problems because I think they're the lagging indicator more than anything. Politics are even Breitbart understood that politics are on the downstream. So you know when you have something like that and you see it manifest itself in legislation that's like late to the party. Right. There's something that's doesn't happen to the people in that geographical area that they even think that that's something that's okay. That's something that's permissible. And I would much rather discuss that and how we can sort of combat that as opposed to looking at it through the lens of what we got to expect the government to fix it. And it's like even if the government made it this way like or whatever veto or not like there's still a bunch of weirdos who think that it is acceptable that people or babies be killed really in any given format but in especially during a boss sort of abortion. What in the hell has happened to this country? It's so frustrating too because a lot of leftists will I think similar to what you were talking about with the trans activists saying like well that's not happening. They're not they're not chopping off you know girls breasts who are under 18. That's not true. There's no sex change surgeries under 18 and you show them the evidence and they're like nah-ah, nah-ah. It's the same thing with this. It's like yeah but your party is they're literally advocating for infanticide and they're like nah-ah that's not true. It's like but what other reason would Katie Hobbs have to veto this bill that her own legislature already said okay we'll agree I mean you know I think it was like one one Democrat in the house. But still the legislature that your state chose decided that they could agree enough on this to pass it through. What other reason would she have other than I advocate for infanticide? I just don't understand how there could be any other reason other than yes I'm okay with infanticide if it's what the mother wants. Well yeah I mean that's the reality of it and I'm not against using sort of that language by any means because it's calling it for what it is. This is why I don't like the term like gender affirming care for example. Right. Literally the opposite. It's completely the opposite and it's more you know when we say they get mad when we use terms like child mutilation because it sounds bad I was like well that's literally what it is. Right. If you don't like the way that it sounds maybe you should kind of address that with yourself. Re-think your position. Yeah maybe you should reassess the position it is that you have if you don't like people calling something that's what it is. Not the way they do it where it's this roundabout way to try to say I'm advocating violence and they can't really there's nothing to cling to there. This is calling something what it is and you don't like it presented that way because we're not using a soft language that you use. That you use in the first place to get people kind of soften to sort of these ideas. So this is why again I'm not against that I'm not against that language calling it because I call it what exactly what it is. They should be faced to have to deal with that as opposed to us trying to use their little soft language that again they use to sort of spread this gospel which is the complete opposite of us completely demonic to other people and get them on board with these ideas because they call it something that I imagine I know it's a different subject with gender affirming care. Like imagine that term like gender affirming care. It's like I don't know you're like chemical castration like accurate and child mutilation so more what do you mean gender affirming care. They're very good at weaponizing language for their own gain. So I want really quickly I want your reaction to this. John Kirby this is coordinator for strategic communications at the National Security Council said that by the Biden administration when it comes to Afghanistan they're proud of their botched withdrawal from Afghanistan watch. People don't have an issue with the decision to order troops out of Afghanistan it is with the way that this president ordered it done there were children being killed there were people hanging off of Air Force jets that were leaving and you're saying that you guys are proud of the way that this mission was conducted. Does it mean a bat? Proud of the fact that we got more than 124,000 people safely out of Afghanistan you bet. It blows my mind to hear him. Yeah I saw this right before that video that clip right be on the show and yeah I mean they're not going to ever admit to any sort of fault in how they've done certainly anything it is a great point that you know I don't think anybody's or at least they shouldn't the War Hawk certainly will bush types of us leaving any country for that matter that we should have never been in the first place. That's not the problem though the problem has never been about that it was obviously about how it was conducted and maybe it was an inefficient way of certainly doing it and that's the thing that people certainly took issue and it doesn't surprise me at all that the government would take pride in screwing up. Right yeah well that's your federal government for you congratulations America. Alright we got to take another quick break but I want to tell you about the movie nefarious if you have not yet heard about it which you should have the executive producer one of them is our very own Steve Days because he wrote the book that it was based off of and it's by the same people who did God's not dead and unplanned and so it is a spiritual movie which I know a lot of people you know Christian movies get a bad rap because they're like oh they're boring they're low budget they're this is not that movie Eric.
