    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show and thank you so much for tuning in and if it's your first time here, hey, my name is Lauren and we have a ton to talk about. As usual, let's just jump right into it. We're going to be starting the show off with a discussion of the death penalty, something that I don't think we've really talked about before on this show. And YouTube is cranking up the censorship as I warned you all would absolutely happen. Plus, Tulsi Gabbard has introduced a bill that she claims will protect biological women in sports, but which critics say is actually transphobic because, hey, what is it nowadays? And then finally, we'll be finishing off with a discussion of the comic book industry and how social justice has really just beat it to death, the death penalty. This is an issue that strangely for me, I actually don't have a very strong opinion on one way or another, or I kind of go back and forth as to what I actually believe and I'll explain it like this. Do I think that there are crimes out there that warrant being sentenced to death? Absolutely. And I'm talking about things like serial killers, child, rapist and murderers, that type of very serious, very, very grievous crime. But where my kind of moral objection comes into it is that do I trust the state or the criminal justice system to be infallible enough to be able to bestow that punishment upon someone? That's a little bit of a harder question for me. I'm someone who is at all stages very critical of the government, very pro-individual freedom. And so for me, looking at the government, the criminal justice system that I have so many criticisms of and then saying, yes, I think you should have the power to put someone to death, it just doesn't really sit right with me. I guess my kind of stance on this would be that I support it in some circumstances for very serious crimes if it is just beyond question that the person in question, absolutely 100% is guilty because it's really the thought of someone being put to death wrongfully. That gives me pause. And I think judging from what I've seen with this conversation, having it with others, that's quite a common standpoint to have. Now the reason why I even bring this up is because the death penalty is back in the headlines after a recent execution that a lot of celebrity activists kind of voice their opinions against. We have this article from Global News. I know I chose a Canadian news site to report on this American story, but there we go. It says, the Trump administration on Thursday carried out its ninth federal execution of the year and the first during a presidential lame duck period in 130 years, putting to death a Texas street gang member for his role in the slangs of a religious couple from Iowa more than two decades ago. As someone who is religious, I do find it a bit strange that that's how they chose to frame this piece. Like the slaying of a religious couple is what he's guilty of. Would it be less grievous if the couple weren't religious? I kind of question why that was included, but anyway, let's move on. They say four more federal executions, including one Friday, are planned in the weeks before President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration. His supposed inauguration, I will say, I will say. So this case in particular, the one that everyone is up in arms about, is that of Brandon Bernard who received a lethal injection of some very long chemical name inside a death chamber at a US prison in Tearout, Indiana. It was a rare execution of a person who was in his teens when his crime was committed. And I just want to say, so talking about nine executions this year, they're referring specifically to federal executions. And what I understand, there are other people who are executed at a state level. They also say that several high profile figures, including reality TV star Kim Kardashian, had appealed to US President Donald Trump to commute Bernard's sentence to life in prison. Bernard directed his last words to the family of the couple he killed, speaking with striking calm for someone who knew he was about to die. I'm sorry, he said, lifting his head and looking at the witness room windows. The only words that I can say that completely capture how I feel now and how I felt that day. Speaking for more than three minutes, Bernard said he had been waiting for this chance to say he was sorry, not only to the victim's family, but also for the pain he caused his own family. Earlier, he said about his role in the killing. I wish I could take it all back, but I can. Bernard was 18 when he and four other teenagers abducted and robbed, taught in Stacey, badly on their way from a Sunday service in Colleen, Texas. Rural executions were resumed by Trump in July after a 17 year hiatus, despite the COVID outbreak in US prisons. So obviously with this being such a high profile case, a lot of people, including AOC have weighed in and she is all for abolishing the death penalty. And that seems to be at least for now the popular consensus among people that the death penalty is wrong and antiquated and that it shouldn't happen. But I asked, do you support the death penalty and 68.9% of people responded? Yes, 31.1% responded. No, and so far there's about 11,000 votes on that poll. To me, the problem here is that so often with the question of the death penalty, people painted as an issue of, well, you either kill people or you just let them go and there's no punishment at all. And I feel like for some people it comes down to a matter of are we actually punishing people sufficiently for their crimes? And I know when I explained my stance on the issue, that's a lot of the reception that I got from people that, oh, would you just want this person to walk away after doing something so heinous? And no, that at least is not my position at all. There are things like life in prison, which some have argued is even worse than being put to death because of the ongoing monotony and things like that. But when it comes to this case specifically, the Bernard case, I, although I'm sure he is guilty, I actually, and I would love to hear your take on this, I would not have supported the death penalty. I would have preferred something like life in prison and let me explain why he was only a teenager when he committed this heinous act. Does that excuse him or absolve him from being punished? Absolutely not. You're old enough at that age. No, you don't murder a couple. But putting someone to death for, I think, you know, acts they committed at such a young age, that just doesn't sit right with me either. And I think this is something that people should weigh in their minds when we discuss something like the death penalty. This is very, this is a different scenario than if the person in question I would say I would have been older, you know, in their 30s or 40s or heck even 20s or had a, you know, a longer history or several murders under their belt. That's the kind of thing that I would keep into consideration if I were the one to be in charge of deciding whether someone got the death penalty. And an example of someone who I think should deserve the death penalty is this other case that the global article also references it says, Alfred Bourgeois, a 56 year old Louisiana truck driver is set to die Friday for killing his two year old daughter by repeatedly slamming her head into a truck's windows and dashboard. Bourgeois's lawyer alleged he was intellectually disabled and therefore ineligible for the death penalty. But several courts said evidence didn't support that claim. I've also heard reports that there was, there was actually abuse going on leading up to the murder of his daughter. And as far as I can tell, there's no question as to whether or not he did it. And his own lawyer is saying, yeah, he did it, but he's not mentally sound. I don't, I don't have any qualms with someone like that being put to death. And from the other side, I've also seen the issue of racism brought up because of course, of course it will be it's 2020. I've heard some people say that the fact that Bernard got the death penalty, but someone like Dylan roof did not just goes to show how systemic racism is pervasive in our justice system. And I've also seen other people say like, okay, well, even if they're both getting the death penalty, the fact that Bernard is getting killed so much sooner goes to show that I don't know. We all hate black people more and a lot of people may not realize this, but his, his crime is not going to be a bad thing. And I've also seen other people say like, okay, well, even if they're both getting the death penalty, the fact that Bernard is getting killed so much sooner goes to show that I don't know, the crime actually happened I think 20 years ago, the article said so there's been a long appeals process leading up to this. So it's not like they've just really tried to prioritize killing a black man over a white man because racism it's no, from what I understand, you know, this process appeals. It's it's all been played out. It's just that this is coming to head now, whereas the whole Dylan roof thing I think only concluded about four years ago. So as far as I can tell, no, I'm sorry. No systemic racism there. And I also want to address the issue of a, you know, I, I kind of paint the issue as should the government have the authority and the power to put someone to death. And in response to that, I did see other people saying, hang on. No, it's not the government that decides whether someone is put to death. It's actually just a jury of their peers. So it's different. And I have a response to that that I put out. I said to those saying it's not the state that decides it's a jury of peers, whether a crime is eligible for the death penalty, who gets charged, what judges appointed and how the appeals process happens are all determined by the state. And I would say to that as well, even if that weren't the case, I still do not believe that, you know, a jury of your peers should have any more control over your life. Right? I mean, I think that's, that's not something that I would want a group of random people, even if they are my peers, to be able to decide. So I just have problems with the whole premise. I have been told that, you know, me being critical of the death penalty in any way means that I'm not a Christian or that I should oppose it. If I am a Christian and it's just a, it's an issue where there's a lot of, I think, bad faith arguments being put forward. And I respect people on both sides of the aisle have had someone actually suggest that as someone sort of in the middle who sees both sides, maybe what I could do is moderate a debate between two people who have opposing viewpoints. And I think that would actually be something really fun if there are any people on either side of the debate that you think would be interested in that. Please let me know because I would, I would be willing, willing to do that. Next up, let us move on to YouTube censorship. But before we get to that, I want to say thank you to our sponsor, Bull and Branch. So what do millions of Americans and three former US presidents have in common? They all agree that bull and branch sheets are the softest and most comfortable pure organic cotton sheets on earth. Bull and branch cotton is rain fed pesticide free and carries the highest organic certification. That is why it is so soft because they work with family owned mills all over the world to expertly weave every single set of bull and branch sheets with the highest level of craftsmanship. It is quality. You can feel the moment you open the box. I own a set of bull and branch sheets and they are like nothing else. And bed sheets are one of those things that when you start to invest in better quality, it is really hard to go back to the stuff you used to use before. And we spend about a third of our lives in bed sleeping. So in my opinion, bedding including bed sheets, it is really not the type of stuff you want to skimp out on. You owe that much to yourself a good night's sleep. And since they sell direct to you, bull and branch sheets start at just $160. What you're getting is $1,000 quality sheets for just a fraction of the price. Plus you can sleep on them for a month entirely risk free. Right now you will get $50 off any sheet set at bullandbranch.com with the promo code CHEN that is spelled B-O-L-L and branch.com with the promo code CHEN for $50 off bullandbranch.com again with the promo code CHEN. Restrictions may apply. See bullandbranch.com for details. Holiday season is coming up. If you know someone and you're not really sure what to get them. Set of bed sheets is a pretty safe way to go. I can't imagine many people who wouldn't like that. So I have for a very long time now for years really been critical of YouTube and the way that they are censoring and controlling the public discourse. I think since 2016 really we've seen them gradually turn up the amount of censorship and control that they're exerting over their creators. And it kind of started off almost not noticeably. I know as someone who does political commentary and controversial subjects it kind of started with getting fewer and fewer views sent my way from like search results or video recommends. And then eventually YouTube came out and just said alright we are going to be like sequestering quote problematic content or even borderline content even if it doesn't explicitly violate the terms of service. And we also saw them saying alright we're going to be trying to elevate authoritative sources and you know side lining independent commentators. And now with with the whole US election thing they're just explicitly saying alright if you say something we don't like we're just going to delete you. And we saw kind of the beginnings of this as well with the whole covid fiasco. They were like censoring videos that went against what the WHO was saying at the time. Now I think you know the mask is off they feel like Trump is going to be out of office they're not going to be facing any opposition from the Biden administration. So they're just like alright we'll do whatever we want. This is from YouTube's official blog it says supporting the 2020 US election. They write yesterday was the safe harbor deadline for the US presidential election and enough states have certified their election results to determine a president elect. Given that we will start removing any piece of content uploaded today or anytime after that misleads people by alleging that widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US presidential election in line with our approach towards historical US presidential elections. For example we will remove videos claiming that a presidential candidate won the election due to widespread software glitches or counting errors we will begin enforcing this policy today and will ramp up in the weeks to come. This is terrifying especially for someone who again does political commentary right now we see that YouTube is deciding what is and what is not true and what deserves to be said in the public square which at the moment in this day and age absolutely involves what's happening online. They also continue by saying while only a small portion of watch time is election related content YouTube continues to be an important source of election news on average 88% of the videos in top 10 search results related to elections came from authoritative news sources amongst the rest are things like newsy late night shows and the most viewed channels and videos are from news channels like NBC and CBS even if YouTube weren't removing videos that question the election results you have to understand that the way their algorithm works they still would not have been directing viewers to ward you alright if you're a random person and you're talking about the presidential election online on YouTube the only way basically people are going to find your content is if it's shared and that's why we depend so much on our viewers to share our content because YouTube isn't featuring us in search results and algorithms were not an authoritative source i.e. one of the news outlets that has actually financially partnered with YouTube so I mean you know this is shocking this is definitely an escalation of their policies of control but it's not surprising and it's not new and you know ever since Alex Jones got booted from YouTube people like me have warned that this type of stuff was just just around the corner but there were so many people out there who were saying like okay hang on I'm not for censorship but I don't really like Alex Jones so I think it was okay that YouTube did this no okay you have to draw a line in the sand and say this is not okay that line came and went as soon as Alex Jones was kicked off the platform and since then it's kind of been like that slow but steady ramp up and I think now we're genuinely at a point where it's it's too late right conservatives are never going to have an equal chance with YouTube that that time has come and gone and it's really sad because I will get people asking me hey I would love to start a YouTube channel and do you know conservative or libertarian or even classically liberal commentary like you how do I start out I unfortunately don't think it's possible in this day and age to do what I did and organically grow a following on YouTube just because they're not going to let people see your videos right and they and they admit it they admit that they're not going to they're going to direct people to other places like CNN and there's something else that I thought was really interesting in regard to this whole story so I also looked on the Google website to see how this affected TOS in general and it says in regard to presidential election integrity content that advances false claims that widespread fraud errors or glitches change the outcome of any past US presidential election or not allowed but it says note this applies to elections in the United States only isn't that strange so on YouTube you can assert that I don't know the elections in Canada were fraudulent widespread fraud and errors affected the results you can say that you know in the UK the election system is not secure widespread glitches have affected things and that's totally fine but you can't say that about the US or your video will get removed I want to hear the justification from YouTube and their supporters as to why that distinction exists why it's okay for people to say that about non-American elections but not American elections and I also want to know if the people who have been claiming Russiagate and Russian meddling in the 2016 election for the past four years if their videos are going to be removed now that apparently YouTube is taking this hard stance that you can't dare question election integrity I would really love to know because if that's the case then a ton of Rachel Maddow clips are in trouble right a ton of I would even say the young Turks clips are in trouble but this is another example of the the term of the service are not going to be equally enforced right as garbage as they are written what's going to be even worse is their enforcement so they also give explicit examples of what is not allowed says claims that a candidate only won a swing state in the 2020 presidential election due to voting machine glitches claims that dead people voted in numbers that changed the outcome of the 2016 presidential election strange that they have the 2016 election there but only only in regard to dead people voting does that mean if it's in regard to Russian interference you can claim that stuff was changed I really don't know they also say you're not allowed claims that fake ballots were dumped to give one candidate enough votes to win a state in a past u.s presidential election they do say we may allow content such as the examples above if it includes countervailing views or sufficient context in the images or audio of the video itself what I think is especially disturbing about this is that YouTube is acting like the presidential election this past one is all said and done everything's been being settled they're kind of painting it as if to continue to question things means that you are some deranged conspiracy theorists today I have to say even if you are conspiracy theorists I still think you should be allowed to post YouTube videos I still think people should be allowed to search for you because there are people out there who want to know about it and I don't think YouTube's role should be to play editor and decide what people can or cannot watch overall I have supported a lot of what Trump has done as presidency but I have to say I am so so disappointed that he and the republicans did not do more to bring a big tech to their knees again for years we have known that big tech has a bias against conservatives and I mean you know there've been there've been hearings where people like Mark Zuckerberg and you know the google heads have been brought in and they've essentially told lies to congress and you know Trump has tweeted a lot of stuff but in terms of actual results haven't really seen it yet so I mean a lot of people are asking how does section 230 affect all of this and you know we have people like Tim Poole saying oh don't remove section 230 because you know if sites like YouTube aren't allowed to claim I guess immunity from legal action based on them being platforms not publishers then it's just gonna make I suppose censorship against conservatives worse but what I want to see happen is you know section 230 can stay because I still believe in that distinction but I think you know the Trump administration someone needs to make a ruling and just clarify that as long as YouTube does this they are not eligible for section 230 protections meaning that if you are another company and you actually are just being a platform you're not participating in all these editorial decisions that YouTube Facebook and Twitter absolutely are now then you know you have that legal immunity but this YouTube cannot claim protections under section 230 anymore as far as I'm concerned it's absolutely ridiculous that anyone would say otherwise and so what I want to see now is I want to see someone try to sue YouTube for content that was posted onto their site and you know I want to see YouTube in a court of law try to claim protections under section 230 because right now actually Trump did release an executive order saying what you know similar to what I am that if a if a platform does this this or this which YouTube is doing all of it they're no longer a platform but a publisher but we haven't really seen that clear cut ruling to say you know whether youtuber or not can claim this protection so I mean you know going forward am I hopeful that something is going to change and we will get back YouTube from 2016 where it's like you could you could get on the trending page if you were just some random person talking about politics I would love that but I'm not confident that that is going to happen I'm very disappointed in Republicans for not having done more and especially considering it's not just American politics that are at risk here it's politics worldwide I mean every single country has their own equivalent of the establishment and people trying to speak up against it or you know the liberal side versus the versus the more conservative side that big tech may not like and it's you know for all of these countries this is an issue that matters you know in Canada there was also instances of the PPC which is our like center right libertarian party encountering censorship on social media I don't I don't foresee this getting better frankly yeah but let's move on okay so Tulsi gabbard she is someone who you know as a democrat overall I really like her I am a huge fan of her stance on foreign policy she's very you know non interventionist she's not a neo-con or a neo-liberal which I love her her domestic policy positions are frankly more akin to bernie sanders so I can't say that I would I would support her in that regard but she just did something that really impressed me as well oh and she's very pro free speech which I appreciate and she recognizes the problems that exist with big tech currently so we have the story from the New York Post it says Tulsi gabbard introduces bill to protect women's sports based on biological sex and this is actually a bill that she is I guess co-sponsoring with a republican so it's nice to see that on this issue at least to a certain extent there's bipartisan support we don't see that too often nowadays anymore but it says the protect women's sports act seeks to clarify that title line protections for female athletes are based on biological sex gabbard and maulin who is the republican said in a statement the legislation would prohibit schools from receiving federal funding if they permit a person whose biological sex at birth is male to participate in an athletic program or activity that is designated for women or girls all right so a little bit of things to unpack there all right so title nine protections for those of you who aren't familiar is something that essentially the the department of education has that says you cannot discriminate on the basis of sex as an educational institution when it comes to receiving federal funding so basically this legislation is not just saying that you know schools that don't allow trans athletes to participate in the the sports club of their choosing can still receive federal funding it's going even further and saying that if you receive federal funding you may not allow a person who's biological sex at birth is male to participate in athletic program designated for women or girls you see what the difference is like before i'm pretty sure a lot of people would say that oh it should be federal funding should be withheld if you are someone who vigorously thinks that trans women shouldn't be competing with women this takes it a step even further and says that if you are a school who says that trans women should compete with women you won't get you won't get federal funding i think honestly this is necessary trans women in women's sports has been a hot button issue for years now we've done several segments on this and my position has always remained the same competing in women's sports is not a right and there are biological differences between men and women that do give biological males an advantage in sports and this is even true if a biological male is for example on hormone blockers and taking estrogen because i mean the way that the body develops before like there are advantages that don't go away just because you are now taking different hormones so good on tulsi gabard for doing this you know this isn't a stance that we've seen many people on the left or democrat democrats advocate for so she's definitely kind of going against the grain um we are going to be going over what the reaction to this on social media has been but first i want to say thank you to quip so there are only two types of people in the world those of us who brush and floss every day and those who don't but just might start thanks to quip's new refillable

really i feel so bad for telsie gabbard because for me she represents gosh a politician who i don't necessarily agree with politically but still one whom i can respect and whom i know is a patriot at heart who loves her country don't forget in addition to serving as a representative in the house she is also a veteran and you know i i don't doubt that she's a good person even though we are not politically aligned uh but she is someone who's been ruthlessly smeared by the media starting with her her presidential campaign you know she's been called uh what is it an Assad is supporter for saying hey let's scale back on the foreign intervention she's been accused of being a Russian asset and all of these crazy crazy things just for going against you know the establishment democrat bottom line it's just it's too bad because we need more people like her in politics but you know the less so far she used to be doing everything they can to chase her out so we have Sarah McBride who in response to this story tweeted out telsie gabbard assigned republican at birth i mean if leftists want to make protecting biological women in sports a republican issue i guess they can go ahead but it seems like a pretty pretty silly thing to do considering this is just common sense and i don't think it's anti-trans in the least you don't need to be against trans people to just recognize that being a trans woman is not the same as being a cisgendered woman and i've had people say okay well then what are trans people supposed to do be banned from sports entirely no i don't think so i think you know competing in men's sports is always should always be an option and i also think like if if there are enough trans people to make this possible i wouldn't be opposed to like a trans womanly exclusively and i think you know that would solve a lot of the issues because it wouldn't make trans women compete against men which they might find distasteful and it also would protect biological women who uh you know think it's unfair that someone who might be like you know six foot five and two hundred pounds but now identifies as woman is able to compete against them but we have other other people who are also chimed in equally uncharitably so Natasha this person says i did track in high school i'm assuming this person is trans and perform to the best of my ability and can say those assigned male at birth do not have any more advantage than someone born with natural ability every girl on the team was stronger and faster than i was and i was by no mean slower week we hear um anecdotal evidence like this all the time regarding this specific issue and i mean maybe this person is just exceptionally bad at sports but the science is the science it's so strange how when it comes to certain things the left is all like oh let's support the science when it comes to the issue of gender and biological sex they're not so much with the science and uh you know i even had someone mentioned well what about a biological woman like castor samena who's not trans but just really gifted like what about her castor samena is and i this is a phrase or a term that's you know offensive to some i don't know another way to say it but from what i understand she is a hematfera dead i might even have internal testes which is why she has so much testosterone which does give her a physical advantage so i you know no that's not the same and you know worldwide if we look at the top competitors in women's sports they are now disproportionately trans women or intersex uh so it's i don't think that's a coincidence and it's just it's just not very believable to say that things like testosterone don't affect your performance in sports because we know that's absolutely not true uh bret louis says how is this small government what part of the constitution calls for policing athletics and gender oh well i guess there must not be much other pressing business going on in the country these days all right so this is an interesting like how can you be pro small government if you support policing people's genders i think there's a good i mean as long as we're supporting small government i think there's a good good argument to be made that none of this should be federally funded how about that right uh but in terms of like you know whether something is small government or not if it's a private sports league i don't think it's either small or big government for them to establish their own rules of who can and who cannot compete in their competitions like i mean that's just that's not even related and i love how people like this only talk about small government when it benefits their argument in a way i mean it never actually does but at least when they think it does we also see this with abortion how can you be small government if if you don't support abortions like well i didn't realize that part of being small government would was allowing murder likewise i didn't know that being pro small government meant allowing anyone who wants to identify as female to actually identify as female um this isn't an issue that i think will be resolved anytime soon and i think as we see the number of trans identifying people to continue to rise this is going to be an actually bigger and bigger issue you know in canada i think currently the we did a segment previously on this the person the trans woman who holds the the title of like some sort of cycling champion uh you know she's come out and firmly said like oh no i'm i don't have any advantages just because i'm trans and it's like eh if if you say so uh all right let us move on the final story let's talk about comics so i'm someone who who actually doesn't really read many comics but i do like a lot of comic book adaptations that you know have come to places like the big screen or tv shows and actually i recently finished listening to an audiobook of niel game and sandman which i think was originally a comic but was kind of adapted into this like audio presentation which was very very good and i highly recommend it but it's interesting uh you know the comic industry in terms of its audience is majority male but you and there's nothing wrong with that by the way but right now it seems like comics are one of the industries that is most being infected by social justice warriors and i don't quite understand why that's happening uh you know there's this whole comics gate thing as well it just seemed like the people who are in charge of creating content and in charge of these business decisions are not seeing eye to eye with their actual readers and uh you know we we did a segment when miss marvel was kind of announced as a new series if you're not familiar miss marvel is i guess marvel's first superhero of color that is also female and muslim so very exciting there i i'm not sure i don't know anyone who actually reads this comic or likes it but they're making us a series out of it and it's in the news now because there are casting leaks or rumors this isn't confirmed but it's been rumored that someone named yazmin Fletcher has been cast in the role of a muslim girl but she's actually half white and christian and so everyone is really mad about it now so we have some some posts discussing film says hashtag fix miss marvel is trending in response to worrying casting and not only is yazmin Fletcher a half white christian girl reportedly cast as a turkish hajabi andrew broder multiple title line allegations filed against him he's supposedly in this as well and matt lintz another actor there's evidence he is a trump supporter because we're going to be getting to the other two actors involved in this but let's start with yazmin Fletcher so miss marvel news uh which is like a fan account dedicated to this they put out that yazmin Fletcher has not done anything egregious but we find it inappropriate that a half white christian girl was apparently cast as nakia bahadir same goes for zenobia shraaf who is a non-muslim indian apparently cast as kamala's pakistani muslim mother so there are a couple aspects of this i want to touch upon let's talk about the whole christian versus muslim thing um do these people not understand acting like at all i mean so we've had people complain about non-disabled actors playing disabled characters we've had people complain about uh you know women like scarlet joe and playing a trans man and she got bullied out of that role so it's like all right you can't pretend to for example need a wheelchair if you don't you can't pretend to have gender dysphoria if you don't we also know that they don't like it when a straight actor pretends to be gay if they're not but now this also applies to religion like you can't even pretend to have different religious beliefs then you actually like what is acting then what is acting these people do not understand saying that someone is the wrong religion as an actor to play a certain role is the most ridiculous thing i have ever heard of these people have like a child's interpretation of how making a movie should go you you do realize that when people die on screen they're not actually being killed right that's not how making movies work so i think it's it's just ridiculous i for one i'm not in favor of religious testing when it comes to actors being cast in roles and then regarding the whole i guess biracial thing so this i think is what upset people the most we have a ton of tweets here one person said brown rep you better do it right you're representing me i will not tolerate no trump supporters or crackers where they do not belong lovely just tolerance you know uh marvel said we're going to be give you a mismarvel show that is so islamophobic nikia should not be played by a white christian girl yeah so just people are not thrilled and this is the same kind of rhetoric we saw when disney went ahead and cast i think her name is nayomi scott in the role of jasmine uh for their live action allowed in representation she's also biracial not not brown enough according to the internet as someone who is biracial i'm half chinese um these people are just so insanely racist uh you know i overall i can't say that i've had a negative experience you know growing up being biracial i don't want to make myself into a victim or anything here but when you have all of these people descending on biracial people for not being Turkish enough brown enough chinese enough like it really is i mean it's it's racist bullying uh you know biracial people already might be prone to feel like an outsider and other because you're not fully this not fully the other and what really enforces that is when you have crowds of people saying no you are not pure enough to play this role uh which is exactly what this poor actress jasmine fletcher is going through i it feels just like a big warm hug i don't know how you can call yourself an anti-racist activist or pro-social justice if you're literally bullying a girl over her racial purity it's ridiculous and you know there might be some people out there who say well you know this is only an issue because hollywood is always preferring lighter skinned actors and not giving darker skinned actors a role and it's like well if you if you're afraid of that type of racism going on then why is your answer to combat it more racism in attacking every light skinned actress like is that really what you think is the appropriate way forward you don't know who else auditioned for the role you don't know uh what jasmine fletcher's performance was like uh how good it may have been to give her this role you don't know what what the you know the casting director had in mind so how can you say that this is upsetting this is not your project uh it's just it's really frustrating especially when we see all the time you know uh roles for white characters or lighter skinned characters going to darker skinned characters and it's like you know you can't have it both ways either the race of a character is intrinsic and it can't be compromised on and it's just an essential part of who they are or replacing white actors with black actors is the right thing to do in totally okay like you can have it both ways you know either the race matters or it doesn't and i just don't know how these people honestly see themselves as the good guys in any situation so yeah but it's not just this actress who's getting attacked it's also two of the males uh andrew broder who i'm not familiar with any of these actors by the way apparently is multiple title nine allegations filed against him that's kind of i mean that that's a little bit ambiguous because a title nine allegation could range from anything to you know you refuse to use someone's correct pronouns to actual rape so you know i'm not going to comment on that but from matt lintz um it says there's evidence this actor is a trump supporter and already people are freaking out it's like we've gone to a point where you can be canceled and people will be upset that you've gotten work not just if you're a trump supporter but if people even think you might possibly be a trump supporter it's like oh my goodness this is similar similar to what happened with matthew mcconnahay for daring to sympathize with trump supporters and of course you know because this the show does involve muslim characters now people are saying it's islamaphobic because apparently trump and all of his supporters hate muslims and it's just like why why why is it like this like why is it always things related to comics that are like this because i guarantee you most of the people who actually read comics a aren't reading this marvel and b don't care about petty controversies like this uh but we have one more story in relation to just the messed up world of comics and this comes to us from the marie su are our go-to for uh social justice issues and media entertainment so there uh there is this dc character starfire who is kind of like your quintessential smokeshoe superhero now there's a spin-off comic that's focusing on her daughter and her daughter actually is goth queer and fat so she essentially just looks like a self-insert of a social justice activist into a comic and actually uh we have a picture as well of the author um that is writing this and it really does look like this is a self-insert it looks like she's drawn a character based off of herself uh kind of hilarious but let's actually read about what what this comic is gonna gonna entail so it says 17 year old mandy daughter of starfire is not like her mother starfire is gorgeous tall sparkly and a hero mandy is not a sparkly superhero mandy has no powers is a kid who dies her hair black oh black hair trendy and hates everyone but her best friend lincoln to starfire who's from another planet mandy seems like an alien like some distant angry light years away moon and then of course let's get some diversity in here it says everything changes when she gets partnered with clair for a school project and mandy likes clair even if she denies it hardly and intensely a lot so uh if you do follow midnight's edge on youtube they are an amazing channel i've recommended them before they cover kind of uh media news and you know production news for different movies and tv shows i was recently on their podcast and we discuss this and oh gosh this is this is just what i've come to expect from the comic book industry honestly we saw that there was also like the new warriors that release characters like safe space and snowflake now we have this blatant marisue self-insert of a body positivity activist and it's like what happened to heroes being aspirational like better than ourselves something to look up to not something to make us feel satisfied with how completely mediocre and sometimes even terrible we are is it just that you know gen z and millennials are so narcissistic as a generation they need to see themselves even as terrible as we all kind of naturally are represented in media and it be glorified as a good thing who wants to read this this is an interesting this isn't this isn't something that the market wants i mean there's probably gonna be like 20 people on tumblr who are excited about this as well as the author of this marisue article but that's it and it just i continue to be amazed at how i don't know these companies seemingly put ideology before profits but maybe it's because they're being propped up by the actual big movies they do that people do care about but in any case that's pretty much all i have to say for now and as always i would love to hear what you guys think are you gonna be watching uh i am not starfire why or why not and how do you feel about the death penalty i know this is a huge and heavy topic let me know but that's it for now thank you so much for tuning in and i'll see you next time"
