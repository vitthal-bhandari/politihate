    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast Welcome in clay Travis Buck Sexton show Thursday edition of the program we are absolutely loaded down Kayleigh McEnany formerly with the Trump White House the spokesperson there now with Fox News She will join us as will senator Rand Paul plus We are going to be joined by one of the writers at outkick the site that I run For a story that he has broken and I want to open up with that We've been talking about Buck the idea of a transgender swimmer. This was a three-year swimmer at the University of Pennsylvania a man who was a successful swimmer obviously as he was swimming in College at the University of Pennsylvania in the Ivy League He took a year off and then came back as a member of the women's swimming team and since that has happened the records are through the roof that This swimmer is setting this swimmer won a biological man swimming with a group of women won by 38 seconds Annihilation of the second place swimmer and the question has been asked What do the women who were on the team the biological women on the team think about having a transgender swimmer? Well, we talked about this buck many of them and we're gonna talk to the writer of this article Who's been talking to some of these pen swimmers who have reached out to outkick and are telling us what they think as Women's swimmers about having a biological man who is crushing them and here are some quotes Pretty much everyone individually has spoken to our coaches about not liking this. This is a pen Women's swimmer our coach just really likes women winning. He's like most coaches I think secretly everyone knows it's the wrong thing to do When the whole team is together we have to be like oh my gosh. Golia. That's great. You're amazing It's very fake. She added a couple of other quotes from this pen swimmer who talked to outkick And by the way another member of the pen's women's swimming team is going to be up tomorrow morning with her own quotes Uh One year doesn't mean anything in regards to sitting out What about the years of puberty as a male the male growth you went through as a man And then she said at the end of the article something that I think really really sticks home here When I have kids this pen women's swimmer said I kind of hope they're all boys Because if I have any girls that want to play sports in college good luck Their opponents are all going to be biological men saying they're women right now We have one but what if we had three on the team there'd be three less girls competing This that final quote to me buck And these pen women's swimmers are so terrified to actually go public they reached out privately to outkick After we had written about this because they go to an Ivy League school buck you went to an East Coast school You can imagine these girls are afraid will they get into grad school? Will they be called transphobic? Will they be able to get a job in the Northeast if they come out and say we don't think it's right for a biological man to be competing against us But this is where the transgender Agenda inevitably ends in my opinion with the destruction of women sports Well, this is why when they say that men can get pregnant. It's important to say no, that's a lie This is why when the left says a man can become a woman or a woman can become a man It's important to say no, that's a lie because the moment you surrender reality to their political whims They can mold it to whatever purpose they see fit They can change as they need to in the circumstances of the moment and what we're seeing is just the end stage of the trans agendas incrementalism which I've been talking about this specific issue for 10 years and and at every phase we say well You know what's next here's what's next and they say don't be bigoted that will never happen Then two or three years passes and sure enough there are 12 year old boys using the same bathrooms and change facilities It's the 12 year old girls and if you oppose that they say you're a bigot you can actually see some mirror imaging I think here of you know Fauci a year ago. Oh, no, we don't want vaccine mandates I know we'll get into this in a few moments, but now it's sorry Yeah, I kind of like freedom, but I like mandates more right and and we say hold on you Used to say that you would never do this and now you're doing it what happened what changed? They push until they meet the resistance and then they back off a little and then they push until they meet the resistance And they back off a little this has been what the progressive left has done on all cultural and you know a culture war issue So to speak the trans agenda very high up on the list and now we're at that place where you have women who? You know clay you you spent a lot of time speaking to and following and involved in sports I know from friends of mine even a d3 school who I went to Amherst college They spent a tremendous amount of time at a very young age often on their sport. It's important to them Right there's something about being the best they can be at that level Yeah, a lot of them aren't gonna go pro at all that fine But it matters to them and this is there are women who are being Humiliated I mean that's a part of this and that's why they're coming to you at outcake They are being humiliated not just in the loss and this is why I think the piece on outcake is so important It's not just we're losing to this person or even our records are being broken There's social pressure to then have to celebrate that That feels very Soviet doesn't it? It really feels like the commies are running things when you have to say yeah The biological male also known as a man who is swimming against the women in the pool and winning Is not something that we should have to celebrate it's wrong and every reasonable rational person Knows it's wrong and that's why these women coming out and speaking out about this I think is so important because they're telling us what we all know and It's your point buck and I know you find this unbelievable Outkick is probably the only sports media site almost on the entire internet That would even allow these girls to talk and will tell their story Just think about how crazy that is for the world that we live in ESPN wouldn't do this story CBS wouldn't do this story NBC wouldn't do this story Almost no other sports media outlet would allow these girls to have a voice and think about this also for a minute Title 9 is about saying hey women are the equal of men for people out there who haven't paid a lot attention to title 9 It requires that there be equal scholarships given in colleges for men and women This represents buck the direct the direct conflict between feminists people who say hey Girl power we're as good as men. We deserve as many scholarships as men and now the transgender Agenda where men are now taking over women sports and the easy solution here isn't very clear to me because if you just say hey Okay, do away with sex-based Classifications for sports. We're not gonna have men's and women sports anymore Women don't make any teams and they don't win ever They don't even make the teams buck there if you if you had men's soccer and women's soccer And you just made it soccer there would never be a woman who played on a high-level soccer team once puberty occurs Because men are so much better same thing for for basketball there would be no women's basketball There would just be men who played basketball and so this transgender From male to female competition Threatens like the quote that I read of her at the end if there are two or three or four transgender athletes on a team They win every championship and there is no longer any women's sports. That is where we are headed It is a reality that people refuse to acknowledge right what we saw before this with Laurel Hubbard was somebody who Was not that good so did not break all the records It was only a matter of time before someone came along who was an elite athlete as a male and Then decided to transition in that sport and and beat everybody we have seen this years ago with a transgender MMA fighter Which I mean I think honestly it's gross just be illegal. I mean I think that's yes I think everybody should know that but there's also the broader sense that we should have that the Corporate media apparatus of the Democrat Party the Democrat Party overall Nancy Pelosi any Prominent Democrat right now. You sat them down on TV and you asked them. Does this seem right to you? They will not condemn it. So this is not a minor issue This is not something we're blowing out of proportion and oh, what's the big deal? they are either cowards or Complicit in this massive lie complicit in this Soviet style Racing of the obvious truth. This isn't a complicated matter, right? This isn't you know how long are we gonna deal with COVID and what do we do with all the vaccines? This is men are bigger stronger and faster than women because of biology. Yeah, we also grow facial hair And there are other things we all know that are different than than women and that we're supposed to negate that because it is Fashionable on the left because it makes them feel good. I mean think about what are they really accomplished with this other than knowing? They have the power to get rational people to debase themselves publicly by going along with the lie And I know this might you know I was warning everybody about incrementalism before you say oh, but Buck. It's just on this issue really It's just on this issue as you see all those people walking around wearing masks outside It's only the people that you know, it's only on transgender issues that you have to live by lies I don't think so I think Joe Biden should get asked about this. Yep, and have to go on the record I mean there's a lot of people who cover the White House that that listen to this show Does Joe Biden who by the way played high level sports his whole life before obviously moving into politics There's no way that 78 year old Joe Biden believes that a Biological man should be beating the crap in the in swimming out of women I but I think he should get asked about it because you know what I think he'll lie and this ties in by the way also with Dave Chappelle Because Dave Chappelle's not allowed to make a joke at Netflix because somebody who's transgender might be offended When we come back dr. Fauci has gone off the rails again He wants to give you Christmas instructions for everybody out there But in the meantime the tunnel the towers foundation making the holidays brighter for our nation's gold star and fallen first responder families with young kids The foundation's giving away a home a day from Thanksgiving through New Year's Eve during its season of hope Imagine for just a moment being able to receive a mortgage free home after suffering the kind of heartache and mental agony That's so many of these families have experienced with each mortgage free home the foundations delivering on its promise to do good and never forget For some of these families they have the comfort of knowing they can stay in the home They picked with their loved one the home where they made precious holiday memories for families in a new home They're creating memories. They'll cherish forever. How can all of our listeners who've already donated over five million dollars to tunnel to towers help even more? You can support America's greatest heroes and their families today Donate $11 a month to tunnels of towers at t2t.org That's t the number two t.org Clay and fuck inspired by rush the next generation because it's just too important on the eib network One thing that vaccinated people can feel comfortable for example Let's take the holiday setting you're with your family you have grandparents and parents and children When you get vaccinated and you have a vaccinated group and you are in an indoor setting You can enjoy as we have traditionally over the years dinners and gatherings within the home with people who are vaccinated and that's the reason why People should if they invite people over their home Essentially ask and maybe require that people show evidence that they are vaccinated You know Clay Dr. Fauci here is basically telling you You can have a very merry christmas this year just just make sure that any of your loved ones Maintain a safe distance of approximately six to 50 feet of distance Make sure there is a rapid test maybe a pcr test in advance Of the rapid test to make sure that you are not around someone who is in a incubator Of a variant by I mean at at what point of course welcome back to clay and buckshare everybody at what point is this just Too silly for pia at what point are you like what who is listening to him? I know there are people that's a thing It's not that's my question But I want to know what do we have to do to get them to stop being so worried if you're so worried that you still listen Fauci aren't you vaccinated and if you're vaccinated you listen if ouchie Don't you know that your risk of hospitalization and death is very low even if you get covid So even if you're around somebody with covid if you're fully vaccinated You might still get covid. We know that that was a big booboo from uh fauci said that was an an oopsie You know oopsie moment But you're still protected against hospitalization death at a pretty good level you can get boosted. So why the freak out What percentage of people do you think are freaking out as christmas gets closer that that was my question as I listened to fauci's absurdities as he walked through all of that irrational nonsense What percentage of people do you think are legitimately? Checking vaccination status for people coming over to their house for christmas first of all the best thing about christmas is kids right No matter who you are young kids sanichlause You know under five years old under ten years old whatever the age is there where they have that magical wake up in the morning Run downstairs face just full of joy I don't care how old you are and if you think there is something better than for christmas than young kids and their excitement and their experience If you are I can't even imagine if you're a grandparent And you're not going to be around your five-year-old because the five-year-old is not vaccinated I can't even imagine how furious I would be as a parent Okay, I mean, but you don't have kids yet, but you got a nephew I mean I would I it's rare that I would get really upset with a grandparent But if I had a grandparent who was saying hey We can't be around you for christmas your five-year-old's not vaccinated That's a meant to me. That's a mental illness on the part of the grandparent. I just I mean, I think you've lost your mind You're you're your parents my parents vaccinated and booster. It's you're talking about vaccinating and boosted people You're gonna have to write that should do it. You're yeah, right? You put you're gonna segment out One person who's very you know, who's at very limited chance of actually spreading We've actually never gotten very good numbers on this. We've always just known children don't seem to spread this readily to adults Early on there was this concern that all the teachers would be getting sick from the kids That never seemed to pan out that data never came out in a way that suggested that was going on in fact Children and if you just think it through it's probably because it's so mild for them and they clear it so quickly that they have a low viral load Probably this is a theory. All right, not dr. Buck. There's a theory, but I've heard other people talk about this too Um, and even fauci says it doesn't seem you know, it does this fact that we don't know Entirely but maybe a little doesn't seem like they actually spread this readily to adults and people are you know The thing in my life right now plays people mask up in my elevator So that they can go sit in a restaurant with a hundred people around them indoors with no masks on Yeah, I'm looking like what are you doing? You only have to get sick once and then you've got covid So why are you living your life under this absurdity? But they probably think that you know transgender swimmers don't have an advantage either So this is where we are well and buck the other angle here is and you know I hope to be there one day and be a grandparent But when you get into your 70s, you don't know how many more Christmases you're gonna have So if you are sitting around not going to your family christmas because a five-year-old is not vaccinated or god forbid Because a three or a four-year-old is not vaccinated I question every single decision that you are making in your life because that foundational one is just so Incredibly awful if you're a lion on at and t verizon or t-mowal for your cell service today You're paying too much money You can save a bundle and get the exact same quality as cell phone service from pure talk instead All you have to do is take advantage of this phenomenal offer right now You can get an inexpensive monthly cell phone bill for just $30 a month unlimited talk tech six gigs of data Exact same towers exact same networks as one of the big three you get nationwide 5g service same phone Even the same phone number and if it's time for you to upgrade to a new phone in time for the holiday season You get a new iphone for just 479 dollars 479 dollars for an iphone 12 how do you sign up 30 day risk free get your phones in your hand right now With your phones dial pound 250 say pure talk you'll save an additional 50 percent off your first month plus save on a new phone pound 250 say pure talk you're listening to clay travis and bucks exes on the eiv network Welcome back in clay travis bucks exes and show appreciate all of you hanging out with us We opened up the show talking about a good article good work being done on the pen Pennsylvania you you pen trans swimmer by joe kenzie He is a writer at out kick the site that I run if you haven't checked out out kick.com and you're a sports fan And you think the world has gone insane. Hopefully we'll make it a little bit more sane for you there and joe does fantastic work Joe good job on this first story. I know there's a second story from a then additional Pen women swimmer that is going up tomorrow morning So I want to start with this question How did you come to get in contact with these girls? Why did they reach out to you and why do they want their story told throughout kick? Clay thanks for having me on listen we We've been writing this story about the uh lea thomas For about 10 to 14 days now and last week One source was tipped off that we had written a story and she was comfortable enough to uh To do a phone interview and really share her emotions about what is going on with this team and she felt comfortable You know with the out kick uh that we were going to tell her story fairly and we don't have an agenda here We're just telling the story about what's going on and uh Now we have another uh another swimmer on the pen Women's team that is stepped forward and that'll be coming soon Joe it's buck good to meet you and good work on the story want to know when you're talking to your source here Um to the degree you can tell us You know, what are they worried or in this case this this one woman in particular worried Will happen if they wouldn't come forward? I mean usually when athletes are upset about something Unfair has happened whether it's reps or anything else they're pretty vocal about it Obviously these uh women on this team who are upset don't want to be vocal What do they think happens if they were to speak out with their names attached to it Well, uh, well, thanks for uh having me on buck. Uh, listen last week These first swimmer was uh, she was just concerned about the general Uh climate in society where she was going to be attacked for having a different opinion And uh that has escalated uh last night. I was told that we now have a situation where the university Called a team mandatory team meeting last night where uh, the swimmers were Strongly advised against speaking to uh media outlets And they were also told that it is non-negotiable that lea thomas will be swimming for the women's team But we are here to support you however you want to come to terms with it is what the uh swimmers were told So we have now entered a different phase of this where the school is definitely taking a stance They're definitely telling these athletes not to speak out And uh and they're these two women are being brave in this moment where they they risk Uh, reprisal from the university How wild is this? You have covered sports For your I mean as long as I can remember I read you before you came over and started working with us at outkick Did you ever think we'd end up in a space where a biological man Was competing at an ivy league school one of the elite academic institutions in the country And potentially going to set all-time women swimming records As a man swimming as a woman. I mean this is It's through the looking glass level crazy, isn't it? Clay when I keep putting that towards you know the whole record thing to these women they're just blown away They're they're they're like us. They're completely perplexed on what this means for the the sport other than All the records are going to be smashed in the freestyle race Uh They're looking at the olympics. They're like, what does this mean for the olympics? So you have what's coming in march is these times are going to win national titles And as a country as a swimming nation They're they haven't even come to terms with this because these records are just being smashed over the last two weeks And they tell me the swimmers tell me that these times are going to be lowered clay And it's just absurd to think that they're now being strongly advised against speaking out Against something that is going to completely affect them completely affect the sport These times are going to be lowered clay to the point to where they may never be broken again unless by another transgender athlete It's interesting joe. It comes across in the piece uh that you wrote for out kick that The coach Seems to be on board and actually kind of excited about this is that where things are. I mean now It's very tough to tell I would think as an outsider Is the coach towing the line because of just the politics around this and seeming excited or is the coach happy that he I'm assuming it's a he. I don't know Uh, the the coach may actually now have the national champion swimmer On the team. You know what i'm saying? Like a is they do we have some sense from the the people have spoken out about this As to whether the coach is just on board for a top to bottom or feels pressured to be on board Well, I think there's two different things going on here bok I think that the the first source told us that the coach just likes to win And that he's looking at this like this is going to go on my record as a win And that's great for me. I'm a coach Uh, the second source said that this is now become a situation in her opinion That the coach is just going along with it so that he's not going to rock the boat He's not going to get attacked. He's going to say listen I just have to go along with what the university says And the university says this is what we're going to do. I just have to go along with it And so You have a combination of things going on here. You have the fear of what could happen if you spoke out Versus the love it when it's on my record. So two different things going on Joe, I want to read this quote because I read it to start the show and I think some people may have missed it because they weren't listening This uh, pen female swimmer who spoke to you that's on this team That is now being dominated by a biological man a transgender swimmer who swam for the men and now is swimming for the women She said when I have kids I kind of hope they're all boys Because if I have any girls that want to play sports in college Good luck their opponents are all going to be biological men saying they're women Right now we have one But what if we have but what if we had three on the team? There'd be three less girls competing That to me is the essence of this right all of these women have been getting up Bright and early in the morning their parents have been taking them their whole lives for them to be able to excel enough For them to be able to compete at an ibu league level And then out of nowhere A man decides to be a woman and he crushes all of them Making their work and their excellence and their pursuit of championships Totally not able to be accomplished no matter how hard they work This represents a straight on existential threat to women's sports doesn't it? Uh completely clay and if you listen to the experts, uh, the the people that have been fighting for title nine for their whole lives They They know that they have a they have a huge fight on their hands here For these women that they had fought four years ago and now all of a sudden book. We have this other threat coming And it's tor it's from a transgender perspective And uh, so these women that are on these teams again, no scholarships clay These are just these just women that get up and want to swim for their school And yet they have to deal with this where they're just getting crushed in the pool Uh I'm being told that in acrym there were tears. There were there was no cheering for a leah Uh, there was massive cheers for the for the woman that finished 38 seconds behind in the mile Uh, so, you know, there's There are some serious emotions going on here and uh, these women they they they they feel like they have nothing Nobody out there to support them. So This is uh, this is a fight they're in Joe second story is going to be up tomorrow. You've got another woman's story. It's at outkick.com Appreciate all the work that you're doing and uh, keep it up my man Thanks. Bye. Bye. Thanks. Thanks so much for being with us That's joe kenzi.

I have to tell you pretty oh so now we're going to compare States we're gonna we're gonna pretend that there aren't democrats in control of all the cities where this stuff is happening And make it a statewide issue to try to say that property crime in texas is worse The folks that are listening now in houston and dallas and austin and you know you you name it right all across the state and and rural areas at texas as well I was gonna I've I named all of our affiliates in texas clay. I'll be here. We'll be here for like five minutes, but the point is Um where we're seeing finally democrats unable to run from the reality? I really think the videos in particular make it because It's so brazen right it's one thing when you see Um when you see somebody break in the middle of the night into a store And there's kind of a frenzy that grab a couple things they run and you can tell they're really worried about getting caught when people are pulling up in cars And it's the middle of the day and it's the fancy is shopping district of chicago or it's a very well Traveled area very well, uh, you know high pedestrian part of uh california uh, los angeles San francisco wherever and they're taking Armfuls of stuff in broad daylight with security cameras and everything you really get the sense clay That they're not worried about how hard the democrat prosecutor the democrat police chief and the democrat mayor Is going to come down on them if they're caught and I think that's the part of it that has finally seeted in and is causing a problem There's no doubt look and we talked about this yesterday there are 12 cities in america all over the country from tuson, arizona Louisville, kentucky Philadelphia columbus, ohio Austin texas portland that are all setting all-time highs this year buck for murders And so This idea that gavin nousam is like oh look at somebody else they have a higher crime rate than we do here Is there crime rate growing as fast? Because I feel like it's not only violent crime It's quality of life crime that many of our listeners right now in california are nodding their heads about you got homeless Encampments taking over what should have been otherwise beautiful places vina's beach in the l.a Area I am told at least uh over the last several months is basically a homeless encampment now You got people who live in orange county that they walk outside to go down to the to the ocean And they're homeless people there now. I mean quality of life factors in in a big way and when you see massive Shapa lifting shenanigans going on with huge groups It's hard to believe that things are going in the right direction We got a bunch of people who want to weigh in by the way on the phones buck Uh, if you want to pop a couple of calls up here clair in wilmington delaware joe biden's i'm sure hey, what's up clair Uh lucky us. Yeah, um, I wanted to make a point about the swimmers You know, there's really a very easy solution to this if it weren't an agenda. We have special olympics So there's no reason there can't be a team Of i think it's more men that turn into girls than the other way around and let them swim against their own They can be transgender and then they're still swimming against men But i'll tell you where I believe the problem starts when this it's in the schools now And I don't know whose hand in this country is pushing this that everyone is terrified to acquiesce I pulled my kids out of public school in 2013 to homeschool and I could see other nonsense back then starting But here's the problem. They are glorifying this transgender lgbtq whole agenda And I think you would find most conservatives could care less what you are However, when you push it that they are special and above the rest of us. That's the problem Most kids in school. I would say 99 percent are heterosexual regular kids Why should they have to be up people have up people in the school for what bathrooms this less than 1 Ones to choose. This is foolish and parents need to take back this country I always pull up my kids. You want to see how much the the people that say they're the party of science believe in science Ask them how many sexes they're on well, you know, but Claire excellent Call from somebody there for a while. Thank you so much. And I would just say in response to what Claire is raising What you really get down to here? Is that it is the the agenda of the left and so everyone's very clear on this Is not that there are accommodations made For transgender individuals in sports or in any area where the sexes are separated The agenda of the left Just to be very clear is that this is now a woman She is 100 entirely lea thomas or tomsen What is their name? Whatever the swimmer. Yes is a woman not a transgender woman not a transgender no no a female like any other Female that is the actual agenda of the left and so even to say things like lea cannot get pregnant guys Is viewed as? sacrilege Yeah, and look the answer is on some level Unisex competitions in sports. That's where this is moving towards Uh, the idea of having transgender people compete against other transgender people is an interesting idea I don't know exactly how that would work Uh, but it's also messy unisex seems to me to be the answer The problem is it destroys women's sports Women's sports effectively do not exist as long as you go to unisex and by the way We've got another caller who was going to raise an issue, but we got a uh, we're about to go to uh, to break here But robin louvel said all the women need to quit the team together The girls were asked about that and they talked about it with joe kenzie They love swimming they don't want to quit doing something they love in protest They've spent their whole lives swimming competitively since they were what five or six years old in some cases I mean very swimming you can start very very young. They don't want to throw that and by the way clay They shouldn't have to write this yes the other side is where the madness is coming from the agenda the left That's why we shouldn't bend the knee and an abandoned Conservative sometimes just want to take their ball and go home so to speak And you know go off the grid and forget all about it Can't see the battlefield do the other side without consequences friends. That's why we're here every day on this battlefield We got more for you coming up including on what happened with that christmas tree that was burned outside of fox news What happened that guy? You're listening to clay travis and bucks exed on the eiv network"
