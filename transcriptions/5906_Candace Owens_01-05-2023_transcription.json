    "text": " Happy Monday everybody. I hope you had a very nice weekend. So guess what? I think I have discovered something that I fundamentally and Patently disagree with some of my conservative friends on one topic and it seems to be pornography it keeps coming up And I think that this topic is so important that we should discuss it So I'll ask you the question of today Which is how much pornography is too much pornography to watch? I want you guys to be super open in the comments give me your honest takes of what you make of this conversation That I'm about to present to you guys right now And I'm gonna give you my honest take as well plus later on we're gonna be talking about an indie and a bar bar out in Indiana And is pleading for its customers to return Aperitongum that they were not welcome for speaking out against Dylan Mulvaney and the Bud Light partnership Yeah, I didn't end well. I like these guys man beer drinkers their hardcore all that and war today coming up on Candace Owens All right, so I don't remember which episode it was it was early on you can probably go back to the earlier episodes of this podcast We started talking about pornography and how I view it to be a cancer But the reason why we were talking about this as a topic was because the Daily Wire hosts sat down for an episode of backstage And this was behind the paywall and for the first time I realized that we had a very real disagreement on one category I'm kind of going to paraphrase for you what went on but essentially I would say me and Matt Walsh and Michael Knowles Which is probably the three Christians that were sitting back say's we're saying that we thought that it was bad for a person That is married to be consuming pornography and Matt Walsh had some very sound points on that I'm not going to say that Ben Shapiro was defending pornography because that would be I think a gross mischaracteration But he was pretty much saying that there are varying degrees of sin and that watching pornography is not the same as adultery So essentially he was I guess I think it would be fair to say trying to separate the idea of watching porn and the idea of Adultery from the actual act itself and I walked through from that just thinking I so disagree with Ben Shapiro on this It's unbelievable and then I discovered that he's actually holding position that other conservatives hold as well I've been very vocal about the fact that I'm great friend Dennis Prager. I've worked for Dennis Prager at Prager University I think he's a wonderful man and he has has so much wisdom that has helped me in my career But let me tell you something I Washed a sit-down that he had with Matt Fred He Matt Fred has a podcast called pint with Aquinas Matt Fred is similar to Matt Walsh also a committed Catholic and a Christian And it was really interesting to hear them have a discussion on pornography Because it just made me realize that I so Disagree with Dennis Prager on this one subject. So before I Wrongly mischaracterize his words. I want you to hear what Dennis Prager had to say This is really just the introduction to their very long discussion on pornography take a listen. I Mentioned that there that there is a Jewish Christian difference With regard to Jesus's statement that a man who lost after another woman has committed adultery with his heart That a that phrase does not appear obviously in the Hebrew Bible, but be That the general Jewish view and I say general because I can't speak for for all Jews Even though I try to be normative Is that you can only commit adultery? With and I said this in the video and I and I Purposely said I'm not trying at all to be cute right in any way You can only commit adultery with one organ and it is not the heart Judaism is very Behavior based Christianity is More not it's not that it's not behavior based but it is equally if not more thought inner self heart based So for example, there's a phrase in Hebrew that I learned very early in my Yeshiva education I'll say it in Hebrew for so that people will know I didn't make it up Oh, I'm a Shavaha Iqara Allah. I say it is not the thought that counts that no not that counts That is the essence, but the deed right Judaism is very behaviorist and I am very behaviorist so for example and I mentioned this to the to at Franciscan I've said on the radio very often. I don't care if you like Jews. I don't care if you dislike Jews I prefer you like Jews, but there are a lot of Jews. I don't like I mean It's this little silly to say I like a whole group I don't there's no whole group. I like there's no whole group by dislike, but in any event I don't care if you dislike Jews. I care how you treat Jews and And that that is It goes to the to the essence of what my belief is I want to know how you act The the left does this all the time. Oh, you treat gays beautifully Like in my case I am I am my wife and I are God parents to a gay couple's children But the fact that I'm against same-sex marriage that makes me a hater So how I treat gay gays is irrelevant. It's it's what I think This bothers me that your thoughts can be regarded as a demerit Okay, so a lot going on there and at a later time I would love us down and have a discussion with Dennis about how he gets to being a God parent to a gay couple's child gay couples child and yet doesn't agree with gay marriage because I don't see how you can reconcile That but the more important thing here is that what he is separating here is thoughts from behaviors And I think that is exactly what Ben Shapiro was doing on backstage We were sitting down and it's not wrong to say that thoughts are different from behaviors Obviously, these are two entire different words and different concepts for a reason But I do not believe with the believe the idea that you should be comfortable And I'm not sure if he's trying to suggest you should be comfortable But he is saying he doesn't care if somebody has Poisonous thoughts because all that matters is how they actually behave and what I would say is I would very much care Just to give an example here if I knew that somebody I was working with every single day had fantasies deep fantasies about Raping me right if they went home every single day and they fantasize about raping me if they were creating for it as an example AI Pornography with my head on it because they wanted to picture raping me that would make me deeply uncomfortable I wouldn't want to be around this child and I'm gonna talk about that about around this person I'm gonna talk about that more at length Because I think it really gets to the heart of what I believe to be the conservative movement I think thoughts do very much matter, but it's important for me to say I do not believe we should criminalize thoughts I would not go so far as to say that a person that has repeated thoughts about raping someone should be put into prison because they have not yet Acted on those thoughts, but the thoughts do matter very much so But let's actually go back and jump into this clip of him on the on Jordan Peterson's Exodus series which is also on daily wire plus and Hear how he further justifies this idea take a listen Looking with lust is not a sin in Judaism. What's the stance on pornography? So pornography When I'm asked this question just to put you on the spot you did indeed Okay, so my my answer when it's raised on my radio show. I have a male female hour and I'm very open about sexual subjects I Always ask if a wife calls me and says my husband looks at pornography. I found on his computer I have one question How is your life of intimacy with your husband? Is it good? In other words is the pornography in lieu of you or in addition to you And I know this is not a religious answer I'm not even giving a religious answer. I'm giving what I think is a moral and realistic answer men want variety and If adultery is a substitute for if pornography is a substitute for one's wife It's awful if it's a substitute for adultery. It's not awful Okay, I very much again disagree with what he is saying here the idea that it's a if it's Preventing you from doing the bad act here being adultery then it's understandable as long as he's faithful to you Even if he's watching pornography and that helps prevent him from doing something worse than that's a good thing So that's like saying, you know if I have to shoot a heroin every day So that I don't beat my wife well beating my wife I think we would agree would be a worse thing than harming yourself and taking a drug So it's okay. It's it or it's somehow justifiable and I just disagree with that I just so fundamentally believe that that's a really wrong way of thinking now I'm not again saying that we should be criminalizing thoughts But I don't think that it should be a substitute Which is the way that he's kind of thinking of it in this way what she's saying is that this is better than adultery This is a substitute for adultery pornography. It's a good thing that we have this now. Where were his ideas seated? I'm not going to show you this clip, but he does talk further on that pine to the quinest podcast About how when he was growing up his father and his mother were in a very loving relationship They stayed together throughout their entire lives and the one thing that his wife allowed him to have was his Playboy magazine and Dennis Prager also says this is when I view porn I'm thinking about when I'm talking about porn I'm thinking about Playboy magazines I know now there's so many I guess more severe versions of pornography There are rape fantasies people are watching videos and it has gotten very demonic That is just the truth But he's saying this was like a harmless magazine that he used to flip through and my mother was okay with this Because he was a good husband. He was a faithful husband and what I would argue is that This was an earlier sin talking about varying degrees of sin that has led to this more dramatic sin that we're seeing today It's because there were men that couldn't resist the urge to look through Playboy magazine So that was basically all they had that was available to them But these would if these men were alive today, perhaps if his father was alive today He would be looking at video porn right Videographic porn because that's what's available and it's become more and more extreme because technology has advanced But what's happening at its core is that you have to resist the urge the first urge that you have when you are in a committed relationship To look at somebody else and to look at a naked body and I go back to the example that Matt Walsh Set on that backstage where he's on that backstage episode where he said How would you feel if your wife if it's just the behavior that counts if your wife just went to a hotel room and Watched to other people having sex and she sat in the corner and she maybe got aroused from this But she didn't participate But she didn't participate so she didn't actually do anything That's bad because she's just watching other people and getting off from it And of course nobody would feel good about that you would say of course that's adultery That's not okay for your wife to do that or for your husband to go to a hotel and watch others But to say well as long as you didn't participate and you watched it It's it's the exact same thing when you are watching porn and then I think if I'm recalling correctly somebody on backstage said well Well, if somebody is only watching porn, let's say five times per year What's wrong with that? And I think Matt Walsh said back to that well if you can if you have the self-control to only watch it five times per year Then I promise you that you probably have the self-control to watch it zero times per year And I want to say that I'm not saying this to Suggests to men that if you watch porn which I know has become such a severe addiction for them Which is why it's so important for other man is to end up and say this is wrong and we can be better at this I'm not suggesting and if you have watched porn if you do watch for a time of time that you're an awful irredeemable human being I'm saying that you can you can be better than that. That's what I'm actually saying I'm saying that you are better than giving into that thing than to giving into that lust and also participating In what is such a dark market? Which is something that has not yet been discussed I've even heard it from Dennis Prager and we weren't able to flesh that out on backstage due to time constraints But when I learned of how many how many Americans are Supporting the human trafficking ring that the reason why children are being abducted after a hurricane in Haiti and a bunch of children Go missing is to feed our porn addiction the amount of women that are found online on Pornhub that have gone missing and they had be turned and returned into sex slaves is to feed this quote unquote harmless addiction and It's something that I believe as a society that we need to be better at and it doesn't make it renders men weaker by the way I'd men go in and lock themselves in a room and perhaps women as well and watch pornography because they were shamed Right if there's a reason why they're not doing it out in the open There's a reason why when we see these demonic acts in Hollywood where essentially is transformed into pornography I mean when we talk about the Sam Smith video where he's twerking or when we talk about videos where they're dressed up like Satan and They're wearing virtually no clothing. It's because it they know it's demonic right? They know that they are removing shame They know that shame is it is actually a good thing to feel because it inspires you to try to be better the next day But you don't want to have that horrible feeling so there's a lot that I disagree with with what he's saying here But I want to get to this next portion of the conversation back to pints of the queerness where he just is discussing Fighting urges altogether and why it is commendable commendable when somebody who has a bad thought Doesn't actually do a bad thing take a listen You have drawn a behavioral Inference from a thought and I don't yeah But see I still am not convinced that this sharp distinction or the distinction You're cuz I've heard Ben Shapiro say something similar and I don't know if this is as you say more a behaviorist Because I think he said something like I don't really care if you have racist thoughts. I care about how you act That's right. I said that to the group tonight. I don't care if people dislike Jews I care how they treat us but if my son or I know you're right I would tell the same to my child if my child said I don't like this group But I think this is what our Lord Jesus Christ is doing in which he's saying your righteousness has to has to pass out of the Pharisees It's not enough that you Don't murder you should not want to it's not enough that you don't commit adultery you should not say But yes fuel the flame I happen to think it's a good thing not to want to murder. I I subscribe to that But There's a very interesting Hebrew phrase Translating from the Hebrew so there'll be a bit awkward in the place that a penitent stands the most righteous person doesn't stand and I extrapolate from that That if you have bad thoughts and don't act on them You're on a higher moral plane than the guy who never has a bad thought I don't get any credit for not molesting children I am as interested in children sexually as I am in bananas or or peach trees Okay, so I get no credit for not molesting a child But the sick dude who does want to and doesn't he gets a lot of credit? I Disagree that somebody who wants to molest a child but doesn't do it exists on a higher moral plane than me I I don't even understand how anybody could think that if that is a Hebrew phrase I very much disagree with it. I Think that I do understand what Dennis is trying to say there in terms of When people make tremendous sacrifices like let's say you are somebody who suffers from alcoholism, right? And it is obviously at a certain point where it becomes Psychological it becomes physiological, but when you meet somebody and they say I've been five years sober It's exciting. You're very happy for them You're happy that they got clean because you know how difficult that is If you meet somebody and they say that they're three days sober It's something that you celebrate and you're happy for and you understand that it is harder for them not to do it because they have they have this dependency Because they have this addiction But I would not put them on a higher moral plane than somebody who doesn't have that addiction It's somebody that didn't give in perhaps to somebody who's never drank in their entire lives, right to somebody who's who was practiced Temperance their entire lives. How do they how are they able to be on a higher plane of morality? Then an individual who has given into those addictions and is trying to now Scale back and say that I want to be done with it This last point I think that he makes regarding thoughts versus behaviors is one that I think is almost Fodder for the left. I guess is the correct way to say this and I'm going to tell you why after you hear it take a listen Speaking of pedophilia Suppose a man says I view animated Child porn so there's no real victim in that sense a child pornography Which we both agree is horrendous and by viewing animated child porn it prevents me from acting out sexually on a child now I I deny that I think that pornography In flames us to then want to act those fantasies out and I think there's good studies that back that up But surely you wouldn't say to the man who views animated child pornography That's not bad so long as you don't act it out. Wouldn't you want to help this poor sick? Yes, I would but I'm thrilled that he's not acting it out. I mean agreed. Okay, well that's big Yeah, we're both thrilled that he might have a poor Substitute but it is a substitute if that were the case no child is being used. It's all animated Yeah, and and he would you would you use the word evil of animated child pornography? No, I can't I would use evil only with behavior That is shocking to me and I think it's really wrong and I cannot express enough how very wrong I believe it is I do not believe that the that these thoughts or that watching child pornography via AI is a Substitution for evil it is not a substitution is a precursor and that is why thoughts are actually so important And why I say that it is dangerous for us to suggest that thoughts are just thoughts and they're somehow separate from Behaviors and not precursors is because then it destroys everything that we fight for what why are we fighting the left on their ideas in the school system? Why are we fighting them if it's just an idea that kids can pick their gender Do we say it's totally fine then in the classroom where teachers are telling children this and seating these ideas? And it only becomes problematic should we only be fighting the doctors that are prescribing these minors drugs to block their puberty? No, because we understand that it is the ideas that are being seated that lead to These individuals believing that they can pick their gender are going to these doctors who are confirming this and giving them these harmful drugs Why are we on college campus fighting these Marxist principles that these children are being thought are being taught? If it's just an idea if Marxism is just an idea, why do we call it a dangerous ideology? Why are we fighting any dangerous ideologies at all? Right if ideas are not the problem, we need to just wait Why don't we all go home do absolutely nothing until America actually transforms into a communist society? Well because we understand obviously that thoughts do in fact become things It's actually what I commit myself to every single day is by telling people You can be better than you were yesterday and one of the greatest pieces of advice that I give people Is that you are your number one enemy your ideas are your number one enemy when people write to me and they ask How do you get up at 4 30 a.m every single morning and go to the gym? It's because I beat back that person in my head the idea the person that says oh, you're so sleepy Oh, you just want one more hour because the ideas matter those thoughts matter of course Of course if you give in to them and you say if they're just thoughts know the thoughts are the starting place And if you do not understand the significance of thoughts and how important it is to conquer yes evil thoughts It is an act of evil to create a child porn It is an act of evil to watch a child porn It is not a substitute for evil in any capacity And while you might not believe that the idea of wanting to watch child pornography is a crime You better believe that it very much leads to crime. It leads to criminal activity again These are not substitutes. These are precursors a fundamental difference between me and others in the conservative movements I believe that thoughts become things They believe that behaviors and thoughts are separated and I am dying to know what you guys in the comments believe again I don't want you to feel any horrific Feelings about yourself if you're watching this and you know that you are trying to stop watching pornography I think it's our job to talk about what it can't turn to come upon society I know that there are so many men that are struggling with this How it how it's impacted their relationships how it's impacted their lives And I think it's in large part because we have learned to culturally accept it because the idea of a magazine has transformed into Videos that people can watch and it has transformed into men that are actually losing their manhood and losing their masculinity by taking Part in these really shameful acts another thing that I want to add here because it was super interesting when we were having a Discussion with my when I was having a discussion with my team or somebody brought up video games They said okay, but you can separate thoughts from behaviors because Do you believe candace that every single person that plays a video game that has guns is going to wind up shooting a school? Do you believe that these people then become violent and the answer that is no and I had to think about why I don't believe that Well, the reason is because I don't believe that people are picturing themselves When they are playing video games, which is different with pornography you are you become aroused by the scene you imagine By the scene you imagine that it is you that is in that scene that is acting that part out that is being played by by a pornographic actress Right in video games when I played mario car. I wasn't like I have a lot of road rage. I'm imagining that it's actually me That's actually throwing this. I'm so angry today that would happen on the road. I'm gonna go home and I'm gonna play mario car No, this was actually me just engaging and playing a game not me picturing me being that actual individual So that would be my response to it is that pornography is very different because it is Seating a fantasy and you are envisioning yourself within that fantasy And if there is anybody that by the way is engaging with video games in that way If you are going home and play mario car because you picture killing people on the road Then you should not be playing video games Because that thought may very well become a thing.

All right now. It's time for some topics to sure Well, I'm absolutely loving this story the Fairfax bar and grill I just I think I love people who drink beer I think i'm there now after the Bud Light controversy with dilemma veini and the stance that that beer drink curse Around the world so they were just not having it and I will tell you who is learning that Fairfax bar and grill operators decided to stand up for dylan movini Which is super weird when this entire conflict broke out they decided that they didn't want any customers Who didn't see that they needed to be more accepting towards dilemma veini and they actually Posted this on their facebook page to their customers They said we are well aware of the controversy surrounding Bud Light We support all people in this establishment no matter who you are or how you identify We will continue to sell anisor bush products because we don't care who they make special cans for If you are intolerant of other humans of any kind we ask that you keep your opinions to yourself Should you feel the need to discuss this matter in public? You will be asked to leave We will not tolerate intolerance here. I don't know what woke intern got hold of their facebook page got all the buzzwords Tolerant tolerate intolerance humans blah blah blah blah sad sad and Obviously i'm going to assume that the typical patron that's sitting at the bar having some beers Isn't exactly thrilled about the limo veini i'm guessing it's not it's not dylan movini I'm guessing there's not tons of trans people i'm coming to this bar Because well first and foremost the trend despite the the noise of the transgender movement They're they represent a very teeny tiny portion of our population They just somehow have been handed a megaphone and so this Bar owner found out people stopped going to the bar. They said all right you're going to hate on your actual patrons Because you want to support this fraudulent ideology. All right, we're we're done with you And so now the indiana bar has realized that no one's coming in they don't want to eat their food They don't want to drink their beer and they are pleading with customers to return after telling them that they essentially We're not welcome if they held any different opinions Here's what they now posted on april 27th on that same facebook page The barefoot bare facts bar and grill wrote a lot has been said some correct and some incorrect and I want to clarify my stance What I really want to convey is this just be respectful different opinions are welcome here as long as they are delivered respectfully We know more want ugly aggressive or rude interactions about which sports team someone thinks is better than about societal issues We do not and will not censor opinions, but we do require stability and this establishment So if you can't play nice gather the sandbox that goes for everyone Let's remember why we even gather at a bar to enjoy each other's company and raise a glass to a civility Yeah, guess what the people that used to frequent this bar still we're not buying it They jumped into the comments immediately One commenter wrote all I want for christmas is to see this place shut down Other commenters wrote go woke go broke and then guess what happened? They decided to shut down commenting because it's been pretty amazing embarrassing And unfortunately this is what I constantly say Well, if you are a business owner and you are focused on the scam of diversity equity inclusion You are not actually focused on a return making sure that you produce a return for your investments If you don't know your customer actually if you don't know What sort of individual it is that sits around and has a beer every day at the bar and you instead think it's a dilemma Vaney that's floating in a bathtub saying that they don't know what march madness is then you deserve to fail That's the truth you deserve to understand what learn what the free markets actually are So I am not feeling bad for fair fix bar and grill And I just want to say more power to the people in that same vein bud light is now also being accused of cowardice for turning off their youtube comments After they put out a new countryfied commercial They were being slammed for pandering to customers that they lost during the dilemma vaney fiasco I can show you a little bit of the commercial debuted During the thursday nfl draft and it was later published on youtube It shows for friends opening cans of bud light at a country music festival as the song chicken fried Which is one of my favorite country songs by zach brown band please and you know This would have been great if it was done before vadilla movaney controversy All right, so let me show you a little bit of that new commercial You Just see a girl she does very much look like she's at a country music concert She's the former pals. I'd like to know that they are all white and that's not even allowed nowadays So they're really saying like, you know, oh, maybe this one kids mix. They're really saying You know, we're we're no longer doing the woke thing There's not the standard dei initiative of every person must be blocking a commercial I mean it feels like tennessee. I look at this and I love it And then it says bud light easy to drink easy to enjoy And people are understandably thinking, okay, you're only doing this because you're Feeling that you've lost your entire customer base and you're suffering economically But I think that there was some some of this that is legitimate I think we did win we just flat out one and there the proof is there They are showing you that they are going back to their customer base And so I'm I actually hold the belief that the ceo who I learned did serve this country Actually knew nothing about the can that was going out. I do believe that they there was some ram department the marketing department That became cancerous. I believe this is why they fired these individuals I believe that if the ceo ceo knew about the dilemma of any can he probably would have well candid He would have said let's not do that. But like any corporation once you grow To a certain size you're not able to as a ceo keep your eyes and ears in every single room So i'm not as angry about this commercial I think like I said last week that sometimes conservatives should count their wins And I believe that this is a major win. So i'm not going to throw any more hate to bud light Uh because what's the point we've already won now? We're just gloating guys All right guys now we're gonna get into some of your comments unbelievably that was such a long monologue that we're already at the end Of the show which seems crazy a few of your comments pertaining to dillym obani which I counted as another win last week Because he's now referring to himself as a human and as a 26 year old adults language that he has never used before As he's documented his days of girlhood, which was super for perverse tanya baker says dylan says he's being dehumanized But he's actually dehumanizing women with his antics. That's correct when he did this new video breaking a silence He said that no one should be dehumanizing him and it is correct women are the ones that are being dehumanized He fails to see that but if we keep pushing perhaps he will because as I said in this video He did not call himself a little girl and I I do credit However, men with that men standing up to bud light and dillym obani having to face that fierce backlash Grandma marth writes. I recognize his humanity more than he does himself His humanity is in the biological form of a man Yeah, I do find it to be really rich the irony is incredibly rich when people tell us that we need to become More accepting of transgendered individuals and they can't even accept themselves Like why am I required to do what you won't? I do accept you for who you are you are a biological male dylan mobani You haven't accepted yourself. So maybe we should start saying that to them like they need to be more accepting It's just I can't I can't stand it the bigotry the hatred towards yourself I will not deal with it. So i'm going to continue to call you a male Another comment from the roller stone. He writes. It's the first time we can see in here dylan Maybe being real and genuine and I think dylan is right when he says he has been dehumanized There's been extreme words and reactions with plenty of unreasonable Hey, I think he's been taking a lot of hate for the rest of the problematic people and behavior in the transgender community I truly hope this will be the first step in a society where we can have conversation instead of being called Hateful for sharing genuine concerns. Yeah, I actually disagree with you somewhat here Because yeah, there have been extreme words and extreme reactions because dillym obani's behavior was extreme He was pretending to be a little girl. He was dressing up like a little girl and he was being handed awards Being told this was good and that it wasn't perverse and we it required an extreme reaction when you see something like that When you see something that could be setting the palette for pedophilia, we must be extreme In response and saying forcefully we will not accept this as a society So I am proud because it's rare for conservatives do that oftentimes We tend to be too polite and I think that it is because it might be our nature to be polite And the left is the exact opposite Well, this is a circumstance in which we learned from the left and we said you know what forget being In polite society. This is so wrong. It was just so backwards that we cannot accept it And now we are seeing the consequence of that which is that dylan is dialing back on his language All right, you guys unfortunately that it's all the time that we have for today I have lots of exclusive content that is coming up on the daily wire plus so you should go ahead Click link in the description and subscribe right now And be sure to come back tomorrow because it's going to be a brand new episode You"
