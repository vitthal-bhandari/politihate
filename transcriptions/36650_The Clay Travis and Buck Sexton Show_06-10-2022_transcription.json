    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in our number two Thursday edition clay Travis bucksxton show alright I'm fired up Ooh, I'm fired up. Oh Okay, I I am really fired up here because I feel like I Did love the matrix to you know when neo had everything slow down Around him and he could see things moving finally inside the major one of the most amazing sequences in its time of Early CGI where all the bullets are coming at him and he sort of does this back bend The matriarch part one is one of the ten and maybe even five best action movies of all time I agree with you. I saw that while I was in college. This was back in the day when they used to close down I was in kindergarten. So Yeah This is when the days and they used to close down the DC subway and Washington didn't have a lot of great Public transportation or even very good theaters So we used to have to go all the way to Union Station and then we were poor college kids relatively speaking So we would often walk if you're familiar with Washington DC all the way from Union Station back to George Washington University Which is basically across the entirety of DC. Oh of Northwest DC. Yes. I mean, it's miles It's a it's a long walk. I'm actually I've actually done that's a lovely one. I've done that walk many of us Yes, it is it is a long walk and then again This was because the subway would close down at midnight So we would go sometimes though as college kids do late night movies and then when we got out the subway would be shut down my analogy here is Everything has slowed down if you start to look at all the gambling markets and sort of think of yourself as The maestro who is designing the democrat attempt to maintain control of the Senate the house is gone Okay, uh and and and I understand that they're trying to turn it into a well Maybe that if you look at where the money is and I'm talking about gambling markets Gamblers are looking at it and they're like the over under right now for Republican pickup is 19 and a half So republicans I believe need five and if you were out there gambling right now the over under is around 20 We want to exceed that. I think we likely will but it's important to understand what's going on Ron johnson is now Trout you can be with us next Wednesday our friend uh ron johnson senator from wisconsin He's been on the show a ton is now trousing his democratic challenger crime is the number one issue buck in wisconsin and uh johnson's opponent has been a Defund the police guy. He's been a left wing wound And wisconsin's aren't standing for it and ron johnson as we sit here 33 days out Is pounding him and all of the money is pouring in in him on him in wisconsin He's gonna win melon's crime rate by the way is just awful And and has been getting getting worse in uh in recent years So that's another another time you think about a place Where democrats have been calling the shots Uh Things are just getting worse, especially on the crime issue And find find me a state with democrats or a city with democrats in charge in this country And i'll show you a place where the crime rate has gone up a lot in the last few years adam black salt in nivada did i say it right Nevada Navet i i don't know why i can't get it right. He's gonna win Nevada just to our nivadans out there clay loves you and your state big navet of fen He's just i've spent a lot of money in los vegas over the years There's there's a lot of you out there I i'm a one man stimulus package when it comes to money that i've spent in los vegas So uh, so yes, I i have put uh Unlike joe biden uh i've put money in a capitalistic system in your pocket without destroying the economy Uh in los vegas and the larger state black salt's gonna win Lacksalt is gonna win and that is a flip So if nothing else changed they wanted to try to take out ron johnson. They're gonna fail nothing else changed right now Lacksalt is the underdog who is leading now Federman they're they're they're making their case for federman. I think buck secretly They're aware that they're gonna lose pincellania democrats are trying to you know Put a good face on it, but I think they see the momentum from ayes I think they know that federman is a disaster of a candidate and they are seeing his what's formidable lead Completely evaporate the reason why all of this and this is matric style putting it all together It's not gonna happen in ohio for democrats. We're gonna talk with ted bud here. I believe in a little bit next hour Yes, sir. No carolina be the next senator from north carolina. He's gonna win Not gonna happen for democrats there. There's still other places Arizona new hampshire where republicans can pick up and we hope they do But the result of all this map that I just laid out for you in the senate is georgia is The democrat firewall And if you're wondering why her show walker is suddenly getting pummeled in every direction By every different story imaginable It's because he in the democrat mind Is the only way they can maintain that seat is by destroying him and they have spent Over 50 million dollars in georgia try into eviscerate him So let's just be clear for everybody out there about what's really happening in terms of the money here Same thing with stacey abrams for all of our georgians listening to us right now We love georgia for all of our georgians listening the richest people in new york city los angeles san francisco Some areas of you know kannetica and etc But the richest people who are democrats in those places Want to pick your georgia governor and the next senator from the state of georgia for you That is where all that money is coming from these are candidates who are backed by coastal live elites Who don't give a what about the state of georgia? Probably don't spend ever any time in the state of georgia But they feel better About their own politics and the future of the country under the collectivist lunes if they can help by For stacey abrams and for rafael warknock wintz That is why all of a sudden Herschel walker is under siege It's not a coincidence that the new york times and the daily beast are going to war with her schle walker They are default campaign contributors to the democrat ideology and georgians You guys i believe are going to decide Who controls the senate in 2022 You guys are going to do it now. It's basically you do over Because you had the same decision in january of 2021 and warknock and asif both got in in the first place and frankly That's cost the country trillions of dollars and that was that we never needed to spend that was we should all be honest about it That was a gop own goal Because i remember clay after the election before you and i teamed up speaking on my show at the time telling everybody look As long as we pull off one senate seat in georgia Nothing really biden's not going to be able to get away with doing too much damage in the first two years We lost them both and we lost them because there was a lot more focus on uh The election that had already happened i'm not saying that there shouldn't have been some obviously There are a lot of questions. There was a lot of lawsuits a lot of things going on But we needed to focus in that time and place on getting it done in georgia I think this time around with the clarity of who's really at you know Who's really at issue here in georgia? I think it's going to be very difficult for democrats to convince the convinceable That in any way the last two years has shown us Anything other than the fact that the democrats are in charge of life is worse That's just everything is more expensive You're less safe you get more lectures about white supremacy and how you know We need to be teaching kids in school about lgbtq and trans transitions when they're in kindergarten i mean all the things That we have seen this by an a green new deal green energy stuff What what have they done that has made the lives of anyone who lives in the state of georgia better? I mean you really can ask that question. I got nothing for them Joe biden has a 40 percent approval rate in the state of georgia right now Raphael war knock will not appear with him in the state of georgia for that reason But rafiel war knock is a rubber stamp for joe biden's agenda So listen to me carefully georgia 60 percent of you Believe that joe biden is doing an awful job Why in the world would you give joe biden georgia's approval to make even more awful decisions a vote for rafiel war knock Is a vote for joe biden to continue to be the worst president in any of our lives A vote for her shall walker is a firewall on the republican side against joe biden's awfulness I just don't see that as a very difficult decision And that's where you have to cut through all the noise And everybody's going to come after her show and we've had him a lot on this show And they're going to pick him apart and they're going to say he did this he did that All you have to decide is this this senate seat in georgia is a referendum on joe biden 60 percent of georgians believe joe biden is doing a bad job 60 percent of georgians a georgians should be voting for her shall walker to keep him from doing a worse job How does the senate matter? I don't want to how does the senate matter to people Do do they go along? I mean obviously they can declare war which we basically don't do anymore I mean there are some things the senate does the senate can confirm nominees Obviously puts for puts through a supreme court justice those are important things But ultimately it's from a legislative perspective. Are they for or against the agenda of the white house That's how that's how the senate really matters Are they trying to spend tons of money on crazy things or they actually taking a rational approach to what's best for the country and fiscally responsible So there's no separating The senate race in georgia from the biden white house because that's those two things together Are the political that's the race that is the race that's the race and so you have a big national decision to make georgians And look i'm a big elan number a fan. I spent a lot of time down in georgia Don't let me down More importantly don't let everybody else out there who you're talking to that's like well Did you know in 1989 her shall walker did or did you know in 2004? It doesn't none of that This is a binary choice. Are you with the joe biden or are you against him? If you are with him you should go vote for reverend raffia warnock Because he's gonna rubber stamp everything that joe biden wants If you are with if you are against joe biden then you are riding with her shall and you better be out aggressively supporting him That's where we are. That's the stakes that those are the stakes that is the situation I think drick style breaking it down for you. I do think this is going to be uh, this is going to be a A one or two one or two seats close difference. It's not Unfortunately, we're not going to have you know 55 republican seats no matter what at the end of this. We might have 51 Maybe 52 probably only 51 I'm telling they get the tie break. So they what all they got to do is stay at 50 50 because kamal You know it's going to tackle her way behind whatever joe biden wants to do So if you want biden and kamala If you want them to control everything in the united states senate continue to spend trillions of dollars continue to run this country In the worst possible way they can then you need to be out there voting for reverend raffia warnock He is joe biden kamala harris warnock their team If you don't You need to be knocking on doors. You need to be out there getting everybody in your church Everybody in your friend group You need to have them going out and supporting her show because that's why this is the real story here that nobody's that's why they're coming after him You think they suddenly just in october found out about some allegation a hershal walker 15 years ago You think they suddenly went down to it's a rightsville georgia and decided that hershal wasn't black enough to represent georgia No, no, no, this is october and they're and they were planning a surprise They have been ready for this since june and july and may know this is their firewall and they're nervous Do you have hershals back or not georgians? That's the question Are you joe biden's boy or not if you are go vote for reverend raffia warnock you love joe biden If you don't you better be putting putch in that ticket for hershal walker as aggressively as you can Not often we suggest you buy a book for your kids a history book no less But it's one you want to have in your house to share with your kids make in time to share our nation's history with your kids Not an everyday routine, but if you think history lessons in school or all they need Unfortunately, you're really wrong Depending on the school. There's an activist teacher out there Involved in making sure that your kid hears That america has an awful despicable Indefensible history that's not true. That's not true at all overarching story of this country is one of triumph That's not what our kids are being taught these days. That's why the total twin history books exist You know the buck and I are both history nerds. I like to be sharing with my kids history all the time That's why I shared this book with them in an engaging way kids will love it They'll come away with a solid understanding of what actually happened in this country how it relates to them today and Why they should be so proud to be americans? That's why you need to go to total radio dot com get your own copy of the total twins american history book Plus free bonuses that are available there too as well Go to total radio dot com Again, if you love american history and you want your kids to as well more importantly You want them to hear the truth you need to go to total radio dot com One thing you can count on with the left is that they will never leave Their targets alone the harassment the demands to bend the knee will never stop Because they are neurotic And they are power hungry and they're vicious. That's just the the id that is the psychology Of the left in america today brings me to this Once again situation in clay, you know about jack phillips right of uh The baking of the bakery in colorado Oh, yeah, they're they're going at you know He won a partial supreme court victory and all the way up the supreme court because he did not want to Decorate a wedding cake for a a gay couples upcoming wedding And by the way since that he's had satanists come in and demand that he make things that you know He write, you know that the devil is my god or whatever I can't even describe there was another time they went in where they wanted him to make a cake that was a A giant Male organ they will not stop harassing this guy I mean this is because and he went to the supreme court. He won a partial victory on religious freedom grounds Once again Just suddenly some active. I mean this is all very targeted the activists have shown up and they wanted him to make a a gender Transition cake, but this time instead of writing in decoration. It's about Outside inside coloration of the cake like I think it's blue on the outside and pink on the inside to Celebrate the gender transition that is coming and he's like I don't I don't want to you know go basically get a cake from someone else There's soon and again Colorado is gonna you know they're gonna be on board for this the state commission on human rights they have And this is the thing. I mean people people don't understand they'll say oh religious freedom Yeah, if you're willing to go to the supreme court Maybe go bankrupt and be harassed for 10 years you have religious freedom in this country, but it is under assault friends it's This whole story has always felt like a law school hypothetical exam made up If you go to law school Ultimately all of your grades come down to Exams pretty much at the end of a semester and the exam is a written Exam where they give you all these crazy hypotheticals Of unsettled factual basis to try to apply the law to and this whole story buck has always felt to me like it's not even real life because Even the idea of it being a cake Place where certainly there's a form of artistry involved right? It's not like you're buying a big mac where every big mac pretty much looks the same Every one of these like cakes is in some way a work of art right they're unique they're they're they're especially ordered and The law is just not equipped to handle situations like these And I don't understand why this poor this poor guy Oh no, no, no, ended up the fate the the focal point of all of this because speak They went after him and they're gonna keep going after him and they're gonna keep going after him until he bends the knee because the left is a bunch of psychos It's crazy. It's crazy Look our friend Mike pillow. Uh Mike Lindell at my pillow Talk about crazy guys in line at a hearties and the government comes and seizes his phone Because he has different political opinions than the department of justice. It's in power right now Mike Lindell super great. He's gonna speak out. He's gonna be willing to speak true to power And you should all support him for that reason because not only does he do that he's got incredible Products and right now he's got the giza dream sheets lowest price ever 60 percent off 3999 with the promo code clay and buck all my pillow products 60 day money back guarantee Go to my pillow calm click on the radio listener specials check out this flash sale on the giza dream sheets That's my pillow calm do it today clay and buck Welcome back in clay travis buck sexton show even cnn has adam lacks all tough he's tested as tested making fun of a blue check who just tested positive for covens by getting six shots um the uh the Six seven straight polls have all had adam laksalt in the lead even including the most recent cnn one Which was just released today He is going to win that senate seat is going to be a big big deal and that is why there's panic setting in all over the democratic party but Yes, today buck as we started off the show talking about joe biden went down to south west florida with ron de santis And as part of that visit to florida Joe biden got involved in a conversation. I'm not even sure who he was speaking to a florida man was speaking to joe biden down there And biden has this idea That he's some sort of tough guy this ties in with the corn pop story I can't Which corn pop reference because that's the obvious like hey man. I gotta I got a chain around my hand You want to you want to dance? I mean It's crazy biden thinks that he is like a 1950s gangster and like he's walking around with brass knuckles then he's got like a switchblade with him Uh, it's the only way that explains how he talks except he's now basically 80 He can barely walk if you watch him you think to yourself every time he takes a step He's taking these tiny little ginger steps He falls down going up the stairs to the air force one like at any moment he broke his leg Uh, our his foot a while back. I remember he was in that boot for a long time during the campaign trail if I remember correctly The guy at any moment could fall even fell on his bike I mean he tried to pull up next to the reporters and he got his foot caught in the bike stand and he fell over All of this is just a joke But biden in his mind thinks that he's like al Capone or something And so here he is telling this random florida voter We had to believe it but basically nobody nobody else with a biden I Mean uh, so no one else with a biden you heard there, uh, and uh, buck It's not only that he's the worst president of our lives The cluelessness the answer is everybody else with biden nobody respects him. Oh pecs Not making uh production goals here. They're cutting production by two million Uh, nobody listens to him anywhere in europe Uh, I mean, it's it's an embarrassment how how pathetically weak he is Joe biden at this stage of the game. You have to wonder What he really even thinks His pitch is going to be going forward, but he's delusional and dumb enough That I think reality doesn't enter into his consciousness with any of these things. Also. I think You know has dementia. So here here you get a guy Who can point to what as success the notion that he's a Tough guy is hilarious. It's obviously an old man and give me a break But beyond that there's so many things that we've been fed so many lies We've been told that Joe biden one of them is that he's like a really nice guy He's not a nice guy. I that's one of the ones that makes me the most annoyed Uh, if you go back you'll find lots of times where he has said really, um, really Despiteful things and for me more than anything else Uh in recent memory the way that he spoke about people Not getting his stupid Mandatory vaccination. Yeah, it was with contempt. It was dangerous He was wrong And to follow it up with that speech we saw a few weeks ago Which everyone is calling the emperor palpatine speech from if you're a star wars nerd, you know what that one is Uh, but you know, it could have been sauron from lord of the rings whatever It was absolutely tone deaf and bizarre He's really just a vessel for democrat machinery He kind of just waddles around and says whatever he's supposed to say and they hope that people don't realize that the elevators Not go into the top floor That was the thursday before labor day the pimp palpatine the deep red glow speech Behind him with the two marines standing on guard in philadelphia That's really buck when democrats Started to soar that was The apex in early september of of of democrats saying oh we're going to take back the house and look at how well We're doing in the senate you can almost track to that instant now I think it's also tied in with people coming off vacation and in labor day and people starting to pay more attention But you can almost track to that instant of that speech the moment when democrats hit their apex of mid-term Optimism and when republicans started to surge back up and as we sit here 33 days out Effectively from the mid-term. I laid it out for you just to start off this hour republicans are surging in a massive way and The senate as right now, I mean, I think I really think democrats acknowledge privately that they're not going to keep the house But they felt pretty good about the senate and that is fading in a hurry and it'll be very quick when that new Congress assuming that that analysis is right when the new congress is Seated in january Politically, it's just gonna I mean we said this but it's gonna turn to all right. What is 2024? I mean, that's it because there's not gonna be any major legislation that gets done There'll be some fights over the debt ceiling and you know Budget resolutions and things like that and that will get done at some level There'll be some hearings that members of the republican house will hold Hopefully, oh, we'll talk about fauci in a second. Hopefully on fauci But gridlock I want ever to be prepared for this gridlock From the federal government is basically the best case scenario starting in 2023 Yeah, the bare minimum Do no harm federal government or do less harm is what I should say federal government starting in 2023 Is victory so that's just prepare ever should be prepared for it's not like republicans are gonna win and then all bunch of great Stuff's gonna happen and we're gonna have you know Universal concealed carry and the budget's gonna get slashed and we're gonna get rid of the EPA in all cow man I'm getting excited just thinking about it. But none of that's gonna happen What can happen if we play our cards right is you no longer have? Multi-trillion dollar. I mean, does that even remember like what was bided even trying to get in the five trillion dollars that he wanted to spend What do you basically universal basic income so people wouldn't have to work anymore? Which is already an issue so all of this you're right I mean, I think the expectations are key. This is about stopping biden from doing worse back in the day What's the number one physician? Responsibility first do no harm. Yep. What we are focused on right now is Rebuilding and the number one goal is first do no harm. Let's just not let him do more gridlock in government when you have a Democrat president gridlock in government is a beautiful thing everybody Yes, just embrace it because you know they're gonna say oh, they're obstructing this what they did when obama lost That big tea party wave election 2010 they're obstructing Obstruct beautiful word. It's like music to my ears obstruct the leftist Obstruct the collectivists don't allow them to do the crazy crap that they've already been doing for two years and we see how that goes so Oh fauci we'll talk about him in a second. I actually have something really important to talk to you all about though right now And it's the preborn pregnancy clinics They began their mission over 16 years ago to help women with unplanned pregnancies by offering them free Ultrasounds each time when an expectant mom hears her baby's heartbeat and sees the image of that baby on an ultrasound She's seeing a life a life that's created in the image of God and that's that moment That's when that divine connection between mother and child is made and the majority of the time because of that free ultrasound She will choose life by positioning their clinics in the states where over 50% of abortions occur Preborn has rescued hundreds of thousands of babies lives and are the country's largest provider of free ultrasound But they do need your help to keep it going one ultrasound is just 28 dollars You can help save a life today with your donation to donate just use your cell phone dial pound two five zero and say the keyword Baby that's pound two five zero and say baby or if you want to go online Donate at preborn calm slash buck.

We are on a mission together to save 40,000 babies lives preborn calm slash buck Welcome back to clay and buck We were just talking about the fight for life a moment ago and we mentioned this at the top of the show the Department of Justice Merrick Garland's DOJ has charged 11 pro-life activists for the federal crime of blocking abortion clinic access obstructing access to an abortion facility now This is this is interesting on on many levels and for one thing It shows you the priority of the DOJ here one to make this a story this happened like 18 18 months ago in Nashville my hometown. Oh, yeah, so over a year ago going on two years ago some some anti abortion Activists some pro-life activists were standing too close to people and Saying things to people going into the clinic that they do not want to hear now under a norm I'm just making sure I get the indictment claims that coordinators recruited participants to go to the city erect a blockade Prevent pregnant women from pursuing abortions a live stream of the stand-in shows active is chanting and singing prayer up to the stairs to and along the hallway police officers appeared in the video urged them to take the prose test outside to the sidewalk and They asked them to leave and then I'm just making sure one pro-life face 11 years in prison for this so what I want everyone to understand here is that the left created this edifice of abortion Rights under a fake constitutional right as we all know and there is in fact even there's a law There have been some cases on this Hill v Colorado McCallen v. Coakley that was in 2014 where the Supreme Court has come close to saying There's no special abortion access law in the Constitution. There's no right in the Constitution or any of this stuff Yeah, trespassing is illegal. You could say blocking access to a facility is you know obstructing maybe it's disturbing the peace whatever This notion that abortion clinics get a special federal protection Keep in mind there's a federal protection against harassment of judges and intimidation here Which Merrick Garland completely ignored when they were trying to pressure Supreme Court justices at their homes So the law wasn't the law then but now for standing and saying please don't go into this place and kill your baby People are facing 11 years in federal prison on a bullcrap law that should not exist in the first place I think it's the way to just talk about the focus on bringing these charges I believe the protests outside of Supreme Court Justice Holmes is still going on may not be as vociferous now Although who knows it may get created in a larger context As we start to have them hear more cases in October and issue new rulings next year But the big picture here is Nobody whoever protested outside of a Supreme Court justices home, which is a violation of federal law None of them have been arrested or charged with any federal violation whatsoever It's been going on for months and during that time it got so charged politically and unfortunately I still think we're there that a guy flew all the way across the country and showed up outside of Brett Kavanaugh's home With a goal intent and desire to murder him to assassinate him before the Dobbs decision became law Nothing happened to any of those people buck and so over a year after some people were involved in Similar to what happened. I think it was in Pennsylvania the arrest of the father of seven for for these issues to face 11 years in prison federal prison for standing outside an abortion clinic and giving any opinion for frankly any political opinion at all is To me part and parcel of what's going on here Democrats are desperate to make this race a referendum on abortion and on Donald Trump It's why the the raid happened at Mar-a-Lago when it did and it's why suddenly a year and a half after these Alleged incidents were getting arrests from the Department of Justice in October because they really hope that it brings abortion back to the centrality of this midterm. I also think that much of the Democrat media machinery became obviously explicitly and Monaically anti-Trump. Yeah in a way that they really it's like it's like Skynet and Terminator Like it became self-aware and they couldn't turn it off You know and it caused huge problems for them because now when people see things about you know January 6 from CNN and when they see things in the New York Times It's easier than ever to recognize these entities for what they are because They did finally come out and say in the era of Trump the truth means being anti-Trump as Journalists that is how we tell truth by being anti-Trump and now the Trump's not on the ballot People look at these entities. They go wait a second You told us you're explicitly partisan you told us I mean you're obsessed with CNN is still obviously obsessed with January 6 as much as they can get away with People I think are seeing this now and realizing more than ever What's really going on here? They don't have the same. Oh, well, these are journalists and they're just you know The media is telling us the truth. I think they've lost some degree some degree not You know, I'm not saying it's gone They've lost some degree of persuasive power as Journeys because they all weaponized against Trump and now that there's no Trump to deal with anymore They don't know what to do with themselves That's why I think Herschel had his greatest fundraising successes after the Daily Beast in the New York Times hit pieces Because I think most people out there see these entities for what they are which is default campaign arms of the Democrat Party and That's fine But they used to have their power by claiming. Oh, we're not partisan We're just out here covered calling balls and strikes covering the news And I think what Trump did was he disabused us of that notion and as if there's any doubt by the way about the desperate Attempt to make abortion on the ballot this midterm as well as Trump the January 6th committee Yes, they are still a thing has announced that they are going to have yet another public hearing in on Thursday of next week Are we gonna do popcorn viewing at your house or my house because this is all man It's gonna be a means during the during the show while we're on air But remember initially they said we're gonna have our report out before October Now they are so desperately trying to make Trump a part of the narrative that they are Scheduling in mid-October Less than three weeks or less than four weeks from the actual election yet another hearing you know I do think that again We're talking about a slice, but it's enough of a contingent I think even some Democrats after a while there are some who are addicted to the anti-Trumpism I mean they're they're junkies like hunter on his worst day like they need their fix of anti-Trumpism But I think that there are also some people who are just like It's just boring. You know, it's just boring the Trump and our democracies in parallel And people have real problems They actually want to hear about what's going on right now And there are real challenges in our lives that don't really need to get a constant all the insurrection It were almost two years in to the two-year Anniversary here and I'm sure they'll be very solemn Portrails and discussions about that you think that's bad wait until it's another election year But they haven't worked they haven't changed anybody's opinions. They haven't registered in any kind of significant way And they rescheduled last week's hearing because they were concerned it would get snowed under by the hurricane The reality is just nobody really cares, but that's coming up. We come back We got great guests for you third hour the program claim buck"
