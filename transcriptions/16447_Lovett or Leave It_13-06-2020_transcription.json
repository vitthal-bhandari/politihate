We want to use a new one each week if you want to make one, send it to us at hay at crooked.com and maybe we'll use yours. You can also tweet it at us. Later in the show we'll be joined by co-founder of Black Lives Matter LA, Dr. Molina Abdullah, the first trans candidate ever elected to public office in West Virginia, Rosemary Ketchum, and we'll hear from listeners to Mark Pride. But first, he's the director of 40 year old Virgin knocked up. This is 40 funny people train wreck and now the king of Staten Island, a very funny movie I just watched. In fact, please welcome Judd Apatow. I'm here. I want to apologize to start. I was not aware there was a video component. This is my Alicia Keys no makeup look. You're not going to get the quaff. I think that you owe an apology to Alicia Keys. If this is what happens to Alicia Keys with no makeup, that is truly shocking. There's a beauty to this too. There's a no a cast away Tom Hanks about two thirds into the movie appeal. I am, you know, spending a lot of time with some of my sports equipment as well. Yeah, you definitely look like you just did some home dentistry. We're all going to hope dentistry. We're like, can we get haircuts? Could we fix our cavities? I think I can do this myself. I have not gotten a haircut since this began. I'm going to go. I'm going to continue. I'm just going to see where this ends. But Judd, excited for you to be here. Thank you for doing this for you to ridicule these jokes to talk about the movie. So let's get into it. What a week. General Mark Millie, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, expressed his regret for participating in Trump's photo op in front of St. John's reaffirming his commitment to an apolitical US military. It was a good statement and important. We cannot allow Trump to undermine our institutions to the point where people might question the bipartisan nature of invading the Middle East. That's hardcore. That's like a wonky joke. That was a wonky joke. It's a wonky joke. It's a wonky joke. I do think part of it. It feels like it belongs in an earlier era. You know, it's a throw. We're not thinking about the Middle East right now, John. You cannot. You you zagged when you should have zigged. Speaking of failed reconstruction efforts, even as an amendment offered by Senator Elizabeth Warren to rename military bases, currently honoring Confederate traders, divided Senate Republicans and passed the Armed Services Committee. Trump pledged to veto the bipartisan military spending bill over the issue. And if he's mad now, wait until he finds out that all the World War II generals we name should after were Antifa. That's it. That's the joke. I like that. I like it. Here's the thing. I think that is a good thought. I don't think it's necessarily like in perfect joke style. It's just accurate. That's just accuracy. I don't know if it's a solid like twist joke. You just told me a truth, a simple truth. What I had originally planned to tell you there was a long meandering sentence about Trump is being a history buff, dresses up in Confederate grays. Yes. To reenact the movements because he doesn't want to honor Confederate generals for their politics. He just is a deep admirer of Civil War era military tactics. Here's what I'd like to see, John. You say to Trump, right now, this second, we're going in a room with three cameras. We're going to have an expert in the Civil War sit with you and you guys have to have a talk and we want to know everything you know about the Civil War. We want to know every general, every battle you know. And here's the thing. He probably knows nothing except like Robert E. Lee's name. I guarantee you, he knows as much about the Civil War as he knows about the Bible. I do believe that Trump's the worst questions ever asked of Trump are open ended questions. And I do think, tell us everything you know about the Civil War. Tell us everything you know about Jesus Christ. Just like, what do you know about Jesus Christ? Tell me what are the facts, anything you want to tell us? You tell us that right now. Well, there's a great clips online that are just someone saying, what is your favorite Bible passage? There's also a great clips of just what is the last book you read, which it has a stunning deer and headlights type of look. You know, I like all books. You know, I'm always reading books, hard to know which one to talk about right now with the with the massive books I read. There were these ominous reports about Trump having these Nazi Germany histories on his shelf. The implied that he had learned from what fascism had achieved in Germany. But it was always predicated on the idea that he ever opened one of these books. Like, there's no, he can't read a book. He doesn't have the attention. He thought blood sport was too boring. He had to fast forward through blood sport. Well, I there was always that room. I don't know if it was true was in some article that he had some book, the speeches of Hitler, right? And I don't know if that's true or not. But clearly, it just illustrates who his friends are. We know he didn't read it with a highlighter. I'm sure there are people around him who probably know all that stuff very well. I mean, when you talk to people who talk about propaganda and the use of propaganda, there's clearly people who have studied World War II assisting him. But I don't think he really understands it. I think he just understands flood the zone. You know, somebody just said, like, just keep talking nonsense. Everyone's confused and we'll push some stuff through. Because Trump is so abhorrent, obviously, we don't reflect on his strengths and he has that relentlessness. Yeah. That's been his great skill, the relentlessness. Yeah. Well, he doesn't ever want to not be in a fight. Every day, he needs someone to go at really hard. And he kind of feels good in it. I think he enjoys that space. And the reason why he doesn't console anyone is I think in a peaceful, quiet, let's even say loving moment. He's very deeply uncomfortable because I don't think that's ever been his experience with Fred. He doesn't need 10 years of therapy. He needs the really good stuff you get in the first 10 sessions, just the first 10 sessions about patterns and childhood. He never got any of that. Meanwhile, as protests continue to cross the country, a group of protesters in Seattle successfully cornered off a few blocks with barricades to create a police free Capitol Hill autonomous zone. Seattle hasn't seen this much free love since Niles proposed to Daphne. Okay, you're going for a reference that is very deep. It's Frazier. It's Frazier. You know, let me tell you something. I didn't put in a lot of hours watching Frazier. I'll tell you why I was working for the Larry Sanders show for Gary Shaling when that show was on. And although, you know, the few episodes I've seen, very strong, those are the best people in the world. The cheers crew, Kelsey Gramer, David Hyde Pierce, BB Newworth. I'm aware of it. But they would beat the Larry Sanders show for the Emmy every single year, five years in a row. We lost to the same people. And here's the funny part. Every single time they won, they never said, it's an honor to be nominated with all of you people. They always just said the same thing. We got the best writing staff on television. I'm not going there with that reference. I'm sorry. I've wounded. I had no idea that there was this lingering resentment that you felt towards Frazier. I'm sorry to have brought it up. You know, you know, my affinity for the Larry Sanders show. And I loved your documentary about Gary Shaling. Had I known a reference to the 1990s. Multi camp. You think this guy let's go? He doesn't let go. Also, this I want you to know something. I'm skipping the the Frazier follow ups. Oh, I'm sure there's many buttons that we're not going to get next week. Maybe I'll just like throw them in. Just just because I don't want to do it in front of Judd. It's not appropriate. But next week, the John Mahoney riff you're going to miss. Well, John Mahoney played a cop. Don't you understand? There's a lot of things we could have done with it, but we'll never know. We'll never know. Also this week, Steve Mnuchin said that the Trump administration won't disclose information about how the government spent $500 billion in bailout money through PPP. Mnuchin said the information was proprietary and confidential to words that have absolutely no meaning in this context. Mnuchin hasn't squandered this much money since he produced suicide squad and just like suicide squad, no one was held accountable. Okay. All right. I mean, I don't, you know, I didn't see suicide squad. So I don't have an opinion on its level of quality. It seems solid. That seems solid. Do you think the fact I could be better at that job being the producer of heavyweights? Sincerely, I believe the answer is yes, not for anything having to do with your skills, but I think you'd be able to attract better people. I think you'd have a better team. I think you'd have a better team. Yeah. The country group Lady ante Bellum announced this week that they would be changing their name to Lady A and the A now stands for Antifa. That's it. Now I'm beginning to understand that in our comedy team writing career, writing jokes for the former president, you're about to say something so hurtful. I feel like you needed me. I feel like you needed me. I did need you for people. Listen. I did need you. I didn't need you. Also fuck you, but I did need you. Just for people listening. When we worked on the White House correspondent's dinner, speeches for President Obama, Judd and I would get on the phone and we would write jokes. But Judd was responsible for some of the funniest jokes that we ever wrote for President Obama, including a big hand in the jokes we wrote for the 2011 correspondence dinner when Trump attended and was destroyed forever. And we never heard from him again. I don't know if we've discussed this publicly before. Have we together? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I don't think so. Here's what I remember of that time. I was visiting the White House with my family. And as I was walking through, you came out of the Oval Office and you said hello. And you said we're in there right now with the president writing jokes for the correspondence dinner, which I was in town to watch. And I thought that you would invite me in because I am in comedy and that would make you look good that you pulled me in to help. And I, in my mind, even in that split second, I thought I'm about to spend an hour with the president. That's how far ahead my mind got. You sent me on my way. And I was quietly furious. And I felt like you were afraid to have that kind of power in the room that I might show off in some way and make everyone look bad due to my acumen. So then I bump into you later in the night. Now your speech, I was the biggest laughs I'd ever heard in my entire life. Barack Obama is a master joke teller in a way that I don't know people can fully fathom. So then drunkenly, I yelled at you at the party and said, how dare you not let me in that room. And then the next year you remembered and sent me the speech and said, do you have anything to add to this? And I said, I think you're a little light on your Trump jokes. This is was at the beginning of birtherism. And I explained how much I disliked the man. And I said, I think you should go hard, Adam. Do you remember that? Yes, I do. I remember being on the phone. I remember our conversation. I remember where I was sitting. I also like, you know, John Fabro was sitting, you called right as we were going over the speech and then you got on the phone. And that's when you started riffing about the apprentice. And that's when we started writing that section. Yeah. So we discussed that it would be funny for the president to describe it in the same detail and entire episode of the apprentice. And then, you know, make a flippant remark about how qualified Donald Trump was and you and the staff came up with an amazing version that was about Omaha stakes and referenced all the different people. And you told me you didn't think that the president would go for it because it was kind of a conceptual bit. It wasn't a one-liner. And you were thrilled when he decided to do it. And of course, many people have said, is that why Donald Trump ran for president? And I don't believe that's the case at all. I mean, he had been dancing around for a long time. And I think he's had plenty of days of humiliation and plenty of days of wanting power. I don't think that was the defining moment of his life. Although Bill Burr has a hysterical stand-up bit about Donald Trump sitting there that night and saying, now I'm going to take your job and pulling it off. Bill Barr, who's in our movie, King of Staten Island. But and then I got a photograph from the president that you got for me. And on it, he wrote, two Judd, thanks for the jokes. You should get a job in comedy, which I assume you wrote. But still good, still still good to have. Although now in history, I don't know if I should hang it up. I don't know. We don't talk about that much. We don't talk about it too much. I blame Seth Meyers. I feel like his jokes were way meaner. And then people kind of conflated that with our jokes, which were a little tough. But Seth Meyers annihilated him. They were rough. And eviscerated. They were so hard. They were good. They were great. In the moment, I all of a sudden had all of the social awkward anxiety because I felt like we should bring you in. But I also felt like it wasn't my job. I wasn't in charge of me. I'm not the idea of me changing the manifest for a meeting with the president. But it really filled me with such a sense of panic and dread that I just waved at you and wanted the whole thing to go away. But it ended up in a great pairing and a working relationship for years of writing those jokes. But let me tell you, my other proud moment with you, I had one joke, the Mitch McConnell joke. Do you remember that joke? That's one of my favorite jokes of all time. Is that you get a drink with Mitch McConnell? Is that the joke? Yes. I don't. I didn't realize that. Yeah. That was my favorite thing from our conversations. People say, I should spend more time in the Republicans. They say, why do you drink a Mitch McConnell? You get a drink with Mitch McConnell. I remember that now. I like that too because it was there was both that and the Trump joke. They're not jokes. They're just they're just they're just statements of fact. And it actually approaches the that joke approaches the norm on McDonald platonic ideal of the setup and the punchline being the same. Yes. You get you get you get a drink with Mitch McConnell. You get a drink with Mitch McConnell. That is yes. I like I love that. I love that. They're so similar. All right. Director John Ridley criticized HBO Max for posting the four hour Southern Epic gone with the win without any historical context and HBO Max pulled the film temporarily creating a controversy. Meanwhile, the only four hour Southern Epic I enjoy is the story of what Texas barbecue does to my body. I thought you're going to make fun of my four hour Gary Shambling HBO documentary. I wouldn't I wouldn't but wait but wait if I want to watch a moving charming epic about an antiheroes journey from postponed adolescence to adulthood through a process of grieving and revelation. I'll watch the king of Staten Island starring my generations Vivian Lee Pete Davidson plug hard. That's the plug that is going to get people all rented AMC announced they'll be reopening almost all of their US theaters in July with strict social distancing protocol that man in a trench coat watching Scooby do alone at 10 a.m. That's not a creep. It's Anthony Fauci. I like that. That's the best one. You ended up the strong one. That was very good. I'll do one more. I'll do one more. One more Jacksonville, Florida agreed to allow Trump to deliver his convention speech in front of a packed arena and Trump is also resuming rallies while asking attendees to sign a COVID-19 waiver. This happened after a miscommunication in the Oval Office when one aide tried to stop the rallies by comparing them to human sacrifice. But hearing that Trump got this weird vaguely sexual far off look in his eye and everybody slowly backed out of the room. I want to do that because it's fucking weird. But Judd before before you go I do want to take a moment to talk about the movie. I watched it. I really liked it. I really it's it's really funny. Pete Davidson as an actor is so interesting to watch. He's so surprising and how he does this sort of very kind of personal but funny movie. Is there anything you want people to know? Because it's coming out today. It's out. This is coming out on Saturday. So it's out now, right? It's out now. It's it's on your computer. If you just scream at your computer, Siri, Alexa, play the king of satto. It's just going to come. It's literally in your computer now. It's and it's I you know, it's a very funny movie. It's very uplifting but it is about what happens to Pete Davidson's character when you know after losing his father who was a firefighter, his mom played by Marissa Tomei starts dating another firefighter played by Bill Burr. And it is about how people grieve and how they heal. It's also about first responders and firemen and and nurses. And I think you know, every once in a while something very special happens when you make a movie. And I think that the movie really does apply to a lot of what we're going through because it is about trauma and grief and how it affects us and how it affects us long term. And I'm just very proud of it. I know we've all run out of stuff to watch. I am currently binging Remington steel. So I'm happy to get something that that I like to the people because we all need it. I will I will tell you that I don't know I hope this isn't inviting another grudge I wasn't aware of Ronan and I are watching the Golden Girls from the very beginning. But I will. This is what we're doing. I'm watching after a mash. I've already got through mash. There's a scene involving a child and Pete Davidson's tattoo artistry that was truly such a funny card to watch. But like I was like I paused it I paused it because I was uncomfortable and also just genuinely appreciating that is a comedy idea I'd never seen anything like it before because it was so crazy. So I really recommend the movie. Judd it's so good to see you. Thank you so much for doing this. Thank you for taking the time. The movie is the King of Staten Island. Judd Apatow and a beard. Thank you for being here. Thank you. And now that we're done I will go put on my makeup. Thank you to Judd Apatow for joining us. When we come back we'll be joined by Dr. Molina Abdullah. Hey don't go anywhere. There's more of Love It or Leave It coming up. And we're back. She is one of the original organizers of Black Lives Matter and a professor of Pan-African Studies at Cal State LA. Please welcome back to the show Dr. Molina Abdullah. Welcome back. Thank you. So great to be with you again. So you were last on this show two years ago, over two years ago at this point. You're speaking to our audience at the improv and you said which you noted was mostly not black and you said you all need to be just as invested in black freedom as I am because until black people are free nobody is free. It's time to be disruptive as hell. Black Lives Matter is about a radical imagining of what kind of world we could live in if we are willing to work for it. A lot of the conversation following the protests and demands from activists all over the country have argued for some pretty radical change. Do you think we're in the midst of that kind of reimagining? I do think we're in the midst of a radical reimagining beginning with the radical reimagining of what community safety looks like. And of course, the murder of George Floyd at the hands of Derek Chauvin has kind of ushered this in. I think the way that he was murdered just struck a chord with everyone and reminded folks that we're not being overly dramatic or radical by saying that American policing evolves from the system of slave catching and it can't be reformed. It has to be abolished and we have to radically reimagine something new. And so I think that we have people now who are seeing that murder and saying here's evidence of that. And what am I going to do? Am I going to sit around and just let it happen or am I going to rise up? And so I think this is a moment like one I've never seen in my lifetime where people are rising up and ready to put themselves on the line. And if you think about the fact that we're still in a pandemic and last Sunday we had 100,000 people marching in the streets in Hollywood, I think that it speaks volumes to people's willingness. And this is not just LA. This is every city in the country and many cities around the globe who are rising up. So I want to talk about what this protest movement has been pushing for. Obviously one of the big changes has been defunding the police. That's been a rallying cry for these protests. And it seems like there are many different definitions of what that means and many different ways people are explaining it. What does it mean to you in a larger sense and also just in the actual concrete fights unfolding in cities like LA right now? Well defunding the police is something that we've been advocating for for a very long time. You know, we began to look at the LAPD budget more than five years ago as Black Lives Matter. Someone just handed us a pie chart of the mayor's budget proposal. And we like most people who've seen it were just shocked and outraged that upwards of 50% of the city's general fund was going straight up to LAPD. So every year since then we've been trying to defund the police trying to roll back the amount of money that police get. And this is again not just in Los Angeles but every major city in the country spends about 50% of its general fund on police. We know that that doesn't make community safer. It doesn't even make sense, right? When you look around and you say what creates safe and healthy communities we need things like housing. We need things like health care. We need parks. We need environmental protections. We need quality after school programs and the arts and those are the things that create safe communities, mental health resources, right? This year was particularly striking because when we saw the mayor's budget it was up to 54% of the city's general fund on police. But this was in the midst of a health pandemic with an economic fallout that had a disproportionate impact on Black people. Now we'd already outreach to the mayor who's supposed to be a liberal. We talked to him about, you know, how COVID-19 and the pandemic is disproportionately impacting Black people and how we need resources directed to not just our immediate needs but our long-term needs. He completely ignored those demands which were issued not just by Black Lives Matter but virtually every single Black led organization in the county and then does the exact opposite of what we said we needed. After his budget came out we launched something called People's Budget LA and we had asked people, where do you want to spend? And most people in Los Angeles had traditional approaches to public safety which includes LAPD as the lowest of their priorities. So defunding the police is not just about something that protects Black life but it's also part of what most people think. Most Angelenos do not think that we should be spending this kind of money on police so we were chanting defund police for years and more intensely in recent weeks even before George Floyd was killed. So one of the things that's been fascinating as this conversation about defunders played out is you see some politicians sort of reject the phrase while embracing some of the larger goals and you even see some polling that shows people being really reticent around defunding the police as a phrase. But then when you dig into the policy about some kind of a new non-police force to handle mental illness crises about addiction in cities, homelessness in cities that is something that's popular. People recognize that more of our budget should go towards helping the community not just policing the community to schools and to social services and parks and recreation and just city life. How do you tackle that entrenched fear born of just a very long period of time in which police was treated as the answer to so many of our problems and the police departments themselves have so much entrenched power in the cities even cities controlled by Democrats over city budgets. Empowering the people is the beginning of it right so the reason that we have the kinds of city budgets that we do is because politicians do the work of budgeting in the dark which makes them beholden to the groups that they think have power. You know if we think about police associations that parade themselves as unions they have undue influence over most elected officials and so most elected officials do their bidding including mayors even in liberal cities like ours right and so they're not doing this budgeting process through what we call a participatory budgeting process right and so some cities do though there's a few cities that are more progressive that are beginning to engage in this way you know people might be slow to say defund the police but what they do get when they participate in budgeting is that it's absolutely a zero-sum game if you put $3.15 billion in policing you don't have that $3.15 billion for housing and when you engage in a way that's democratic people say is my priority putting police on every corner as the police chief of Los Angeles wants to do or is my priority saying there's 60,000 homeless people in Los Angeles I see them every day it makes me sick when you drive down Skid Row which continues to be an ever expanding area even in the midst of a pandemic you feel sickened not by the people but by the fact that we live in a country in a city that allows its people to sleep on the streets with no restrooms with no access to clean food with no access to hygiene how could we do that how could we call ourselves you know a developed nation and you have 60,000 people living without homes right you know people might not want to hashtag defund the police but if you say here's $3 billion do you want to spend it on housing our people or do you want to spend it on LAPD they're going to choose housing our people when you say here's $3 billion do you want to spend on having quality after school programs for our children or do you want to spend it on police they're going to say we want to spend it on our children and that's what we see time and time again and that's what the outcome was we did the survey everybody jumped on board as we started talking about this we got this UC Berkeley researcher to really craft our tool and the lowest priority for Angelenos was traditional approaches to policing everybody said their first priority was meeting universal human needs like housing that's how you push back is exposing people to what it means to getting them to understand you know this is not something that's scary this is something that's actually very healthy and societies should constantly reimagine themselves in part stirred by this protest there's been a larger debate in our culture around systemic racism and I know that for me I've said this before but like you can know something and then you can really come to know it and it can really influence and affect your worldview all these problems have been around you've been talking about these problems for a very long time you've been trying to get people to wake up to these problems for a very long time right and now all of a sudden it does seem as though there has been this awakening for a lot of people in part spurred by George Floyd's murder why do you think this is happening right now since black the black lives matter movement began killings had increased things had actually gotten worse in many respects and yet right now something seems to have so have happened what what in your mind do you think spurred this moment of protest this moment of people reimagining well I want to just say one thing that in cities with large black lives matter chapters or active black lives matter chapters you actually have seen a continuous decline of police killings so we're not good until there aren't any but I want to say that because I think that sometimes we as organizers and activists spend a lot of time offering critique and not enough time celebrating our wins and so it's not the victory until police don't kill anybody but it is something I think to be recognized that we have been effective in our work I think this moment is really interesting and for me it gives me a lot of hope and faith that the kind of transformation that we're seeking is on the horizon I think George Floyd's murder was absolutely one of the most horrific that we've ever seen I think the fact that Derek Chauvin sat on his neck for almost nine minutes when not only George Floyd but the people who were around him attempted to even physically intervene to try to get Chauvin off his neck pled with him prayed right and try to get him to make another choice and that for nine minutes he refused to do so I think it demonstrates the history of policing and devolving from slave catching and I think that people could feel that like if you looked at Chauvin's face you know it was that he had the authority to steal this life he had the authority to do what it was he was doing he almost got pleasure out of it it seemed and I think that resonated with people differently than even other murders that we saw caught on camera so there's that piece of it but I think there's also that in Los Angeles six hundred eight people now because someone was killed last night have been killed by police and no one is being held accountable and I think that at a certain point George Floyd becomes the last straw like there's six hundred eight other straws in LA County there's eleven hundred straws every year and at a certain point he becomes the last straw and people say you know what we've been tinkering around the edges of this policing system for years and decades I'm done and then you know we also have been hopefully confined in such a way that it's allowed us to engage in some soul searching to engage in some good reading some good conversation and maybe some good spiritual work that says you know what it's time to get up it's time to get up what are you even here for if you just go sit at home on safer at home orders when people are literally still dying from police violence one question on the politics of this some democratic politicians are trying to strike a balance they don't want to embrace the phrase they want to embrace the goals they're trying to kind of find a way to embrace the aspects of the protest movement that they view as sort of politically either practical or possible or positive or what have you what are you looking for from democratic politicians to demonstrate that they've done the work embrace the positions to earn your vote to earn the vote of the people out there right now don't be weak these proposals are putting forward or weak watered down proposals I never understand democrats right if you were going in to buy a car you don't go in and make an offer based on what you think they'll sell it to you for defund the police is not that bold you know it doesn't have to be police abolition although I believe in police abolition defund the police and police abolition are not the same thing they're just parts on a continuum recognizing that you know police are not the answer to every problem I don't understand why they're not saying things like no municipality can spend more than blank percent of their unrestricted funds on police democrats should say police don't belong in schools point blank period and it's not even that imaginative right anybody who's over the age of 35 remembers that police weren't always in school I had no idea just how pervasive having police in schools had become and how many schools had police officers and not nurses police officers and not a guidance counselor police officers and out of social welfare officer I I learned that from these protests right so why went in the democrats why went in policy makers say that's an easy one because most parents went to school when there were no cops in school yeah and most parents went to school when you had a school nurse I remember my nose used to bleed all the time and I was always in the nurse's office right that's how I learned how to pinch the bridge right there it was because there was always a school nurse who taught me that stuff right I would have lunch and then go to the nurse with a stomach ache and it took them too long to figure out I was a lactose intolerant Jewish person it took them just a few it just took them too long like I'm a child can some adult crack this fucking code like every day you were drinking that school milk chocolate milk that I'm sick somebody put this together what it's not that hard every day that chocolate milk was good though I think I also I think I also like the nurse she was nice to me so I would love to see policymakers be more courageous be willing to listen to the people not just the lobbyists not just the police associations and you know be willing to say you know now is the time I think right now I really believe we could have anything we want if we fight you know I think this is a moment where it's time to be bold and we can have everything in anything we want well we'll leave it there Dr. Molina Abdullah thank you so much for being here it's good to see you again thank you good to see you too and stay safe when we come back we'll be joined by lgbtq plus listeners to talk about culture they love culture they hate the culture about which they feel both emotions to mark Pratt don't go anywhere this is love it or leave it there's more on the way and we're back listeners I think it is time for all of us to give Jay Inslee a much deserved apology you can build 10 000 affordable housing units on the land of one major theme park to destroy Harry Potter world Star Wars galaxy's edge or Pandora the world of avatar which one's gotta go um I am a politician of conviction I vote against Iraq war I voted for the assault weapon bill I voted against the repeal of a glass deagle and I think Harry Potter should be eliminated holy shit you all booed governor Inslee and his campaign was forced to clarify his comments but Jay Inslee got it right he's good on climate he's good on Harry Potter there are two sentences that I always think about about two different and unrelated aspects of pop culture one is about Harry Potter one is about Quentin Tarantino which is again completely unrelated the one about Harry Potter and I read this and I tried to find it I couldn't find it but it's someone who just said Harry Potter is about a popular boy who is good at sports and that really stuck with me and then the other thing about Quentin Tarantino which is completely unrelated to this segment and Harry Potter is that someone wrote that Quentin Tarantino makes movies about violence as someone that has not experienced violence and I've seen Quentin Tarantino movies in a different light since I heard that again unrelated now JK Rowling which of course stands for Jay Karen Rowling followed up a glib anti-trans tweet with a very long quite confused anti-trans op ed on her website so we want to hear from LGBTQ plus listeners not just about JK Rowling's bullshit but about culture that has let you down and about how LGBTQ people have told their stories and fought back originally we were just going to talk about problematic faves but when JK Rowling decided to add to her glib tweet with a genuine anti-trans screed that was very dark we wanted to change this segment up a bit so we're going to go to the phone lines and at least let's call somebody hi is this Elliot yes yeah this is Elliot you're on with John as we say here reluctantly what's on your mind well I written about something that happened with my mom over Christmas she had bought me like some general Harry Potter socks and stuff and then that was when like one of the rounds of the and so the stuff was happening so as soon as she like heard what was going on with that she offered sort of turned the socks and um apologize but like she didn't know what was going on so it was just a really like meaningful thing for her to do so your mom your mom wanted to make sure that she was loyal to you now that JK had taken this anti-trans position yes yes she wasn't aware of it beforehand like she's been very supportive since I came out and transitioned so she wanted to correct that and made sure we weren't like supporting her monetarily and push this very very on board right away which really meant a lot to me this JK Rowling shit is such a fucking bummer huh yeah yeah it really sucks um and like I grew up on Harry Potter and like it was a big part of my childhood and it was something that was very important to me and now it it really sucks that something that was so important now it's kind of hard to look back on and and think of an apostasy way still well it's nice that your mom decided to take a stand on your behalf yeah yeah that was that was really meaningful to pay and like we had some some tough times when I first came out to her but that like really solidified her commitment to being trans people in general and yeah it was a really nice summit between us and we still have Daniel Radcliffe yeah very happy about that yeah that's been really cool to see everyone kind of speak out of concern uh well Elliot thank you so much for sharing and uh it's good to talk to you yeah thank you so much um the huge fan I was going to talk to you hi carsey hi hi you're on with john as we say here uh how you doing oh my god i'm i'm doing well i'm on with john love it oh my god yeah i wanted john love it hi hi carsey welcome to the show so it's pride happy pride to you thank you and we are talking to lgbtq plus listeners about the problematic faves because their heroes let them down but also the culture they love and so i just want to turn it to you what do you want to rant about do you have a positive rant do you have a negative rant can you give us both what's on your mind my problematic faves has to be chicks away i love them so much but people are so nice they're so nice they're so nice good lemonade oh i won't touch the lemonade i won't touch the lemonade but they're such nice people yeah they're so nice people they ask you if you want like sauces they ask if they want to take your plate their chicken is good it's not like the end'll be all chicken but it's a good chicken i think it's really brave of you to tackle this issue i think what you're doing is shameful i think that your behavior is absolutely appalling i know but hypothetically yeah if once in a while people like you people like me human beings flesh and blood yeah decide that we want the spicy chicken sandwich with waffle fries with the side of the buffalo sauce and maybe also with a couple of the chicken nuggets as well i love the chicken nuggets i mean i've never had them i never had them i'm speaking hypothetically but if you were to get them if you were to get them and dip them in that buffalo sauce you know it might be really good it might be something you right really like you know that's sort of like my hypothetical hypothetically if we were to it's all right as a member of a minority we deserve that we've been through a lot we deserve i think i think you're pushing it i think you're pushing it and you know it you know it look i know i'm doing it i have political science major i push things all the time that are probably not in the limit i totally understand i will say this though it is absolutely true that there have been moments where i've given in and had the chick fillet okay and it is a sad statement about me that the problems we both know about we don't need to get into it we know what the problem is yeah politically about chick fillet has not stopped us but i will say i think that there has been a real decline in quality i think that the the french fry texture has gotten worse i mean i if you know from what i read i've read that too that it has gotten a little less crispy it's gotten a little more floppy yeah exactly exactly that's what people are starting to say in these in these books that we're reading and uh that may be enough that may be enough so i it's a lesson for me that the combination of an anti-gay history and a soggy fry is enough for me to take my business elsewhere and i and i hope the same is for you everything else is disappointing me and i'm taking action so you're right this probably is the last stand something that happens to me is whenever i talk about how we shouldn't go to chick fillet it puts it in my mind is that a problem that you think you may have and say the next sort of like hour or two yeah maybe maybe maybe carsey thank you so much for joining us thank you for sharing i think it was brave i understand i'm with you i understand the tension as a fast food loving lgbt person stay strong out there all right and we'll just do our best in other ways we're just human beings yes we're just human beings we are it's not our fault it's not whatever that means i agree it's not our fault thank you so much for calling you don't know how much this made my day oh well thank you it made my day talking to you too carsey stay safe out there okay it's good talking to you okay bye hello hi is Aaron yes hi Aaron you're on with john as we say here hey how's it going how you doing i'm doing well thanks for calling yeah so right you know it is pride happy pride thanks thank you so you know because of pride and because uh seen some of these unfortunate comments from certain authors we're talking to lgbtq listeners and want to hear about the culture that drags you down the culture that made you happy you can rant negatively you can rant positively what's going on Aaron i've got i've got a positive and a negative i would like both okay but i'd like to start negative and go positive okay okay my my negative one is the latest update to the american red cross american red cross does great stuff sad that gay and bisexual guys still can't donate blood without a celibacy period i just think that's junky uh it's not uh not research base it's kind of discriminatory so i'm kind of disappointed on that latest headline but i agree i agree but from like a public health perspective it's a lot of like at risk groups right there's there's like risky behaviors that you can engage in and of course of course plenty of people that um that don't engage in those risky behaviors right and we also know that like the blood donors are screened for those risky behaviors and then the blood is tested for any pathogens including HIV it's a weird call out it's very dated it shouldn't be about who you are it should be about what you do that is obvious and yet and yet and yet so i think that was a really good a really good point that's my negative yeah um my positive rant though is per your recommendation um listening a little bit earlier i started killing you oh yeah man oh man i've been down in the dumps i hate quarantine i hate hostel good and thing and this is just an absolute pleasure i love seeing lgbt characters where their sexuality is not part of the main storyline i love it i love seeing it gave villain they're dynamic they're complicated and uh it's not uh we don't have to have like our typical tropes of uh coming out of the closet or being rejected by family i completely agree with you erin and it's such a good point killing eve is so good now we have to note that there was a little bit of a hubbub a little bit of a squabble about whether or not it was a gay love story um but putting that aside and honestly i did not keep up with it because i don't care i completely agree get me there the homoerotic tension wafting off of bbc america when that show was on is incredible i'm here for it yeah sandra o is incredible the actress whose name escapes me for one moment playing villa nell is incredible jody jody yes jody kohmer kohmer kohmer kohmer great it was amazing well erin that is such a great example i'm so thank you for sharing it thanks for the call it was really fun thanks for doing it it's uh it's a good topic hello hi is it step yep you're on with john as we say here sometimes oh my god here uh happy pride to you thank you happy prayer to you too i'm just curious what's on your mind you know what did you want to talk about drag race in general is just bothering me wait what did rupaul do you want let anyone compete who's not like a gay male basically it's just drag kings deserve better okay and rupaul also has a farm in wyoming where he fracks but nobody wants to talk about that rupaul's fracking rupaul's fracking yep i didn't know about that i'm learning that from you nobody does it was like news for a second i can't believe that i can't believe that yeah that's i agree with you i think rupaul should be focusing on entertaining people i don't think you should be oh yeah producing fossil fuels oh yeah i totally agree well step thank you so much for sharing this rant with us you're welcome step thank you so much for joining us uh stay safe out there and we appreciate you calling thanks bye oh hi holy shit hi this is our old friend kalen isn't it yeah three kalen welcome back to love it or leave it all right we haven't talked uh since we last spoke to you you were working on a project about presidential history is that right yeah uh but today because it's pride and happy pride to you kalen yes thank you you too you wrote in saying that you wanted to rant about and i quote my trans-ass getting knowingly queer baited by the cw yeah first of all i'm not very comfortable with that language from you kalen all right oh you're a young person all right and i would like to see you keep the cussing to a minimum frankly yeah my parents would probably agree with that uh but so tell us more uh what do you want to say about the cw so because i have nothing to do until i leave for college in august i have decided to watch all of the arabesque shows so arrow super girl black lightning the flash you know all that and it's just no surface level for their gay relationships and it's bad and i want more i need content kalen you're you by the way i just think this speaks to the progressivism of a of a young generation that your complaint is you find the queer relationships on the cw to not be substantive enough there to surface level for your taste is that what you're saying today yeah i mean i'm watching arrow and there's the gay couple and they've been dating for like three seasons and they have not shown a single kiss on screen now that i understand that i understand i just want you to know kalen all right as an elder all right as your lgbtq elder all right let me tell you you have no idea how little no i know i know how few characters there were and to hear you demand not just queer characters not just queer relationships but you want more kissing on the cw all right because that's what they would do if they were straight i want you to know that i think it's inspiring all right yeah i guess uh they're also very attractive over there on the cw huh please don't please don't do this right now i have a crush on all of them why are they all hot they're all hot because they're on television kalen yes wait where are you going to college in the fall where are you going uh american university are you excited yeah i mean i'm doing online orientation and that's fun how do you feel about jk rallying um i don't know if you know about this but uh jackson bird who the trans-doutuber wrote a really good piece on that which you were through a nonprofit called the harry patter lines and he basically talked about how harry patter like helped him come out as trans and stuff and it was really neat yeah it's disappointing but i'm not surprised and i'm kind of used to it well kalen i'm glad that even though the uh cw queer relationships aren't having the level of romantic depth that you're looking for uh from your superhero dramas that i'm glad that that even in this dark time you have that hotness available to you okay as a young person all right researching american presidents and getting ready to go to college okay i need friends it's fine well the good news is you're going to make lots of friends you're going to go to american university and you're going to be able to make lots of friends yeah no i mean i'm excited well kalen it's good to talk to you i think we just have to check in regularly okay i think we just have to keep following up and seeing how you're doing i would be totally okay with that okay i was checking all of the twitter interacts like the morning after um the last episode aired since we had an idea of kalen with kalen i thought it was funny okay all right you know what kalen you know let's let's slow down here all right i'm not ready to be eclipsed i don't need to be paid it's fine but work for free i can't get a job anyways kalen hey come on all right you got a you know you you have to know your own worth okay you got a fight for you all right all right whatever all right kalen it's been so great to catch up with you as always i'm so glad to talk to you all right say hi to your parents for me all right and uh you know we're gonna have we're gonna have to check in with you to hear about how college is going okay we're gonna have to check in and see what's happening at american all right i would love that thanks for calling me back because i was not expecting it i was kind of expecting your show producer to be like oh that's kit again but that's what they said but i told them they were wrong just so you know they said no way but i said we got a kalen oh cute all right goodbye kalen get out of here well thanks yeah bye thanks to kalen thanks to all the listeners who called in on a serious note i did want to take a moment to talk about the activism we've seen to protest the deaths of black trans people including remi fells ryan milton that have helped draw attention to these issues as black lives matter protests have unfolded broadly across the country their organizations doing great work advocating for trans rights and trans people right now like the trans justice funding project at trans justice funding project org and the okra project at the okra project.com and you can support their work and help them protect trans lives and advocate for trans people and when we come back we'll be joined by rosemary ketchum who just want to see on the wheeling city council in west virginia in in that victory has become the first openly trans person to win public office in that state ever hey don't go anywhere there's more of love it or leave it coming up and we're back she just want to see it on the wheeling city council and is the first openly transgender person ever elected to public office in the history of west virginia please welcome rosemary ketchum thank you for being here hi folks thanks for having me so congratulations on your race can you tell us a little bit about uh what you were campaigning for yeah so i was a candidate for wheeling city council in ward three uh which makes up four neighborhoods uh and a few of our campaign you know issues included homelessness and vacant properties potholes and stray cats all of those uh fine local staff you also you know won this victory during pride first trans person elected in the history of your state can you talk a little bit about what that was like on the campaign trail did you meet people who were less familiar with lgbt candidates like how did it actually play out day-to-day i didn't know what to anticipate i definitely didn't run as a trans candidate but i didn't hide it i've been working in my community as a community organizer for almost a decade so people know who i am but uh yeah i've i had a lot of interesting first encounters some awkward most very kind and wonderful i walked into a bar as one does on the campaign trail um trying to get directions um to find a specific space and i had never been in this place before and it was dead quiet when i walked in kind of like one of those saloon movies where you walk in and it's like that we uh me and my my uh campaign team walked in and they gave us directions very kind of quietly um and we walked out and by the end of the night we walked to you know get into our car which we had parked in their parking lot without asking and one of the folks who was in the bar ran outside yelling our name and that's never a good sign and so we're kind of terrified and scared and he walked up to our car and said um hey you were the worst politician i've ever met and you know i'm a new politician and so i it hurt a little bit he said you never introduced yourself first and foremost and apparently they had a big discussion of whether i was a man or a woman inside the bar after i left and he went on and on about that and said that the whole bar wanted my contact information to learn more and it was easily one of the most awkward experiences ever um but 100 kind and thoughtful uh and i think the kind of definition of what local politics looks like that's a lot to bear you know you're trying to campaign on these issues the small-town problems you want to take on your building you know you said you're a new politician and yet your victory in a city council race becomes national news right i think for a lot of people transvisibility is new you are sort of representing not just yourself but the idea for people of being trans in a place like your towns what what does that experience like how does it change you as a as a candidate i guess is my question i guess i'm a people person at heart and that makes it super easy because i'm an extrovert i love talking to folks i love uh helping folks understand what they might not understand i work in mental health so every day i'm trying to um enlighten and inspire and do all those fun things but running for office is very different i've never had an experience like this and i think running for local office is particularly unique because in this national landscape of convoluted politics we have now and we've had you know in some way forever but particularly now it is incredibly frustrating and there's so much apathy and indifference toward federal and national politics because people realize how glacial change is and how frustrating getting anything done can be but i believe the more that we focus on our local politics the more we realize the kind of untapped power of our mayors and city council members uh to make change in our communities in our cities uh so that we can all be have little pockets of progress um throughout our state so we were when i when i kind of framed it that way it was so much easier to run because you know it's like we have our own little stake here in wheeling and we can really make progress on our own terms i've been in a fight with some harry potter stands all day uh bless your heart it's just a tweet uh i don't know how much you've been following what uh jk rolling has gotten up to uh but she's put out obviously these abhorrent statements uh but putting just this one person aside yeah this idea about what a real woman is something that people even some people that consider themselves progressives can seem to get behind even now what to your mind is the harm of that kind of an idea of the kind of arguments uh being put out there right now i think it's really important to kind of separate what we know to be ignorant versus what we know to be bigoted you know and and what i believe ignorance is just the fact of just not knowing or not understanding but trying to learn maybe not getting it right uh and bigotry is active hate and you know somebody who just does not care to learn or to be kind so you know i speak at colleges and i've had you know this past summer i got to speak at some of my first elementary and middle schools which were the most intimidating but the most fun experiences that i've had you know just the language is really hard to understand for folks the difference between a female and the difference between a woman there is a difference and the language we use is oftentimes mixed and convoluted i have i have a story about going to the DMV for the first time and being refused an id uh because the language on the forms didn't make sense they weren't 21st century you know as a as a trans person who identifies as a woman but is not female there's no box for me to check so you know for folks who have never really had to consider the trans experience or what that means for a person who doesn't identify in that you know very rigid binary system this language is really hard it's like learning mandarin for people it's not easy to get right away and so i try to be patient but you know uh miss rallying has a pretty large exposure and so it's it's i think that much more important for her to try at least try to get it right i do think i mean you look at sort of she wrote this incredibly long piece it does seem as though she has moved from this ignorant place to someone who's now done enough work to be considered someone who has decided to disregard the science disregard the experts disregard trans experience yeah i actually want to ask you about west virginia too because i do think right that your story has become national news in part because it's like even in west virginia oh my gosh even west virginia this place where they right they're rural they're they're bumpkins whatever whatever the pejorative is but there does seem to be some idea that like the reason it's exciting uh that you want is because it's even in a place like west virginia and you talked about the the glacial pace of national politics some of what you talked about addressing as a city council member is about the failures of the federal government like what what do you want people to know about some of the fights that are going on in west virginia and the politics of west virginia uh given the kind of failures at the national level to tackle some of the economic challenges and societal challenges like drugs and and what have you in west virginia we're kind of microcosm of what's happening nationally um because we have a governor who is in so many ways the donald trump twin he's kind of like the the you know the doppelganger and and we have a statewide you know opioid epidemic that you know exists across the country but is i think really concentrated here in the state of west virginia at base we have a complete distrust in the systems that govern us nationally but in west virginia we are very much a rebel state we're the first you know nation to secede from you know the confederacy and you know we're proud of it however you know what we're seeing across the country um with you know the protection of confederate monuments and flags and statues is frightening and not part of what we are here in the state of west virginia so that's all to say the stigma about west virginia is often baseless you know because you know the folks here are incredibly humble and compassionate um but the issues we have hit home for every single west virginia i don't think if there is a west virginia that doesn't know somebody impacted by the opioid crisis or isn't themselves impacted i have family members in recovery myself and so from a city council perspective you could think of it as unfair to try to take on the responsibilities that our state or our federal government should be taking on um but i see it as an opportunity to build trust which is perhaps the most valuable currency that a local government can have um and to exchange with their community and it's something that i've tried to build as a community organizer in in my state um and hopefully now i can do the same you know as an elected official last question for you there are trans kids right now they are seeing things that jk ronlyn is saying they're also seeing your victory they're seeing the progress they're also seeing this bigotry that's out there what's your advice to them what's your message to them it's not as hard as you think and fear is not the boss oftentimes we are controlled by what we're afraid of uh and that makes sense the world is kind of scary and it takes a certain amount of vulnerability to do something like this because you will not know what the consequences are until they're you know right in front of you i didn't know i was gonna win i didn't know that time magazine was gonna pick the story up and then i was gonna be talking to john love it that you know two days ago i was you know excited about two retweets um so this is how fast it can happen um but i would tell a person or whomever's thinking about running for office um that they should uh because it's more efficient to replace elected officials than to convince them and it's more fun actually rosemary ketchum thank you so much congratulations on your victory and uh good luck thanks john we come back we'll end on a hunt out don't go anywhere this is love it or leave it and there's more on the way and we're back because we all need it this week here it is this week's high notes submitted by our listeners hey love it this is emma from st rinsisco it's been an especially tough couple of weeks but one thing that has been giving me hope is that my best friend from college and a few of her friends created a fundraiser to elect for black women to congress jackie gordon desirated Cynthia wallace and Joyce Elliott all of them will be either the first black women elected to congress in either their state or district in just 24 hours they have raised over seven thousand dollars it's not only proven to me how much power we have as individual state change but it's also given me hope for the future hi i just wanted to hear something i'm hopeful for my dear friend ran for state house in state of pimpobania in one last week and we're super excited that both state of america and hi to america is working with organizing and getting people to adopt the state and we're just super hopeful and i'm excited that she was vulnerable enough to run and i'm just really happy from central pennsylvania thank you hey love it this is john from milwaukee and my high note this week is that i went to a drive-in movie went with my family to see a double feature of et and Jurassic park was wonderful two childhood classics on the big screen all from the safety of our car thanks bye hi robert my name is jennie and i'm from west virginia and i wanted to
