    "text": " We're back with another episode of Keep It, recorded live at South by Southwest, brought to you by Toon Air. Kara Lewis and I traveled to Austin, Texas for our first live show and it was actually pretty fun. We had a lot of really great barbecue. We tried tortoise tacos for the first time and we saw a lot of people who were excited to see Keep It's first live show. So coming up in this episode we have a discussion about Bruno Mars, Rachel Dolesal and American Idol. And after that I'll have an interview with musicians Tegan and Sarah about the Netflix reboot of Quira. Hi, I am Ira Baddas and the third. I'm Kara. I'm Lou Wiss with Seven Ers. Imagine Kara from the Jungle Book saying it, the snake. Can't work a mic, can't work champagne. Oh my god. I'm never going to make it on the voice. But the shirt is nice and tight today so it doesn't matter. We have an empty chair here because we're waiting for our guest, Omarosa. She is running a little late. No, we're going to kick things off with the really fun conversation of, I guess, cultural appropriation. It's big in the news every week when the Kardashians do something. But this week it's about Bruno Mars and Rachel Dolesal and Katy Perry. Both are the kings of pop. First off, this week debates were sparked yet again. I feel like this happens every week. Every week now. The third out, Bruno Mars is culturally appropriating black culture. So let's end this once and for all. We already talked about this if I recall. Clearly everyone didn't hear the episode where we solved this for you around the Super Wall. But I feel like I remember saying I don't care. He's not black, which is also a thing. I think everyone didn't realize that Bruno Mars wasn't black. They were like, he's tan and he dances. I just don't care about this. There's something interesting about appropriation claims leveled at him because he's from Hawaii. And I'm going to quote my friend and USC pop culture professor Karen Tonksen who says, Hawaii is like an annex territory. It's like we literally have forced our popular culture on Hawaii. They had no choice but to participate in all of our music, all of our movies, whatever, the Philippines, et cetera. It's weird that we've forced all this music on him and then we say you can't use any of it. It is what he grew up with though. Yeah, but someone said it was like karaoke. And he kind of is doing that very, very well. He is not a black person. He's doing a bunch of extensive James Brown karaoke numbers. So I don't know that this is a fight we need to be focusing on right now when Rachel Dolezal is out here with a damn documentary with her hair still braided. Well, she's releasing an album too. So I think the biggest thing about brutal Mars is just the fact that there is obviously an appropriation of cultures and many things that we do. Like I just want about my apartment and like a silk robe that is from Japan, not Japanese. People get angry when people go to some of their friends like Indian weddings and they dress up and you see those photos that was that levied at the hot person from Canada. Straight up. Yes, sorry. Anne Murray. No. Who is it? It was Trudeau. Sorry. I forgot his name for a moment. Oh, okay. He's not our president. No. Damn it. It's Donald Trump. It's always interesting to talk about appropriation of pop music though because I think it's one of those things where we did it casually for so many years. We just allowed Madonna to be Asian four different times and like it never became a big enough conversation why this was happening. You know, we're playing catch up constantly on these sorts of things. Gwen Stefani escaped it. I mean, you look back at those photos and it is like how did no one say anything. We let her do that for she literally just had like little Japanese girls following her around in her suitcase. It was crazy. I believe that in Harajuku girls was just wait till you get your little hands on LA. It's like, oh my God. And fans are like that. It was like it couldn't have been worse. That's that I also love her. She looks to me a little bit like a claymation reindeer. I say that affectionately. A reindeer. You know, that's the kind of pointy like the big like kind of eyes like this. I always forget reindeer are real animals. No, right. Every time around Christmas and I'm like, oh, they're not fake. Yeah, I assume they're like unicorns. The scientists called them caribou. That's why it's a. Oh, the scientists. Yeah, that's right. Yeah, all right. I think the ultimate thing is that Bruno isn't doing what Gwen Stefani was doing, you know, he's not carrying around, you know, like three tiny black people that he found dancing on the subway in Harlem. He's not doing like Justin Timberlake, you know, and harassing black women. His producers are black. His fans are black. He works. Yeah. And also he's always been upfront about his influences too. It's not like he's saying like, I've invented this R&B tradition here, you know, like when people say years ago, that song locked out of heaven, people would say he sounded like the police. He's like, I'm obsessed with the police. You know, he, and I think he's always been sort of a knowledgeable musician. And I think pop musicians now have to be smarter than they've ever been before about what they did, because everything sounds like everything now. Everything takes from past styles. And I feel like he's one of the just kind of cooler people in pop music. Well, a non-cool person who Cara was talking about is Rachel D'Olezal. We talked about her a bit last night on Love It or Leave It, a little show you might have heard of on Gricut Media. Not that many people listen to it. Cara, Rachel D'Olezal is back in the news. She has a Netflix documentary. Yeah. I am so sick of this bitch. I really thought we were done. I cannot believe this is happening. Her own children are like, really, mom? We're doing this again. She, like I said, her edges with the braids, I'm like, this wasn't made for you. I don't know. It's really disappointing. I, like I say with Omarosa, I do not think these people should be given attention. Netflix was really quick to be like, she didn't get paid. The film, you know, we don't pay documentary subjects, whatever. But she's obviously thinking that she can profit from this somehow or else she wouldn't do it because she has nothing to gain. So ultimately, she thinks this will help her, you know, make money or get back sort of whatever. She's going to become an Instagram honey. She's going to be some comedy tea. I know. No, I don't even know. It's so exhausting. I don't know if you've seen the trailer for this, but I mean, as you basically just said, her son reads her two filth. Yeah, he's like, this isn't humiliating to me. He goes, every one of your stunts backfires. It's really strange. He's like, I wish she hadn't said so many of the things she said. And she's just saying they're like, yeah, but you know, I don't know. She's not even, she's just like, people need hope. Right. I think she said something like, you shouldn't take hope away from people. Hope of what being a black woman, you should have that hope stripped from you. Yeah, right. And clearly we haven't stripped it far enough from you. I think also it's just I feel I question the intentions of this documentary because what is there to one pack? We figured out her, the jig is up. There's nothing left. It's sort of like why I also am suspicious of a movie like Itanya where they tried to put kind of like a woke spin on the proceedings when the fact is, no, you made this because it's a salacious story that people are obsessed with for bad reasons. And you're trying to find a way for people to congratulate themselves for having watched it. And it's just like this. It's like there's nothing left. It's just it's something she shouldn't have done. And that's it. Who do you think is going to play Rachel when they do I black woman? Oh, black woman. There's also no black woman. The two filmmakers, it's a white woman and a black man. So there's of course, there's no black woman on earth who would have cosigned this shit. So you know, there were no black women, you know, none of them were at Netflix, you know, none of them, there was no camera went women, none of them. No, but there was not a black woman anywhere near this. What someone would have been like, what are you doing? I know who should play Rachel, though, as well. James Franco, it just seems right. He's going to get that now. Burned him for disaster artists. I got you. You did. Yeah. Loses funny sometimes. Indeed. And then we have Katy Perry this week as well. Do we? Yeah, we do. All right. It's either Omarosa or Katy Perry. Okay, get Katy in here. All right. So Katy Perry is hosting American Idol, which is coming back for some reason. I think it was just on the air last week and it's coming back with new hosts. It is Katy, it's a Lionel Richie is another judge and Luke Bryan, which is a person with two first names. Is he the country dude who wraps? No, it's not. Well, isn't there one of the country guys who kind of wraps? I am so sure. I think he's new, but along that vein. He's just in the, I feel like in around 2002, all of male country music agreed to just dress like they work at Pacific Sunwear. It's very like black t-shirt and then straight leg wash jeans every time. Like Keith Urban, think about him for a moment. He's dressed in the same mall gear for that generation. Katy is back on the show and she is back on the show. I mean, she's on the show now and they released a clip of the show, which has her interacting with a gay fan who says wig to her and she responds, did you just say wig and they have this interaction where she says, oh, this language is just for us, not for you, Luke. Brian, Elan O'Ritchie. And after, this is after they ask what the hell is going on here? They have no, they can't interpret it at all. They've never heard of snatching wigs, let alone edges. So, obviously some people were like, Katy Perry, this language isn't actually for you and here she goes inserting herself into gay culture again. Does she do that a lot? She does it a lot. I feel good for her. She brought drag queens to do her SNL performance. She inappropriately, after Pink gave an emotional speech at the VMAs last year, ripped off a blonde wig and said, I am shooketh. You snatched my wig. No, okay, okay. I don't remember the head. I think she's the weird case of a pop star who has had a few missteps, like at the beginning of her career, she had a song called You're So Gay and You Don't Even Like Boys is the name of the song, which at the time, the first time I'd ever heard of Katy Perry was Madonna's thing. She was a big fan of that song. I get all my news through Madonna. Is that a problem? And it felt a little too familiar, a little too like you're using the word gay in a way. You think you're cool with us, so you're using it this way. That said, I do feel like in general we are a little bit hard on Katy Perry. I feel like she routinely does her homework. I think she's messed up. When she performed as a gay show one time, again, bad. What's the video where she had a finger wave and like grills? She did a ritual with a horse. She did some wild. This is how we do video. Right. It makes me really wonder, because she and Rihanna used to be like best friends. And I'm like, maybe Rihanna doesn't fuck with her anymore, because Rihanna, she wouldn't be pulling that shit if Rihanna was still hanging out with her. She wouldn't be like, hey, Rihanna, check out this video of me with my grill. So maybe the key is don't ever piss off Rihanna and you won't make any mistakes. That should be the end of an A-slaps, babe. Yeah. So let me say this about American Idol, by the way. I actually saw the first episode. I would say she's not only the best judge on the panel, but it makes the show feel relevant again, because I think something that got away from American Idol is judges who understand what it's like to be a 16-year-old or a 17-year-old. The last time it was on, the judges were Jennifer Lopez and Keith Urban of Pacific Sunwear. And who's the other one? Harry Connick Jr. And I feel like they would only give them critiques in the vein of like pitch level, which is not interesting for me to watch. Whereas Katy Perry, to me, I think interacts with teenagers all day on Twitter, and she makes the show feel fun and kind of vivified again. I used to love American Idol. I don't know if you guys did, but... They don't. No. I actually did use the American Idol. I watched it for multiple seasons. I feel like I stopped around the time something called a lead to wise. That's right. Yes. No, eventually it is started giving men who have seen a guitar before the title for no reason. It was maybe unpopular, but I liked it when Simon was there because I liked when he was mean. He was so bitchy and he was right a lot. He wasn't... He was mean, but I was like, not wrong about like, she can't sing. You're correct. And I liked the... I didn't like the bad auditions you could tell when it started to become very scripted and like, you were just cherry picking people, but like those first two or three seasons, when they were just getting randos and Simon and his tight tees was just being mean and British. I love that. I don't think any human being has worn more Henleys than Simon Cowell. I don't know if they... Guinness keeps track of things like that, but... Also Ryan Seacrest is back. That's a problem. Oh, he is. Well, you forgot about that. Straight from his empty e-carpet to American Idol. I don't know. Keep him away from the female contestants. That's... I wonder what they're going to do. I didn't even... Of course, I didn't think of that. I haven't thought about American Idol. No. And said that they've worked with Ryan since the first season of American Idol and he's been nothing but great. And I think that's all the PR, American Idol is going to be about him. Also I just hate updates like that. Like who cares that he was nice to somebody? That doesn't say anything about the problems we have with him. Kelly Ripa. Yeah, right. Yes, exactly. He's not going to attack you Kelly. What are you talking about? Markham Sway was would kill him for one. He's all jacked up on Riverdale. Right now. Like... Wrestling teenagers. Right. Plus, I feel like Kelly Ripa's is the one that annoyed me the most though. Yeah. Because when Kelly Ripa defended Ryan Seacrest, she basically gave like... She gave that speech Oprah gave when she was asked if she and Gail had a lesbian relationship. Oprah, when she was like... Gail is like the sister. I wish I had the mother. Everyone should have. I don't know about a person. I don't know about a person. And that was Kelly. She was like grabbing his hand. It seems like she had tears in her eyes. Like don't rip another co-host away from me. That's really what she was feeling. She was like, read this left. Michael left me high and fucking dry. She took a parachute on that. She's like, I can't do this like round robin of new hosts again. Yeah. I feel you on that girl. But you know... No, it's weird though. I mean like obviously they filmed the auditions of American Idol and the Hollywood Week rounds months ago. So they can't, I don't know if it's possible to edit out Ryan Seacrest. Who also does the narration for all those episodes. Yeah, I'm curious what they're going to do moving forward because it's too uncomfortable for me to leave him back in the show. It would be hard for me a zealot fan of American Idol, which is just weird to admit to keep watching. But didn't I tell you, I was like, he's going to be fine. Like when I saw him on the e-carpet, I was like, because he, they said right, like they did the investigation and one of them, they were like, we didn't see anything wrong with that. Did you do the journal investigation and found that nothing happened? I was also give it, I wrote an article about it for the Daily Beast. Do you work at the Daily Beast? Huh? You work at the Daily Beast? That was just like a job title, Cara. It wasn't even a brag. I hate you. I wrote an article and I was given a statement from NBC Universal about like the whole situation and they were like, just so you know, the woman who was harassed allegedly was not fired. When Ryan left his post at E, her services were quote, no longer needed. So she was like, go. Yeah. Her services were no longer needed. I'm like, all right, I don't need your Miranda Priestley spin right now. It's just very murky. They, every response to what Ryan did sounds like Olivia Pope, like wrote down a statement for them to say. Yeah. That's why I think he's also honestly, he's too valuable to ABC, to, I mean, he's now is doing the American Idol and what is it? Kelly and Ryan. Yeah. Yeah. Like, that's a lot of money. He's very valuable to them. Like, they're not going to let him go without a fight. And I think we're saying that. When we're back is Lewis versus an audience member. Ooh. It's very ominous. I play to win. All right. So we're back. Lewis has been getting, you know, a lot of headlines like he's Adam Rippin for his Oscar trivia knowledge. So we're going to play a game with Lewis and an audience member who wants to test some Oscar trivia with Lewis. Oh, wow. Do not be afraid. Oh, I see sense, sense of excitement over here. Yeah. Are we very excited? I'm super excited. All right. Let's do it. I lost to Lewis with Google. I just want everyone to remember that. I had a full on laptop in front of me, couldn't type the words quick enough before this one had it. So Godspeed. I can't say your name tag. What's your name? My name is Treble. Hi. How are you? Hey, I'm good. How are you? Lovely to meet you. Where are you visiting from? I'm from Chicago. Oh, so am I. Listen to you. But not a cool suburb. Not like a cool John. Oh, yeah. Prison suburbs. Oh, that sucks. That's good. All right. We're going to go ahead and go into this. There's not a prize. I don't know anything about the Oscar. It's fine. It doesn't matter. It'll be fine. I have a good feeling about this. I think you'll do well. Lewis. Oh, here it comes. Sorry with an easy question for you. This is just for me. Okay. Best Supporting Actor 1965. Martin Balsam, a thousand clones. Great. I didn't ask all that. Who's your Oscar trivia question? He lives on Sesame Street. Oscar, the grouch. Correct. It's one to one. He also thrives on Sesame Street. Not just lives. Do you know he used to be orange? The Oscar, the grouch. Okay, listen. We only need Oscar trivia from you, Lewis. Come on. Save it for the nights when you update Wikipedia. I know people who do that. I actually had close to home. Best Picture. Okay. 1970. Patton, which is I think the last best picture winner I've not seen. So, yeah. I haven't seen that. I love story, which is the worst best picture nominee ever. Have you ever seen that movie? With Ryan O'Neill, who is among the most disgusting celebrities who ever lived, who accidentally hit on his own daughter at like a funeral they were both attending. Anyway, Tatum O'Neill's a goddess, but moving on. True. Look it up. It's the disgusting story. Yeah. All right. Let's two points for you. Your question. He plays Poe Dameron in Star Wars. Oscar. Who? Oscar Eisenstein. That's a fair pronunciation of Isaac. He just turned 39. Oscar Eisenstein is how he is. Is what he put out his resume with the audition for a common brother's movie. Never seen a Latino in one of those. Better add a Jewish name. All right. Lewis, Best Actress 2017. That would be this year. Francis McDormand. All right. Her second Best Actress, when her fifth nomination. God, my dream job would be staying the stuff as they walk to the podium. Like, this is her fifth nomination and she also looks great. That feels super achievable. Yeah. Someone does that. Thank you. Like that's your dream job. Yeah. You can eat a book. You can tweet someone and get that job. That's a positive. Live in LA. Yeah. I would start with like three statistics in a row and then something shady. You know, like. Do you have that much time? They're getting up. She's in the front row. She's up there kind of quick. Two wins by the nomination should have been Sally Hawkins. Yeah. Uh, your question. Randy. A famous Dominican American fashion designer. Oscar de Laurenta. There you go. Wow. We are. I'm catching on to what these answers should be now. Yeah. That's okay. Um, we are three, three. This is a grudge match. You just said? Um, no. We have, um, the next one, which is Best Live Action, Short Subject. Oh, this bastard. 1971. Live Action, Short Subject. I'm going to go with, uh, uh, Ryan O'Neill actually, who's not that tall. Sorry, it's the resurrection of Bronco Billie. All right. Which they always make you watch in school. So shame, I didn't know that one. All right. Well, you lost one. I did. Um, your question. Is this for the win? Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Just try to. I'm vulnerable to take advantage of this. Take advantage of this. I'm out of Oscars. I don't know anybody else named Oscar. Okay. All right. If you get this one, you win, oh, a tune in shirt. There is a prize. I conjured one out of thin air. Um, he created a meat and cold cut company most famous for its hot dog. I'm going to go with Oscar Meyer. All right. Oh my God. How's it going to lose? This is the one thing I'm good at and you take it away from it. I don't have many friends. You were in those jeans though. That's true. Yeah. So I got that. I got the snatched waist. Those jeans are so tight. They are really close friends. That's right. Yes. Um, beautiful work over there. I didn't really read a rudner with her one liner. She's over there. Didn't really have a good joke there. You know, just decide to go with it. We're going to take a break. And when we're back, keep it. Now it's time for the part of the show that we all love. It's when we say what we don't like this week and what we're going to say, keep it too. For those of you who don't know what keep it means, it basically means no thanks. I don't want this. Other words that I won't say because I think we're live and we should not be swearing in here. Lewis, what are you going to say, keep it too this week? Okay. This is sort of a complicated keep it. You guys all play HQ, the trivia app. I feel like the host of that, Scott Rogowski gets a lot of flack for being annoying. And I want to say keep it to people who dwell on that because if you're familiar with the app, it's a 12 question game in which you play on your phone and it's 12 multiple choice questions. And it's the glitchiest app ever. So this guy is basically forced to vamp constantly. And I feel like it's disingenuous to call him annoying for doing 10 run on punny jokes in a row. Which is annoying. Okay. Super annoying. Moving on. When it's like he has to say something and he doesn't ever sound like he's run out of things to say. So I actually think he does a really good job at that show. And also I want to say that HQ for a multiple choice trivia, if you know anybody who's obsessed with trivia, multiple choices just not that exciting a format. You want to be able to pull the answer out of thin air. It's more fun. Nobody on jeopardy is like give me a multiple choice. These are actual egg heads who want to be challenged. For this kind of format, I think the questions are amazing. If you watch who wants to be a millionaire, nobody wins a million dollars anymore. Why? Because when they get to the $20,000 question, the question's like how many fourth graders does it take to fill up the White House? And it's just like four random numbers. It's like nobody would ever know that. Whereas I think every question on HQ is fair and gets people really excited about trivia. So I'm a huge fan and I would love his job if they're giving it up. I would rather you than him. Thank you. He's so annoying. I don't want to carry Lewis and run on my phone. Getting regular announcements that you're about to come on. Right. With my material about trivia. Yes. Kara, what are you saying, Keeper too? So there is a hippo named Fiona who I love. And she was at the Cincinnati Zoo and she's brand new and she's great and like plucky and is in her tank and is doing things and is wonderful. There's this other hippo at the San Antonio Zoo named Timothy who tweeted at Fiona today saying are you looking for a boyfriend? And first of all, I don't like when people do this shit like animals are talking to each other. Neither they're not tweeting. The hippo is not asking Fiona this. But also she's one year old back off. Time is up. No thank you, Timothy. And I really love Fiona too. So I want her protected from these creeps. We all got to deal with it. All of us ladies. I wish like Coco the gorilla tweeted. This feels like a very misogynistic conversation to me. I'll keep it. I love it. I feel like I have to. Because one, I started to say on love her to leave it. But people really wanted to hear about Ari the Bachelor. Oh yeah. I'm done talking about that man. I don't watch white seasons of the Bachelor. If they decide to cast someone ethnic again like Rachel, I will watch. Obviously. One next season. I'm going to say they do this I think once every 20 seasons. So invite your grandkids. Grandkids. Who knows what your life's going to what turns it'll take. 20 years. You never know. All right. My first one is suitcases with batteries. Anyway, my actual keep it this week is about Gary Oldman. I feel like I talk about him a lot. And I'm tired of talking about him. His publicist is tired of me talking about him. But he was back in the news again after winning the Oscar. Obviously, we all know that during his divorce, his ex-wife alleged that he hit her with a phone. And he's also had instances where he was in Playboy. He was interviewed in Playboy. And he defended Mel Gibson's like racist and homophobic and anti-Semitic rants. With something like we all talk crazily behind the scenes. Yeah. It was something very round about in strange. So he basically pulled a Casey Affleck and sort of ignored all of this during the Academy Awards season because he wanted to keep scooping up his wins. And he finally won. He won his Oscar. And when Casey Affleck won his Oscar, he went away. When Gary Oldman won his Oscar, he had his son pen an open letter to the media saying that the media was being mean to his father and that his mother was a liar. Jesus. This is real. Yeah, this is real. And I just feel like nobody needed to know all that. I feel like no one needed to involve your son in this. I guess the son is old enough to have pen this letter and like be out there. But I just feel like you already won your Oscar. You already won. Yeah. What difference does it make now? Why are you dredging this up now when the son could have done this during awards season and could have had a real conversation about it, but you decided to do it after you got the award and now there's nothing to really do about it anymore. Like addressing the media is very like Trump at like the media, all of them. Who are you talking about? Who are you talking to? He's talking to me. No. And every other place started picking it up too. I don't know. I was just very uncomfortable with the fact that like that's interesting because you think about, I think we said that with like Jeffrey Tambor, where it's like you have had a very long career. I'm sure you have a lot of money. Take your shit and go. It's done like you're off the show. Just go and shut up and be quiet and like accept that this is not happening for you anymore. Like Gary Oldman, you won your Oscar. Like you got over. Just take it. Can you be happy with that? I can only trust Gary Oldman's son. I can only deem him trustworthy if he also apologizes for the fact that his dad won over Timothy Chalamet because that was an actual nuanced performance no one was expecting. What Gary Oldman did in Darkest Hour, which is like a two and a half star costume drama, I describe it as auditioning for Mad TV. It was just like slamming and being upset. He put on the like state puffed marshmallow suit and he was like shaking chairs and yelling about bombs and Dunkirk I think because it's the same plot or I don't know. It was a crossover episode of Dunkirk. That's right. I saw 10 minutes of the Darkest Hour and I turned it off. When we're back an audience Q&A. And we're back. If anyone here has questions they want to ask any of us and we won't answer them. They can be about anything really. It doesn't have to be about podcasting. We can give you advice. Lewis could tell you where he gets his jeans. Hi. Hi, how's it going? I was introduced to the podcast a little bit late. My cousin turned me on to it and I've been a big fan ever since the last few weeks. There's only been 10 episodes. Yeah, I figured it out. So I was wondering if I had missed it or if you guys could tell us how you guys kind of found each other and came to work together. Oh, cool. Well I was thinking about starting a podcast and Lewis started showing up my door and saying let me on it. No, I got involved with Cricut Media about a year ago when I appeared on my former MTV News colleague, Onamory Cox's podcast and hers is with friends like these. And from doing that show I did a guest appearance on Love to Leave It. And after that, John and I wanted to work together so we started developing a show, we keep it over the summer. And eventually we just started like, I started doing like chemistry tests, people, you know, who we could work with. And I loved working with Lewis and I wanted Kara on the show honestly, but she was working on Grown-ish at the time and then Grown-ish went on a hiatus that it's still on. So I made her be on the show. Yeah, I did love it or leave it. She did love it or leave it. She hated podcasts before. Yeah. And then she had fun. And then when she was drunk at an after party, I said be on keep it. And she said yes. That's kind of it. Because I also, when I did love it or leave it, I was not confident that my, it was like a lot of like white dudes. And I was like, I don't know guys if you're going to find this funny what I'm offering. But it went well. The three of us also were in the same kind of racket for years of writing for various websites. She's a Jezebel writer. He had written for MTV now. He writes for the Daily Beast. I wrote for a bunch of sites that were once great and now don't exist. But they were great. And so when you write on the sites like that, you are inevitably on Twitter all day. So I would see them constantly retweeted and sometimes they were amusing, which is all I need. So anyone else? Hi. Hi. I'm Lindsay. I'm a big fan. Hi, Lindsay. So you guys have this platform where you're allowed to rant and be outspoken, give your perspective, no holds bar. Have you ever maybe regretted a moment or wish you could reel yourself back in at a certain time than anything? Well, that's what editing is for. I actually had said something when I did love it or leave it. I didn't threaten Paul Ryan, but I think I said like I wouldn't mind if someone else perhaps threatened Paul Ryan. And John on stage was like, I'm going to edit that out for you. And I was like, keep it in there. I don't care. Come at me trolls. But no, he totally edited it out. Yeah. So that's helpful. It's for the better. I once had to flee to Europe. I want to make a joke about Jeff Sessions. So sometimes reel it in. I think about that though, when I look at my writing on Jezebel, because I was at Jezebel for three years, and I think ultimately, if I had to, I think I could def, like 87% of it, I think is like cool. And stuff that I really think I could defend, even if I'm being, you know, like rude or whatever. Like it's stuff that if put in front of, you know, if I had to, I could defend this. And the rest of it is just stupid. But I think that's also part of like the internet where you're like, there's going to be dumb things that you've said or done there. And not a lot to be done. Particularly in the jobs that we've had, you know, like when you're working for a site where you have to like basically be like a hot take machine every day. And the reason I really love keep it is that, you know, each week we talk about topics that interest us. And you know, we have like a thoughtful sort of like nuanced conversation about it as opposed to getting an email like this celebrity just did this, you know, like, can you write about it in an hour? And then you write up something dumb and it's like, you know, you see it months later and you're like, why did I have that stupid take? It's like, oh, because I only had 20 minutes to think about it before I started writing. Yeah. The most backlash I've ever gotten for anything. I mean, like when you write about famous people, I feel like most of the people who come at you on Twitter are like particular fans of that celebrity. But like you need to be open to that. Like I'm very particular about who I am obsessed with. And I'm sure everybody else is too. And I think we should necessarily be at war about that all the time. Years ago I recapped SNL for us. I called TV line by, which is a site by Michael Oscello. And Justin Timberlake had hosted and I mean, for like five weeks in a row, oh, we talked about was Justin Timberlake. But his humor is just not for me. It just feels super fratty. It feels super prom. King asked like you're being almost like coerced into finding him funny because he finds himself so funny. That was the only time I saw people on Twitter making accounts to threaten me because they were so obsessed with Justin Timberlake as a comedian, which is so wild. Like I get it if you were into his music or whatever. What year was that? It's got to be like six years ago. I'd say 2012. Because I was pre the internet realizing it's okay to dislike. Right. Yeah, what I'm saying is I'm revolutionary in a trend setter and people were just catching up. So I haven't regretted anything that much yet, but stay tuned. Anyone else? You know, obviously podcasting has been around for a while, but I think it's clear that over the last couple of years it's really taken hold. We've kind of had a bit of a, I don't know if it's a renaissance or a resurgence, but can you point to anything culturally, politically, something specific that you think has really driven that and really driven interest in the medium as a whole? I think sort of what Karen and I were talking about with delivering like hot takes for like adjustable or daily beats. I think a lot of people are just sort of exhausted with that sort of analysis of the news and culture at large. You have cable news too, you know, after just the people, they talk about nonsense all day. You know, like you, if you follow a podcast that you like and you know that every week they're talking about something that they're interested in and you're interested in, you know what's not going to be like Don Lemon holding up a sign that says is cracker, a bad word. You know, it's the, like the cable news and everything, like they constantly have to turn out stuff every day. And a lot of it's going to be dumb. I think people are just sort of reaching a point where they want their news to be a bit more filtered, particularly to their, you know, liking and their senses, but also just they want something that's more produced. It feels more comfortable. I think that's, well I also, because I did not listen to podcasts as he said, I found, I was like, I don't feel like listening to these two people just talk for, and I would see things, it's like 90 minutes and I'm like, are you crazy? I'm not listening to that. But now it feels like the idea of something being produced and like thoughtful and like, you know, we sat down and are making sure that this makes sense as opposed to just like, I think initially when I was like not on podcasts like years ago, it was just like, it's just these people, I don't care about these people talking about nothing. And the idea of like, this is very tailored. And like you said, like more thoughtful, I am starting, I'm getting there. I'm coming around to podcasts. I think also just because you're constantly bombarded with news, and you spend, I think most of your day, your work day, like an average Monday, by yourself, you want to be listening to people like on the way to work at work who are just making sense of things. It's like really calming after you've been bombarded with headlines all day necessarily. You know, everybody, you know, everybody's about 80 years old. Everybody's on their phones. So no, even if you're not paying attention to the news, somebody else's, and they will tell you what's happening. So I think podcasts are sort of like having, you know, sort of a whisper in your ear, you know, making sense of things, making sense of that bombardment constantly. It's a conversation with friends, but you don't have any friends around. How about that? Some of us. Right, for now. Yes. Thank you all for coming to listen to Keith. When we're back in interview with Tegan and Sarah. Everyone's been talking about Netflix's reboot of Queer Eye. Like can Anthony actually cook? And what was up with that weird episode about the police? To discuss it with me, I'm joined by Tegan and Sarah. I'm very excited because I have two people here that I love Tegan and Sarah. Hi. Hi. What kind of love are we talking about when you say the word love? I enjoy your music. I enjoy you as people. Yeah. You have a love. You have like strong feelings for us. Yeah. Like actual feelings. When I see you, I genuinely like to see you. I don't know if I would like so literally throw around love, but like I mean, I really care about you. Sarah's showing her true color right now. When does friendship feelings turn into love feelings? I just don't know. You're a regular Carrie Bradshaw today. So you're rewatching that show and there's another show that's bad. I think everybody is surprised. It's good. It is good. Queer eye. Yeah. Like I don't think anybody was expecting it to be as emotional as it is, but I've cried through three episodes. It's so many tears for me. That's how we got into it. Our mom, we have like a family WhatsApp and she posted like her and her partner Michael that they'd been crying all night watching the show and how tremendous it was. And then she proceeded to go to all the other chats we have because we have multiple chats on WhatsApp with different family and friend groups with her on it. So I watched the first episode and bald, but I want to say this is good crying because like in a time where we're crying for so many terrible, terrible reasons and so upset and anxious, all of us collectively, it's a good cry. It's like a real cry. It's a reminder that actually most people are real and soft and good and people just want to be loved. That's right. I think what's interesting about the last show is before it was just sort of like a show with like introducing gay people to the world. So it was just like wacky and it was like, it was fine. But I think this one is about like gay people are in the world. Yeah. And now what can you learn from that? Yeah. It's interesting too because there was a whole sort of early first sort of generation of shows like Queer Eye that I didn't like because I often found they were mean and either they were mean about themselves like playing up stereotypes about queer people or whatever, people in fashion, whatever. And then also mean to the people who they were trying to change or impact. And the thing that immediately struck me when I started watching the show last night was how kind and empathetic and like how conscious everyone seems to be about making sure that they're building up self-esteem, that they're talking about self-love. And that to me was so remarkable whether you're looking at the guy who's obviously like a Trump supporter or you're looking at like this somewhat closeted black gay guy who's basically like he's just looking for like someone to say like you're beautiful and you're amazing and you don't have anything to apologize for like get out there with your beautiful body like you know. And I think to myself like there are probably so many of us who just are looking for someone to tell us that we're okay and that we deserve to feel love and deserve to feel good. And this show I mean to me seems like you know the kind of like reality show 2.0 but now better much better. It would be interesting to touch on to is the episode where at the beginning they get pulled over by the cop. Like that was ridiculous. That episode that's the only for me the big misstep so far on the show. It was wacky. It was like oh here's the five gay guys in the car and they get pulled over by a cop. And then oh wait twist the cop is like I hate it. And on it into the reality thing I'm like getting pulled over by the cops. It's not funny and it shouldn't. I felt that was I just want to say because I feel like I'm really putting a lot of praise on the show and I do really love it and I think it's great. But I think that while I appreciate that they maybe they were trying to engineer a discussion between the cops well between the guy that they were trying to transform and his friend who are cops and the one black character like I just was well character one black guy on the show. Like I was like I can almost go to this place where I understand what they might have been trying to do. But if they were authentically unaware that they were about to be pulled over I thought that was like a really bad move. I think that like the producers like that just went too far. It was like unreal. It was like unreal it was. Which I also love that show but whoa did their second season go off the rails. But like I just felt like that was the engineering of that moment was wrong. It was there could have been an easier way to have that conversation without having to make everyone so clearly uncomfortable. And also sort of lightheartedly make it seem like see cops pull over black guys and then they're joking. You know like I did. There's that weird thing where like there's been this meme of like cops pulling over people sometimes and but then it's like actually we baked you a cake because we're trying to like create good relations with cops in the community. It's like don't pull me over. How about just don't pull me over. Send me a cake. Oh my God. Yeah. Have a block party. It was just that was the one big misstep I thought and I just I wanted to just throw it out there because I thought that it sucked and it was weird because even if anyone else conversation I was gonna say the conversation did evolve over. I was like if they don't go back to that moment and discuss it. I don't even know if I'm gonna get through this episode and so I was glad they eventually touched on you know probably why that whole thing was engineered in the first place. But yeah the rest of the show I have feel has been really great has been really sensitive. They did occur to either of you when you're watching because I thought right away I was like why is there not a show like this for lesbians. Yeah I was gonna say that too. Well even thinking about the reboot now I was like where's like trans characters. Yeah. You know I'm like look I mean this is the problem with LGBTQ content though is that we always try to be everything to everyone and it's like it's okay. You're the gay. Yeah it's like it's yeah I just I just had a proper moment where I was like I think lesbians have a lot I mean there's a lot of fashion icons and a lot of really like you know well dressed and interesting lesbians and then you must think I mean like all the other categories of like health and fitness and feeling good and all the rest of it I was like yeah why can't they pull something like this together. Well it would be other. It was like instead of it trying to be like a modernized version just like what if it was like all stereotype lesbian like like they like they actually walk you back from where you know like where maybe where you are like they're like you're too modern and we can't tell that you're queer and so we've changed your we've changed your closet it's all plaid it's all work boots. We're gonna take your long hair we're gonna cut it back into the military. I want them to come and have that conversation with me because I was so much happier if I could just live back to that. Yeah that's what I thought about. No but speaking of LGBT women that is what the Tegan and Sarah Foundation is for. Yeah. Tell me a bit about how you two created it and why I guess. Well we decided in 2016 to start the Tegan and Sarah Foundation mostly to kind of elevate the activism and the you know sort of raising of funds that we already had been doing. I think because all of a sudden we were a bigger band and we had a little more visibility with our last record there was a lot of requests coming in from a pretty wide range of organizations like help us raise money for this and this and this and it was hard like we were feeling like personally a little stressed out about where to focus our energy and so anyway long story short we started the foundation and we knew we wanted to focus on funding LGBTQ organizations but we started kind of doing research and looking at the numbers and there's just a really really like intense need for money for LGBTQ organizations that research and represent and fund women's programs and youth and young girls programs and we were kind of excited by that. We were like great this is a focus for us and really ties into our audience but within a few more months it was like oh we need to even focus more and so we're really trying to not just raise money and write grants but also like create programs and have the kind of conversation that we can have because we can get in the door with some of these organizations to center women and girls specifically women of color and trans women because they're even more under researched and underfunded and it's been great. I mean it's long it's hard we joke sometimes where I'm like why did we do this it's like we took on a second full time job and there's so much to learn and you know we spent a lot of last year meeting with organizations and talking about where the issues in the community lie and we you know we're not raising millions and millions of dollars right now so we're really having to use our skills as indie musicians to stretch a dollar and we're trying to fund raise and. And you fund raised on the you have your recent tour for the 10th anniversary of the con and it seems like people really your fans really donate it and came out. Oh yeah. As soon as we get creative and find places like that to raise funds the money comes in. We just have to keep being creative. Sarah just to keep coming up with creative ways for us to. But people love it people feel engaged and we're not trying to raise thousands of dollars from each person. We're really encouraging our audience to give a dollar or five dollars especially women in our community we tend not to give as much and I think there's a lot of need in the community right now and I think we get scared that that five dollars isn't going to do much but we're fundraising for organizations that five thousand dollars is like their entire budget for the year you know and we can really make a difference. So I hope our community hears our call and also that men in our community you know women have been the backbone of a lot of the you know LGBTQ issues that centered around men for decades now and like just because our organization is centering women and girls doesn't mean that a lot of these organizations don't have programs that support men or that the center doesn't support men and so I hope men will step up as well and it doesn't have to be for our organization just that they get involved in something other than step up to the streets. Step up 3D. Step up revolution. All of the step ups. Tell people how they can donate and get involved. Sure yeah the Tegan and Sarah foundation.org is where we exist as a website and you know the goal actually for us is to start making it easier to donate just I mean websites sometimes I say a website to someone and you can see that they're like oh yeah websites how do those work again. So we're trying to figure out. They're like the Apple computer what's a computer or commercial computer it's it's it's like you have an app or something. They're like why can't you just do it yourself go to my bank. So yeah we're figuring out and also engagement like Tegan was saying there are you know we've really centered community organizations who are doing fantastic work they just need to be amplified we just want to connect the dots for people there are they take the money and they turn around they do something with right away like yeah like a lot of the organizations we initially wrote grants to they were doing simple things like there was an organization in Florida where we donated and they were buying bus passes because a lot of times these places exist they have great resources how do you get there you know what is the barrier that prevents the queer community from finding and accessing the resources. So some of our grant writing right now is very small but it's extremely direct it's like you gave us a dollar that dollar went towards a bus pass and someone got to go and get counseling at an inner city organization. So and then some of the stuff that we're going to be doing over the next couple of years is more sort of like bigger programming and some of our research has led us to a place where we can see that there are gaps there is sort of like resources missing in the community and we'll try to use the skills that we've built as a band to hopefully push that messaging out through some of our social media both as the foundation and as the band. So we're really excited it's all. For now though just go to the website. Yeah the website yeah or my mom signed up she gives monthly. Yeah she does give monthly. Yeah. And she's donating a lot of tunies and loonies. Okay. Yeah you can get you can get involved but it's really I think the good thing that we learned from the contour is that people want to be engaged and they want to be excited and as if we can make the connection shorter between how to get involved and how to do the work people seem to get really excited. Great. Well I want to thank you both for being here today. Thank you so much for having us. Yes. So glad by this wide range of topics we covered. We covered everything that's what we do I'll keep it. Makes me so happy. I'd like to thank Tegan and Sarah and Cara and Lewis and of course tune in and South by Southwest for having us this week. This has been Keep It. We'll be back next week."
