    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, Joe Biden makes some questionable remarks about Vladimir Putin and Hollywood privilege now apparently includes being able to assault people. We've got all that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez. Happy Monday. I am joined today by my good friends, Chad Prather. Keep your name out of your infant mouth. I just keep my name out of your infant mouth. But I'm just trying to introduce you. How do I do that if I can't say your name? Don't say my name. Chad Prather, it's going to be an interesting show. Keep everybody's name out. Your name, my name. Really hard to do. My wife's name, whoever, joined also. Can I say your name? You may say my name. Matthew Martin's name. Matthew Martin. Of course, are that can I, today I'm introducing you as our Hollywood expert. Oh, okay. Don't be hating. I know it's like our Hollywood expert. But we love him. He's ex-Hollywood, but he still knows enough to be able to give us, I think, some very fascinating analysis on what happened last night at the Oscars. But first, I want to get into what happened over the weekend with our dementia patient in chief. This was Saturday, Joe Biden delivering a speech in Poland. He's trying to, rally the NATO allies to stand against the Russian invasion taking place in Ukraine. A very, very weird moment. I want to play Joe Biden. This is at the end of his speech. And he's like, hey, by the way, this guy can't remain in power, guys. Watch. Ukraine will never be a victory for Russia, for free people refused to live in a world of hopelessness and darkness. We will have a different future, a brighter future rooted in democracy and friends, open light of decency and dignity of freedom and possibilities for God's sake. This man cannot remain power. Weird way to end. Well, first of all, it was a word salad that none of it made sense. Did you start throwing out your vision for the world of peace and tranquility? And, you know, all that stuff. And then end with a regime change. Right. Okay. Right. We're going to have peace and drink quality by God, this guy can't stay in power. Do you have much in the telecoms to go in? Yeah. Well, I mean, right. And that was what I was going to ask you guys. There's no way that that was on script. It was thrown in at the end. And I mean, poor Joe has so much of a hard time anyway, just reading the prompt. I don't know how he managed to, you know, speak any coherent sentences off-prompter. But this is definitely probably not the one you want him to be going off script. I have a theory. I have a theory that there's like half a dozen cryogenic bubbles. They keep it on Air Force One and every one of them has a different Joe Biden in it and they just pop one out. And the coherence is going the ability to understand what he's saying depends on how warm and thought out it is. Like it hasn't been out of the bubble long enough. I'm afraid one of those cold Joe's is going to get us into another Cold War or World War Three. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I know. I just, every time I see him talk, I sit there and I go, it's kind of like, you know, when you watch an ass car, you're like, is it? You don't know what they didn't crush. They didn't crush. Yeah. That's what I feel like when I watch him genuinely, I don't, it is a sad thing that the leader of the free world is clearly challenged. I mean, in all seriousness, right? I mean, you know, we joke about it, but there's millions and millions of billions of people around the world looking to us, looking to America. And they're like, is that the best you have? Right. I mean, is that it? Right. Right. Unfortunately, it is. We're in a bad situation. I told people on my show, I said, you know, just go ahead and get Jesus, get Jesus in your life. Because we're in a bad situation here. I mean, this could be it for all of you. I just said to my friend yesterday, I said, no, it's actually today coming in. I was like, do you know that phrase? You all need Jesus? Yeah. I said, there's a reason why that phrase came out, right? It's true. I mean, we're really looking. Yeah. I mean, this could, this could really help us realize our mortality here. He's going to gaff us into World War three. Somebody's got to get him under control. In all seriousness, look, Anthony Blinken is going to come out and try to walk it back. He already did. He did that. And then, of course, Mike Morrell, who's a former director of the CIA, said this was an unforced error. We've got a quick given this guy excuses and hold him accountable. This isn't a President Trump phone call with the linsky about Biden crimes and the Biden family. This is stuff that's going to get us into a global scale war if he's not careful. You know, talking about, well, they won't let me go over into Ukraine. No, no, typically, we don't let the President walk across the border into war-torn countries that are being invaded. That is typically the rule of thumb for our policy. Right. Right. So you mentioned Blinken. He did. He already walked it back. But there was also a White House official that said that, look, Biden was not discussing Putin's power in Russia or regime change. He was actually just saying Putin can't be allowed to exercise power over his neighbors in the region. It's like, no, that's not what he said at all. We all heard it. No, this isn't even. This is his bet. This was the other day when Kamala Harris referred to Ukraine being a member of NATO. Right. You know, our multiple times. Our NATO allies. And then he went back in a deleted or tweet and added in our NATO allies. This is the vice president of the United States referring to Ukraine being a member of NATO. This is some parts of the world. They want to kick your ass for stuff like that. Well, so I want to throw into the equation here because it's not the first time that Joe Biden has said said something that you're like, oh, this is not the guy we want running our country when there is the potential for a World War III. He had actually went on Friday and talked to US troops that were stationed in Poland. And he said that when they were in Ukraine, he said, you're going to see when you're there. And some of you have been there, you're going to see you're going to see women, young people standing in the middle of a tank. You know, I mean, he's implying to these troops that we are going to be deploying them into Ukraine. Here's some of that. Watch. Now, with the Ukrainian people, Ukrainian people have a lot of backbone. They have a lot of guts. And I'm sure you're observing it. And I don't mean just a military, which is we've been trained in sense back when Russia moved into the southeast, southeast, Ukraine. But also the average citizen. Look at how they're stepping up. Good. How they're stepping up. And you're going to see when you're there. And you've got to see women, young people standing in the middle of a front of a damn tank. It's just saying, I'm not leaving. I'm holding my ground. They're incredible. But they take a lot of inspiration from us. And you know, a woman who just died in the Secretary of State used to have an expression. She said, we are the essential nation. It sounds like a bit of hyperbole, but the truth the matter is you are the organizing principle around which the rest of the world is the free world is moving. So again, just not what you want to see in your leader when there is the potential for world war. He can't even get out sentences without having to take in a deep breath. You can tell he's very winded just by standing there talking and also telling American troops that they are going to be deployed to Ukraine. Even though by the way, the White House right right afterwards is like, no, we're not actually no, no, no, we're not changing our stance. We're not we're not deploying military. It's like, then why is the president saying? Well, as well, you also have a complicit media, right? Because when Trump said something, little Rocket Man, okay, when he said something, they were like, they were like, he absolutely means it. The most of us looking at it was like, listen, the dudes in the Goshator, right, he goes here and then you get about there. And it works, right? And so nobody on the right was like ever believed that Trump meant what he what he was saying in those negotiations. But everyone said on the on the left, they absolutely truly means it. You mean, and then once your button says it over and over and over again, oh, that's all I know. And you're like, yeah, what is it? They know, they, you know what, it's funny. I wouldn't be surprised if they blamed that on his stutter because they seem to blame everything else on his stutter. It has like nothing to do with the stuff and they're like, no, it's just how dare you. He has a stutter. Don't you know that, Chad? Well, how heartless. Listen, Vladimir Putin's not corn pop. Okay, you can't go confront him in the parking lot. Scranton Joe, lunch pale Joe, big tough talking Joe, right here, Jack. That's his attitude towards everything, though. But again, he's a dementia patient. So you're going to get some of that anger issue. And you're right, whenever, like if I go on Twitter and I say something stupid, it happens. And somebody comes at me and I'm like, well, I'm just kidding. You can't say that. Right. You can't say, well, I'm just joking or I misspoke or something like, no, the cancel culture's out there. That spirit is going to hold your feet to the fire. Like, no, but they do this over and over again with Joe Biden. He can get away with every gaff in the world. It doesn't matter what he says. Right. So here we are in a situation with a guy you don't know what he's about to say. Well, if you don't know what he's about to say, you don't know what he's about to do. That's the scary part. Because his actions, I mean, hopefully somebody's putting him back in that cryogenic bubble and keeping his hands off the trigger because this guy might decide to, you know, roll a, what is it, a length of chain up around his arm and go out there and mess with corn pop and who ran a group of bad boys? Well, to be fair, I do think he, he seems like he probably takes a lot of naps. So I feel like he's probably just spending most of his time napping drinks and ensuring it tend to and for and he's a bit of a six. No question about it. Six is late, I think. And senior specials at 430 in case he goes out to eat. I want to tell you, can I also say before you go to that, please, please, I do want to regime change. I want this regime in the in the so-called United States of America. I want it gone. Yeah. All right. So let me go on record water. Regardless of what he walks back about Putin, I ain't walking it back about Biden. And you know what, here's another thing like we tend to look at it from our perspective, right? And they're like the West perspective. But you've had years and years and years and years of them saying that Russia, you know, we what they did, they were involved in this and they did that and this is Russian dish information for for hunters laptop and Russia, this Russia, that and there they go in. We had nothing to do with that actually. That was a fella. So if you've heard that over and over again, like we're not looking at it how it looks from the other side. It's a very, you know, myopic view. Yeah. And we have to stop and say, after all these things have been said for years and years and years and years, I mean, it is years now. I mean, when did that when did all that scandal first come out? It's about three years ago, four years ago. Yeah. Right. And now the collusion. Yeah. That's 2016. And then there was Hunter's laptop that was. Yeah. So the collusion and Hunter's laptop. And now he's saying this stuff. If you're the bad guys, you're going to look and go, well, there's a line of, yeah, they're saying this about us. They say, oh, they finally got in power. Oh, and now he's saying this. Yeah. I mean, I would say like what what Putin is doing is not right. Right. We know that. But we really, there was a time when we had to really be careful about what we said on the world stage, because guess what? They've got nuclear weapons, you know, and they take it seriously. Yeah. I mean, I hope they don't take it seriously. Where are we on time? You're fine. All right. So here's the thing. Russia can't do a long drawn out war. They don't have the budget for it. Right. They can't finance a long drawn out where he can't even finance a long drawn out occupation of Ukraine. If Ukraine keeps putting up resistance, they can't do you do that. So guess what? Their last cause of action, or their last recourse of action, we got to push a button. Yeah. They got to use what they have on the arsenal. So shut up, Joe. Please, please, please, shut up, Joe. We saw how you handled the pull out of Afghanistan. Like we don't please don't get us involved in it. Which is a reason where we are today. Yeah. Putin saw that. Yeah. Now here we are. Yeah. Yeah. That's a great point. I want to get into one of the more nefarious issues when it comes to Joe Biden talking about all of this, what's going on with Russia and Ukraine, which is the push towards green energy and kind of using this as the springboard for that. Let me go ahead and do that after the break. First, we want to thank our sponsor, Omega XL. So if you just live in constant pain, maybe you have arthritis, maybe you have knee pain, maybe you've gotten in a car accident like I did several years ago, and it just messed up your discs in your back and it just you're just living in pain. What you may not realize is the likely cause of that pain is the actual inflammation in your body. And if you're not defeating the inflammation, you're going to continue to have pain. You might have things that just mask it right like a topical cream that you rub on for 10 minutes and it feels really good for the 10 minutes. And then you're back in pain again. Don't do that. Use Omega XL. It is backed by 35 years of clinical research and it actually attacks the inflammation that is causing your pain. It goes to the root cause of the problem and it's going to neutralize it. It is made from the pristine waters of New Zealand. It is a fatty acid combination. So a lot of you men out there, I'm just going to be sexist. A lot of you men out there are going to think that it doesn't work. It's natural. It doesn't work. That's messed up. You guys would be wrong. You're not a biologist. Yeah. I'm not a biologist. What do I know? Why did you look at us and say men? Wow. You guys, you men would be wrong. Okay. And I think maybe the last two years, if it's taught us something, don't always put your stock in pharmaceuticals. You got to go for the natural stuff every once in a while and you need to with Omega XL. It will get you out of pain. It can be life changing. You can go to omega XL dot com slash news. If you order now, you will get a second bottle for free. That is omega XL dot com slash news. Before we move into what happened at the Oscars last night, which I know a lot of you are going to be like, oh, you didn't chat has no idea what happened. But I know a lot of you are going to be like, that's not important. But I think it is. So stick with us on that. I first want to get into just wrapping up the Joe Biden speech in Poland. It's just fascinating to watch them use all of these things that are happening in the world to further push their agenda in any way possible. Because Joe Biden in the same speech in Poland mentions again, you know, for the safety of our nation, we really need to move as quickly as possible towards renewable energy watch. As a matter of economic security and national security for the survivability of the planet, we all need to move as quickly as possible clean renewable energy. And we'll work together to help get that done. Yeah, I mean, it's that Putin price height. I mean, that right there is why I have a hard time taking any of this seriously. I feel for the civilians again, the people who are caught in the middle of this game that's going on. But it is a game. You're going to sit there. You're on the verge of this major, major global disaster that's going on in Europe right now. And you're going to talk about renewable energy. Yeah, it does seem very sinister. Don't do it. It almost makes me think that everything we see these days, there's something else underneath or behind it. Really? It's just a hunch. Got your next story. Let me get you a medal. I'm kidding. I'm a pro American. Let Matt talk. No, I mean, again, it's his thing is it because when I speak, it sounds very, very intelligent. It really does. It's not a TV. It's actually a legitimately I just love listening to you. I'm dumb as a boxer. No, it's tough. No, he's not. But I want to have sex with him. Play cards, right? So here's my thing. Nobody that was in power when they did the lockdowns lost their job. Their lives weren't affected at all. They could all afford to pay for the hikes and get the toilet paper, whatever it was they needed. They weren't affected at all. Same thing with this, right? They are hiking up all the prices on things. There's no gas shortage when we're sitting on more gas than any other country in the world. And the little people again, and screwed, they don't care. This is the difference is what I don't understand, voters think that these people give a damn about them. They just don't care. And I wish that people would see that when they make comments like this. Because what we should, what he should be thinking of is, let's just say, okay, he's talking about Russia, whatever. Why does it seem like they care about everyone else but Americans? And the people that Americans, the Americans that would normally vote for them, which is working class blue collar people, they don't care. They have never cared since I've out my eyes to it politically because I'm from a working class background, even though I'm in an industry that's mainly... You're an elite. Yeah, of course I am. No, but it's true. I mean, they just don't care. And they're completely divorced from reality. And I think that people really need to get a grip because they... It's like, you know when people think they know you, when you're on TV, they think they know you, so they'll come up and talk to you like they know you. But they don't really know you. And you distance from them. It's on a huge scale when you get to politics, right? It's the present in United States, but he's been in Senate for how long? And he just doesn't... The corn pop thing's a classic example. It's utter... Yeah. It's going to swear. I didn't swear. It's swear. But... The netting's swear in Britain. Yeah, there you go. It's an oral mushroom. And he thinks it's relatable, but it's not. It's not a relatable thing. They talk about things they think are relatable, but they're not. It's like the PR people come and say, hey, listen, this is really relatable talk about it. Yeah, and they go, well, just buy a Tesla if you don't like gas prices. Yeah, like get an electric car. The average American can't just drop what they're doing and go buy a Tesla. Yeah, no, I totally agree. Let me... I want to switch gears here to what happened last night at the Oscars. Very strange scene. Chris Rock... I did... Was Chris Rock hosting the whole thing? You guys know? No, I don't know. Okay, so he was... One of the pikes was the host. Okay, so he was just like... He was just presenting something and made a joke about Jada Pinkett Smith's lack of hair. She shaved her head. Apparently, the story is that she has alopecia. And so she decided to just go ahead and shave her head because she was struggling with alopecia. Made a joke on stage and then a very awkward moment transpired. I can't wait to get gentlemen your takes on this, but let's watch that moment. Jada, I love you. Jai Jain 2 can't wait to see it. All right? That was a nice one. Okay, I'm out here. Uh oh, Richard. Uh oh. Will Smith incoming. Oh wow. Wow. So he goes on to say, Will Smith just smacked the out of me at which point Will Smith is seated at this point again and says, well, what Chad said at the beginning of the show? He's my wife's name, ouchy-f and mouth. Like very... He was very tense. He says it twice. It's very tense. It feels very raw. Very much like an actor would. That's what I was going to say. These are actors. They're supposed to be the best of the best. Some might say some of them aren't, but I think it's interesting because I think you guys, I think you guys differ on this. Matt, I think you were supposed to be on the program later this week, but I was like, I need you on today because this was your world. Yeah. You say that was real. 100% real. Why? There's multiple reasons. I mean, firstly, I look at why would they stage this? Like this is, it used to be the pinnacle for actors. I don't think people see it like that anymore. People around the world used to look and say, I mean, I grew up thinking, you know, one day I want to, that's where I want to be. The pinnacle is when it went in in Oscar. So if that's the case, why when you're nominated for an Oscar, would you sit down, imagine sitting down and going, hey, listen, what I'm going to do is I want to come on, I'm going to slap you. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. Yeah. And you're going to go like this, and then I'm going to walk back and then I'm going to yell at you. It just doesn't make sense. This is from a guy that doesn't swear in his rapping. Right. So that's the first thing for me. It just doesn't make sense. And it pulls up all a lot of unpleasant stuff about him and his relationship with his wife. And then how does it make Chris Rock look? Some people are like, well, you should have shouldn't have said it. But he's a comedian, you know, it's a comedian. That's what you do. You live on the edge. You know, I mean, God forbid, Ricky Gervais was there. Exactly. I mean, everyone would have been running up and hitting the stage. But also people saying, no, it was a stage slap. I'm like, okay, that's not how it's done. Right. When you're throwing a punch for television or for movies, you can be a foot away from the person. In fact, they want you to be far away from the person, because even in those situations, your adrenaline runs a little bit. And you can strike the person. I actually knock someone out doing that because that wasn't my fault. The stunt guy was going, no, get closer, closer, closer. And I was like, I don't want to do it because it was dark. And I actually rang his bell. I actually just similar to that. I hit him like that. And the guy went down and dropped like stack potatoes. But there's no reason for them to, they could stage it so that it was nowhere near Chris. And think about it. Like normally you would have gone down. What I think happened was he said something, it's one of those weird things, right? Like, when you're in a car accident, you're like, some people behave differently. They behave oddly. They don't like go, you know, some people laugh like you hear a lot of people in war. They go, well, they laughed all the way through the firefight, right? When really they were really hyped up. So I think he, something happened because Will was laughing. I think he was like, hang on a minute. And he goes up. Yeah. And so this is the screen, a still of Will laughing. Jada's rolling her eyes, but Will's laughing at the joke. Yeah, I think it, but I think it was a little bit like, oh, he just made a joke about that. Well, hang on a minute. Now we don't see, this is the odd thing. We don't see the other shot. Then he gets up and he walks up and Chris Rock has still got his hands behind his back. Right now, people like, well, why did you do that? Well, imagine if Will Smith was joking, he thought Will Smith was joking. We went like that and Chris Rock went like that. It looked like a complete, it looked lame. So he's just standing there like that, boom, and that slap smack. He goes down. And if you watch after that, he said, you know, Will Smith just smack the crap out of me. And then he goes, Will Smith says what he says, which is, I was a dilated, he's got his chin up. He's like, he's all hyped up. And then Chris Rock says, I could, no, I won't. It's super fast. But if you listen to it, he was going to come back. And you know, as comedians, they normally go, well, I could say this about, I mean, he could have taken him Chris Rock and the jokes written in Will Smith's follow through. That's how fast his brain was working. Especially when he's on. Yeah, yeah, probably. But it was awkward because he was, he did say like, okay, because he says keep my wife's name out of your mouth. I'm going to. Yeah. I'm going to just, it was all weird. It was all weird. Chris Rock already has a new hour of material written. But where's the release from the, from the agents? Right. Nothing. And the thing is, let me tell you guys, the day after Oscars, people do not come until about 12 o'clock into the agencies, right? So, and then normally if it was a setup like that, he would have been partying with Chris Rock afterwards, like, oh, yeah. And there was none of that. You didn't see any of that. They just went, yeah, it just didn't smell right to me. So Chad, I want to get your take on that incident. And then I want to take a break. And then we can kind of, I want to get into why I think it's relevant, not just, oh, let's talk about the Oscars. But I think that there's a, there's a particular part of it that I'd like to, that I'd like to get into. But Chad, what was your, you don't, you think it was fake? I will say, well, no, not necessarily. Okay. I said, I was sitting, I was watching it live. I didn't want to be. Hi. But I was at a hotel sitting in a restaurant, I was sitting at the bar. Someone was holding a gun to your head. I was sitting there and I had asked him, I said, could you change the channel from the Oscars? And they said, no, some other people are watching it. And I said, sound was down. And then I look up and I see this thing going down. I was like, that was real. I understand television delay. So I know that Chris Rock standing there and I was like, well, either the screen froze or, and then there's a clip right in the middle. It is almost like they cut some of the awkward pause out and did an edit on the fly. So there's usually about a 42nd delay in a live thing, maybe not quite that long for that. But I don't know, they do a little bit of a clip right there. And he's still there. And there's the altercation, of course, as the whole thing's been pulled down, it's been silenced, it's been bleeped out. Of course, we know now what's said. It definitely wasn't staged by Chris Rock. He didn't know he was about to get smacked. I think we'll pull the slap a little bit. Okay. I agree with Matt on this in that these were real emotions that were going on. And Chris Rock's come at J to Pinkett Smith before back in 2016 when he said she wasn't invited to the Oscars, just like I ain't invited into Rihanna's panties. So he compared her to Rihanna's panties, because she was snubbing the Oscars because Will didn't get anyway, didn't get it. So I think there's some stuff that's going on there, but I'll go deeper into what I think was going on the week after we take a look. Okay, all right, perfect. All right, so then, so then let's think our sponsor Grove Collaborative.

That is grove.com slash news. Getting back into what happened at the Oscars. I want to play for you. So just, let's fast forward a little bit. For those, I know you guys, if you're watching this program, you didn't watch the Oscars probably. So let me just tell you, if you didn't already hear, Will Smith ended up going on to win an award for, it was Best Actor, right? Which I think is very sexist and wrong that they actually have categories, Best Actor and Best Actress now, because I'm told that saying that any gendered award is wrong. But he won Best Actor. He got up. He cried. He said he was sorry. It was like a very weird speech, emotional speech. And then after he allegedly, right, we're supposed to believe that he committed assault on someone. So he commits assault. He's very sorry for it. And then later on in the night, there's a video of him just like dancing and having a grand old time watch. Singing his awful, awful, awful song. That it's like, why would you want to relive that song? It was horrible. Why are you singing to it again? Cuba Gooding did a handstand. No. What he won is Oscar. Yeah. That's terrible. You're just rapping to your horrible song. But it is interesting because it's like, what kind of privilege and elitism is that that you commit assault live on television? It's obviously recorded and you then go on to win the most important award in your particular profession. And you're just like, everything's totally fine later. You just get to party and celebrate with your friend. Assault is so fun and so cool. You get rewarded for it in Hollywood, I guess. I don't know. It's just was weird. It was a mostly peaceful Oscar ceremony. Mostly. Mostly peaceful. Mostly gentle slap. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So here's why that matters. First of all, it was assault. Okay. Let's say Matt's right. And it was real. It's a song. Yeah. It's real. Okay. So if it's fake, you have to come out and say it's fake. You have to. Because otherwise, he broke the law. He assaulted another man. So it then and his black on black crumb. So go one step further. They say, well, Chris Rock didn't press charges. It's not up to the victim to determine whether or not you broke the law. Okay. If someone car jacks me and shoots me in the head, I'm not there to press charges. That person still gets arrested. Right. So this is this is a one of those call it a travesty of justice, whatever you want to call it. This is one of the situations where you see the elites, which by the way, nobody's wearing masks. If you didn't, there were maybe three people in the whole room wearing masks and nobody was socially distancing. Judy Deitch, Judy Deitch, she 900 years old. I'm like, you don't carry anything about grandma. Breathe that all over that old lady. But this is a thing where the elites get to do exactly what they want to do, including slap somebody on public in like global television with Japanese subtitles. Right. And everyone's just like, Oh, wow, cool. They're signing for Coda. They did it every he slapped that up. Sorry, in every language. So well, here's the thing though, they have a problem. And this is what the problem is. You can go and smash a store up and loot it and not be prosecuted. Then you're going to go and prosecute an actor for slapping a guy on stage. So you imagine if you're the store owner, Will Smith gets arrested, which he should have done. Right? He should have. And yet your store has been looted thousands and thousands of dollars. Maybe someone's got hurt. People are getting, you know, people are getting hit all the time. We've seen all those, you know, those assaults and nobody's getting prosecuted for it. You're going to be there going, hang on a minute. Right. So we'll also hold on. So I have a question about that. So do you think it was, what is it? Was it the Hollywood elitism that got him off? Was it that he just, he aligns with the right people? And that's okay. So like, so if you're, if you're part of the social justice mindset, whether you are looters and rioters or your Hollywood elitists, you're going to get let off. It's all the above. I mean, we've seen over and over and over again with people in Hollywood. Right. Seriously. Yeah. No, look at Jesse Swellitt. Right. The only thing missing from this attack is actually somebody else did it. And nobody screamed, this is Maga Country. Right. I mean, Chris Rock got beat up worse than Jesse Swellitt, whether it was fake or not. Yeah. Because, you know, but, but look, okay, biotech is the COVID-19 shot partner with Pfizer. So Pfizer was the sponsor of the Oscars. Of course they were. I'll go down a little conspiracy trail with you. Of course they were. Pfizer is currently in the third phase, the 2B slash third phase of a clinical drug for alopecia. What in the world can get everybody talking about alopecia? Because nobody's talking about alopecia. Suddenly the whole world's talking about alopecia today. Pfizer is coming out with an alopecia drug. They sponsored the Oscars. So if I was going to drive it the whole setup thing, I would say, okay, maybe there's an angle there. But at the end of the day, what really matters is the fact that somebody broke the law and got away with it right in front of everybody. So that tells you that on the world stage, I don't care if it's Hunter Biden, Hillary Clinton, whoever you want to list off, we know that the elites can break the law. There's no consequences for them. Yeah. Yeah. It is really disgusting. Okay. I want to switch gears here and go to over to Florida where Governor Ron DeSantis has signed the state's parental rights in education legislation. He made an interesting statement on I just kind of love this man so much. He's like, I don't give a crap what any of these woke corporations say about any of this. I'm doing what I know is right for parents. Watch this. We will continue to recognize that in the state of Florida, parents have a fundamental role in the education, health care and well-being of their children. We will not move from that. I don't care what corporate media outlets say. I don't care what Hollywood says. I don't care what big corporations say. Here I stand. I'm not backing down. I love it. I love it so much. So there it is. Ron DeSantis signing this, what all of the left would say is, don't say gay bill. Which by the way, I did see another clip from the Oscars. Well, Juan DeSantis and Amy Schumer came out and said, this is going to be a gay night based off of the Florida bill. So this is going to be a gay night, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, gay, and based off of Will Smith's slap, it's pretty gay. Well, look, I just see Ron DeSantis coming out and saying what every regular folk in America and mainly across the world thinks is like, I ever say, and what my kids do. I mean, like, why is this controversial? I don't get it. I really don't. Isn't it sad? It's crazy. And when you say, well, actually, I think that I should be the one that teaches my kids about sex. Amazing. No, but you know what they'll tell you, Matt? You know what they'll tell you? They'll say, but your kids should have access to it if it's in literature. And then it's your job as a parent to talk to them about what they've already been exposed to by someone else. Yeah. I can't see. That's legitimately what they- I cannot see what goes wrong in that. I cannot see what could go wrong in that. Right. Right. So it's like- literature, what do you mean? Well, oh, oh, they mean whatever is in print. Yeah, what? Literally whatever is in print is what they would tell you because they don't recognize that children's brains are not equipped to handle that kind of information. It's just like, well, no, they're going to get exposed to it in the real world. You just have to explain it to them. Tonight's episode of my show, we have Adam Golett who's coming on from accuracyandmedia, aim.org. They have exposed footage of educators who are basically saying, we're going to take we're going to take these things where they're CRT, SEL, sex ed, whatever. We're just going to rebrand it. They're actually calling on camera and saying, well, now we're calling it mental health. Now we're calling it advocacy classes, all whatever the ones- and you need to watch that show tonight. It is powerful what Adam has to say. It's on right after this program. Yes, it is. So make sure to tune into that. But yeah, just really, really disgusting, really glad that Rhonda Santis is standing up to all of the leftist indoctrination into your kids. All right, let's go ahead and take a break. We'll be right back. So speaking of all of the leftists who want to indoctrinate your children within that move is this weird trans movement where people are pretending like men can turn into women. But now that's not all because we're reading things like this tweet that went viral that said, okay, I'm a trans woman who's experiencing her first period cramps. And what the f? I have literally never felt pain like this. Why do we let people live like this? I have questions, but I think the biggest one is like, I hope you get to a doctor. Will you please go see a doctor? Because those are not period cramps. You don't have a uterus. You probably should be seen. Also, where are you bleeding from? Yeah, I mean, you don't have a uterine wall to cleanse the lining. So I don't know. I mean, that's called IBS. Is that where it's coming out? I don't know. You need laxatives is what you need. Maybe you have a lot of s? Crohn's disease or an appendicitis. I don't know what's going on. But you definitely need to go see a doctor. Like if you're legitimately hurting, you might have some form of cancer. Yeah, you need to go to a doctor. That's right. There's a thing that might be, yeah. This is this this warrior stuff is like, yeah, guess what? You might have a real problem going on. Are you wait a second? Are you saying that someone who would say that they are a different gender may need mental help? You know, they know it. They might not want to admit it. They know it. They just don't know where to go get it. Right. Well, they're going to go get it. And they have the wrong knee body. I think you want to normalize all this stuff to the point of saying, Oh, no, it's perfect. You're fine. You're fine. No, you're not fine. And you wind up, if not, you don't kill yourself statistically, you may. You're going to get yourself killed. Because you're going to ignore something that biologically is unique to you or not unique to you that you're saying is right. Right. Yeah. So Matt, I'm I make the obvious, you know, statement that this person is not like that's not menstrual cramps that you're experiencing. And I'm called things like a transphobe. I mean, what are you going to say? I mean, I just I got nothing. I'm already saying you say something, but are you afraid of trans people? I am. I'm really scared. I'm afraid of a man who dresses up like a girl. Well, it's like a rack of nephobia. You have an irrational fear of this. Yeah. Words don't mean anything. No, this is, it drives me crazy. You're you're a transphobe. You're a, you know, all these, you know, homophobe. What does that mean? I'm scared of gay people. Like, I said, they're going to. I'm a xenophobe. I'm a xenophobe. Therefore, I'm scared of him. For I'm scared of him because he's a giant physical man. I've seen him kill people in movies. I know that's true, by the way. It's all true. It's all true. I did all of it. Reality by what you see. I listen, I'm watching this show the other day. I'm why I'm snowed into the house, right? Two days of ice in Texas, and I'm watching, I'm watching Reacher. And all of a sudden I hit Paul's and I go. Matt goes, Hey, mate. You're on my TV. I'm like, you guys are you watching Reacher? Yeah. I was like, my man's still on it, baby. But here's the thing though, it's like, I don't understand these phrases, right? Like, I don't understand climate denier. Right. No, there is not a climate. Right. Right. Vaccine denied. No, no vaccine. There is no such thing as the vaccine. I'm like, just why do we keep allowing people to take their narrative and say things that don't make any sense? It's really, really dangerous. And they've got it locked down. The left does it lock down. They do. Climate denier. It's like Holocaust denier. Right. They clearly put those two things together. And like I said, do we deny there's a climate? I don't know. There's a climate. There is a climate. I'm not denying there's a climate. What does it mean? Well, I mean, they have been very smart. I mean, it's very cunning to try to use that kind of messaging because it just on the surface, it makes you sound bad. There's a negative connotation. It's just like banning books. It's like going back to the to the parental rights bill. People are like, well, you're banning books by not wanting pornographic literature in kids libraries. And it's like, no one's banning a book. Like you're allowed to go buy the book. I just don't want it accessible to my kid in their school. That's not banning books, right? You're not you're not allowing free speech by not allowing kids to read that stuff. It's like, that's not what any of these terms mean, but they've co-opted all of them. Yeah. I mean, but look what Chad just said there to that tweet. It's like, hey, listen, you need to go and see a doctor because you're in pain. Right. There might be something wrong. That's actually really good advice, right? That's objective advice. Like you have the pain. You should go see a doctor, but yet you'll be called a name for it. And you'll be said that you don't care because I know everything like, well, I was says, my kids would love to eat ice cream every day of the week all day. But I'm not being a mean dad by saying no, you have to actually eat vegetables because they're good for you. It doesn't mean I'm like a child for whatever it might be. There's this weird perception that you have to agree with everything. Make every like you say something. So it has to be true. Like the worst phrase ever in the history of the world is my truth. My truth is right. My truth is the most damaging thing ever. That's a really great point. That's actually a great point to end on. All right. We because we got to take a break, we'll be right back. That is a I know. Hey, driving up. Hey, don't forget to go wherever you find your audio podcast. You got to subscribe, rate and review the news and why it matters.
