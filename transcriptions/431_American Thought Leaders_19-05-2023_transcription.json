New York Post columnist Carol Markowitz was a self-described New York supremacist, having spent all of her life in the Big Apple. But she uprooted her family to Florida after the coronavirus pandemic opened her eyes to what she saw were Soviet patterns across American culture. I saw very clearly for the first time that even free people can act like authoritarians and turn on their neighbors at a moment's notice. She's the co-author with Bethany Mandel of Stolen Youth, how radicals are erasing innocence and indoctrinating a generation. The woke are a very small segment of the population and yet they're able to control so much and they do that through this forced conformity. When we treat kids like little adults, we instill all of our problems and issues on them and that really does mess them up going forward. This is American Thought Leaders and I'm Janja Kellick. Carol Markowitz, such a pleasure to have you on American Thought Leaders. Thank you so much for having me. I've been really enjoying reading your book as I've done a lot of interviews related to woke ideology, to gender affirming care as it's called around COVID, just disastrous COVID policy. I've been thinking a lot about how I'm seeing similar themes and you put it all together in a book for me, which I really appreciate. Tell me a little bit about how you saw first, how all these things are related. It was definitely COVID that opened my eyes to a lot of what was going on and I started to see patterns across our culture that I thought were part of a larger cultural revolution that I think is happening in the United States. Things like during COVID, you weren't allowed to speak and say what you really thought and you had to conceal your actual opinion lest you be shunned by your community or your neighbors or worse. You could be fired from your job, etc. It reminded me very much of the stories I had heard from my family. I was born in the Soviet Union and the stories that I had heard from my parents, from my grandmother, suddenly resonated in a way that they never had before. I recognized things that were going on in American culture that I felt were very similar to those Soviet stories. While I had always sort of dismissed the idea that any part of American culture could be Soviet, I saw very clearly for the first time that even free people can act like authoritarians and turn on their neighbors at a moment's notice. So my co-author Bethany Mandel and I started throwing around stories that we were hearing. We didn't have an overarching theme necessarily other than bad things are being done to children and we need to say something about it. Original title of our book was Keep Your Village Off Our Children. That was like what we when we were writing it, what we were thinking. And we just saw that COVID had exposed so many different ways that kids were being targeted for indoctrination and we're just treated so poorly in our society that we felt like we had to say on the one hand, right, there's this whole idea that children are little adults that they should be you know taught about all sorts of what typically would be thought of as very adult things as early as possible. Basically that that kind of in all boundaries should be removed. At the same time during COVID, right, it was the children that were subjected to the most harsh restrictions and the greatest boundaries. I mean there's and I subscribe to this idea from Scott Atlas that they were that adults use children as shields for themselves, right, and what a horrific idea, right. So how do we square these two things, right? Well that's the problem here is that adults use children for their own purposes. I don't know that they use them for shields, right. I mean I don't think did the adults think that the kids were particularly dangerous? I'm not sure that they did. It's just that the kids were easier to control and that's the whole problem with this ideological push at children is that kids are much easier to persuade than a full grown adult who has their own ideas and concepts and thoughts. If you start the indoctrination early, you can ideologically capture most children. You can feed them ideas throughout their schooling and make them believe what you want them to believe. And I think that what Americans might not realize is that this has been done many times in the past. It's not a unique thing that's happening right now. The only unique part is that it's happening in a free country where you get to hear about it as it's happening. I think in a lot of the places where these revolutions have taken place and where kids were targeted for this kind of indoctrination, I think people can say, oh I didn't know. And here and the reason we wrote stolen youth is that you won't be able to say you didn't know. We're telling you this is happening. We're telling you this is going on in your kid's school and at the library and at their pediatrician's office and everywhere else. And so you can't look away. You have to fight back. Well, you know one of the examples you bring up a number of times in the book is one of these things that you're not supposed to talk about. What happened in Nazi Germany and how children's perceptions on Jews changed specifically through this kind of indoctrination. Tell me a little bit. Well, so there's so much evidence that what the kids pick up in society as it's being pushed on them really does resonate that if you believe that oh I can just at home fight back against this indoctrination. I mean in free free places you might be able to do that till larger extent, but in places like Nazi Germany it was uncontrollable. They were picking up the idea of antisemitism in their schools and in their culture as a specifically targeted viewpoint. And so you had that generation of children when they grew up to be adults be far more antisemitic than previous or post generations. So the fact that they were pushing these ideas on them was extremely important and it resonated. And I talk a lot in the book also about the Soviet Union where kids were seen as the ultimate revolutionaries. They were the ones who were going to carry the bright future forward and the targeting of children was not accidental and the breaking up of families was not accidental. They tried to separate kids from their parents born indoctrination and even somewhere like the Soviet Union they had to kind of be sly about it. They couldn't say like these are our children now. You know these children belong to all of us which Joe Biden recently said he said these are not your kids, these are our kids. There's no such thing as someone else's child. No such thing as someone else's child. Our nation's children are all our children. And I think even even in places like the Soviet Union that that idea would have gotten pushed back so they couldn't do that. They had to kind of say that we're all in this together and we're going to help you raise your children and it's not about separating you. It's about growing you together. At one point parents were kind of instilling values onto children and that changed to being friends with children. Right. Kind of equal with children. It's kind of a very different mentality of upbringing. Yeah it seems like we're raising kids based on some book that we haven't finished reading. It's like we just keep throwing theories and philosophies of parenting that we can see isn't going to work out. There was a story recently where a doctor said that a child had come to his office with his with the mom and and that had a sore throat and the doctor said okay I'm going to check your throat open wide and the child refused to do so and the mom said well it's his body his choice and the doctor was like what like I need to check the kids throat but this is the natural progression of this kind of thing where the kids in charge and they get to tell you what they believe and what they think and you're the parent. Kids need parenting. It's it's something that I think parents take for granted how much kids need them. They need them to show them the way. They need them to teach them and parents are really abdicating that duty and it's going to have bad repercussions. There isn't kind of a one size fits all solution. That's what strikes me like some kids are just incredibly responsible from a very early age and you can almost it almost makes sense to have that kind of a relationship with them. Of course with some boundaries but they have they've heard they're already developing their own boundaries and there's other kids who have none of it like zero right and you need to be extremely. Yeah look I have three kids they could not be more different. They literally seem like they have you know two different parents all of them. They were born in the way that they were born. That's true but we have helped shape their responses if not their personalities. Sure they you know they might have the personalities they arrived with but we've the goal is to raise resilient children who can go out into the world and not you know feel a level of anxiety that debilitates them or have them be extremely worried about climate change in college where they they feel a level of a worry that prohibits them from living their full lives. So when we treat kids like little adults we instill all of our problems and and issues on them and that really does mess them up going forward but it seems like the parents are just as ideologically captured in all some of these stories like this mom where they have stopped thinking reasonably and it should be concerning to all of us. I think the people who believe in this ideology would say we all do indoctrination actually Carol you're indoctrinating kids with your ideology I have a better ideology I want them indoctrinated with mine that's just a fact right right so so what are you not indoctrinating your kids? Well I'm sure I'm influencing them um I listen I would love to indoctrinate my kids it just it isn't reasonable that kids will follow everything that a parent tells them but when you have every force in society pushing them in one direction that's very powerful but also the idea that you should be able to indoctrinate my children is one that I find you know abhorrent no you can't you're not their guide you're their teacher you're their doctor you don't get to implant ideas into their head that I then need to like cancel out at home and I have to say that my kids do move through the world because of you know my indoctrination or whatever you want to call it my teaching they do move through the world very aware when somebody's trying to convince them of something they my older two come home from school and they'll say like oh this I heard this in class today like is this like something I need to think about or are you worried about um I jokingly call them the woke police because they they're very aware when a concept is being pushed on them or when they're getting somebody's opinion and not fact and that's good I want them to be aware I you know Bethany and I my co-author have very different paths that we take I have three kids um until recently they were all in public school ones now in private she has six kids and she homeschools them she pre-watches their movies she pre-weeds the books um I don't do any of that I kind of give them a longer rope and I say I trust you I want to hear what you're learning out there um but I also I provide the foundation at home and we both do that but what she would say is no matter how much she protects her children she can't protect them from this woke mind virus in every way and at the pediatrician's office she still she says I homeschool them and I we do everything you know outside of the culture but I still need to take them to the doctor and if you have a pediatrician who has been ideologically captured which many of them happen um you're going to run into some issues yeah it's interesting I I liked how you put it that you know you want to uh you know inoculate them with some level of this wokeism right so they can actually see you made a very very interesting distinction right when the whole of the whole kind of perception of what you're supposed to believe right this sort of the perceived consensus which I keep thinking about in our society is pushing in a certain direction and you're being taught that this is exactly how it's supposed to be as opposed to hey I'm gonna give you the skills to evaluate these things right it sounds like what you're doing it's very different yes well I definitely that's definitely the goal is to give them the tools to evaluate what they hear out in the world um but I also say that this new wokeism as opposed to like liberalism or old leftism walks such a narrow line that you have to parrot the words in the exact right way and you need to have the ideas um be very specifically outlined to you that you you have to only speak about them in a really certain way like you can't say I'm not racist you have to say I'm anti-racist right um so I don't have that rigidity with my kids I want them to explore their ideas and have their own thoughts and have their own concepts and that used to be the goal we wanted our kids to have a wide range of opinions presented to them where they could pick their own and and learn on their own and now we don't have that because everybody has to think the exact same way under this you know woke regime so just explain to me um you know where you've come from and maybe some of these ideas that your parents taught you that you thought hey this looks familiar you know I was born in the Soviet Union and I came to the US as a small child I wasn't quite too yet I grew up in Brooklyn and I lived in New York most of my life with some little gaps here and there um I was a lifelong New Yorker we were going to raise our children in New York and then a little over a year ago we made the decision to move to Florida which was a sort of startling decision we had just built our dream home in Brooklyn we really did have a plan to spend our lives there um but we felt like New York had lost its grip on reality um particularly under COVID but also in you know in lots of issues around COVID it wasn't just COVID but that did play a large role we felt like Governor Rhonda Santas in Florida was doing some really sane normal policy making that we appreciated um and so we made the move which was very public because I'm a New York Post columnist and again a New York supremacist so the idea that I was leaving New York was big and people wanted to hear the story so um it's been amazing it's been just really freeing and our family um really found a way to be free you're reporting especially during COVID that's when I started I started reading you a bit more because I thought you were a bit ahead of the curve and than a lot of people that was very thoughtful but this is I want to get at what is it that your parents told you that made you more aware of what was happening because I'm sure there was some moment right where you were looking at what's happening and the people around you were like what are you talking about right right yeah there were quite a few moments but I would say things like on Facebook groups my very liberal neighborhood um suddenly was no longer interested in providing education to the poorest members of society they didn't care at all that kids in poorer neighborhoods all over New York City did not get to go to school and in fact it became part of their philosophy to keep them out of school um meanwhile for their own kids they sent them to private school which were open obviously public schools were very dangerous but private schools were allowed um or they got them a tutor or they moved to their beach house and sent them to the kids to the school there but they didn't say a word for the poor kids all over the city and I I felt like that was a very Soviet moment for me it was like you said one thing but you believed something else entirely um I also the telling on your neighbors people would call the police and say oh there's too many people in this backyard they seemed to enjoy it so much it was really full of like zeal um other things were those shutting down of conversation when somebody would say I think schools should open I think it's like I don't understand why liberal europe has schools open but it's become an idea only Donald Trump supporters believe in America um and they basically would say like oh you're a right winger you you know they would kind of kick them out of the club and say and this person would say like I'm a lifelong liberal I believe everything you believe I just don't understand why we can't open the schools and they would get harassed um really seriously some people got fired for these beliefs it was a really serious time but then crime started to really spike and New York had been doing so well for so long that we all expected that to just continue and then when it didn't it was like they refused to accept it they refused to admit that crime was going up so you would have posts like I'm just afraid to walk around by myself after dark or my teenager's cell phone got stolen at the local subway station or stuff like that and they would get comments like no you know don't believe the right-wing media about crime and I'd like the stats or the stats and they would say things like but look you know in the 1990s the crime was higher well yeah but that was during an extremely bad time in New York City history you're talking about we've now had like at that point what 20 plus years of relatively crime free and not crime free but low crime um time for New York City and you're just going to give that up over ideology you're going to say that this doesn't exist because you're you're on the side that wants to pretend this doesn't exist I just saw the conformity that I had heard about my whole life where you had to believe and you had to make a spectacle of it which I I dress in the book um I talk about installing youth a lot where the spectacle is survival it's part of what makes these totalitarian societies um thrive so for example when the George Floyd killing happened and there were these riots and everybody put BLM signs black lives matter in their window and I would just thought to myself and I say this in the book um you know black lives matter is a really uncontroversial idea so when you're putting the sign in the window who are you talking to in your ideologically homogeneous neighborhood like who are you trying to convince with your sign and of course they're not trying to convince anybody they're trying to say I'm on the team I'm part of this and don't come for me please because look I have the sign in my window that felt very Soviet to me um my great grandmother I'm sorry my grandmother's father my great grandfather was killed in Stalin's gulag but my grandmother and her sister when Stalin died made a scrapbook of his glorious life because that's what you do when the spectacle is what matters and I saw it in so many different ways and then I couldn't unsee it did you ever have this situation in your family where it was kind of treason to talk about things inside the family outside of the household did you grow up at that? I didn't have that I think my parents were not afraid of what I would say outside the home but recently I have my kids are 13, 10 and 7 I don't remember what it was my seven-year-old we made some sort of gender joke I like oh I think he wanted his he's like oh my nails painted like my sister like he's joking I'm joking everybody's joking but I said oh no in this family we follow really strict gender roles and I wouldn't let you do that and we're just playing around and my daughter says to him make sure not to say that outside the house like don't don't tell anybody that mom said that and it's funny because I don't you know I don't worry about that why is she worrying about that why is she worrying that somebody might take our jokey family behavior and do something bad with it so something that you mentioned earlier was this zeal with which some people were doing that so-called tattle tailing on others or it kind of empowers these obsessive people that typically don't have a lot of power but suddenly they're they can become the people who are the enforcers that's right right and that like in every communist society those people are the people that rise in these called the communist ranks and that when I saw these people doing the tattle tailing with zeal like what is that right why with zeal right yeah they've been waiting for their moment to like tell on their neighbors and I mean isn't that so troubling it is it is because I I think that before covid I wouldn't have thought that I would see that in American society and it's it is troubling it's troubling how quickly and how easily so many people fell into that and did tell on their neighbors and tried to get people fired for the wrong opinion and you know called people's jobs etc yeah it's it's unbelievable that that happened and it's happening in America and that people are standing by it standing for it it's like the walker a very small segment of the population and yet they're able to control so much and they do this forced conformity you know this idea that freedom is only ever one generation away I always felt so lucky to be here and I obviously still do but I feel like there's a really troubling trend happening in American society and you're right it isn't something that we should just dismiss or not worry about it can this could all end tomorrow this is already one of the if not the longest running experience experiment in democracy and freedom in world history I think it is the longest right I don't think anybody's beat us and it could end tomorrow and we can't let that happen and it and it can happen with elections and it has happened and you know all around us I just you can't you look at Venezuela you know this really kind of thriving free society voted itself into totalitarian dictatorship right well there's that joke you know you can vote yourself into it but you have to shoot your way out you have this kind of comprehensive picture between you and Bethany of of wokeism so what is it right and you reference all sorts of people who have done excellent work of course yeah so wokeism is the combination of leftist ideology with this forced conformity so where old left is definitely tried to push its agenda and and did so successfully say at the college level the new wokeism wouldn't allow any room in that conversation it's like leftists would not be able to argue with leftists about different perspectives wokeism walks a very narrow path so it's like the old left is on the joke I kind of used for it is you might get a woman studies degree but the new wokeness is you get a woman studies degree and you can't define a woman and that's important it's it's something that like you know the old leftists would be shocked that wokeness now says they're not sure what woman is they're not sure what it means to be a woman they cannot define it and you know the feminists of the 70s for example 60s and 70s would find that shocking so that's really the difference to me between old leftist ideology and this new wokeism that also the discussion of equality versus equity is another great example of that I think that the old left used to be for equality whereas equity is the buzzword of the woke it's not about equal opportunities it's about equal outcomes and anybody who's ever lived in a communist country can tell you equal outcomes is not a thing it does not happen it is impossible some people will have different outcomes than others and that's just how it goes you know I put noted down some kind of themes that occurred in my mind as I was reading so one of them has to do with preposterous medical prescriptions for children yeah what we're doing to kids medically is a gigantic problem specifically for boys I think that we're way over medicating them and we're taking away the very natural way that boys behave again I have a girl and two boys they are different they're not the same my girl can sit for hours and read and my boys will destroy half the house if they had to sit for hours and read and they come from the same parents so I think the over medication of boys is just a large large problem and it's you're seeing this use of medication on kids enter the in the gender ideology debates too like what is acceptable to do to children whether it's okay to stop their puberty from arriving or you know hormone treatments and it's wild because it's only recently that we've really begun to say this is not okay I think hormone treatments for kids had been sort of prevalent for any kid presenting as gender dysphoric for a long time and now it's finally being challenged and and challenged fairly well it's amazing to me that we've let it get this far in Europe both again on the sort of gender medicine side of things and COVID medicine side of things there were much more science based yes policies created but for some reason we didn't know about them over here well we knew about them we just chose to full on ignore them it's it's crazy to me to give Europe credit for a for something but they did so much better than us on COVID I just was watching astounded that so many countries in Europe never masked children at all and then when the vaccines arrived they were like no kids don't need this which is what I was saying and it was considered a really far out thing I was pro vaccine I just thought kids didn't need it I don't know that I'd be pro vaccine you know the fact to do it over again but I was and it's it was so obvious to me that kids their risk already of a poor COVID outcome was zero so you can't reduce it any lower it's not like you can make zero less and yet Europe figured this out fairly quickly and they've also really inoculated themselves from a lot of the wokeness they they are very liberal continent as most of the countries there are fairly liberal but that's the whole thing they're liberal they're not woke they're not in the grips of a mania this ideology that is is really manic and they're not having the same kinds of issues that we are there gender dysphoria numbers are nowhere near the numbers of ours which just shows that it's a social contagion and it's not something that's happening naturally Europe is very accepting for example of transgender kids in general and yet they're having a far lower instance of transgenderism in their children than we are and that really people on the left in America should wonder why they used to follow Europe on everything but now they don't but nobody's allowed to ask any questions well and also that the shift you know now accelerating away from this whole gender affirming care idea where it's like if you think anything different than the norm a firm a firm a firm right right and Europe's moving away from that and Britain for sure is moving away from it because it didn't because it caused huge problems i mean then they saw that right yeah yeah it's causing huge problems here and we're not doing anything about it the third theme that i noticed is just this general idea again on the gender side on the covid side and frankly beyond is this just this idea that parents should be excluded from their children's from decisions about their children so that's actually an okay thing somehow yeah right that should scare parents you know we used to understand that if somebody's asking a child to keep a secret from their parents that person is doing something bad to them but we've gotten to where that's become acceptable where parents don't need to know what the child is doing in school if the child has decided to become a different gender in school to go by different pronouns and dress up as the opposite gender that should motivate parents to understand that there's a wider issue at play here the separation of the family is what happens in these kinds of revolutions and if parents see this kind of thing going on where somebody's asking them their kid to keep a secret from them i think they should imagine for themselves what else is happening if this is happening what else is out there is this cultural revolution it doesn't doesn't feel like it really we've seen them in the Soviet Union we've seen them in communist China and yes it was the young people i don't know if i said this earlier but yes the red guard you know mouser red guard we're young people basically putting the older generation who are not you know according to the rules through the ringer right right it is a cultural revolution happening here and i think it's very similar to those revolutions and the only real difference is that we know what's happening here we we are aware of it and so stopping it should be easier than it was elsewhere i think that we you know we draw these historical parallels in the book because i think that they're instructive they it is they're they're trying to alter our culture towards their vision and if we allow it it's it's not like we're going to be able to stop it once they succeed it's like it has to be stopped now when when you see it happening in different facets of our society it should be stopped as soon as possible and people should take it seriously i feel like i before i wrote this book i i don't think i would have agreed there was a cultural revolution happening but now i i see it clearly i see that it's taken over everything and it's not a conspiracy theory it's happening and the other thing is like we talk about things like that the left uses children to be their activists and you know we get so many comments or letters or whatever saying like that's ridiculous you know these are it's ridiculous to imagine that that's really what's happening conspiracy theories and then Bernie Sanders puts out his book recently and says yes we should make children into activists absolutely that's the goal and it's like is it a conspiracy theory or did one of the top leaders of the left just admit that that's what's going on you're not going to get admission on everything so you're going to have to think it through you know parents will have to think it through for themselves but this is what's happening well that you have a really excellent chapter i think looking at things in a way that i haven't seen anywhere else i called child soldiers and this is of course what what you just discussed i didn't fully grasp the significance of the parkland shooting and how that catalyzed the idea of using the child as the kind of activist that can't be argued against right how can you argue with the child tell tell tell me about that well it was the first time that it was teenagers that could speak out and say what they believe on guns and the media immediately fell in love with them they were articulate and they were bright and they had just survived something very traumatic so when cena proposed a town hall these teenagers got to confront various politicians on this on a stage in front of everybody and they also confronted uh daniel ash who was an array spokesperson at the time national rifle association um there was also the sheriff on the stage who had failed to go into the building for hours his team did let this go on for a really long time um and yet he was spared their criticism it was like they they they really tore into the politicians on the stage like marc senator marco rubio um and what's interesting is they were clearly traumatized and look some of them went on to become activists but at least one of them really regrets that appearance and regrets that whole episode because he feels like he was pressured into it um and so when you see the case of greta thunberg talking about climate change who was inspired by when she saw here right i didn't know that parkland yes i didn't know that either until we started looking into this it was a direct line it was a grown-up in her life who knew that she was passionate about climate change saw the parkland kids was an activist um and saw the parkland kids and the reaction that they were getting and said i have someone who could do the same thing and so she became an activist on climate change and how are you going to argue with this pig-tailed little girl who is afraid that the world's going to end um and so they've set up a situation where they their opinions are impossible to confront impossible to argue with when they're delivered by small children as you're talking right i'm thinking back again to scott atlas' sort of assertion that we use children as shields for adults isn't that exactly what's happening here that is exactly what's happening here i think that that is a classic example of how we're using children in this way um and i i think we're seeing it with gender ideology they're um they definitely have kids who proclaim themselves trans in the public eye and being talking about these trans issues because what are you going to say to this child who says no i was born in the wrong body it's something you can argue with an adult about but you're going to argue with a child it's not yours you're not shuts down the conversation you talk in the book about groupthink um and then there's of course again people who are believers capital B and in this wokeism or critical social justice which yeah i think is what it calls itself um is it the same thing or is it is it different well in that woke world you cannot say things that aren't specifically already pre-approved for you to say you cannot draw a new parallel or use language not already used but somehow they're ever changing isn't it well it has to be changing yes so we we we talk about this in the book as well but you know the jargon has to change that you know who's in the in-group it's it's an idea that my friend Michael Malice wrote about and i think it's so right on where it's very easy to change your language right it's easy to change the word one word two words and that's why they have to keep changing the jargon so that they know who belongs and who doesn't um i one of the predictions that i i've made is that i think the word trans will be at a favor very soon right now it's like you have to call them a trans woman or a trans man very soon the fact that you're even qualifying that they're not actually a man or not actually a woman will be unacceptable and i i could see that heading in that direction just like the way you know vagrit became homeless became unhoused became you know etc what is it that's appropriate to teach children at a young age math science um i think things that we always knew would be appropriate reading i've gotten to the point where i don't think we should be teaching climate change to small children anymore and you know the argument for teaching them is like oh they need to know what's going on with the world well do they why why do they need to know that we don't tell them about like car crash statistics like before they get in a car like hey by the way a lot of people die in these things like no we don't do any of that um and so the idea that we need to terrify them and make them think that the world is ending which is what they think it doesn't make any sense to me it's it's something that we they've had so many studies where teenagers have high anxiety rates because they've been told their whole lives that climate change is happening and it's going to destroy everything well maybe we save that conversation when their cognitive abilities can accept it well accept accept that there's no evidence that there's 12 years left or whatever it was that just right every 12 years it's like it's like 12 years right meanwhile we're barely teaching any history at all i would love to see any kind of approximation of historical education in our schools which really doesn't happen you know one thing i've also been i've also been thinking about is uh what are considered guidelines right whether it's from the CDC or from the American Association of Pediatricians which is one of the groups that you cite that you believe has been captured heavily the guidelines somehow become policy yeah and it just dawned on you know this forced conformity right is the tool for that right in order to get into medical school you need to address how you're going to support diversity and inclusion in your medical practice it produces immediately a control of what you're allowed to think is anybody gonna write like oh i don't think diversity is that important in my practice no of course not they're all gonna parrot the same thing because i i actually want to focus on like cutting well as a surgeon right i'm gonna read a quote from uh dr jeffrey talking about this topic of gender dysphoric youth or somehow he's involved in it and he says the parallels with the opioid epidemic are astonishing interesting it's the same sort of deal you've got a group with a vested interest you've got weak data you've got ideological capture you've got mass psychosis legions of unthinking clinicians doing what their medical societies are telling them to do right that's the real problem with this kind of woke capture is that you're not allowed to step outside the line so if you know something crazy something bad is being done you're not allowed to say anything you have to tell the line so what what happens is you end up having like a whisper network of like where the normal sane doctors are because you can't tell based on you know their practice anymore and it should scare people it really should it's just scare people that we're putting um ridiculous ideas like this ahead of actual hard science and and actual medicine um and the fact that your doctor can't say what they really think should really scare people you know one of the reactions to this often and from talking to people in the heartland right is just like wow those uh you know people on the coast are pretty nuts yeah you know we we don't we don't really have to worry about that well this is like the the trial of my life um i find it much easier to get people in blue areas to believe what i'm saying than i do people in red areas and it's so wild to me because the people in red areas they intrinsically agree with me but they just don't think it's happening there and so i'm constantly pulling out examples like um a few months ago there was a little girl who was transitioned behind her parents back at school she's in fourth grade nine years old or ten years old and they start calling her boy name she starts wearing boy clothes and the parents are only brought into the conversation when she draws a picture of a little girl who wants to kill herself and the parents finally get called and brought in and this happened in a red enclave in a red hamlet in a red town in a red county and it's like i i need these people to understand that this could happen anywhere these teachers get ideologically ideologically captured themselves at their teachers colleges they're themselves being indoctrinated and then they're taking these ideas and going throughout the country and it's just the idea that this is only happening on the coast is just untrue um it's probably happening more on the coasts i would say your child is more likely to have a cluster of kids in their class who declared themselves transgender in san francisco or in new york city but it's still happening places we have examples in the book where in small town you know a girl scout troop a bunch of girls declare themselves trans at the same time and it absolutely happens how does that happen i mean it's it's like a kind of it's like an epidemic yeah of that it's the it's the mind virus like how does that work so just contagion for sure um it's really one person says it and then a bunch of other people fall into it one of the influential girls for example right preteens are feeling uncomfortable in their bodies you know tell us all this time uh we used to have cutting as an epidemic when when i was a teenager or my 20s and this is sort of a similar thing where they're being caught up in something and what they're being caught up in in this case is can have real lifelong implications if they take the next steps and when you have a medical system that does nothing but affirm them you there's no other option if you come to a doctor with your child and the child says i feel like i'm in the wrong body the doctor does not have any other options and that's again the problem with woke medicine is that the doctor can't say like you know she'll grow out of it no the doctor has to affirm what's going on and and provide suggestions on next steps there's these unbelievably pornographic books that end up in children's libraries and not just one like kind of all over the place and you wonder you really think to yourself that someone look at this book and was like yes this is a great idea for my you know eight-year-old or whatever i just i just can't imagine it but but you actually explain how this happens well it happens because these books end up winning awards and it's an award-winning book so obviously we have to have this pornography in our school library um main thing that we Bethany and i talk a lot about is that they use the fact that these books are LGBT as a shield they would never allow a book that showed pornographic images of straight sex in a library meant for you know 11 and under which is these are found in elementary school libraries but because it's gay sex it becomes okay because oh you know what are you homophobic you don't want this porn in your kids library and they use that as a shield so i think the the question for us as we move forward is not so much even how the books get there although that is interesting why these books are chosen but why do they stay in after we see what's happening in them why is it why did they become the the model of what we should have in our school library and if you don't want that then you're banning books which is ridiculous well and just somehow managing to conflate age appropriateness with banning books exactly you're just such a yeah we don't like kids watch rated-r movies why are we letting them see books that are deeply inappropriate it's not a free speech issue it's for sure not right it's not really a banning book issue just because your book is not available in the in a children's library doesn't mean your book is banned i'm sure my book is not in an elementary school library does that mean my book has been no of course not it's not for kids not everything is for kids right well it's just it's just that these narratives are so powerful they can you can kind of you get caught up in how does media fit into this whole ecosystem yeah media drives a lot of it the media is obviously in the woke camp and if you question any part of the agenda they will come for you i think jk rallying you know who wrote harry potter is a great example of that i challenge anybody to find anything that she said that is really actually controversial just the fact that she says things like women need their own female only spaces it's not a controversial idea at all it's an idea that most of the world believes in but the media portrays her as this like firebrand and and who says really crazy things and she really doesn't and the media is responsible for so much of this they they push this conversation along and they push it leftward and then they don't feel responsible for the repercussions of it and they are because it you know it comes out of the academy it's in the school definitely it's taught in the university yeah the teachers that come out of teachers colleges disproportionately believe it or at least believe that this is what they should be teaching yeah and then it's amplified you know dramatically by this media and this you know i've mentioned this in a lot of interviews but there's this kind of mechanism of manufacturing perceived consensus in society i call it the megaphone that it's a very powerful thing in our society and some portion of us are susceptible to it very dramatically susceptible that's something that covid taught me yeah absolutely um in the book we go through a lot of the conformity experiments where people are asked to give an answer of something and they give the correct answer but then they see everybody else in the experiment who are state which is staged giving the wrong answer and they'll often adjust their answer to fit in with the group we're very social creatures we want to belong we want to believe what our peers and neighbors and community believe um and it's hard to be the one who has a different answer and that's something important that i teach my own children is that like it's okay if you're the only one with this answer um it's okay to stand alone and believe what you believe there's this very interesting chapter where Bethany talks about her own struggled in develop and how she developed her resilience some of the most challenging moments in her life and you know struggle with her mother's passing in a very difficult circumstances i'm just very curious you know obviously you discussed this together and you chose to include this why we thought it was important because that was the overall message of our book we want to raise resilient children we don't want to raise necessarily conservatives i mean that would be great i would love for my kids to be conservative but i would mostly like them to be resilient at our book party in new york we had protesters who like threw drinks and threw books at us and i i would be heartbroken if those were my children i would think that like wow i did not prepare them for a world in which other people have other ideas so for us the resiliency chapter was really important because you want to raise children who are resilient who will grow up into resilient adults who are able to live their lives to their full capacity and not be hindered by bad ideas you know what are your prescriptions at this point Bethany and i have different prescriptions again she pulls her kids from the culture where i leave mine in but provide a foundation at home we give parents a lot of different ideas on what they could be doing but if you find yourself in a place where you're unable to speak freely and you're unable to challenge the bad ideas that your kids are being subjected to i one of the prescriptions is absolutely moving and it might not be moving to another state like like my family did it might be moving in next town over or a different neighborhood but a family who is free is the goal and that's what you're looking for you're looking for a situation where your family can be themselves and you can raise your children according to your own philosophies what's your pithy message to parents this is going to take a fight no matter where you are if you're in a red area blue area this is going to be a fight not only for our children but for the culture and for the future so don't imagine somebody else is going to mount this fight for you it's going to have to be you it's going to have to be for your own kids and i think that once you wrap your mind around the idea that fighting is necessary here that fighting back and saying what you really mean and standing up for yourself and for your family is important i think you'll find that other people will join with you but you have to be brave and that's when people will gravitate to what you're saying when they see that you're brave and not afraid of the slings and arrows i think you'll find a community of people willing to do the same well carol marco it's just such a pleasure to have you on the show thank you so much thank you thank you all for joining carol marco it should be on this episode of american thought leaders i'm your host yonya kelick"
