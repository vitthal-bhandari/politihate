    "text": " And just a final question here. Is there any sort of work being done to with the airlines in order to get flights actually on time or delayed as much? Just curious if there's any work happening there? Yes. So we've seen almost a doubling in terms of improvement on on-time performance since last year. That is a reflection of all the work that we've done across the ecosystem together with our partner airlines, with agencies, reducing processing time, reducing wait times, and fine-tuning operations with our air carrier partners. And we see the great results that have come from that. It's a cameraman who deserves an award. I'm Dave Rubin. This is The Rubin Report. It's July 25th, 2023. We're live streaming on the Rumble, the locals on the YouTube. Subscribe if you have not post-game show as always, RubinReport.locals.com. And we are just a couple days away from me going off the grid, dipping out, no phone, no TV, no newspapers, no communication with the outside world. Just sitting in a cold dark room waiting to return. And looking forward to that, Thursday will be my last day on the grid. We're doing a live meetup, Thursday night, for our locals community. If you want to join us, RubinReport.locals.com. It's the pin post for subscribers only. And I'm being told on the fly that we have a Tuesday test for me. I did not know about this. I guess Tuesday is going to be our test day. All right, so you've got some sort of question for me. Is that what's going on here? You have three questions for me. Okay, today's Tuesday test. I'm getting this on the fly. What is older? Oh, this is good. What is older? Nancy Pelosi or the microwave oven? Wow, that is good. That is good. So Nancy Pelosi's got to be what? She's got to be early 80s, 82, something like that, right? And then the microwave oven, I'm guessing, came out in the 50s. So it's close. It's definitely close. I'm commercially, though, probably not till a bit later than that. I'm going to say Nancy Pelosi is older than the microwave oven. Yeah, I got it. Wow. Nancy Pelosi born in 1945. Oh, no, the oven. Wait, what am I being told here? Which is this? The oven came out in 1945. Nancy Pelosi came out in 1940. Okay, that's good. One for one. Pretty good. What is older? Joe Biden or Tupperware? There's definitely a theme today. Joe Biden or Tupperware? Tupperware seems kind of new to me. Tupperware seems like in like a 70s or 80s, a bunch of women would get together and share Tupperware with each other. So I'm going to say Joe Biden is older than Tupperware. Wow, two for two. Tupperware came out in 1946. So I was a bit off on that one. Joe Biden came out in 1942. We are educating the people today. Finally, what is older? Donald Trump or paper straws. Donald Trump or paper straws? Well, Donald Trump is what did he just turn 79? Something like that. The paper straw. I feel like the paper straw has been around for a while, you know what I mean? People enjoy the straw. People were drinking lemonade back in the day on the veranda with a nice paper straw. I'm going to say paper straws are older than Donald Trump. Paper straws came out in 1888. Thank you, ladies and gentlemen. Not bad. We did not rehearse any of that. I did not even know what was happening. There you go. The theme for today's program, which I did know about, is a bit about this Barbie divide happening in the country. But if you're not, I'm not going to belabor you with everything going on with Barbie and focus on Barbie and all that. We do a little Barbiness, but I think Barbie and the culture wars and the woke versus the sane people and the destruction of old stories like I talked about yesterday, Snow White. If you don't like the story of the guy kissing the princess and living happily ever after, instead of destroying that story, how about you create a new story? If you don't like whatever it is, Barbie was all about big boobs and a genderless dude or whatever Barbie with their car, then create a new story. But they like to burn down everything. And that's what the machine is good at. Destroying anything that Americans can broadly agree on and then giving us remakes that just make us hate each other. And then we're going to connect that to a whole bunch of politics, including the big thing going on here in Florida, because today is a day that ends in the letter Y, which means the entire machine is going after Florida going after DeSantis, claiming that we are not teaching slavery correctly in our schools and a whole bunch more. And of course, when I saw the headline on this a few days ago, without even having to read the articles, I knew it was complete nonsense, but that didn't stop Kamala Harris from getting on a plane and flying to Florida and telling everyone how racist it is, racist this place is and all of the mainstream media and all that. And then we'll do a bit on Trump and DeSantis because some of you saw this, I'm sure, but I went on Charlie Kirk's show yesterday, Charlie Kirk, of course, from turning point USA, Charlie's a friend of mine. We've done dozens and dozens of public events over the years. We're in different spots when it comes to Trump and DeSantis, but we got into it in an interesting, I would say in an interesting and respectful way with completely different perspectives. And we don't see too much of that these days, do we? Whether it's a Democrat versus a Republican in a respectable manner, or even let's say two people that are going to vote Republican, me and Charlie, having an honest discussion about why we're supporting one candidate or the other. So we're going to do all of that. But before we do, let's talk about Mooink Box. You guys know that 60% of US pork production comes from one company owned by the Chinese and their hogs are given something called Rakte-Pamin, which is banned in 160 countries, including China, yet you find it in your grocery aisle every day. Well, guys, there is a better way. I want to tell you about Mooink. You know Mooink, that's Moo plus Oink. Mooink delivers grass-fed and grass-finished beef and lamb-pastard pork and chicken and sustainable wild-caught Alaskan salmon straight to your door. You choose the meat delivered in every box like rib-eyes to chicken breast to pork chops to salmon fillets and much more. Plus, you can cancel anytime. You guys know I love taking a little fillet and yon out on my big green egg on a Friday night. Shark Tank host Kevin O'Leary called Mooink's bacon the best bacon he's ever tasted, and they guarantee you will say, Oink, Oink, I'm just so happy I got moinked. Keep American farming going by signing up at mooinkbox.com slash Rubin right now and listeners of this show get free ground beef for a year. That's one of the best ground beef you'll ever taste, but for a limited time and now back to me. Okay, so when we were setting up the show this morning, and Phoenix said to me, Dave, let's cover a little bit of what's going on with this Barbie situation and everyone's freaking out about Barbie. We had a little back and forth because I was saying I don't want to always, just because something happens culturally and everyone's freaking out. I don't want to always add into the freak out, right? I'm trying to give you guys solutions on this show. But sometimes things happen that I would say are so culturally impactful whether we like it or not that we have to address it. So I am going to talk about Barbie for a moment. We're going to show you a clip of the movie. I did not see the movie. As I said yesterday, I am an adult. I did not see Barbie over the weekend. I did watch Flash Gordon, but you know, that's a little bit different obviously. But I'm going to show you a clip, but I'm not telling you all of this to outrage you. I just want to show you how a certain set of people are trying to push a certain set of ideas. And then really on the other side of that, how we can fight back in a better, more functional way. So here is Ken. You know who's the actor on this one that's Ryan Gosling, if I'm not mistaken. Ryan Gosling, as Ken, singing about blonde fragility in the new Barbie movie. I just don't know who I am without you. You're 10. But it's Barbie and Ken. There is no just Ken. It doesn't seem to matter what I do. I'm always number two. No one knows how hard I tried. Oh, oh, I have feelings that I can't explain. They're driving me insane. All my life been so polite. Cause I'm just Ken. Anywhere else I'd be 10. Is it my destiny to live? I'm not a life of blonde fragility. I'm just Ken. Where I see the love she sees and frets. What will it take for her to see the man behind the 10. And fight for me. I'm just Ken. I'm not. And I'm ready to install. So hey, check me out. Yeah, I'm just Ken. Baby, I'm just Ken. All right, so first off, I want to just reiterate, I am not here to make you outraged by that. I don't think you should have been outraged by that. I think there's obviously, and we just all agreed on it in this room. And I think I'm sitting here with three heterosexuals as far as I know, there was something visually interesting about that. Is there anything you guys want to tell me about your sexuality real quick? Anyone? We're good? Good. Good. Phoenix. I'm a canonical asexual. That's a reference for last week. Give your pay attention. Anyway, there's something visually interesting about that. But the point I'm showing you on this, and then we'll get to sort of the outrage machine around it, is that here you have what they've done is they flipped, which is just fine. They flipped what the traditional thing is, right? Here is the guy now saying, I'm not complete without the girl. That's okay. They're flipping the script on that. And again, there's something visually interesting. The song wasn't terrible. But now there's this giant culture war raging around this is this destruction of men and men now need women on the other sides trying to take out the people saying that and all that. I thought the Daily Wire had a nice piece that could that sum this up quite well. Early reviewers praised the film as being pro-feminist and anti-patriarchy. Gerwig, that's the director, has crafted a fierce, funny and deeply feminist adventure that dares you to laugh and cry even if you're made of plastic. Entertainment Weekly reporter Devin Kogan wrote, the writer goes on to describe how in Barbie land, the women run the show while the kendals always play a supporting role. But then stereotypical Barbie, played by Margot Robbie, starts to unravel mentally when she starts thinking about deeper issues such as death and realizes her arched feet have gone flat. She ventures into the real world to figure out what's going on. Once Barbie and Ken, Ryan Gosling, begin rollerblading around LA however, they both realize that they've essentially entered a mirror dimension. Where are the female presidents? The CEOs, the astronauts. Gerwig tackles the doll's complicated legacy head on exploring how Barbie's reputation here isn't one of leadership or creativity but of corporatized objectification. Barbie herself is horrified facing crude comments and misogyny for the first time in her plastic life. The EW review also notes that Gosling, as Ken becomes enamored with the idea of being the boss and tries to bring that power structure back to Barbie land. To Ken, this newfound idea of patriarchy is intoxicating and he quickly enters a spiral of masculinity, ludgerating in trucks, cowboys hats and the addictive thrill of power, the reviewer writes. He says of the film, Greta Gerwig loads plenty of food for thought in a hot pink pop-fantasia, poking fun at patriarchy and corporate parent Mattel in her treatment of the iconic girls can do anything dull. In Barbie land, Ken's job is a deliberately ill-defined afterthought, basically just beach. Whereas in the real world, dudes rule an idea he takes back to Barbie land with pointedly absurd results, brainwashing all the women into behaving like obedient housewives he shares later in the review. So this is connected to what I talked about yesterday, that instead of creating new characters to do all of these new things, whether it's Snow White, whether it's Star Wars, whether it's Barbie, whether it's Marvel, if you want to change all of these new things, if you want to change the history, the lore of these characters, if you want to change their sexuality, their gender, their skin color, little mermaid, all of these things, if you want to do all that, that is just fine. That is what dreamers dream of, right? Writing new stories, creating new characters, new tensions, new worlds, new ideas. That's once what the great legendary writers did when they created, say, Star Wars or they created Lord of the Rings or they created anything that you watch that is a fictitious something, a love story or whatever else. But instead what we do right now is the corporate world takes old properties that were just fine in and of themselves. They really were and then tries to put this modern spin on them to show us how evil the patriarchy is and all of the usual stuff. We wanted to show you one little clip we saw this going around, this is interesting. This is from the Barbie premiere in Spain. Look what's, oh god yes, queen. Oh my god yes, oh, mermaid lady and oh my god guys, what's that about sure? Is that more of a Willy Wonka thing and oh look at that. So how are we connecting this to other things? Well, the point is guys that the woke thing, like you can see again, I'm not enraged by this if you want to see Barbie, go see Barbie, okay fine, yada yada yada. But the woke thing that destructive force has permeated throughout society everywhere. So now I want to connect it to something politically that's happening, of course right here in the free state of Florida because the flames of the woke, they end up burning everything down. One of the things that's happening right now is Florida is being attacked, well the Department of Education in Florida specifically and of course that means Ron DeSantis are being attacked because they are claiming that somehow we are not teaching black history correctly, that we are not teaching about slavery correctly and much more. Again, I want to reiterate that when I saw this story just a headline a couple of days ago, I knew we'd covered on the show in the next couple of days but I didn't even bother clicking because I was like it's so obviously nonsensical that there's no point addressing it. So my hope was it was going to just go away, of course it did not. Here is CBS News, they're a very serious corporate press organization covering this very serious and real story. Traversee over Florida's new education standards after Governor Ron DeSantis signed a bill called the Stop Woke Act last year. The changes include teaching middle schoolers that some enslaved people actually benefited from slavery because it taught them skills. Nancy Cordes is following all of this at the White House. Good morning Nancy. Good morning John, yes this debate may have started in Florida but it has now landed squarely in the middle of the presidential race. I didn't do it and I wasn't involved in it. Florida's Republican Governor Ron DeSantis tried to distance himself from the curriculum controversy but it didn't work. I didn't do it and I'm not involved in it are not the words of leadership. Florida's new history teaching guidelines approved last week stemmed from a 2022 law. Governor DeSantis called the Stop Woke Act. Governor DeSantis started this fire with the bill that he signed. The new standards say Florida students should be taught about the harsh conditions slaves endured but also about how slaves developed skills which in some instances could be applied for their personal benefit. They're probably going to show some of the folks that eventually parlaid you know being a blacksmith into into doing things later in life. That comment drew a swift rebuke from fellow Republican presidential candidate Will Heard. Okay now that sounds very very scary. Now first off I just want to address one thing about the skills issue because that's what seems to be everyone seems to be hung up on this skills thing. You know there is a uncomfortable truth related to this. No one is defending the horrors, absolute horrors of slavery. A human being has no right to own another human being and in the United States of America we fought a civil war very close to our inception to eliminate slavery. Slavery existed long before the United States slavery was not one of the founding principles of the United States. All of those things the the simple truth and we'll get to the way they're exaggerating all of this nonsense is that if you attained some skill however you attained it it's still a skill. So if you were a blacksmith on the plantation you were able to take that skill out you didn't immediately become an accountant the day slavery was over. That is no defense of slavery whatsoever and I have no doubt the media matter losers are watching this right now waiting for me to say it in some way that they can selectively edit but there is a truth to that you could make the same argument and here we go I mean I know it's gonna happen already but in the work camps right in World War II Nazi work camps they use they took people that had certain skills to do certain things to build buildings and undo and engineering horrible things you might have learned some skills there it doesn't mean any of it's good none of it's good none of it's none of it's just but it doesn't change a certain degree of reality but of course I'm gonna unpack why this is all nonsense but let's just do one more thing this is a political a political reporter Eugene Daniels really explaining again this is sort of the hysteria around this this is mostly because white kids feel about uncomfortable about reality. This teaching is from the Florida new curriculum there but also how governor DeSantis and his anti-woke policies have put him in a box with us speaking to a seemingly smaller and smaller portion of the electorate. This is what happens when you base your entire kind of political career on this when you say that everybody needs to be anti-woke that's where this is where you end up and when you talk to folks in Florida the whole point of the bill that came through this is in reaction to a bill that he wanted it was making clear what he wanted to folks and it's because he felt a lot of people around this country are starting to feel that we can't teach the correct history of this country because it makes white kids uncomfortable that is at the base of this right that it is uncomfortable to hear that people that look like you put people that look like me in chains and make them do things and beat them and rate them that is uncomfortable for kids to hear that is what folks is that is what these folks are saying but then when you use that as a political cudgel you have to own it right at this point this is on ronda santis it is he may not have created these policies or with the school board but at the end of the day he made it very clear what he wanted to the folks in that okay everything he said there is complete nonsense and if he wants to teach oh kid fourth grader fifth grader sixth grader whatever it might be people who look like you did this to people who look like me thus we must have equity right thus I must get a job instead of you thus I must get into the college instead of you that's the world that that guy wants to live in right that's the world that the supreme court just struck down the the decision to allow affirmative action as it relates to getting into colleges thankfully the supreme court did the right thing because we don't want systemic racism the idea that desantis is doing something because white kids are nervous about hearing reality no it's not true but before I get to any of that I'm just going to lay out more of the way the media are treating this verse reality we'll get to reality I promise you here's whoopi Goldberg completely lying about the thing trying to get through everything that's happened over the weekend and what's all the insanity going on in the world like Wednesday Florida's board of education approved what they're calling standards for African-American history I feel like they didn't talk to any African-Americans because we could have told them about the history and nor have anyone seemingly gone to the Smithsonian we're telling you this history it's our American history because you need to know so we don't repeat it and here you come to Santas trying to repeat it where you know what as long as the Smithsonian is standing as long as there are books as long as there are families because remember we didn't have books all these stories come to us from our families you don't call our families liars they know what happened because they're grandma's grandma's grandma's grandma's grandma told them you sir are you are I can't I can't even say the word you are I just grace we'll be right back all right first off whoopi you got to lay off the pipe I've heard from multiple sources you show up to that to show stone every day um I don't know what the high hell you're talking about the Santas is not trying to reinstitute the institute slavery or teach anyone that slavery didn't exist or anything like that but you flat out lied when she said that they should have talked to some black scholars about this because two of the scholars that were on the board who put this whole curriculum together and by the way we're gonna read you some of the curriculum and link to it down below you will find it is it in the description already yeah it's in the description already if you're watching this video right now we've already linked to it don't want to read it while telling you about it but yes there are two scholars who are black they are african-american dr william b allen and dr frances pressley rice so everything you just said there was complete nonsense speaking of complete nonsense the view actually had to cut a portion of ananavaros insane diatribe we're about to show you because she was using some foul language I'm you know I live in florida uh-huh I have been spitting mad about the cultural wars that ronda has been creating so when he says that he has nothing to do with it to blackies and minions to put that legislation into effect he has created the environment that has led to this how dare you shame on you people in florida how dare you try to whitewash slavery and to the commissioner of education in florida many dears a cuban american that is like saying that there's a redeeming quality to cuban political prisoners under castro when you don't have freedom you don't have anything and for this man ronda santis was apparently his only skill that he has acquired is lying and creating cultural wars that he thinks are going to make him president they're not buddy that's why you're 30 points down and uh i beg you to leave this horrific racist hellhole known as florida please leave don't put yourself through this it's making you very very angry again guys we're gonna get to the facts in just a moment but one more from the view because after whoopi lied about there being no black scholars on the thing alyssa farah she's the pet republican they pay her about a million bucks a year to pat her on the head and pretend she's a republican so she can always go after republicans she actually acknowledged that well there weren't some black scholars who wrote the curriculum i reached out to the santis's i reached out to the santis's team this weekend honestly in hopes that there was some decent explanation here and basically what i got from them was well there were some um black educators and scholars who contributed to this and it's been on the books for over a decade well a lot of things have been on the books for over a decade that shouldn't be and they're bad and they're terrible my friend will hern i think said it better than i could have which was it was literally the most dehumanizing institution subjugated people's property because they lacked any basic rights and freedoms this is ronda santis doing what i wanted to think there was better to him but i wonder i'm i'm realizing there's not okay so there she is she's not doing it to debunk whoopi but she's going on their train their train of lives let's continue with the train of lives because the thing that really lit this on fire was that vice president kamala harris the queen of venn diagrams uh she was very upset about this and then she appeared in florida here's a little video of her freaking out about this thing that's not real a thing we'll get to that and while they do this check it out they pushed forward revisionist history just yesterday in the state of florida they decided middle school students will be taught that enslaved people benefited from slavery they insult us in an attempt to gaslight us and we will not stand for it okay she's very outraged about what's going on here so um look at this i have a piece of paper in front of me and you're not going to believe this we've got the actual information about what's going on here this is from the national review i'll read it to you carefully and you'll get all of it uh i've been trying to work out how to best illustrate the sheer scale of harris's falsehood and i've come to the conclusion that the only way to achieve it is to list in one place all of the relevant parts of the courts about which she is complaining so below i have copied and pasted every single reference to slaves the slavery slaves abolishingism civil rights and african-americans that is in the document for those interested the folk in the full curriculum including curriculum for teaching of the holocaust is here by the way as i just said we've linked to it in our video that you're watching right now so you can read the entire thing for yourself there is simply no way of pursuing of perusing this course and concluding that it gas lights people or whitewashes slavery among many many other things it includes sections on the conditions for africans during their passage to america the living conditions of slaves in british north american colonies the caribbean central america and south america including infant mortality rates the harsh conditions and their consequences on british american plantations for example under nourishment climate conditions infant and child mortality rates of the enslaved versus the free the harsh conditions in the caribbean plantations poor nutrition rigorous labor disease how the south tried to prevent slaves from escaping and their efforts to end the underground railroad the overwhelming death rates caused by the practice the many ways in which africans resisted slavery the ramifications of prejudice racism and stereotyping on individual freedoms and the struggles faced by african-american women in the 19th century as it relates to issues of suffrage business and access to education many of these modules apply to florida specifically so yes florida is going all in on teaching reality there is nothing being whitewashed or anything else but you guys get it you guys get it if you do anything anything that is remotely against the woke they will come and try to destroy you and lie about you and it will be all the way up from the vice president often it's the president himself but from the vp to the harpies at the view to cbs to the activists online the whole freaking thing believe it or not i am still shocked about this i am i am so shocked i may fall out of my chair as we play you this video on cnn of all places they had this guy by the name of scott jennings and he actually told the truth what's amazing to me that how little comla heris apparently has to do that she can read something on twitter one day and be on an airplane the next to make uh something literally out of nothing this is a completely made-up deal i looked at the standards i even looked at an analysis of the standards in every instance where the word slavery or slave was used i even read the statement of the african-american scholars that wrote the standards not ronda santas but the scholars everybody involved in this says this is completely a fabricated issue and yet look how quickly comla harris jumped on it so the fact that this is her best moment a fabricated matter is pretty ridiculous but let's go okay so what i would like you to do if you care about this issue at all is actually after the show just read what's in it we gave you a nice summary from the national review right there but you know this is what i'm trying to show you is the playbook that these people use if you do anything right desantis was coming for the gays and then he was coming for trans and now he's coming for black people and you know these things are all lies right this is the freest most flourishing state in the union and i want to talk a little bit more about that right now because praeger you and you guys know i've had many connections with praeger you over the years denis has become i would say a mentor and a bonus uncle to me i've done i think four of their five-minute videos i've done a series of other things with them but praeger you has become an incredible idea powerhouse of sanity taking people all over the political spectrum who are fighting radicalism giving them a platform often people who don't agree with a lot of things that say a traditional conservative might agree with such as me such as tim pool such as jordan peterson and many others and allowing them to spread their ideas because there are good time tested ideas that should flourish in a place that's set up for many people of different walks of life and different views well florida now is once again going on offense so it's going to be lied about on this front uh florida will be incorporating some praeger you materials in the education system this is absolutely wonderful i want to read a quote about it from the miami new time so this is this is a leftist drag here's how they're framing it which is consistent with everything else that we just showed you praeger you a conservative nonprofit often criticized for downplaying systemic racism and promoting anti-immigrant theories announced today that florida is the first state to officially approve praeger you as an educational vendor a press release from the group states this fall in schools across america students will be watching praeger you videos in their classrooms as states officially make praeger you an approved educational resource the group claims it is partnering with as many states as possible to provide a conservative lesson plans touted as praeger you kids in response to request from teachers who are sick and tired of curriculum laced with radical political agendas according to the press release in the past teachers have been disciplined even fired for showing praeger you videos in their classroom now praeger you videos are not only being allowed in classrooms but superintendents and education commissioners are actively encouraging teachers to use praeger use content to educate their students praeger you supplemental curriculum offers an easy cutting edge way cutting edge way to teach core knowledge and subjects ranging from civics and history to entrepreneurship and financial literacy governor rondisanthesis office didn't immediately respond to a request for comment via email praeger use announcement comes as florida adopts new academic standards for black history classes in public schools with accordance with the state's controversial stop woke act signed into law by desantis in 2022 the legislation restricts instruction regarding systemic racism and bars educators from teaching that people are privileged or oppressed solely because of their race national origin or sex introduced in the fifth grade the very section on slavery in florida's black history curriculum closely mirrors a praeger use segment in which conservative pundit candis oans who is black reminds viewers that slavery was not invented by white people in response to a request for comment the florida department of education says that it reviewed praeger you kids and determine the material aligns to florida's revised civics and government standards whoo that was a lot of reading couple things i'd like to address there first off can't just was right slavery was not invented by white people and even if it was it wouldn't make all white people bad and all black people good just inherently based on that fact uh the opening paragraph on that phoenix could you give me the line on the opening paragraph on that again because it's really just great the way they frame everything look at this a conservative nonprofit often criticized for downplaying systemic racism the way they're framing it is that systemic racism exists except it doesn't and they do videos debunking it and actually the supreme court by eliminating affirmative action has just kneecapped systemic racism and also the next one and promoting anti-immigrant theories they don't promote anti-immigrant theories they promote that we should have a border that the nation state is actually important that some people are legal members of a society and some people are not so it is absolutely wonderful that praeger you will be part whatever it is part of the milieu of the florida education system and the media will go nuts and they will lie about all of it just like they're lying about what's happening in florida right now and you will see it relentlessly and and the whole purpose of today's show was whether they're showing you uh uh the entertainment style barbie things where they're destroying old things or whether they're whether they're lying to you about what's in your child's curriculum you got to figure out better ways out of this so that gets me to the to the last segment today because uh i was on charlie kirk's radio show yesterday uh they it's video and radio it's mostly a radio show but they simulcast the video uh and we got into the desantis uh trump situation i just want to say as i said up top charlie and i've been friends for years we've done dozens and dozens of events together usually with turning point usa uh charlie is firmly in the trump camp turning point from my humble opinion is basically a trump uh campaign arm right like that that they that's what they in effect are but charlie was gracious enough to have me on his show to say what i think about desantis uh so he asked me to make the case for governor desantis here you go kind of make the case especially to our conservative audience and then secondly how do you think his campaign is currently going you in essence should be loving every single thing that ronda santa's is done i i don't know one thing that ronda santa's uh has not done that we would have wanted him to do florida is safe its economy is absolutely booming we fund the police here we're getting esg out of our institutions we've done that which that's actually perhaps the biggest issue that people don't talk about that often because it's kind of in the weeds on how corporations are putting wokeness on all of us i know you talk about it but the average person doesn't and they certainly don't incorporate america uh he has fought disney he has fought the endless racialization of our children by getting rid of this ap african-american studies course that was in essence going to teach gender theory we've gotten some of these books that are sexualizing our children out of schools he has done literally everything that anyone right leaning could believe in or could possibly want to happen i would say he's done one or two things that are a little bit more like right leaning than than i would want oh they're perfect for me dave i gotta say i love that stuff no no absolutely but i would ask you what is there anything that ronda santa's you're at least the part no he he's um he's america's greatest governor i've said that and i and by the way i did i've said that repeated okay so it was good to hear first of i want to credit charlie charlie brought me on his show to let me say what i believed him as obviously i went ahead and did it charlie said right there that uh disantis has been america's greatest governor he later went on to say that i think his exact quote was 100 percent when i asked him if disantis was the best governor when it came to covid uh and then we got into a little bit of my criticisms around trump i thought you might find this one interesting but here's what i would like to see at a disantis we get talk after the break dave you know when we go to a college campus you say hey if you disagree go to the front of the line i want to say i want to see somebody get in the arena and say hey i i'm willing to throw out the script i'm willing to just take any question i'm willing to kind of just fight it's more kind of total and attitudinal um dave your reaction 20 seconds we'll pick it up after the break sure so look if in essence and we'll pick it up after the break if in essence your your point is oh i agree with virtually all of the policies that nobody has accomplished more than this guy and done everything i want to do but but there's a little bit of a marketing issue here all right i'll go with you on that and i think that can be dulled the base is very smart and they're constantly looking in a way of who's going to betray me next this is the advice i gave to disantis privately and publicly and right now the rubicon has been crossed where they think disant is going to betray i'm not even saying that's fair but i'm not saying it's fair i mean trump trump has done far more to betray the truth and and in a certain way the the respect of the base every time he lies about disant right so when he lies about covid and florida who who is the best governor for covid and flor uh covid in the country disantis 100 but who has more who has more who has done more work and more praise for paul ryan is it ronda santis or donald trump for paul ryan i can't i can't speak either way but at the same time we could talk about you after the break speak either way i mean i can show you plenty of videos of from talking about how much you love paul ryan but dave i okay now again credit to charlie he brought me on the show i was clearly ready to do it i later on read him the direct quote where governor disantis says that he has spoke to paul ryan once since being governor and i think not once with carl robed since he's been governor i might i might be getting that backwards right now um uh charlie didn't have much on that i wanted to show you one other clip in terms of the what we were getting to there about what there's a difference between getting the ideas right having the right set of policies and all that and what you're doing in terms of campaigning and making the argument against the other guy i will agree with you that in terms of some of the strategy of the rollout they probably should have been more aggressive i do see that changing look disantis just went on uh russell brand last week uh he just went on cnn for the first time last week i think he's doing megan kelly this week if i'm not mistaken and she's been very very critical of him uh russell's a lefty i mean he certainly uh isn't you know the one that you would call a traditional conservative by any stretch i would love to see him go on the view sit directly with those women and call out their endless lies about florida you know ana navaro who lives in miami who rails against florida every day he should sit right next to her and call her out um so if you want if your question is really do you want to take some of the the anger that the base has because of the way trump being treated and he's being treated horribly and i completely agree with that um i agree i agree there's probably some way to do that but i would also say to some extent if you just want to view this if you just want to view this in the political lens maybe this is why trump should stop lying about disantis every which way and you know he is everything he says about disantis this is a lie everything he says about art and thought i'll be honest it's also a lie when disantis goes after trump and says he was pro fauci and all that that's just not true but well he is fauci and a ward on the way out we're out of time david ruben thanks so much more after the break can i pat myself on my on my back on my show is that a little too self-illating or something he did give fauci and a ward on the way out and he did praise fauci endlessly and it's just so annoying to have to do this because i get what charlie's point is no matter what you say what in essence charlie was saying to me it's attitudinal and you know uh something like that what he's saying is no matter what you say that is true about trump unless you bow to the base and i think when he actually says base he means donors the trump donors i think is what he means uh that they will come to destroy you but the simple truth is trump ran we showed you the video once maybe you know we'll try to find it for the post-game show uh but trump when he was running re-election ran a video praising fauci as part of his re-election that's just reality that that is just reality and you have to make of it what you will anyway the point of all of this is that there is as i've been trying to lay out more and more and more and i will continue to and then when i go off the grid i'll get some time to just date with it and think about it and chew it and masticate it and come back masticate i said nothing that we have to get demonetized over i know it sounded a little different um i will come back with fresh eyes on all of this um but i think there is a way out of this nonsense but we have to stop the lives we have to stop the pure partisanship we have to call out the nonsense we have to stop burning down everything that was once good and a series of other things and i think we have to have an honest an honest debate at least those of us that are right leaning on what should happen in terms of this trump to send this thing and i want to throw back to one clip we've played this once or twice before but i think he makes a great point this is Jordan peterson on piers morgan talking about the trump the santa situation would you like him to run again would it be good for america do you think no i i don't think it would be good for america would it be good for him to run that's a that's a difficult question because it might be that it would be good for america to have whether or not donald trump should be president sorted out in the public sphere debated intensely and subject to an election so it might be very interesting to see him put himself forward on the republican ticket if i had my dr others um and i say this i hope with do care i would rather see someone like disantis step forward who shares some of that forthright um um strength let's say that characterizes trump at his best but seems to be a more uh cautious administrator and a less divisive figure i think that would be better okay so i love how jordan laid that out we probably have to have this fight publicly we're having this fight publicly and i think the challenge for you the challenge for me the challenge for everybody is find the honest arbiters within this not not just succumb to the trolls or whatever it might be not just denigrate everybody there are gajillions roughly i'd have to check the abacus of great trump supporters right of course and i went to trump rallies and these are great people and all of those things but as i've often said trump make the case for yourself stop insulting their intelligence like i don't like if you're going to make everyone think that up is down and left is right and somehow disantis was bad on covid and florida was worse than new york and that he's dishonest and and not loyal like all of this nonsense all of this nonsense but we as a country will have to decide do we want to burn it down and burn down all of our old things or do we want to figure out a way that will be more honest and real whether it's in our children's curriculum whether it's in our entertainment or our politics the question is posed and i suppose the american people will answer it we've got a post game show coming up in just moments at rubinreport.locals.com can we find that ad that trump put up a fauci and we'll put
