Appreciate you rolling with us. We have a very stacked show today. No surprise. It's going to be getting very busy day in and day out as we enter this presidential election cycle. Also some interesting polling out that we can get to in a moment. 18%. This is from Gallup. 18% of Americans are satisfied with the state of the nation. Now you might say, well, are people always a little curmudgeonly and salty about the state of the nation? Well, it's usually about 35% of people are satisfied. So that's a substantial drop. Hmm. You mean Joe Biden and the lunatic communists around him are doing things that make people less prosperous, safe, happy and sane? Yes. We tell you about this. We can come back to it though in a second. Obviously the house about to vote on the debt limit bill. Has that happened just quite yet? I think it's any it's going to be happening shortly here. So we'll check the latest on that. Rhonda Santis kicked off his campaign with a stop in Iowa. The Trump to Santis throw down is getting, shall we say, more heated, more interesting. Donald Trump also, those of you who are very online, as in spend time on Twitter, probably saw and some of you might have even seen it on Facebook or other places. Trump had some comments about his former press secretary, Kayleigh McEnany, who's a friend of mine, a friend of Clay's. We will discuss what the former president's truth social post was all about. That'll be coming up. There's some interest. A lot of interesting stuff, even I think, interesting stuff going on in the sports world right now with the Dodgers and now a Toronto Blue Jays player making the requisite. I'm sorry. I offended the wokeness hostage video. Clay will lay some of that out for some of that out for us. We've got a political development that I want to dive into here in a second. But first, Clay, I don't know how many of you remember the movie Road Trip, but there's a whole scene with what was that comedian's name on where he says, was it was it Tom Green? Is that right Tom Green? And he says he's going to unleash the fury. Clay just got a clay just put out a tweet. And I was like, clay, are you unleashing the fury with a tweet about something happening at ESPN? What happened, Clay? What's going on? And we can we want to return to this in a little a little later. Yeah, next hour, I'm going to dive into this in a big way. But tomorrow is Pride Month. And you all know that I mean, it is the gayest day of the year. And that's not meant as an insult. June 1st is the gayest day of the year where everybody is bedecked in pride flags. And and it is impossible to mistake the entire month. Many people have pointed out that we get one day to celebrate those who have died serving our country. We get a full month to celebrate gay people that obviously always happens with Memorial Day coming in close consult with June 1st. So ESPN. So there's evident I had to do research on this book. And I don't know if you are aware of this. Traditionally, the pride flag is just a rainbow, right? Yes, because the rainbow in theory would represent all colors. They have now modified the rainbow because the rainbow was not inclusive enough. And they now have like some sort of like arrow that is a trans flag. Trans flag. Where they consider to be the trans like, Oh, I, I study left is um, constantly. I know they've changed this one. But isn't it fascinating? Because there's no whole point of the rainbow that it is all the colors literally everything. The whole point is that it's supposed to be everything. Yeah, they're literally could not be anyone not incorporated in the rainbow flag, which was the entire purpose of the rainbow, which now has been taken over by gay people. I don't know. This happened in conversation recently. One of my kids said, uh, you know, every time I see an actual rainbow, I think now about the gay pride flag because the gay community has so taken over the rainbow. You haven't though, unleash the fury. So to speak on Twitter by breaking some news and then seeing all the reaction to it. What's going on? So this year, ESPN is not just raising the gay flag. I am told this is the first year that they will be raising the transgender gay flag. Now, some of you out there may say, okay, what's the significance here? ESPN right now is foremost in advocating for men who identify as women to be able to participate in women's athletics. And in fact, ESPN ran and I believe we played it on the show. An advertisement buck calling Lee at Thomas, one of the women sports heroes of the year. This is a dude who was around the 400th best college men swimmer who became the best women swimmer in, I believe the 500 meter, if I remember correctly, set the NCAA championship, this past March. So they have had a few brave people who have spoken out. Sam Ponder, who some of you may know, Sage Steele, two women have come out and said, this is ridiculous. I'm not going to allow this to happen anymore without speaking out on it. So this feels buck like a direct shot back at those women. Sam Ponder was called a bigot by USA Today for advocating for women sports to only be a part of women. So they are now having a public flag raising of the transgender flag over the Bristol Connecticut campus of ESPN as many of their female employees who are speaking out are being called bigots and transphobes. And so this feels like a direct corporate shot at those employees who are speaking out on behalf of women's athletics. It strikes me, Clay, that it is entirely now because of a Supreme Court decision some years ago, legal to burn the American flag as a form of speech. But I have seen numerous stories recently of people not even necessarily damaging a flag. But let's say, wasn't there someone who I think left higher skid marks on a pride mural or something? Yes, in the street. And that's a hate crime. But burning a so if you burn a pride flag, if you own the flag, that is criminal. But if you burn an American flag, that is protected speech. Do I have that right? Because that's the way it seems. I think it has not gone to the Supreme Court. And so there are states that are prosecuting to your side right now, there are places where you could so you can be prosecuted for burning. I just want ever to be clear on this because there are cases people are prosecuted for burning a pride flag. You will not be prosecuted for burning an American flag. In fact, the left will tell you that's the highest form of patriotism. Yeah. And then I think in our staff can correct me if I'm wrong on this, but I believe in this sounds like a made up hypothetical story that would be in a law school exam. I believe a homeless man, they are now called unhoused people. Yes, I know they've changed the term again. Yeah. Yeah. Homeless man used a gay pride flag to wipe his bottom and was charged with a crime in New York City for crime. So that's right. Crime. And so I suspect, Buck, this will go all the way to the Supreme Court. And I am such a free speech absolutist. And I understand some of you are going to disagree with this. I actually think you should be able to burn the American flag. I disagree with it. I don't support it in any way. I want to be clear. But then should you be able to burn a pride flag? 100%. That's what I'm saying. I think this would go all the way to the Supreme Court because it is a form of political commentary, whether you agree with it or not, the logic and consistency there would require that these statutes which seek to punish people for doing so are unconstitutional. And this is why hate crime laws are slippery slope. There are crimes, right? There are crimes that people should be punished for the notion that there are things where you could be punished for action that is otherwise entirely legal because it offends certain people. No, I disagree with that. There are cases even in I remember actually actually did my college thesis 20 years ago now on campus speech codes and the various ways now I know this is private institutions, but they would find ways to punish and they would use criminal laws the basis for it to punish people for doing things that would be entirely protected under all circumstances except the wrong feelings are hurt and then all of a sudden there has to be action. So I think that's an interesting side component of this debate. We've kind of gotten deeper into this now than we had anticipated. So we'll have to hold some of the political discussion about the the primary for for a few minutes. But Clay, can you tell me about this? This do we? I think we have it, right? The blue here we go. Blue Jays picture, Anthony Bass apologize for a posting of video endorsing boycotts of places like Target and Bud Light play five. I recognized yesterday. I made a post that was critical to Pride community, which includes friends of mine and post family members of mine. And I'm truly sorry for that. I just spoke with my teammates to have been shared with them my actions yesterday. I apologize with them. And as of right now, I'm using the blue Jays resources to better educate myself. Oh God, yeah, I can't. Honestly, I can't. I'm using the resources. I'm excited to go into the reeducation camp where my transgressions will result in struggle sessions. Give me a break, Clay. Like I mean, this is this is why we actually need, you know, you need to take action. You need to speak out because otherwise this happens to everybody. Well, and and by the way, the groveling doesn't work because a Toronto newspaper columnist has already demanded that this guy be fired. Of course, because even when you throw yourself prostrate on the apology Olympics here, the to try to apologize for things that you actually believe that managed in some way to upset someone, it isn't actually, it isn't actually possible to do so. And so's Anitsyn's Gulag archipelago. There's a really haunting, there's some haunting passages really where he gets into your initial arrest on your way to being sent to the Gulag and the apparatus functionaries who would be there, you know, interrogating you, torturing you and everything else. They knew you were innocent, but they wanted you to give a confession just because then that made the process of completely destroying you even easier. And they would get more and more frustrated the longer you held out on that confession. But the point is confessing did nothing for you. Like they would say just confess and we'll make it stop. Just confess. No, when you confess, then they send you to the Gulag for 10 or 20 years and you're, you know, the chance of survival is very, very slim. That's the way it is to to bend the knee to the woke mob. It's not like your confession results in some better treatment for you. Your confession merely becomes admission of you being a bad person that needs to be punished further. So there's never any point in it. That's why this guy, I feel like he's a pitcher. Is he a very good pitcher? I have no idea. Is he a good player? You know what, Buck, this is one of those things where I know a lot about the Atlanta Braves, my chosen favorite team. Baseball. Hey, baseball fans. You have you. Okay, buddy. Put me on blast here for being inadequately knowledgeable about the Toronto Blue Jays roster. Many of you out there, maybe Blue Jays roster experts. I am not for the baseball fans in the audience. Trust me, if this guy was a second string tight end playing in the SEC 20 years ago, Clay would Clay would tell you what his class schedule was, but okay. Blue Jays. Yes. Yeah. So anyway, but this guy apologizes and what does he get for it? Nothing. But it's fascinating. This is now when people are starting to say, maybe we should step up. Remember, this is for Bud Light. He's shared. I think he shared or liked a video. It wasn't even him talking about endorsed. I mean, boy codding Bud Light and boycotting target. But because he liked that action, which remember in the target situation, it's for making bathing suits that hide men's penises. Yes. That are supposed to be women's bathing suits. Okay. That's really what we're talking about. I think four. I mean, what is the thing? Like, what have you done that's so transgressive? So the I just, it's the groveling. I hate when they make people do this. I hate when they make people do this, but it's it's not about him. I would just know. Has anyone ever groveled for a left wing opinion? I'm trying to think. I mean, they're have, I mean, I'm sure we could find some people who didn't say the right thing and the left came after them. No, no, I mean, for having too far left wing of an opinion, not like I misspoke and like said something and people were mad at me. I mean, like you said the most outlandish far left wing thing imaginable. I can't recall anyone ever being required to apologize for that. No, I, I can't either. I think they always leave space for that. But there's also maybe a lesson here, which is that our side gets distracted fighting with each other or trying to placate the other side. Their side has an amazing and consistent focus on destroying the country. So there's something to be learned, something to learn from her, apologize period, not if you sometimes misspeak. We might say something stupid on this show. Trust us. I'm sure you probably think we do it all the time. But apology for misspeaking is different than apologizing for what you actually believe in. You should never do the latter. We have an announcement about somebody, not like we are now, just to be clear, we're not announcing it, but there is an announcement out there about somebody else who is entering the presidential contest here on the Republican side. We shall discuss that and a whole lot more here coming up in a second. You know, online data breaches happen so often these days they don't get reported very much.

The number of Republicans who are running for president continues to grow. Chris Christie is reportedly going to announce. What's the date next week, Buck officially Wednesday, next Wednesday of next week. Chris Christie is going to officially announce and enter the race. We of course will invite him to come on this program as we've invited virtually anyone who has announced for the presidency so far. This buck and we'll talk about this when we come back because I think it is kind of significant. This would be the first person other than the santis who might be willing to challenge Trump. Now, I don't think Chris Christie has a chance to be the nominee, but do you agree with that based on the way things are going so far? Maybe Mike Pence is going to enter, but Christie would be the first person other than the santis to be able to go toe to toe at least after. So here's what I think. I think I think Chris Christie is on a political kamikaze mission and his only his only goal is interesting. Right. DeSantis is out there talking about why he thinks he would do a great job. Everyone other than Trump is pretty much attacking the santis. Tim Scott's not really attacking anybody. He's just sort of telling inspiring story about himself and about America. But you know, other Canada. Anyway, we'll come back into this. Christie just wants to get into settle scores with Trump. I think that's what you're looking to see. He might try to do to Trump what he did to Marco Rubio, which if those of you who remember in 2016, we will discuss in the meantime, you don't want to be like the Biden administration.

I don't know how many of you had a show that you really remember very fondly growing up in your teenage years. I think it's I think depending on what generation you are, I don't know. For some of you, it might be a happy days for clay. It's probably mash, you know, because he was a teenager when mash was here. And you're your insistence, by the way, based on three years of difference. I know. I'm I the same age as your older brother? Yeah, you're the same age as my older brother. Well, I think it's great that was a people are just like, Hey, you got to lay off clay. Like so he's a little bit older. We were out to dinner the other day. People don't realize this. And and and they were like, somehow our ages came up and they they said, but you look, you look really young for your age, which implies to me that I looked super old for my age, too. And we're three years apart. Clay and I, Clay and I could have been on the same, like, high school athletics team. He could have been aging me. That's a good point. In the last year, even a freshman when I was a senior. Yep. Yep. We could have been on the same high school team, but I do I love this joke is occasionally people caught on this the joke and they're just like, Hey, lay off, you know, clays, you know, it's like, it's like clays. Anyway, you haven't been through the war of three kids yet. They will age you. I mean, the lack of sleep for about 20 straight years or whatever it is, 16 straight years of having kids. Now that we're all grown up, you know, my mom who had four show, he says she she if she could go back, she would have eight. And I'm always like, well, is that because you've, is that because the four have all grown up and you're now in grandma mode? You know, so it's I would, you know, I would keep having him. We had Katie, who you've met has been with us for almost nine years now. And initially, she was in charge of taking care of all the kids buck. Now she's kind of in charge of me. And she's having a baby. And so I feel like we're having another baby coming into the household. I'm excited about it because I would keep having so I'm encouraging you and carry however many kids you want add one. Yeah. And one day, I'll tell stories of I actually had an English nanny growing up and she would walk around and she would just, she would get furious. She'd be like, did you take my keys? Did I did we take her keys? And she had always had them on a little necklace around her neck. But we could never get her. She always thought I was taking I was like five. I didn't take your keys, lady. I swear. Anyway, she was very Mrs. Doubtfire. Oh, actually, Mrs. Doubtfire. We look at this differently now, the whole Mrs Doubtfire situation. One of the biggest movies of the 90s, actually, you know, that would be totally unacceptable. Although I made that argument. And then people said, you know, Madea might be the one that protects Mrs. Doubtfire because right if you cancel the stout fire, you have to cancel Madea. So how we got on this other than the silly stuff is, I remember I grew up and the shows that had the most impact on my on my formative teenage years would be Beverly Hills 902 and now maybe just explains a lot of my worldview and saved by the bell. Right. So Beverly Hills, not a two and O and say both both said in California, which is interesting to me now. What I always say, I grew up thinking California was the promised land that I would move to somewhere when I was older. But for a lot of people, it was Dawson's Creek, which I watched a little bit of. And this is what got me thinking about this. How many of you remember the show Dawson's Creek guys and girls? I liked it to 45 and under, I think, would you know, be probably Dawson's Creek, you know, from I don't know what the age limit would be point being James Vanderbeek, who played Dawson and Dawson's Creek. I haven't I haven't seen him in public in a very long time. I don't know what the guy's been up to. You know, hopefully he's doing great, you know, selling insurance out in Scottsdale or something. I have no idea what he's doing. But here he is pointing out that the DNC is just in this all out shutdown mode. He says no debate, no democracy. And that's an interesting point. Play a cannot get over the fact that the Democratic National Committee is saying they will not be a debate to decide the nominee for president. Are you kidding me? There's no debate. There's no debate or an 80 year old man. If he lives with me, the oldest sitting president in the history of the country. And if he doesn't live as the vice president, his approval rating is worse than his. How do we have a government? How do we have a democracy? If we're letting a small little back room of people make all the important decisions for us. That's not a democracy. And it doesn't work. Because you all have been wrong about a lot. These last couple of years in that back room, no debate, no democracy. Dawson's Creek for the win clay, pointing something out here Democrats aren't allowed to even talk about the fact that Biden so all that's preposterous. I talked about this on Fox News and I never would have believed that this would be the case that we would be reacting to James Vanderbeek, aka Dawson Leary, aka varsity blues Johnny Moxon, one of the all time great high school sports movies, high school movies, maybe period. He was phenomenal in that as a Texas high school quarterback legend. But Buck, he also said Biden's got dementia as a part of this. And it's fascinating to me that that Dawson Leary, James Vanderbeek is more insightful on the DNC process than anyone on MSNBC or CNN has been so far throughout the primary season. Isn't basic honesty a fascinating thing when it's been swept away for so long. There's not a single Democrat who could make a case that Joe Biden is not beyond the senior moments that would raise questions about this not a single one. Yeah. And yet they all go along with this. It really does feel like a mass formation or mass formation psychosis. It feels like everybody on the Democrat side has to go along with this craziness that they don't believe in. And then that brings me to this. I got it. Look, I got to say another friend, you know, we talked about Kaylee before another friend of the show below Riley, right? I remember watching, you know, back when back got back when I was in college and afterwards watching bill at eight PM on Fox for many years. Talented broadcaster, you know, and he's been on the show a few talks talking about his books and you were recall, he got one thing totally right. He came on and he said, well, Buck is a brilliant guy and a genius, but he's and then he got the thing wrong when he said, but he's totally wrong about Biden being the nominee. Now Biden has announced. So in my head, I was thinking, look, I don't want to be that guy that says, ha ha, I got this right. But I was thinking to myself, well, ha ha bill, I got this one right. I want to be clear. Bill, we got him here. Bill is still sticking with the prediction, everybody. And I admire the the gumption. Is that the right word? Is that the right word? Yes, the right one. I admire the gumption here. He still believes at this point, Biden will not be the nominee. Play nine. The problems that we are facing now, particularly with this axis of evil, are very, very worrisome. And the open border, as I said, all boy, it's going to lead to this real, real trouble. And he does not have control, Biden, of the federal branch of government, the executive branch, he just doesn't have control of it. He will not run again. I sticking by my prediction. He will not be the democratic nominee. Can I can I what's what's your sense of this one? So I understand the argument of why Biden's not going to be the nominee. Here's the challenge. Maybe we need to get Bill O'Reilly on to work with you. But do you do you agree or disagree? You think he is or is not at this point? So if he's not going to be the nominee, they have to force him out by September. And the reason why I say that is if they wait till after September, Kamala Harris is going to be the nominee. And there is a zero percent chance that they want Kamala as the nominee. His so the logic behind his opinion is Biden is too weak of an incumbent to be the standard bearer for Democrats in 2024. I don't disagree with that. I think Biden is going to be the weakest incumbent president in any of our lives. And I think he should lose, not that he will, but I think he should lose. The problem is the protection on some level for Biden here, Buck is Kamala would be an even worse candidate. So if they are going to try to force Biden out, they have to open up the primary process and allow an actual race to take place. So I I think it's the logical choice, Buck. I really do. But I think it has to happen by Labor Day. All right. Well, I'll just I'm doubling down on Biden's going to be the nominee, everybody, just to be clear. If I were betting right now, I would go Biden nominee. Remember, like maybe a month ago, I felt like the long knives were coming out when the Washington Post had their story about how awful. And then nothing really came of it. It kind of has faded. If they're going to force him out, and it would be a force out. Yeah, it has to happen by Labor. To be clear, a true, a true and sudden health issue of some kind. Yeah, that's that would mean that could still, but that can happen to literally any president that could happen to anyone who was running for office. I mean, you know, God forbid, but you never know, but in terms of the political decision-making and calculus, at this point, I think I think it has to be. But you know what, we, you know, we should do. Why don't we get bill back on? I've built on next week. We should have it back on because it has to happen. You agree with me. If it's going to happen, non health related, it would have to happen in the next 90 days or so because they would not want Kamala. If it happens next year, Kamala is the nominee, right? They don't want Kamala as a nominee. So the fore sound is to get a better choice. Kamala is a worse choice than Biden. Can I tell you something? I think some people think is crazy and light up those lines with this debate we're having here, 800-282-2882. I think Democrats think they have a better chance of getting Kamala elected president than they would Gavin Newsom. I really believe that. I think they think that she would be better. Let's let's we let that meridate a little bit. I could explain why. Yeah, we'll come back to it in a moment. But you know, the other week, I got to host an in-depth interview online with an extraordinary market analyst with a name that I know well, Mason Sexton. He's also my dad. I'm look, look, I'm very proud of his career, including what he's focusing on now, which he calls the great disruption of 2023. In the past, on TV, dad predicted the stock market crash of 1987, the top of the market before the COVID crash. He's had many major calls that have been verified that are in print. What he sees coming now is unlike anything we've ever seen. And you can get in on it now so you know how to prepare and what to do. In this interview, he revealed the exact date. In fact, this July, when he thinks things turn ugly in the market, we've already already been seeing the signs of disruption banks going under real estate losing its value at a rapid rate, inflation causing sticker shock at the grocery store. My dad, Mason will tell you why he thinks most analysts are wrong about a coming lost decade in stocks and why what's coming could be much worse in many ways. This is his first major prediction for the public in 30 years. If you missed it, the video is still up. You can watch it. Go check it out. The replay is available now at disruption2023.com. That's disruption2023.com. Emma is expensive and in short supply. Did you know you can train without ammunition at your house using the Mantis X?

What other than attacking Trump? What is the motive for him to enter this race? Because I don't think I think his moment has passed. He had a moment. I think he primarily squandered it and then went and blew up Marco Rubio's presidential race. So there is a precedent for him just basically taking out someone else. What other than trying to take out Trump? What is Chris Christie doing here, Buck? I think that it's one. This is what Chris Christie is all about. He wants to be out there rumbling in public, right? He wants to be part of the fight and in the spotlight again. I think that's a big component of this, which is true of a lot of politicians. You know, there has to, Glenn, I always joke around there's something a little off about anyone who could sit for three hours a day talking into a microphone. Like you got to be a special type to just be like, I want to sit around and talk for hours a day. But also anybody who wants to get into, I think it's even a level above those who are willing to put themselves out there and get into politics at a high level where there's going to be the scrutiny, the pressure, the forces are right against them. So I think this is just he's a guy who likes the fight. And he also really takes it very personally. Just so everyone remembers, I believe, and I'm asking for a fact check from the team as I say this, but I believe Chris Christie was denied anything in the Trump administration because Jared Kushner had a father who was a convicted felon. And Chris Christie was the US attorney who oversaw that conviction, that felony conviction, which was later pardoned by Donald Trump, that conviction. And so I think when, you know, there are a lot of people in politics that have, they have little feuds and things come and go. And as I've said, for example, before, I think Ted Cruz was a phenomenal ally of Trump when he was president, even though they had a bruising primary, and Ted did what was best for conservatism and best for the country. And I think I think Trump appreciated Cruz when he was president too. I think he was a an eloquent spokesman for many of the America first policies. Chris Christie, it's the opposite direction of he's he's, you know, the, the feud is very real. This is not going away. I think he feels snubbed that I think he wants to go after Trump. And what's interesting is you can tell like the problem with some of the others, whether it was Kasich or Rubio, is that when they tried to get down in the mud, I don't even think Marco Rubio would disagree with this. He's not comfortable in the mud. That's not where he lives. He's not a mug guy, you know, he's not a guy who likes to get into it that way. Chris Christie is, yeah, he is happy to throw down with Trump in that way. So it could be quite a spectacle when they get on the debate stage, but even just in the media, the war of words in the media will be interesting. Yeah. Also, I wonder if this makes it even more likely that Trump doesn't debate. Because if you think that Chris Christie is just in the race to attack you and that he's going to do to you, what he tried to do to Marco Rubio, why would Trump step on the debate stage purely from if Trump's got a lead and he knows, look, a lot of these guys, I think are whether it's Vivek, whether it's Tim Scott, whether it's Nikki Haley, there's a certain element of auditioning for the Trump administration, right? Running for VP or Secretary of State or fill in the blank. 100% that's unlikely that if Trump were on the stage with them, they would really go after him aggressively. What's interesting though is what you've had up to this point is, and look, I think Chris Christie's he's done a lot of appearances on MSNBC and telling Morning Joe, you know, so I do think we should have him on once he announces. I think that will be interesting. I want to hear him out on this one. I remember and a lot of UT partyers out there will remember this too. Christie was phenomenal at taking on when I say tea party is around the same period of time, you know, 2011, 2010, taking on the teachers unions in New Jersey that were just just completely, you know, they were running the school system as their own little personal piggy bank and don't care about the kids at all. And he called that out. So he has, you know, he has that enemy has that ability. Anyway, what I think is interesting from a political dynamics place, Clay, is you have people like Nikki Haley and Vivek who will attack DeSantis. Yep. Right. And we've pointed out they don't attack Trump, but they'll attack DeSantis. Okay. That's their call, their strategy, whatever. But the media narrative will be different when Chris Christie's in because he's only going to be attacking Trump, I think. So, you know, the having the having your second and third, you know, tier, if you will, sniping at DeSantis, there's going to be a different approach or a different media commentary when you have Chris Christie throwing haymakers at Trump, which is what's going to happen. Yeah, I think it's less likely that Trump goes into the debates. I remember that's happening as soon as August. So I mean, we're talking about about to be June, right? Tomorrow. So we're talking about just a couple of months away, 60 days from now. And I also think this could be, as you said, the first person to enter the race that is doing something other than trying to genuine, you know, fleck that Trump's altar, someone who is legitimately against him. I have a lot of friends who are big Chris Christie people. But I've never seen Chris Christie in a presidential campaign where I thought, Oh, this guy looks like the president of the United States. He's always seemed kind of like a bomb thrower. He's a brawler. And what's it? He's really the only person that you can think of who, you know, you know, remember in Jeremy Gwire, which he's like, I'm not as good at the insults as she is. Chris Christie may be as good at the as the insults at the insults as Trump is. We'll see. I think that's where this is headed.
