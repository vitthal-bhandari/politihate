I hope all of you had fabulous weekends We certainly did or rather Year now to fight for truth justice and the American way I would like to think so many different stories We're gonna dive into today The battle officially underway. I would say in Iowa between Ron DeSantis and Donald Trump What did we see over the weekend and why is the Hawkeye state there? So incredibly important more so than all of the national polls you are going to be paying attention to We got some interesting numbers out of the West Virginia Senate race with Jim Justice the current governor now in We'll talk to you a little bit about that covid retrospective now that the covid Emergency is officially over. We've got some incredible clips to just demonstrate how many lies you were all told about Daniel penny, of course has been charged. He has raised millions of dollars. We will discuss for his defense Buzzfeed and vice both under siege. What does that tell us about the era of media that we are currently in vice? Many of you will know and be familiar somewhat with that company has officially gone bank Or up the nation wants you to question why did the lee at Thomas get so much media attention and women's sports? Which will be fun, but buck we begin with the situation that continues to I think be probably the biggest lie in in in maybe the entirety of Democrat politics which is saying something and that is the idea that Joe Biden and Mayorkas and the entire Democrat party establishment continues to embrace They are arguing Regularly still that the biggest threat to this country is white supremacy and Joe Biden went to Howard University in Washington D to deliver the commencement address there and I want to lay you this audio Remember Biden said The fire not a divider I'm going to speak to the soul of this nation It is probably the biggest failure of his presidency relative to the promises he made That he would bring back normalcy to the American body Politiki has not done that and this I believe is the biggest lie that is embraced anywhere in politics It is the idea that suddenly in the 2020s no one ever said this in the 1980s No one ever said this in the 1990s. No one said this in the 2000s suddenly in the 2020s This idea of white supremacy this boogeyman that doesn't exist So clay your your audio is having a little trouble So let's let's just get to the white supremacy issue here as raised by Joe Biden in the in the speech at at Howard University A lot of people. I'll just tell you everybody a lot of people are having a moment here They're like Joe Biden is even more shameless and reckless than we anticipated play the clip stand up against the poison White supremacy as I did my inaugural address to a single out as the most dangerous terror Spector homeland is white supremacy And I'm not saying this because I'm on a black HPCU I Say wherever I go Now there are so many questions here first off in what universe is It a thing you should bring up at a I mean it was a it was a graduation wasn't it? This is Yeah, it's a commencement address Graduating class so what is what is this telling and this is that historically black college, you know HPCU historically black college or university? So it's one of these moments in time you say Joe Biden takes this an opportunity where he could be inspiring people where he could be Telling them about one celebrating the accomplishment that they've already had graduating from Howard's a great school People go off from Howard and do great things you would think that's the moment But for Joe Biden going into an election year looking as decrepit and dementia addled as he often does whatever pandering he has to do whatever level of Political just cheap shot he has to take he's willing to and that's why when he says he's talking about how white supremacy is the biggest Terrorist threat to the homeland. I would sit here and say Okay, what what is the scale of this terrorist? How many people in a country of 330 million people? Clay when we look at the data are dying from white supremacist terrorism any given year and we could also have a whole conversation about People who used to say that we over over-emphasize jihadist terrorism, but we had a not even really a multi-billion multi-trillion dollar Security apparatus that was overwhelmingly devoted to that problem which was dealing with a very small percentage of the population in this country and They were always saying we're exaggerating the jihadist threat and then you look at this the white supremacist threat Okay Why why is he telling everybody this at this at this graduation and what really is the scale of this threat? These are the questions that I would want someone to ask Joe Biden Yeah, look the reality here is pretty clear This is a made-up story and for everybody out there listening to us right now I would just break down the 1970s the 1980s the 1990s the 2000s Did we hear this argument about white supremacy at all? Did we ever hear anyone out there saying oh the nation is under a desperate attack from white supremacists? Of course not and so what has happened and you can even see it buck. We've talked about this on the show the New York Times the Washington Post They've sort of CNN MS NBC taken this lie and run with it. Well, that's this is where I wish I mean, I really wish if we want to have a real conversation about crime Remember I've said this before buck, but Ross Perot style Do you remember when he used to back in 1992 rent out time and stand in front of an easel with like his pointer? And he would talk about the budget deficit and he just basically would try to make an argument and be like a 30-minute presentation I Feel like we need that on crime in this country, right? Who is actually committing the crimes who is actually dying? Because the reality is every time there's a mass shooting and you pointed this out well, and I think it's important people rush out and talk About the mass shootings, but if we eliminated every mass shooting in America 98 percent of murders would still happen And the reality is white supremacists commit almost no murders in the entire country Murders are occurring overwhelmingly. Let's be honest. It's like people won't actually talk about it Young black men between the ages of like 16 and 40 represent around 2% of the population and commit half of all murders It's actually it's actually more like 60% now. Yeah over half of all murders committed by young black men between the ages of 16 and 40 Now, why will people not say that because they're terrified they're gonna get called racist well You can't solve a problem in this country until you acknowledge where the problem is coming from and buckets Not just Biden may orcas who's a disaster at the border Echoed Biden and said white supremacy is the number one problem in America I think we have that audio I would submit to you white supremacy is not in the top 50 It's not in the top hundred. I'm not sure it's in the top 250 biggest issues that this country is facing right now But the lie that is being spread listen to this my orcas endorses Biden's big lie the president yesterday at his commencement address For the Howard University graduates called white supremacy The major domestic terror threat in this country is that correct? It practically is you know in the terrorism context domestic violent extremism is Our greatest threat right now individuals are driven to violence because of ideologies of hate anti-government sentiments false narratives personal grievances and like and Regrettably we have seen a rise in white supremacy Okay, first of all they they it's a constant Democrat talking point. There's more hate crimes. There's a rise in white supremacy It is basically always a lie they do this by changing the definitions Changing the way they calculate the statistics, you know, this is what you always hear Oh, there was such a rise in white supremacy for example under the Obama administration That's just not every time you've looked at an analysis And I used to do this because I would go and argue with people during the Obama administration on TV about this They would change the way they calculated hate crimes and and you know things like that that are related to white supremacy So that they could make this case. Oh, it's gotten so much worse. It's not true the media talking about it has amplified as magnified Dramatically, but let's understand something here a couple things are come to mind play when they're doing this They're doing this propaganda on the media one is They create a circumstance where they mobile they they separate people based upon race Gender whatever and then mobilize them on those characteristics and what this allows then is anyone who says hold on Why are you doing this? We're all Americans? Why are you separating us by race? Why do you insist on trying to aggravate old racial wounds for your own political benefit? Anyone who says that is a part of the white supremacy problem, right? Anyone who actually argues for just treating everybody as as fellow Americans and or you know fellow human beings Is treated like they're part of the problem based on the rhetoric that they deploy and then specifically on the terrorism threat I mean you you asked about this question How many people walking around of all races ethnicities and backgrounds right now? They walk around and they go oh my god I'm so scared of the white supremacist terrorist who might come in right now or I'm scared of the white supremacist terrorists When I get on an airplane or whatever we all inherently know we instinctively know this is bizarre This is some fantasy land that they've concocted in a country of 330 million people there might be one or two Mass casualty white supremacist lunatics shooting people or something in any given year that are really clearly Not just someone who's insane not just somebody but somebody who's actually attached himself to an ideology Why won't they release the Nashville trans terrorist manifesto? Because then the narrative of white supremacy and white supremacist terrorism is useful for explaining the failures of the Democrat party away At the border in cities where there's violence. Oh if you talk about it your white supremacist And as you know clay they attach all of this to Donald Trump and the January 6th insurrection They were saying pardon me January 6 riot. They called it insurrection They were saying this stuff about Trump before any that even happened So they're just changing all the definitions and they're obviously engaged in I think just a massive con against the American people by Pretending like this is a much bigger and Biden's the absolute worst and buck note what they've done And I think this is important too Democrats have so devalued Accusations of racism that they don't even hardly use the word racism anymore, right? They've now moved on from racism to white supremacy Because people start to ask questions and I think it was a good one. Wait a minute if Racism exists shouldn't it exist across multiple different racial groups and of course Democrats would argue no only white people can be racist But when everything is racist, it's the boy who cried wolf theory It doesn't really motivate anymore And so they have tried to go to the new scare tactic the next phrase up is white supremacy Which buck you can legitimately track in the media when I say no one talked about white supremacy as a danger in the 1970s 80s 90s 2000s that's 100% true it didn't exist as a phrase that was used and I would just ask all of you out there When do you think there were more white supremacists the 1970s or the 2020s? This idea that somehow in 2023 We've got an influx of white supremacists. No in 1970s. There were way more white supremacists The reality is there's never been very many of them and most of them are powerless and they have almost no economic Muscle behind them and so they've created this new boogeyman look underneath the bed Oh the bit the awful white supremacist is there when the reality is it just doesn't exist As a legitimate threat to argue that it's the biggest threat that America faces today Is such a transparent lie that you have to ask yourself Why are they trying this and why are their allies in the media continuing to boost it and the reality is this is what identity politics requires This is what the Democrat Party is it's the oppression Olympics and white men have to be at the peak of Power in order to justify everything that Democrats are trying to do Come back into more on this will also take some of your calls also gonna be curious for those of you who are paying attention to it There was a little bit of a of a bruja ha ha an embryo over the weekend An issue where the Santis was in Iowa and there were photos and he was going around seeing people being on a he was on a barbecue Trump was supposed to be there and the Trump team says that it was because of tornadoes The non-Trump team says it was because of lackluster attendance Which one do you believe?

Why are these companies collapsing? I would argue it's because they've gone so woke buck that they are fundamentally dishonest with their audiences And here is a perfect representation of that. I saw this on sunday The nation which is an unabashedly far left wing outlet Sin out this tweet. I think they're actually I mean their commies I mean that pejoratively, but I think they think of themselves as commies too. I mean they are Radical left they are lunatics even for far left wing It is far left wing right the nation for those of you who have not paid attention Uh, that is how bad they are, but they send out this tweet When lea thomas first entered the women's in c double a swimming scene in 2021 She got the kind of attention Rarely given to swimming athletes outside of the olympics thomas was good, but she wasn't the next simon biles of her field So what explained a frenzy? I don't know maybe that it's a dude But maybe the male genitalia for the females the quote female swimmer was that was a little bit of a challenge for some folks Maybe because the woman had a penis And was also a man who was dominating all women, but buck I mean we can laugh about this But what this represents is the fundamental dishonesty of much of media right now, right? Even the most left wing nation writer Understands that the reason why this person got so much attention was because sports man said Hey, this is a dude pretending to be a woman who is now winning women's championships So the tweet itself even for far left people buck is dishonest And that is the world in which we live in where you're not allowed to recognize And point out the fundamental dishonesty you see just just a few days ago the french runner halber dioff Was banned from the olympics did you see this a trans female? And I mean if you look there's a photo up on fox. I mean it looks it looks like a guy with long hair Yeah, I mean if you look at the physique, this is a man. This is a male runner with long hair Because that's what it actually that's what we're dealing with but I just thought this was fascinating I'd never seen this before this is in the roiters headline about this trans issue It's very similar with the nation like you let me give the headline and then why they're doing this right or or the the way they described dioff is a A person who has gone through male puberty. That was the quote They described this sprinter as dioff a person who has gone through male puberty That is known as a man That is known as a man a person who has gone through male puberty is male But the reason they do this roiters the nate that was roiters by the way, right? It's worse than the nation there are a bunch of commies you expect lunacy from them But this is it's very common in in cults where you see people that They have to debase themselves They have to say things that they know to be untrue And then that becomes part of your field to the group right part of the way you show your faith To the trans cult here is to come up with new, you know New ways to express This belief which is that you know a man can become a woman right new ways to describe this It's like they're showing off for each other Yeah, bucking i would even say if there's a scarier element to what roiters is trying to do there as well Is this would then allow like if you take from the argument perspective? They can say well, this is why Young kids need to be able to get so-called Gender affirming care because once they go through puberty then they won't be able to compete in Athletics because they're being defined that that's the problem with designing puberty as masculinity like Because then you say well at 11 you need to be able to treat this boy as if he's a girl or vice versa So they can have a quote-unquote normal life. That's what they're trying to seed here with the roiters headline There's been in history We can go history nerds here for a second there have been different Castes different groups where there have been extreme gender really mutilation Uh for for some purpose right there was um there were unics Why did you have unix guarding the harem of the saltin for example or guarding We all understand why because you're not worried about the guy who doesn't really have functional male parts anymore Wanting to try to um have you know relations with the women of the harem or with the royal family etc There's the uh castrati Which you know about this right men. This was done in parts of europe men who would have their male at a young age Their male area removed so they could sing high notes even into adulthood That's a real thing that happened. We look back on these things now with revulsion You know we think and and the point of it was well, okay granted you wouldn't be able to have children But you would be a singer in the court of you know archduke so and so and you would you know Be a celebrated artist or whatever and everyone looks back at that and says that's that's that's terrible You can't do that to people now They want you know 10 year olds to cut their breasts off and we're supposed to think that that's fine And not only that buck I mean some of the same people who were and I would love to hear them try to rationalize this Some of the same people who are saying gender affirming care is necessary A decade or 20 years ago were the people who were protesting against genital mutilation So called female circumcision in africa, right? So the idea that you would get part of your sex organs removed as a child when you could not consent to it In africa was a human rights violation Now the same people are arguing you should be able to take your genitals off Or it's not fair treatment like they literally have taken both sides of the equation here And they can't in any way square that and so they just pretend they never said it Didn't uh didn't tucker once referred a bryad stelter as cnn's resident unique. Yes. Yes I remember sometimes tucker said things that that actually made me lol and that was one of them. Yes Yeah, did you see I don't know that we talked about this the reaction from inside of cnn to the trump town hall Uh, who was it a liveer? Who was the guy darsi? What's the guy's name all over darsi used to work All over blares believe it or not. Oh my god. I didn't know that well. Oh, he's one of those They said after he got called out by the new head of cnn. I always loved this phrase. He was visibly shaken Have you ever been visibly shaken by no meeting? I mean, oh, I like I understand if you're visibly Shaken if someone tries to kill you I was like if you just kicked in a door in remala When you when you step off the curve And and you just end up managing to get missed by a milk truck going 80 miles an hour And you feel the breeze across your face in your life Then you're allowed to be visibly shaken for a minute. You know what I mean? Not because you didn't like the cnn town hall. Yeah, but so the cnn town hall They called in this darsi guy and they said I think the reports are that the new head of cnn like ripped him Over his what he had written about the cnn town hall and all the reports said when darsi left the meeting He was visibly shaken. You're visibly shaken because your boss tells you he didn't like what you did Like maybe maybe man up a little bit. I'm just gonna toss that out there You're an employee Quick if you're truly upset, but to be visibly shaken after a meeting after someone said something to you Uh, this is everything that's wrong with the policing of words in general I want to take a little trip down wokeness lane for a second because you know, we're claiming that the two of us We're in our own ways We have like master's degrees in woke history and woke ology just from covering it now for so many years Earlier on in the era of twitter and and facebook, uh, you know, maybe of almost a decade ago Remember when they were so upset they would do the literally shaking. Yes rn for i'm literally shaking right now Like brian stuff would be like i'm literally shaking right now from You know the results of like a gubernatorial election somewhere, you know, that was that was the way they used to That was pre-ukrain flags and preferred pronouns. I think peak Stelter as a eunuch to use chakars phrase Definitely had to be when he put out of the thread about how like he just got in his bed and curled up and cried because he was still Remember that thread. Yep. Oh, of course. Yep I mean look you can be upset about things, but if you're like i'm just so terrified about the way the world is going I just had to curl up in the fetal position and have a good long cry Good lord, man get control of your masculine parts step it up a little bit Uh But anyway, I hope you're all not visibly shaken by the first 45 minutes of the clay and buck show today And if you are congratulations on voting for joe biden Uh next agenda health care a health care solutions provider Suffered a date of reach last month and exposed the personal information of over a million individuals We're talking names that dresses birth dates and social security numbers All the stuff cyber criminals can use to commit online identity theft It's important to understand how cybercrime and identity theft are affecting our lives your personal info gets exposed so often It can make it dangerously easy for something like this to happen Which is why we encourage you to protect yourself with life locked by norton when you sign up with life lock You're getting the best online identity theft protection.

We're gonna talk in a few minutes about the Daniel penny case in New York City. Um, the bad news is as I talked to you on friday About it that he is indicted and is now facing manslaughter charges But some some good news under the circumstances a lot of money raised for his defense from people just like you who uh, decided that they weren't gonna let this guy not have the best Lea at least the best legal representation money can buy in new york city in this democrat Looney bin of new york city right now with alvin brag bringing these charges Also later on on the show my dad will be joining with a big economic update and he's gonna talk to us about a Um, a project that he's working on that I think a lot of you could benefit From but we'll we'll unveil all of that later on that'll be the third hour later on in the show Um, we also we're gonna we don't have it offloaded yet. We will shortly. There is a new Miller light ad That is I mean given what has happened? With bud light you would think miller light would say you know what maybe respect our audience. No The new it's a real ad too. It's not just a influencer campaign the ad Is a lecture for miller light drinkers? Um, so we'll we'll bring you the full situation on that coming up in the next ad you want to take some call sclay right now We got a whole bunch lined up. Let's get to it Scott in little rock arkansas on the biden white supremacy comments. What's going on scott Hey guys good to talk to you. You too appreciate you You know, if you listen closely oh sleepy joe and uh morkus the dorkus What they were really saying About the white supremacy he said it's in this country He's talking about individuals that don't agree with the government or hate the government You know their own our own citizens of the country. I think it's just another way for them to implement Uh, you know surveillance on their citizens and you know for the endgame of their you know socialist Alliterian, you know country. I think it's just just the way that you know, they're they're trying to go It's an interesting argument buck. I I think what it's based on is the number you know what the number one fear of most white educated people in america is being called racist If you are a college educated white person in america today I guarantee if you pulled what is your biggest professional or social fear, right? You would be better off. We've talked about this you'd be better off if you are in high level Employment as a white guy To probably get multiple duis Then to be called racist based on something that you've done in a video or something that you've tweeted, right? People you get a dui people are like, oh, you know, he just got a drink less Almost no one loses their job over getting a dui people lose their job all the time Over not being racially sensitive enough So what they recognize is there's a palpable fear out there in the educated white classes There's also these woke white people who it's mostly all white people by the way who have destroyed this country using woke ideology They want to look down on other white people because they aren't willing to acknowledge the scourge of white supremacy and systemic racism and everything else That's what this is all about. It's also so easy because you have to remember the foundational principle or or non principle of leftism is you say the right things and get to Live your life differently or you you support the right positions and then your personal hypocrisy is considered irrelevant all of these Individuals that you'll see I mean Joe Biden and so what you can say well Joe Biden's in office and he's representing the democrat party so Uh, he's doing something whether you like it or not for all these different communities But for most white liberals, they don't actually you know, they don't want to go to Have their children rather go to highly diverse schools in Neighborhoods that have socioeconomic, you know low socioeconomic status that don't have high household income They don't want to live in high crime neighborhoods. They want personal police forces guarding there But they get to pretend for the purposes of their buddies. Oh, I care so much I care so much, but that's why the Gavin Newsom thing is hilarious isn't it? That's that's the encapsulation of what i'm talking about What is Gavin Newsom actually done for the black community in california? I mean you can argue not only nothing you can argue he's actually harmed the black community through policies and law enforcement that have Increased crime rates particularly in in minority majority areas But beyond that the whole reparation situation clay Gavin Newsom sets up all these committees The committees come forward. They say okay every black person in california who qualifies gets 1.2 million whatever it is and now Gavin Newsom's like I mean like We're not really giving you guys a lot of money you understand that right like this was just so I could feel good about myself as the governor and get Get high fives at fancy cocktail parties at french laundry This is like the number that's the tat scott's analogy that we had fun with the michael scott's office thing with gavin Newsom running back from reparations But here's always fun too buck how many people how many white people live in gated communities and we'll also simultaneously Arg you walls don't work And these are my favorite people wait you look why do you have a wall around your own house? Why are you in a gated community and then you're out there saying walls don't work What is trump even thinking about with the wall even joe biden? I think has multiple homes with walls surrounding it right? I believe joe biden's beach house has a wall surrounding it's awfully interesting Joe biden won't build a wall in the southern border But he'll build one to protect his private residents at the beach Oh, I mean what's going on there the crazier thing you're willing to say that the left demands The higher up in their communist priesthood you ascend that's the way it goes play Travis and buck sexton on the front lines of truth With today's volatile stock market the phoenix capital group recommends diversifying your retirement accounts and high value u.s oil and gas investments with current yields ranging from 9% to 13% ap y paid monthly To find out more download the phoenix groups free investment packet today at phx on air dot com Investment and bonds have a certain amount of risk associated with it And you should only invest if you can afford to bear the risk of loss before making investment decisions You should carefully consider and review all risks involved to find out more download the phoenix groups free investment packet today at phx on air dot com With the lucky land slots you can get lucky just about anywhere This is your captain speaking.
