    "text": " Look guys, anywhere you turn, you're going to see the challenges that we as American face. Now, some of these challenges are designed to stir up infighting and get some eyeballs on certain media outlets and others are genuine threats to our way of life. Now, it's hard to know which is which, but it's also imperative that we start having some real discussions about the real issues. My guest today is Mike Ritland, former Navy SEAL, New York Times Besseling author and author of his latest book, Un-F America, a respectful, open-minded conversation. Today, Mike and I don't see completely eye to eye on everything, but we do have a powerful conversation about emotion, religion, and bias in politics, whether or not there are inequalities in America, what hate speech is and what it isn't, money in politics and the danger of lobbying, also the eroding checks and balances in American politics, and ultimately how we can begin to un-F America. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. You embrace your fears. You boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become at the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Micler. I'm the host and the founder of the Order of Man podcast and movement as we get closer to the end of 2021, which is really weird to say. I just want to thank you. Thank you for promoting what we're doing. Thank you for stepping up. Thank you for sharing. Thank you for leading within the walls of your homes and businesses and out in your communities. That's what I want this to be about. Guys, I want you to take the information and the conversations that I'm having with guys like Mike Rick, Mike, I can say his name here, Mike Ritland. There we go. Jocko, Andy Fresilla, Ben Shapiro, David Goggins, Dan Crenshaw, and of course, some other incredible guests that we have coming up in the next several weeks. I want you to take these conversations and the discussions we're having and then apply them. That's the whole point is to bridge the gap between what we know and what we hear and then what we actually do with that information. That's what we're supposed to be doing. That's how we show up as men. And that's what this podcast is all about. So we're going to get into a really, really good conversation. Again, Mike and I didn't agree on everything today. And I'm trying to be more balanced and fair in my approach and be open-minded to ideas that I don't necessarily see fully or even agree with. But I think you're really going to enjoy this one. Before I get into it, let me just make a quick mention of my friends and show sponsors. Guys, I think they've been sponsoring the show for probably what four years now. And there's a reason for that. There's a reason that I only have them. And occasionally some others that I really like, Soarnx and some other Montana knife companies and other company, but Origin specifically today, there's a couple of things that I take religiously. When I say religiously, I mean daily. It's their joint warfare and it's their super-cryl. I noticed that as I get a little older, I'm not using that as an excuse guys, but my bones are hurting a little bit more. My joints are a little stiffer than maybe they used to be. And I notice a huge, huge difference when I don't take the super-cryl and the joint warfare, which is designed to help take care of some of the inflammation and build up the strength and the cartilage in your fingers, elbows, knees, hips, joints, etc, etc. So one thing they've got going on, and this is what I like because I want to get this on the regular. I don't like running out of my stuff, especially because I take it daily, is to look into their subscriptions because they have some subscriptions available. And with it being Christmas, this might be a good time to do it to pick up a yearly subscription of their joint warfare, their super-cryl. And of course, they have their mulk, they have their pre-workout, they just came out with, and they've got some other stuff as well. But specifically, the joint warfare and the super-cryl is what I would suggest to you. You can check that out at either jockofuel.com, jockofuel.com, or originusa.com, originusa.com. Make sure to use the code order, O-R-D-E-R at checkout, because you're going to save some money when you do. Again, origin, I am struggling speaking today, originusa.com. Use the code order at checkout. All right, guys, let me introduce you to Mike. He is a former Navy SEAL. He's a New York Times best-selling author. I believe he's got three other books prior to his newly released book, which is called Un-F America. He's also the host of the popular podcast, Mike Drop. Now, this guy is a three-peak guest on the podcast. And for good reason, and despite our few disagreements, which I talked about earlier, Mike's always willing to have an open discussion. And frankly, he pulls no punches in the way that he views modern culture and society and just America in general. And I found that in this world of delicateness and sending other people, and a lot of guys afraid to speak their mind, Mike is never one of those individuals. I really enjoy our discussions and its friendship. And whether you agree or not, I think you're really going to enjoy this conversation. And guys, I can already hear you yelling through the radio or earbuds while you listen to this one. So I hope you enjoy. Mike, what's up, brother? Good to talk with you again. You too, my man. I appreciate you having me on. It's always a pleasure. The book, you just came out with a new book. I was like, just came out, but it was like October, wasn't it? So it was actually November 16th. So it's a month tomorrow. But all right. It's like everybody's got a book, everybody's got a message, everybody's got a podcast, everybody's got a this. And I'm like, how in the world do I keep up with everybody who's doing good stuff? Yeah, no, it's tough. I mean, it's an interesting dynamic for sure. And that historically, and this is, I think, a big paradigm shift, society is that we have, for the first time, as of about 10 years ago or so, kind of everybody that wants to have a platform has one. Now, there's still, there's only so much time in the day and the people that are worth listening to are still going to rise to the top. But it's not a state run media, kind of the way that it has been, not that it's, not that it was as bad as China is now, but it was definitely much more controlled. And I think it's fascinating to see the shift of if you look at, say, even on something as simple as YouTube as a platform, the big media outlets, ABC, NBC, MSNBC, and any of their shows or personalities that have shows, if you look at the traction that they don't get compared to a lot of people that just started their own thing and aren't beholden to anybody that have a much more powerful and then popular voice than a lot of these traditional media conglomerates. It's a pretty fascinating shift that is worth paying attention to, no doubt. Yeah, I mean, it is interesting. It's a bit of a double-edged sword in that it's decentralized, right? And I think that's a good thing because that allows us to different opinions, different perspectives, maybe a topic or a conversation or even an opinion that would have been censored to some degree and we can talk about censorship too. But then on the other hand, you've got a bunch of bullshit also that you have to sift through and that noise is much more prevalent, I think, than it ever was. So it's got its pros and cons. Yeah, just like everything. There's good and bad to all of it. Yeah, but well, one thing I was going to say with even our past conversations and the book that you have now is I really respect our conversations because you've never pulled any punches, right? And I think so many people do, they run their message through a filter and they make sure it's pretty and they make sure it's comfortable for everybody and nobody gets offended. And even just with the way that you look at or the way that you frame this book is like, it goes against that popular narrative, especially in the veteran community of like America's the best and America's the greatest. And I think it has the potential to be, certainly, but we've got some we've got a rough road ahead, I think, and you do a good job illustrating that. Yeah, well, I appreciate it. I mean, to me, the one of the kind of key benchmarks of the book, and it falls or it stems from the chapter that I talk about politics is one of the big, I think, issues that we run into is having a political party system that's so kind of hypocritical to the point where each side and both sides are guilty of it, aren't willing to hold themselves to the same standard that they're holding the other side to. And I think that's a critical failure because it kind of disenfranchises and really sweeps the legs out from under most average voters when they see no adults, basically. They see people that aren't taking accountability for their own decisions. And there are certainly people during the Trump administration on the right that were guilty of it. It does seem maybe I'm a little biased. It does seem more prevalent on the left where it's really they can do no fucking wrong. And there's just zero accountability for it. But to me that nothing will make an average American voter feel helpless like that. And so if you can't come to the table with enough maturity to say, we did this and we fucked that up and legitimately mean it. I mean, Jaco talks about it all the time, the extreme ownership. But there's such a lack of that, I think, in our society and especially in politics, which they are supposed to be setting the standard, that it really just contaminates the ideologies and what their intended purpose was originally for, just really ruins it. And so I hate to see that. And it's something that I talk about a lot, is kind of the three main things. One of them we may disagree on a little bit. But it is to get rid of emotion, is remove all emotion from the beginning of a discussion, which sometimes is really hard to do if you're passionate about something, but it's crucial, is remove religion from it. That's the one where you and I may tend to differ or disagree on a little bit, but then also remove political bias and affiliation from it. The reason for all of those things is and I'll speak to the religion thing, because that's probably the one I get the most pushback. Most people think, yeah, it makes sense to ditch your political leanings and your emotion at the door for the sake of mental clarity when discussing a topic. But I think from a religious standpoint, where it's tough, is that you have to understand that there's people that don't believe that or that disagree with it or whatever. And so if you go into it, even if that's what your principles are, that's what your benchmark character beliefs entail, is that if you're so attached to those that you're not willing to see it from the other side and not let it influence your perspective on things, and it's going to come across as such, and it's going to seem very inflexible when it comes to that. Well, I do think though, yeah, I do think though that it should influence how you behave and how you show up, of course, like how could it not. But I actually agree to an extent with what you're saying, that's why you don't really hear me talking about God as the ultimate authority on masculinity. I actually believe that personally. But I don't appeal to that authority because if you and I don't agree on that or a listener doesn't agree, then there's nothing else that we can talk about. So let's not necessarily talk about in my world where masculinity derives from as much as let's talk about what it is and how we express it and how we how we become more masculine and embrace it and then serve other people. So yeah, I hear where you're coming from. I think it should influence who you are individually and allow you to make your decisions based on that because that's a framework, it's a benchmark for the values you have. But yeah, if somebody else doesn't believe that God gave us these commandments, then okay, like how are we going to have a conversation and come to the table? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. One of the other things that I appreciate you saying that, you know, one of the other things that I talk about kind of at length also is going into every debate or conversation with the prospect that you might be wrong, which is really hard to do. You know, especially when it comes to religion, you know, and but really with anything, I mean, there's certainly people from a political standpoint or from a cultural standpoint that believe so strongly in things that the prospect that maybe it's not a good idea or that maybe that they're not correct, just that they refuse to entertain that as even a possibility. However, remote it might be, you know, and I think again, if we're really expecting the other side, you know, and that's whatever it is, whether it's politics or culture, what have you, to either negotiate or compromise even a little bit, like you have to be willing to do the same thing, you know, and so that kind of sets the tone for every chapter. And then I talk about, you know, kind of the overarching theme, which is, you know, there's a lot of white noise like we were talking about, you know, to sift through. And there's a lot of media outlets primarily on TV that are still popular enough to where, you know, they're getting millions of viewers per show and they have a very specific agenda and narrative that they push and make you worry, you know, there's so much media hype out there that, you know, kind of tends to dictate to a lot of people, you know, what they should be worried about. And in the reality of it is, is that most of it, if you kind of look at it from a data standpoint, does not reflect what are the most challenging and detrimental things that are taking place in our society. And so I did a shitload of research on, from a statistics standpoint, you know, what are kind of the 10, 10 most prevalent problems that we have in this country data lies, you know, and they're not what's usually talked about in the media or nearly to the same extent, you know, and so to me, that's a big part of the problem is being kind of misdirected and misguided and distracted from from what the real issues are. So, yeah, you've got a bit of the wrong target going on here. I actually do want to get into some of these that you addressed in the book, because there's one in particular that really stood out to me. But with regards to the political thing, one thing I was going to mention is I just saw this report and I don't know if it was from the CBO or what it where it was from, but the amount of money that we're spending relative to the amount of tax revenue the government is collecting. And I'm not even talking about the ethical side of taxes. Let's just table that conversation for a second and just say, okay, we're collecting, we're basically we're spending two times what the government is collecting in revenue. To me, I'm like, if you can't figure that part of the thing out, there's nothing else that we need to be talking about right now. And that shouldn't be a partisan issue. Like, if you're spending twice as much as you're taking in, you've proven to me that you're incapable of acting like an adult, of having any level of responsibility and nothing else that comes out of your mouth really holds any weight or credibility with me because you can't get that right. I agree. Yeah. And I think one of the other things I talk about is the kind of popularity contest and the personality blowing up of politicians in our country. A lot of politicians aren't viewed as servants anymore. They're viewed as fucking rock stars. Right. Yeah, they're Twitter and Instagram accounts are in the millions or tens of millions of followers. And they're acting more like influencers than they are policymakers. And I find that to be not just disheartening, but very immature and fucking petty on top of it is that if everybody in the country, you guys are supposed to be the quote unquote adults in the room. And I've never seen a group of people act more like fucking children in my life than watching some of these Senate hearings when it turns into just political grandstanding of not even asking questions, but just saying, rattling off talking points, hoping that some short clip that they say with a zinger fucking line or bullet point gets picked up and goes viral and makes them more popular on social media. And I think that mentality is incredibly toxic and poisonous for our government. When the officials think, I tell you how the cow eats the cabbage and not you guys hired me to fucking represent you, which is absolutely what's taking place and has been for a while, then that is a broken system and then needs to be fixed. And I do talk a little bit about my theory on kind of getting rid of money in politics as best you can. Those things are always going to be intertwined to a certain extent. But I think that the way the system is now, it's pretty apparent when people like Nancy Pelosi on the left and say Mitch McConnell on the right, when you look at what those people are worth based on what they've made, that's an impossible formula. I don't give a fuck how lucky you are with stocks, bonds, crypto, whatever the fuck it is, is that if you spent 40 years making less than 200k a month, a month a year. And your worth, above my gets you there. And you're worth 40, 50, 60 million dollars. There's some other shit going on that that's nefarious at that best. And that's interesting because every time I bring that that issue up, because because on one hand, you say that, right? And then on the other hand, I talk a lot about free market capitalism, which I know you hit on the economy subjects in the book. And we're not completely in a free market. Let's just get that on the table right now. But still, I advocate for building wealth. Everybody should attempt to build as much wealth as they possibly can for themselves and their family, even generationally, as long as it's legal, moral and ethical. So people will say, well, on one hand, you're talking about building wealth on the other, you're condemning these people. I'm not condemning them for having wealth. I'm condemning them for the way they would in which they acquired it. That's the issue to me. Agreed. And I don't condemn it either. But on the same just on the same token is that our law enforcement officers are held to a higher standard when it comes to carrying a gun than your average citizen is with with body cams and how they interact with people, our elected leadership. And then that's the key word is our fucking elect, they're elected. They're put in the position by us, not the other way around. And when they're there, I think that there should be a higher level of scrutiny on how they make their money, specifically and especially when they are privy to things that nobody else is privy to. And so that's the huge red flag as far as that argument goes, is that these people are sitting in on top secret and classified briefings that go into, that makes insider trading on Wall Street look like fucking monopoly. Well, a couple of years ago, there was a gal, she was a, I believe she was a Republican representative in maybe Georgia, I might be wrong on that. This was just a couple of years ago. And it talked about how she was ditching all her stocks right before they crashed and then buying them back up after they rebound. It's like, come, I mean, you said it, that's insider trading, that is the definition of insider trading. And yet there's no accountability for these people. Yeah. And the problem is, you know, with that is that trying to have some level of accountability, I mean, it's akin to asking a fox to audit himself in the hen house, like that's never going to happen. Right. You know, they're going to have, you know, some AG launch, some internal investigation and coincidentally, they find themselves not guilty. Like that's a big pocket surprise. You know, and it happens time and time again. And that's bullshit. How do you build in that accountability though? Because you're right. Like, okay, so you're going to ask one party to hold the other accountable. They're worried about their talking points and getting their zingers in so they can be famous on Instagram. Yeah. Like, how do you hold it accountable? Well, so here's my take. And it would be a radical shift. And it's based off of a personal experience of being in a small rural county in Texas and being selected to be on a grand jury, not once, but twice. And it's a six month commitment. And just like with jury duties, you don't get a choice. Right. It's right. You know, your civic duty is your selected and you have to do it. And so I think where the root of all of this stems from is the money in politics that starts every one of these people that the amount of money that you have to raise to get elected at this point is why everything is the way that it is. It is that you're now so in bed and beholden to all these other people that have spent millions or tens of millions or in some cases hundreds of millions of dollars getting you to this position. Now you fucking owe them. And just like, say, the mafia and loan sharking is that there isn't a, hey, thanks, but we're done here. You know, option, you know, for those people once they get an office. And so, you know, campaign finance is a problem in lobbying. I mean, in any other country, lobbying is called fucking bribery, right? But in the United States, it's coincidentally or conveniently called lobbying and it's bullshit. So to me, when those two fundamental components of our political system exist, you're never going to change it. So you have to get rid of those. And so people say, well, how the fuck do you get rid of those? Well, to me, this going back to the grand jury thing is that to me, that they're almost, and I say almost because I do know some people that have ran for office that are good people and have gotten elected. And I still think are, but they're in such a muddied system to where, you know, even if you're a good dude, there's not much you're going to get done because of how entrenched everybody is in an in the game. Sure. Yeah. And but I also think that for most people, just by wanting to run to office should automatically fucking disqualify you. Because I think there's a level of narcissism or sociopathic behavior that that has to exist for you to want to go through that to put your family. Well, I look, I agree. I agree. I can see that side of it. But don't you think there's people who genuinely feel like they can make a difference? I mean, I don't doubt what you're saying, but I think there's the other side of it too. No, that's why I say, you know, I do know some and I would say that yes, there are some people that get railroaded as soon as they get in there and can't get shit done. But I think a lot of people are there because they want to be that, they want to be in that position. So to me, the way you get rid of both of those things right out of the gate is that you don't allow people to run for office and you can keep everything the same way in terms of the districting and re in regions and the way, you know, all of our different representatives from a region standpoint is that, you know, this congressman is over this section and this population where you keep all that shit the same. But just like the grand jury system that I'm about to outline that happened in rural Texas, this is how you elect people is that you've got this basic checklist of you're essentially a net positive human being in your county, your state, your region, what have you. And that's, you know, you've paid your taxes, you're not a felon, you've lived there for a certain number of years. You know, just a basic, you're not a shitbag and you're a productive member of that society. And you have been for a long enough time for you to have a vested interest in where you live, right? So let me just poke holes at this just a little bit. I know you're going to go through this. But one concern is I know plenty of people who I would consider, you know, would check those boxes, let's say, but they're complete effing morons. And I wouldn't want them anywhere near running any sort of political office or part of my life at a government level. So they're not here's where this process goes in is, is it, is that let's say, and in this instance, the county is as small as like 3,200 people in the county. So once they narrow this list that, you know, here, here are the basic good productive members of society. Let's say there's a thousand of them. So now those thousand people have to submit 30 names, or it's 10 or it's five. I mean, whatever it is, you know, I'm not a statistician. I'll leave that to people that are better on numbers. But but they you basically say, here are the 10 people that I think should be the congressman for this area. Right. And so now you tally all of those up and whatever the five or three or 10 or whatever that that magic number is, people that got nominated the most times by the people that live in there that respect them enough to think I think that guy should be running the I think this guy should be the fucking the mayor or the congressman or the senator or whatever. It is that there is that you're basically elected by people who again who pay taxes that aren't freeloading that aren't shipbags that aren't felons. And and that collective mean average of whoever the top five people are that got voted the most times they now run for office or they're put into, you know, that position for office. And then and then that's that's how it's decided. And it's on the on the smallest micro scale or on the largest macro scale. There's no political contributions because there there is no there's no there's no there's no incentive there. Sure. Well, there's no incentive in there. And there's no ads like there's there's no voting to it as far as you know that stuff goes. And so there's that and then also now once you're in office, you don't know anybody anything, you know, and you can almost if you imagine it from the standpoint is that most of the people that that are probably going to be voted for the most times are people that are probably going to be a little reluctant to do something like that who are the best people for that job who feel like okay, this county that I live in for whatever reason, you know, more people in this county think I'm the guy that should be running the show around here more than everybody else. I guess I'm the fucking guy and it's my civic duty to now be in that position. And individuals are obligated is what you're saying. Yeah, you don't get a choice. You know, I mean, it's it's one person out of, you know, however many. But every two years you go four years or whatever it is, you go through that same process. So you don't get to run for it. You know, and if you're doing that shitty of a job and enough people think you're doing a shitty job, you get voted out. And now every one vote counts as one actual fucking vote. It's not well, California is going to have this many electoral votes. So, you know, my shit doesn't matter. There's none of that thinking because everything is on a on a level where one vote equals one vote. So, so you're bringing up an interesting point with the electoral college, but I actually think the electoral college actually does the opposite of what you're saying. So what you said is that, you know, my stuff doesn't matter because that would party got their their votes. But that's what keeps small towns and that's densely populated areas in the in the running. I'm not advocating to get rid of the electoral college. My point is that everybody has has a fair, a fair say in who who gets elected versus not right on again on the smallest scale or the largest scale is that every every vote in terms of your voice for who you think should be running the show isn't based on well, here's my two candidates. I've got to pick one of the fucking two of them. And so I guess I'll go with this guy. Is that you decide? But the so I could see that working at a local and a state level, something like that. But when you get up to the federal level, if everybody has one one vote, one, you know, one person one vote, the problem is is that New York and California, yeah, one person one vote. But when you get these heavily dense, these heavily densely populated areas, they generally tend to vote in one way. So that yes, one vote per person, but it still drowns out the other person who might be in rural Texas, for example. But I mean, to me, like, what we're already doing that the I think the benefit to doing something like this is largely on your point is that at the representation level of the other two branches of government is that you don't have the political hurdles that you have now, because the president can't do things unilaterally. But but if the entire Senate and the entire House of Representatives is geared in the same fucked up way that he was elected is that that's why you have the gridlock that you have. So if two thirds of the government branch wise are elected from people who are legitimately they're representing the people because they're they got the most votes. I think that, you know, from a starting standpoint of again, trying to fix the problems that we've that we've created over the last, you know, I'd say 50, 60 years of such a highly charged political climate is that's a good starting point. You know, maybe maybe try it with just the House of Representatives, right, just just Congress to start and see how that goes with everybody that's there that's duly elected there elected in this system and see see how that shakes out. And if that works, you know, is it a is it a perfect solution? No, nothing is. But I think it's a really good starting point. And then from there, you learn what lessons you're going to learn. And then you try that with the Senate, you know, and then from there, if you can implement it on a national, you know, federal election scale, fantastic. If you can't, well, it's still better if you've got two thirds of the government that, you know, from the two thirds that are supposed to be representing the people, that that's the, you know, that that's the one branch rather that, you know, that should be there. As it relates to the judicial thing, you know, that's still going to be the president doing that. But, but I think if the House of Representatives and the Senate are both, you know, elected in a manner where where those those representatives that are there are actually representing the people, because because that's who decided, you know, on, on everybody that should be there, I think that that's at least from, from my perspective, in terms of how do you, how do you knock it down to ground zero and then unfuck the mess that's there, that in my opinion is the best way to at least start that process. Well, and I also think there's a huge problem with the enforcement of the checks and balances that we already have in place, like you see each president who comes in who has so many executive orders that over override and overrule what what the elect or the people's house have voted on. And that's a problem. And then you see, you know, Supreme Court justices who are not elected, they're appointed by the president, who is stepping on not only our current president, but just about every president there who's stepping all over these checks and balances. And then those people are there for life. And now they're not interpreting the Constitution. Now they're making personal biased decisions and interpreting law, not on what's the Constitution says, but on what they believe. And that's bullshit to me. And I don't care what side of the aisle you're sitting on. I agree. I think, and so here's where the system that I'm talking about, I think would have a trickle down effect on that second branch of government to give it the two thirds, is that the I think the key is, is that, you know, on the judicial branch, Supreme Court nominees are exactly that they're nominated by the president, but they have to be signed off on by the Senate, you know, so if the Senate actually has their shit together, you know, and our representatives of people from a system where there's no money or no bullshit into it, there's, I think there would be far less party lines. And so if a president knows like, hey, if I throw up some bullshit partisan fucking nominee in the Senate's going to say, fuck you, try again, 37 times before I put somebody in there that's actually a constitutionalist that's going to do it. I think at least the way that the current system is set up, you know, shy of completely overthrowing the government and starting from scratch, is that that's the most effective way is that you start with that body with with the legislative branch of government because everything has to go through them. So if you start with them as the bedrock group of the 456 or however fucking many there are, as being solid representatives that are elected in a manner where there's no money, no politics, no super PACs, no lobbying, and that group of people who Supreme Court nominees have to go through, you know, and every other big decision, whether it's spending bills, etc. I think that that's the best place that you can start without a complete fucking hard reset and still manage to salvage our government in a manner with which, you know, is step by step process wise without being a complete detriment to the country. Well, I mean, and you're talking about this hard reset, hopefully it doesn't come to that point. But frankly, I feel like we're getting to that point, whether that's we implode or we have some sort of external threat that that causes something like that that to happen. I hope it doesn't. My concern is just we won't get to this point until something horrible and catastrophic happens. Yeah, unfortunately, it takes a 9-11 type event to right exactly to unify the country, you know, and I hate that that's the case. But you know, sometimes democracy is messy that way. And, yeah, and unfortunately, you know, people forget things too quick and go right back to the same downshift. Hey, guys, let me hit the pause button on the conversation very quickly. I've been talking about it for months now, but my son and I finally, finally recorded our first episode of My Son Brecken's newest podcast, Man in the Making. This is his podcast. This is his project. He's funding it all. He's paying for it all with the money that he's earned from fulfilling orders over the past three years or so now. And this is a podcast of father-son conversations around all the discussions that we know we should be having, but often find a way out of porn, drugs, girls, puberty, business relationships, starting a podcast. In fact, we're going to give you a behind the scenes look. So when we start, it's going to be raw. It's going to be a little ugly, but you're going to see it develop and grow because I'm going to help him build his own little mini empire. And you're going to see it in real time. So guys, this is important because it's designed for you to listen in with your sons. So we're going to keep it clean. We're going to keep it relevant as we really want to help you unlock the conversations that you want to have with your boys. And he'll also soon be interviewing incredible man as he strives to learn how to become a man himself. So to get notified about when the first podcast drops of his, the first show, which is on December 31st, 2021, head to order a man dot com slash update. Again, that's, it's not order of man. I'm so used to saying that it's man in the making dot com slash update. That's his website man in the making dot com slash update. Check it out for now. I'll get back to it with Mike. You have a, you have an entire chapter dedicated to inequalities in the country. And I'm really interested in your take on that because that's so polarizing. You know, like, what are there are there inequalities? Are there sex or gender, or excuse me, pay differences in between the sexes? You know, like, these are the things that I think is on a lot of people's minds. Yeah. So again, you know, to me, the reason they're polarizing is because people aren't looking at data. They're using emotion and, and click bait and thumbnails and snippets of video and, outrageous statements and things like that to piss people off and get an offer. Which in all fairness, I, I do that as well as a, as a marketer. So I'm, I'm not putting myself above doing any of that. We need to be or same as you though, with a title of your book, let's not pretend that you're not out there to get people's attention. Well, I mean, I am, but you know, that's one of those things where it's kind of to a detriment of the book is that, you know, there's a lot of hurdles that, you know, you don't carry it or people, you know, won't even have me on because of the title. You know, so yeah, good point. Good point. That's a double edged sword where one side is quite a bit sharper than the other, but, you know, but, but the, you know, I think the, the key is again, is looking at the numbers, you know, whether it's, and we'll use the two that you brought up because those are, frankly, the two most divisive and prominent ones, but, you know, police, policing and then the shooting of unarmed, you know, black members of society, the reality of it is, is that the numbers don't back up the narrative in the media, you know, that they just don't. And not even like almost, it's woefully inaccurate, you know, how blasphemous the media has become as it relates to, you know, police on black crime or shooting or, you know, whatever you want to call it, inequality in terms of how people are treated. You know, there were nine instances in 2020, which is obviously the last year of recorded data on that. And these are FBI statistics, right? This isn't, you know, some partisan right alt right wing fucking group with ties to the Klan that, you know, that spewing out some bullshit numbers. And that was the reality of it is there were nine instances where black people who were who were at the time unarmed that were shot and killed. And five of those nine, there were other other factors involved in a couple instances they had a gun and just dropped it, you know, or had a gun and were, you know, moving around and it wasn't technically in their hands at the time. There was a couple instances of where they were physically being attacked. And, you know, basically had to prove that that it was through self defense, that they were still fearing for their life, etc. So it came down to a couple of instances where somebody was legitimately unarmed and not attacking a police officer or having just that were shot and killed, you know, but but if you watch the trick, the media uses is what is a weapon, what is unarmed mean, you know, if somebody's, for example, this guy who ran this car through that parade, you know, was he unarmed? I think probably people would attempt to make that claim. But if you're using a vehicle to mow innocent people down, you're armed that that's a weapon that you're using to do destruction and damage to people. Yeah, I mean, there's been a number of cases that, you know, unequivocally, and in every instance, when it comes to use of force and police, you know, there's statute after statute after statute that allows police officers the ability to use lethal force to stop somebody that's trying to hurt people with a vehicle. Right. That's not even up for debate, you know, so. So yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, yeah, it shouldn't be. But in terms of the law, and that's part of the problem too, is that data and statutes are factual, you know, and when you start to to over blow stories by, you know, having having pundits on or people that say things like, you know, there is a a genocidal like movement in this country for police to wipe black people off the planet. Like that's right. Padnly falls. I mean, it's it's horrendously untrue, and it's poisonous. And it's really dangerous when people, you know, who aren't paying attention to all of the other things, who aren't looking at data, who aren't doing anything but picking their lunchbox up and going to work every day and to come home. And they see six minutes of news and I, and that's one of the things they hear day in day out in conjunction with COVID is the, is the worst pandemic since the fucking black plague and everything else is that, is that their spoon fed this over and over in kind of a background capacity and they just start to believe it. And that was the again, the biggest premise behind this book was that, you know, that that in conjunction with a lot of other things that we are continually being, you know, smothered with, you know, as far as what we should be worried about and what the biggest problems facing this country are and they just, frankly, aren't true. The other thing that you mentioned was, you know, the pay wage gap is that, you know, that there's, you know, relatively popular adage that says, you know, women are historically paid less than men. And again, all the numbers are in my book. There's too many of them for me to verbatim, you know, fucking down to your lap on the show. But, but the reality of it is, is that they're not, you know, and one simple thing with that is, is that, you know, business owners are pretty shrewd, generally speaking, whether it's big business medium, you know, their bottom line, you know, that I'll put it this way. They're more shrewd than they are sexist. That's that's what I've I've come to the conclusion. Well, well, for sure. And, you know, illegal immigration in terms of the E verify and the issues that the government tries to to implement to not have people hiring millions of illegal emery immigrants, because they're cheaper, or all of these companies sending shit to China, because it's cheaper, right? So if women legitimately were paid 70 cents, I can tell you right now, the entire fucking workforce would be all women. Of course. And they're not obviously, you know, so I mean, to me, like you don't even have to look at the data, I think you should, because it absolutely proves it. But just on common sense of looking at the other dynamics of our society, if that were the case, then again, yeah, there'd be nothing but women in every workforce. So, you know, again, it's just it's a disingenuous talking point that that pisses people off and gets people mad, you know, and makes them want to stand behind something. And I think, you know, as a society, we've gotten, we've been so good for so long that we're a victim of our own success, you know, and and we've we've created things to be pissed about and causes to stand behind, because there aren't or there are so few legitimate causes that are still legitimate concerns in this country, that now that you know, the human mind has to struggle and has to have purpose and has to have things that they stand behind and are passionate about. And if you don't have those, then you're going to get them from TikTok and fucking Twitter and you're going to, you know, be spoon fed bullshit that that you have this this feigned outrage about, you know, that that's a manufactured pile of crap. But well, I can I can tell you a little anecdotal just from my own personal experience yesterday was a was a shitty day. I mean, it really was I don't need to get into all the specifics, but it was just a shitty day. I'd love to hear about it. Yeah, well, I'm sure I'm sure you would just love to hear how bad my life is. So I'm thinking about it, you know, I'm sitting in bed before I go to bed. I'm like, man, I just got to chalk that one up and just get after it tomorrow. And I started thinking about it. I'm like, okay, you know, here's what went wrong. And then I'm thinking about, okay, there's, there's kids who their dad and mom just died in a car crash. There's people who, you know, they don't have food. They don't know where the food's coming from. Or, you know, they just lost a loved one. And I'm like, okay, I really didn't have that bad of a day in the grand scheme of things because my computer went to shit, my internet went out and I couldn't get all I wanted to accomplish done. But you know, I think one thing people are doing though, in addition to what you're saying, like we're making things up to fret over because we have to have meeting in our lives, is that I think a lot of people, when they paint themselves into these false narratives, whether it's like you're saying with police or the gender pay gap and all these other issues that people seem to hit on, is I think a lot of times they're looking to explain away or excuse their underperformance, right? Because if it's somebody else or something else or somebody's doing this to me, then it's not my responsibility. If they only change their behavior, then my life is going to be different. And we know generally that just isn't true. So I agreed. And I don't know why there's such a disconnect from real life to a lot of other things where we don't do that. And I'll give you an example, let's say soccer, right? Or any professional sport, you know, there are advantages that teams have over other teams. Okay, this team has more money to hire a better coach. This team, you know, the weather is better where they train. This team, you know, has more money to hire, strengthen, and condition coaches have better gyms have better fucking whatever. Was that considered an advantage? Well, fuck yes, it is. Right, of course. You know, when the game is played, right, let's say we spent, you know, on the soccer team, we spent all of our money on the best fucking goalie in the world, right? And so now we play the game and it's five to zero. The other team doesn't say fucking goalie wouldn't let us score. God, you know, God damn this thing, you know, what are we supposed to do about it? It wouldn't let us fuck. It's like, like, right, it's that ridiculous. Like there's no shortage of opportunity, you know, but there's, there's such an avalanche of excuse as to why you didn't fucking perform or didn't try harder or didn't make the most of your opportunity. I mean, the fact that that people from from other countries who are born in a God damn cardboard box can come here with nothing speaking no English, you know, and fucking 13 years later are worth several million dollars and own five businesses tells you everything you need to know about about this land of opportunity that we are so incredibly blessed to live in, which is there's no shortage of it, you know, you can do almost whatever you want, you know, if you just fucking work hard and people don't want to do that. They want to sit on their ass and blame other people for their problems. And again, I don't know why there's such disparity from real life to every other aspect of our society. Because imagine in a post loss interview, you know, some some athlete says, yeah, fucking guy wouldn't let me score on him. It's bullshit. You know, it's like, are you kidding me? Wait, what? Fucking try harder. You know, like you should have ran faster. You should have hit him hard. Whatever it is, you know, boxing. Look, that's not that far off, though, man. I'm telling you, like, I was, I used to coach quite a few of my my kids' teams. And, you know, they try to pull the score away. They, I saw one article was a legit article. They were playing soccer without a ball. So nobody scored anything and made the other team feel bad. Like it's what you're saying sounds ridiculous, but you're actually predicting the future. This is going to happen. Yeah. I mean, I guess on a professional level where there's money involved, yeah, like, I don't think you're ever going to hear that because that is the great equalizer. I mean, the same thing, like women's soccer bitching about not being paid as much as men. Right. Here's the reality. Some more tickets. Well, you are a product, you know, whether you like it or not, you are. And the product sells or it doesn't, you know, and to me, it's like if you don't like being viewed as a product, then don't play professional soccer for a living, you know, but that's the case with everything entertainers, the same thing. A shitty actor, you know, or somebody that people just don't want to fucking see, isn't going to make as much as Tom Cruise per movie. Right. You know, and the reality of it is that the women's soccer team came to Texas not long ago and played a group of high school boys. It was a, you know, not a high school team, but high school age. I don't know what the what the league is called, but, you know, our professionals are high school kids. And, you know, the US, the handful of best women's soccer players in the United States got their absolute asses handed to them by a group of high school boys, you know, and so, you know, to me, I would say, you know, for all of the gender pay gap stuff, especially in sports. But I think it could be trickled down to, you know, a lot of professions as well is that stop having men's and women's anything then and see how that goes. Right, right, you know, like, like for the Olympics, now there's no men's and women's events. It's just the events, you know, and watch how many women win medals, right? There's a reason why college, you know, in high school and even in the Olympics, why there are women's sports, it's so that they can actually compete, you know, and you see it with some transgender athletes knowledge, I think it was a crock of shit. And, you know, I've had this debate with a number of people here, you're lately for completely different reasons, but the whole transgender thing, not to get way off topic. You know, but to me, if being a man or a woman, you know, is not designated by biologically what you're born with, if it's between here and here, and that's what makes you a man or a woman, then what fucking difference does it make what you are? Right. And for that matter, what does it even mean then? Like, if being a woman is nothing, that's what they want is is a state of mind, then tell me what that state of mind is. And I would also ask why is it that if you're born biologically as a male, but you quote unquote identify as a female, why is it then that you aesthetically go out of your way to appear just like a man people that biologically have what you're trying to identify with? Why do you give a fuck what you look like if it's not about that? Like none of those things make sense. And you know, you bring that up and it's well, you're a bigot and you're a transphobe and all this other stuff. And it's like, that's the most clear cut way to say I can't argue my way out of a paper bag is to just start hurling fucking personal insults because I can't have my position challenge and actually back it up with any actual logic or reason. The whole thing is kind of all connected that way. And it's it's if it wasn't so dangerous and sad, it would be laughable. But we're way past that. Well, that's the problem. I think you hit on it right there is that it's dangerous. You know, look, look at sports, for example, women are going to get hurt. I mean, they're there that's already happening. Yeah, I think there was a couple of UFC fights where a man who said he was a woman fought another woman and injured her severely. You know, this is only going to get worse. And not only that, when we're teaching our kids the wrong thing, inaccuracies lies, that's what they're going to build their entire worldview off of and they're going to be less effective, less productive because they don't have a truthful, truthful foundation from which to operate in their lives. Yeah, no, I agree. I mean, and it's yeah, it's setting them up for failure, you know, and it's like that slippery slope of, you know, you get to decide, I think it is the beginning of the end is that it's like now facts aren't even facts anymore. I mean, to me, it's no different than saying, you know, hey, I know I'm in math class and two plus two is four, but to me, two plus two is five. Like, well, no, it isn't. Like, I don't give a fuck what it is to you. It's not, you know, and to me, it's the same things. Like, I don't know when we paradigm shift wise as a society, have a gotten to the point where now you're it's your opinion on fucking everything. Well, I mean, look, here's the real issue. And before I said UFC with that fight, it wasn't, I don't think it was UFC. I just think it was an MMA fight. So I just want to correct that. But I think here's another issue is that nobody has the balls to say anything about it. So someone comes and says, Hey, no, two plus two is five and everybody's like, Oh, yeah, I think person's cut like the like the emperor with no clothes, right? Like, Oh, that guy's kind of crazy, but like, I'm not going to say anything because I don't want to draw attention. And that's the problem. If you see something that's not truthful, that's a lie, then you need to actually say something about it. Yeah, I agree. And I think, you know, the trans thing seems to be kind of the, at least for me, and maybe I'm completely off base. Maybe it's just anecdotally like my experiences with, you know, kids growing up in in today's day and age and getting in well into their teen years and seeing other kids and whatever. But, you know, to me, that that's the one kind of catalyst that seems like has kind of started it all. You know, is that, you know, call it a gateway drug into into the political correctness of validating fucking crazy things. You know, and to me, percentage wise, you know, whether you want to call it transgender as a more gender dysphoria, which is what it used to be called. I don't know why that's that's a politically charged issue or why that that's mean to say that it is. But to me, it is. It's a fusion, sure. Yeah, I mean, it's me. It's a mental disorder. I mean, that's what it is. Well, I think it's classified still as that in, I don't know what the medical the books are, but it is still classified as that as far as I understand. Yeah, or it was, you know, if you Google it now, it won't be. If you duck, duck, go, it might, you know, and that's part of the big problem too, is that, you know, that there's that it's hard to even know what's what's real or not. I mean, it's like we're living in the fucking matrix in a lot of ways. But but from a percentage standpoint, right, on the on the physical deformity side, there's 21 major physical deformities that Western science identifies as as considerable. Same thing on the mental issue side or mental disorder side. In each case, 3% of the population is born with one of either a major medical or physical deformity or a mental disorder. Any of those by themselves affect about 0.7% of the population. All right, people who who are gay, you know, that the entire LGBTQ community is 3% 3% of the population identifies as one of those categories. Transgenderism by itself affects 0.7% of the population. So even percentage wise, it falls completely in line with with all of the rest of those things. And the big differentiator though, is that let's say somebody is a schizophrenic, right? And they've got seven personalities in their mind. To me, that's no different than validating all seven of these personalities and saying, no, you, you know, you are seven different people here. Seven different IDs. You're seven different lives, you know, or lives that you live in and validating that. Now, sure, in an institution where a therapist is working with them, they may validate that to try to work through issues and see the depths with which their schizophrenia, you know, how far it goes and how many personalities there are. But the general population should not be validating that. Well, and even a therapist and a therapist is not going to enable that, you know, they might acknowledge it, right? They might acknowledge it and say, okay, well, you genuinely believe this. So I need to acknowledge your thought process, but I'm certainly not going to enable. But here's the interesting thing. Ironically, it's those people who are willing to tell the truth about life to other people in this context or any other context. Let's say you have an employee who's doing a shitty job. Well, you don't want to make that employee feel bad, but you have to make those corrections. Ironically, it's the person who actually speaks the truth, who I think cares more about the person than the individual who's going to continue to lie to them and help them live in their own delusion. Yeah. Those people aren't going to get the help they need if we continue to lie to them. Oh, no, I agree. I mean, it's like enabling a drug act. I mean, it's the same principle. You know, and I also think, again, that seems to be the catalyst for other things is that where do you draw the line? Because if that's okay, then what isn't? And does anybody that would say, yeah, no, that's okay. Well, what about from a cultural or ethnic racial standpoint? What if I, just for whatever reason, I feel more in tune with the Asian culture? Right. And that's just how I identify as an Asian man and not as a white man. Right. And the interesting thing about that is, is that's actually would be more accurate on culture because culture is societally constructed. Like America's culture is constructed by Americans, Indian culture, by Indian's cultures and history and belief and backgrounds and religion. Biology is not culture. Sure. Yeah. Culture is societally constructed. Yeah. But here's the irony with that is that the biology, which is not debatable, you know, is now fluid and it's up to you and then you can pick. But when it comes to, you know, if I was to say, hey, I want to apply to Harvard, not I identify Asian. You know, so, you know, that's how I feel about it and you need to accommodate that. Like they would laugh at you. Right, of course. If you laughed at somebody that said, hey, my pronouns are this, you'd get fucking sued. You know, like it's just sometimes I, not sometimes, I'd say most days. I look around and like I'm just waiting for Ash and Kritter to jump out of the closet and tell me I'm punked. Like I'm like, am I on a hidden camera show right now? How can this be fucking real? Yeah. You know, and that's because nobody says anything about it. Well, very few people if if the, if the 99% or whatever the percentages you're using, the 97 or 99% of the people would say, no, that's not right. That's ludicrous. And we're not basing legislation, behavior, dictating, how other people show up based on that. We're not doing that. Then it wouldn't happen. But those people aren't willing to stand up. Yeah, 99.7% of the population, you know, which ironically is also your chance of beating COVID if you get it. I know you're dragging that into it. Oh, yeah. I don't even, I think that one's just been dragged through the much. I mean, I think we kind of do because at this point, we all know it affects elderly people. If you want to get vaccinated, get vaccinated. If you don't, don't, everybody's had the decision to make their their choice as an adult. And let's start living our lives. I don't think that's an issue anymore, but apparently it is. Well, you also talked about, and one thing you hit on earlier was, was America being a rich spoiled brat is the term that you use. And I think that's exactly right. I think that's what you're hitting on right now is that we've had it so good for so long. That we just expect to be handed everything and coddled and nothing challenging or bad can come our way. And if it if it does, then it's because somebody did it to us. The term that you hear a lot is like hate speech. Look, if somebody's actively calling for violence against you, yeah, that to me is an issue. But if I came to you and I said, Hey, Mike, you know what, I think you're more on. I don't like you. Okay. Well, yeah. Okay. So maybe that's dubbed as hate speed. I don't know. Like it's so loose and open for interpretation, but yeah, I should have the right to say that. Yeah, I think there's a big difference between being a dick and hate speech. Right. Right. Unfortunately, those two things are kind of the same thing now. You know, and it's, you know, if you hurt somebody's feelings, you can go to jail for it. And it's just, you know, to me, ultimately, you know, there's, you know, kind of a simple principle where, you know, if you allow somebody to offend you and hurt your feelings, you are handing the control of your emotions over your feelings. Plain and simple. You know, no matter how big of a dick somebody is. And don't take that as like, I don't ever get worked up or somebody running their mouth. Yeah, there are times when I do, but it's pretty rare, you know, and for that reason, like, I don't want to put myself in a position where I'm allowing somebody else to dictate the control of my emotions. I'm not going to do it. Right. And, and that's an all or nothing thing, you know, because as soon as it's, well, but this word isn't okay. Okay. Well, then this word isn't okay. Well, then that one isn't okay. You know, I've had this debate with, you know, some of the LGBT community with with the pronoun stuff. You know, is it to me like, the way I view it. And this is again, this is where I make, I draw the line for me is that if you want to be called whatever name you want to be called, I'm happy to call you that. But I'm not going to call you a boy if you're not not going to call you a girl, you know, if you're not, I'll respect the fact that if you want your name to be Christina and you were born as a male and your parents named you John, if you want to be called Christina, no problem, but you're a guy, John, and it's he, you know, it's not z. It's not they. It's not, you know, like, like again, those are those are rules of the English language that exist so that people can communicate properly. That's right. You know, and I just I don't know how that's up for debate, you know, but because, you know, where I get into the debate is that, you know, it's like, well, you know, it offends me if you if you don't call me, you know, I'm non-binary, right? I don't identify as either one. And so I want you to call me day. And it's like, okay, well, you know, that same person may may say, or use the term cisgendered, right? You've heard of that. Sure. Yeah. Okay. So, so, all right. Well, if what if I tell you that offends me that you call me cisgendered, I don't want to be labeled as cisgendered. I just want to be called a male. Are you going to stop doing that? Probably not, you know, like, of course, you like you don't get to dictate every aspect of it. And again, to make it real simple is that, you know, here are the rules of the English language and you just stick to them, right? And it's not open to to debate, you know, like you don't get to pick your fucking pronouns anymore than you get to pick your sex at birth. If you're confused, I'm sorry. I don't think you should be mistreated because of it. But I don't think you should be coddled and, you know, and enabled, you know, for that aspect as well. The common rebuttal to what you're saying about human language is that human language evolves, right? And it has. And it will continue to evolve over time. And so the rebuttal is, well, you know, we can change the human language changes. And so we can't. The problem is that we don't all agree that it's going to change this way. And that leads us confused and ineffective. You know, I think about you and with the teams. I mean, imagine if you're all speaking a different language and you don't understand each other, like, how effective can you possibly be? Or at work, here's another consideration. At work, you've got a team of 10, you've got seven people who are acknowledged their biological sex. And then you've got three, hypothetically, that don't. Well, the seven now have to walk on eggshells and tip toe around and they can't have a real conversation with you. They can't point out real issues. They can't say, Hey, you're screwing this up because they're worried that you might consider it some sort of, you know, racially charged or sexist or misogynistic claim when no, all I really mean is that you're not doing a good job. And I need you to fix this. And then the team becomes less effective. Yeah. And I think that that's a straw man argument also because it's, there's a huge difference between the subtle nuance of shifting of language culturally versus saying this now doesn't mean this means that instead. You know, those two aren't the same. Like, that's just a chicken ship rebuttal to well, the English language changes. It's like, right, but not from a I factually identify something as this blue doesn't mean fucking green now. You know, and it won't. You know, and so, you know, yeah, I mean, to me, it's just such a, but such a weak argument. Like if that's the basis for for what, you know, what an argument is to validate that I think that tells you a lot about. You know, the lack of real ammo and justification they have for trying to validate that. Well, that, you know, that's another problem too is there's nuance in the way that we speak in language. And so we have social media where it's just these small clippets and snippets of talking points and people take it so literally. And they don't realize that even we believe there's exceptions to things we might be saying or conversations that we may be having. And they're not even looking at it. You know, and that's what's frustrating to me. But I think part of that comes from these echo chambers and tribalism. Yeah. And you do talk about that. It's like, nope, this is my talking point. Gotta stick to my talking point. Somebody else presents a, an interesting perspective you hadn't considered before. It's like, oh, I gotta ignore that. I gotta protect this ideology that I have. And that happens on both sides. Yeah. And I'm not immune to it either. I know I'm guilty of that as well. Well, I think, you know, again, you know, kind of like the first, first couple of principles. It kind of dovetails on to the, you know, go in with the prospect that you might be wrong. To me in that same vein, it's, it's that I welcome people to challenge any position I have in this book, any interview I've ever done. I mean, you know, you've pushed back on a number of topics, which I appreciate. And I think everybody should, should welcome being challenged on anything they say because it does one of two things that either reinforces your position and you, and you have a reasonable way to defend it. Or it actually changes your mind and you grow from it. You know, I've changed my mind on a lot of things. And that's one of the things I mentioned in the book also is that I'm not just saying, hey, you should, you should be willing to change your mind. I haven't because I've been right every time. No, I've changed my mind on a lot of things. And the example I use in the book is, is the kneeling of the anthem thing. You know, do I like that? No, I don't. Does it deteriorate me? Yes, absolutely it does. Do I think that it should be illegal? No. You know, and the reason is the NFL, just like a lot of other things is ultimately at the end of the day, it's a fucking business. You know, and each franchise owner is the owner of that franchise and that business and they can run their team how they see fit. And you can not like it and you can just not watch it and not support them. And at the end of the day, you know, if the NFL loses 97% of their viewership over something like that, I rest the fuck assured, they'll stop doing it. You know, and so if something bothers you that much, you've got to be willing to vote with your wallet and not support it. Most of us aren't that convicted about these things we pretend to be upset about, though, either. Oh, well, like, you know, I'm not going to ditch my Netflix. Well, you know, I don't agree with what they're putting on, but I'm not ditching it. I'm keeping it. Yeah, yeah, to me, it's pick one either either be pissed and ditched or keep it and shut the fuck up about it. Exactly. Yeah, 100%. You know, yeah, don't complain about it then, you know, or complain about it and live by the sword and fucking stop doing it, you know, but, you know, so that, you know, like at first I was like those motherfuckers like that shit should be illegal. You know, like no, wait a minute. They shouldn't be as much as I hate it. This is where, you know, the first amendment and I get, you know, businesses different than, you know, than just out in the public. But at the end of the day, like, it's a privately owned business. They can run it however the fuck they want. I don't think that they should get any tax breaks. I don't think it should be classified basically as a nonprofit and get the tax breaks that the NFL does. But I think, you know, they need to be able to run their business how they want on the same token. If a business owner says, no, everyone at you motherfuckers is going to stand up when I tell you to and you're going to stand there and you're going to do this no different than any other fucking job. Right. Is that, you know, if I mean the business that I own like there are certain things that I allow and certain things that I don't allow to grant and I'm pretty fucking liberal when it comes to my employees and let them whether it, you know, how they dress their political leanings, what they post like, I don't give a shit about any of that stuff. But there's people that do, you know, there's big corporations that don't allow you. I mean, you see it all the time. People get fired because of one post they put on Twitter or something. They said on fucking Facebook nine years ago or what have you, you know, so it's not that that that isn't allowed and you can agree with it or you can disagree with it. But ultimately, I think businesses should be able to run how they want it. That's how they they want to do it. They should be allowed to. Well, the other thing is why would you want to support a business that you don't agree with? You know, like so many people are like, well, they should change this and they should do this differently. Or alternatively, why like, why do it would be the equivalent of saying, Hey, I've got this friend and I hang out with him and I feel shitty every time I'm with him and he's a loser and he takes it out on me and he makes me feel bad about myself. But you know, like, I really, I'm going to go spend more time with him. Like, like nobody's going to do that. Yeah, or to me, like if you make them do something, like at that point, is it how is that any more respectful? It's not like, I mean, to me, it's like it's like asking for a compliment. You know, it's like, you know, a woman is a red dress. Yeah, I mean, it's like, like your wife walks out in the sexy red dress and you're just on your phone, you know, and you look up and you're like, Oh, hey, and she's like, you're going to say something like, Oh, yeah, fuck baby. Look hot. Like, God, you look sexy as fuck tonight. Like, does that mean anything at that point? No, it doesn't. No, no. So, yeah, I mean, to me, it's kind of the same thing. Like, if they don't, you know, my version of respect is is what it is, you know, and if, and if, you know, the group of people that are doing that don't feel it. And you know, and you can say, well, we didn't mean that as a form of disrespect to a veteran. Well, I mean, you can say the same thing about a racial slur. Like, well, I didn't mean any disrespect by that. Well, motherfucker, that's how they took it. Right. You don't get to decide if it was or not. Yeah, like you may not have meant it that way, but I can tell you, use a racial slur around certain groups of people and see how that pants, see if they're if they feel disrespected by it. You know, rest of fuckers sure they will, you know, and that's their, their right to feel disrespected by it. So this is that same token. But again, I don't think you get to dictate how people act if you're offended by what they're doing. You can fucking choose to ignore it or not. Right. Agreed. Well, I like the conversation we've had because, you know, we've talked about a lot of these issues and there have been some, you know, minor, hey, let's talk about this. And, but that is the point of the work and the book that you did is both subtitled, respectful, open-minded conversations. I think is that right? Yeah. It's a little bit of a contrast to the title, but on Facebook. I've, I've figured I was like, no, wait a second here. Is that, is that really that? It is. And I know it is. Because that's what we're having right now. You know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, I think that's why America is so fucked. It's because there's such a lack of decorum when it comes to actually talking about things. People just get mad and they start throwing personal insults and they react emotionally instead of reasonably. You know, and any time you, you ditch reason for emotion, you can, you can almost rest assured it's going to be the wrong, wrong position. For sure. Well, tell the, tell the guys where to go, how to connect with what you're doing. Obviously, they can pick up a copy of the book wherever they get books, but where should they connect with you? So if you just go to, to microitlandcode.com or just Google my name and then that'll be the first thing that comes up. That's really the kind of the hub of everything, whether it's dogs, dog training, podcast, the books, speaking engagements, worry, dog foundation, you know, everything, anything and everything that I have going on is all kind of centrally located there. Just try to make it easy. Awesome. And we didn't obviously talk about this today, but guys, if you have a dog or a pup and you want to train that pup yourself, or even if you don't, there's great training. And I can attest to it because I've taken two dogs through that training that you've put together and it's phenomenal. I've never had more well behaved dogs in my life than when I started using the training that you put together. I appreciate that. It's very, very flattering coming from you and also the food. One thing that I did launch last time we talked is, is the fueled by team dog food and treats and supplements, which have been going really, really well. And, and I can't recommend that stuff enough. I only sell it because I basically worked with a manufacturer to formulate a blend that I wanted for all the retired dogs and my own personal dogs that I just couldn't couldn't find the consistency and quality that I wanted, which is a recurring theme of all the products that I do. They're all made because of that. It's because this is exactly how I want it. And so since I'm making it for me, then I'll sell it as a product also. So, so it's really good stuff. And I can't recommend enough. It should be should be coming on chewy here soon too. Oh, that's cool. Is there a, is there like a CBD oil version or something or something? Oh, there was. Okay. Yeah, we used to do CBD oil. The, the connection that there still is with advertising and Google ads and stuff like that because it's a hemp product. It was just too big of a fucking hassle to, to continue to battle with them. So we don't sell it, which is unfortunate because it was a good product too. And yeah, had a lot of really good positive feedback of people that said it changed their dogs lives and what have you, but it just cost benefit analysis wise wasn't, it just wasn't worth keeping on it. But I was wondering about that because while we had Sarge, he passed away several months ago, but he was such a high strung dog. And he was always, he seemed very anxious all the time, not just like excited, but anxious like there was some anxiety or something issues going on. And I was wondering if that would help with some of that. I mean, he's acting. We kept him outside. We ran him all the time. So it wasn't any of that. I don't know. Yeah, I would say in most cases, it is. In most cases, it's effective. You know, CBD oil for dogs, similarly with people, I think most people see a benefit to it, but not everybody. You know, I'd say, you know, my, my experience was about 80 to 85% of the dogs that we put it on showed a noticeable impact. And the neat thing about it is, and same thing with the food and the supplements, frankly, is that I mean, I've gotten feedback from people all over the place. Talk about, you know, how the dog is really hard to keep laid on or, you know, dogs coat looked like shit or he's real itchy and scratchy and hot spots and whatever. And, you know, within about 30 days of switching to the food, it's, you know, a very transformative process. Yeah, it's awesome. You know, so yeah, with most, most dogs, the food, the treats, the CBD oil is all pretty effective. Yeah. Well, we'll sync it all up. Well, Mike, I appreciate your brother. I appreciate our friendship and always our conversations. They're always good. And I walk away with some new information or new ways of looking at things. So excited to get this out to the guys. Appreciate your brother. I'm not appreciate you. Thank you. All right, you guys. There you go. My conversation with one and only Mike Ritland. I hope you enjoyed that show and that conversation, even in disagreement. I know you probably disagreed with it. You probably agreed with other facets of it. These are the conversations that we need to be having. So guys, if you're not having these conversations with other men in your sphere of influence, neighbors, colleagues, coworkers, friends, family, et cetera, then I think we're really missing a powerful opportunity to have conversations that are going to make a real difference and a real impact in our way of life. So if you want to use this as fuel, please do so. Send a text to somebody. Take a screenshot right now before it turns off in the next few seconds and post it up on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, tag me, tag Mike, and let us know what you're listening to. And most importantly, let other people know what you're listening to so they can benefit from the conversations as well. And you guys can debate, discuss and disagree and agree and all that kind of stuff as well. Also, be sure to pick up a copy of Un-F America by Mr. Mike Ritland. Check out my son, Brecken's new podcast called Man in the Making at manandamaking.com.com. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life and be more of the man you were meant to be. We invite you to join the Order at Order of Man.com."
