    "text": " Get ready to hear the truth about America on a show that's not immune to the facts with your host Dan Bonjino All right, welcome to the Dan Bonjino show producer Joe. How are you today and already for another action packed week Dan? Hey, you dude you believe this this uh the far bell a ball what a button basketball I mean is this guy for real folks for those of you miss this story. I Mean I really haven't a tough time with this one like this president Trump can do nothing Without getting kicked in the teeth by the left wing media hacks and Democrats. It's really pathetic So for those of you who missed the story Yeah, laver ball. Uh his son is it Lee Angelo ball? I'm not really sure the name But Lee Angelo ball was one of the uc le You see la basketball players who again if you miss the story got caught shoplifting in China You see la the basketball team went over there to play a game There were three players who were caught by the chinese shoplifting. They've admitted it This isn't a you know a legit incident. They've admitted to doing it. Okay. Oh, they got caught by the Chinese government Uh they were they were uh apprehended and they were they were being held in custody So uh most of you may know some of you may not well trump gets involved the president trump and Basically personally gets involved and and asks for their release They are subsequently released back into the united states and i'll say this they gave a press conference to three players Lee Angelo and the two others their names are escaping me right now joe and they were very gracious So I thought they the thank the president They did not in any way try to put lipstick on it. They were like we screwed up. We embarrassed ourselves We embarrassed their team. Listen, I I believe in the power of redemption and forgiveness. I hope they're sincere I don't know what was in their heads, but they certainly sounded sincere to me joe right? Yes trump then releases a tweet a very Gracious tweet to where he says listen people screw up all the time And basically says I hope these guys go on to live really great lives now In a normal non insane labral world joseph, right? That's the end of it. Yeah, it's mean it's not me clapping That's me white big my hands of it Guys screw up you as citizens president personally gets involved Gets them released from a foreign country a communist regime Uh, they thank him he says terrific, you know, you guys. I hope everything works out. Well goodbye Well, of course, that's not enough because trump derangement syndrome this viral infection uh, like, uh, what is it like mad cow disease? infecting liberals hollywood types entertainers and sports types has just It's like a parasite eating their brains Leangelo balls dad lvar ball Comes out and says in an interview He goes well listen, you know piece guys trying to take credit for this and you know He didn't really do too much to get him released and it basically takes a shot at trump So I tweeted out this week and I'm like, let me get this straight step one shoplifting a foreign country step two Get caught shoplifting in a foreign country You know step three the potus person in the united states intervenes To get you released from the foreign country step four your dad goes nuclear on trump the next like what the heck Well folks. Oh seriously. We're living in bizarro superman land. Yeah now What's amazing about the story is not that that happened. You know great. It's news. I you know, I Sometimes do news of the day sometimes pick different stuff What's interesting to me about this story joe is the media spin on this again Now to media types that listen to my show and I know there are some I get the Emails personally from some producers. You know who you are. I appreciate you listening And by the way, I mean some of them are actually conservative too Who've tried to pitch some of the stories to their staffs. I get they're really great emails by the way I will never name your names. Don't worry. Oh, I don't want to get you in trouble I know you were for the left wing media. God forbid you actually proposed stories that are not left wing narratives But what's fascinating about this is the hack left wing media is now blaming this on trump What the hell did trump do wrong? Trump intervenes to get your kid released after he admits to committing a crime in a foreign country, right? He he admits it He admits it trump intervenes with the burning political capital with a foreign country to get your kids released who screwed up Well, you're a kid in this case. I don't know what the other parents Uh, think they didn't say anything to be fair But to get your kid released and then you open your mouth and you take a pot shot at the president So what happened to president fired back on a tweet and said Well, hey, you know, maybe I should have left him in jail then All right, you know, it's typical, you know, you're trumpy and he's gonna always fire back when he wants to but they blame it on trump Oh my gosh. She said he was gonna leave the american citizens in jail. What you mean like uh What do you mean like obama? An auto warm beer who uh who died by the way when he was released from an earth Korean p- oh, you mean like that You mean like that guy? Folks again, you see now why I wake up every single day Thinking what fight are we gonna have with? intellectually vacuous liberals today So you have a problem now with trump who by the way You've declared over and over to be a racist despite no evidence of that being actually true Because everybody's a racist to you He gets three black basketball players released from china who admitted committing a crime The father then attacks trump and then trump who fires back is now the guilty party Oh boy But by the way, don't apply the same standard joe to obama, you know, yeah, right? Okay Who did nothing to get you know, I mean, well, I don't want to say did not let me be fair But did not get warm beer released Who is now dead? Let's not apply that standard. Let's just move on and forget I mean it's really disgusting folks and you wonder why the media what is it? 90 percent of republicans think the media is the equivalent I don't even want to say the national acquire because the national acquire once in a while actually breaks a true story The media is just total complete hackery. It's just disgusting It's totally completely pathetic and on that note before I move on to my next story because I don't know if I was going to cover this but on that note The ran paul story equally disturbing senator ran paul from katucky is attacked by his neighbor The guy breaks six ribs causes some kind of fluid buildup and around his lungs the guys in the hospital ran paul He's having a tough time breathing afterwards He's viciously attacked by his neighbor and the media is still i'll put this story in the show notes today Up on gno.com and if you subscribe to my email list i'll send it to you Is an interesting story by the washing exam about how the media is dying joe dying? To portray this story as a dispute over lawn clippings. Yeah, saw them As you saw the one despite the fact joe that the neighbor This is like one person's account everyone else the neighbor. It's like lawn clippings What are you talking about? It's despite the fact that the neighbor When you look at his facebook posts is like a devout socialist and hillary supporter or bernie supporter whatever it is Now joe reverse the script here And make that a democrat lawmaker attacked by a republican neighbor breaking his ribs Cloring causing fluid buildup around his lungs Causing a hospitalization very serious injuries and the story right away will be crazy maniac republican racist misogynistic homophobic transaphobic islamaphobic phobic phobic phobic phobic is the phobe attacks poor democratic senator Republicans should all be uh summarily executed on a firing line in the state of katucky the devil reincarnate Yes, the devil reincarnate of course But because it's a republican lawmaker attacked by a socialist the story is about lawn clippings lawn clippings Read the piece folks ed the media just if they're just disgusting entities they really are they're just filthy Just ignore them just ignore them and go out and seek your own sources Your own credible sources of information because counting on anything from the media to be actually accurate It's just absurd Attacking trump joe a trump trump because he gets the guy's kid out of jail You know he shouldn't have responded that way, you know, dan that's that's a hell of an example to set for your kid I'm sorry man, right? Isn't it you know what i'm saying? Joe, let me listen, you know, you're a dad. I'm a dad sure I don't have boys you have a boy I have two girls Yeah, but honest question for you I mean I already know the answer but you catch your kid Shoplifting somewhere and he admits to it by the way It's not a question of like was he profiled or anything you come up. Yeah, I got caught stealing By the way, it wasn't caught stealing like bazooka gum. Okay, remember bazooka the five-says gum with your kids. Yeah, yo The younger listeners like what the hell's bazooka gum? Um, you got caught stealing a pair of expensive sunglasses the guy in china Yeah, you're the store owner. Let's say brings you brings your kid home and he's like listen We're not gonna press charges here But you know your son be caught your son whatever he's on tape he admitted to it stealing sunglasses What's the first thing you say to him, Joe? I forgive you, but uh you're gonna have some time to serve at home pal. You're damn right Yeah, your allowance is gone. Give me your phone You're punished and by the way, uh that trip we were gonna take whatever it might though You know she likes Disney or anything like that. Yeah, that's how to I mean, I'm not gonna I don't like to you know I I feel like I owe you all a sense of insight into my personal life because you've allowed me so much insight into yours By playing my show every day, but I got an incident with my daughter last year I'm not gonna say what it wasn't that serious, but it was serious enough that it bothered me And she was staying up on my mother-in-law's up in viro I got in my car and drove my caboose up there that day was like getting a car Right? You my mother-in-law didn't even say like hello when I walked in because she knew how serious So I said, oh hi daddy. I'm like, oh, give me the kid.

Oh, oh greaty who uh reports on south america for the wall street journal has uh I'm sorry to switch You know topics on you. I know like these segues are always uncomfortable between happy stories and you know what i'm saying joe And you're in it radio all the time you're reporting on You know, uh, you know, mary christmas folks and is gonna be it joe's up in baltimore that area Tal's in today and in the next story is like a cop is shot and you're like, well, how do we segue there? So these are always uncomfortable. This is a really troubling story So mario grady reports on south america for the journal and she always writes really thought provoking good pieces I'm always fascinated about what's going on in south america because um, I spent a lot of time down there and my wife is from there So I I enjoy reading her pieces She has a really troubling piece on venus willa and i'm sorry joe i never joe joe asked me what we were going to talk about I should have told him like we were going to proceed on to a rather macabre story afterwards But uh, he's used to rolling with it. So I read the piece and it's about the destruction Of a a formerly great country in venezuela formerly powerful economy And the destruction of it since the implementation of socialism during the shavas and now meduro era now folks I I'm i'm Asking you a personal favor now For those of you listening Who have friends who are socialists who have young kids who are impressionable? I get a lot of emails from parents who say You know, dan my kid. She was she was she or she or she was a You know, we've had them go on with conservative principles and freedom and liberty and I got to college and now I can't get them back And we're losing them and they're turning to the left. These college professors are indoctrinating them Just have them listen to this piece They can read the piece but it's you know a lot of it's subscriber only But let me read you a quote from what's going on in venezuela since the government implemented socialism which again for the Joe, what is this the umpteenth thousandth time umpteenth thousand the millionth umpteenth thousandth times ten time socialism is Because we can't argue about the benefits or detrimental effects of socialism if we have no idea what it is Now for those of you out there who don't know what it is and profess to know what it is socialism is clearly the government control of the means of production It's basically a government control of the economy That was implemented in venezuela now here's a quote from a piece about what what's happening and this is Stevastating you can't listen to this as a good person a christian a Jew a Buddhist or anyone who cares about anyone else and not be really physically You know get retched by this They're children Joe talking about the venezuelans they cry all day and their mothers can only give them water They are dying The residents of korakis when a venezuela is largest cities have lost an average of 30 pounds Folks you don't have to have kids like joe and i to be disturbed by that i'm asking you for a second To visualize this very scene in korakis where you have say a dad Who says i'm average sized at ease what five nine hundred fifty pounds who's now five nine hundred twenty pounds Whose wife is say five three hundred pounds who's now seventy pounds Who are now sitting at a dinner table with their kids with no food The kids are now crying out of pain because there's no food to eat Physical pain because they have nothing to eat and all they can do is give them water They don't even have kool-aid for calories these kids are crying They're dying folks people are dying in a socialist country to all of our younger listeners out there who were were may have Partaken in that poll or had allegiances with the poll that we spoke about last week Joe where millennials now a good solid portion of millennials thinks socialism is a positive path forward. Yeah Does that bother you at all You know i To make sure i didn't get lost on this and getting to a rant rather than a fact based discussion I just wrote one simple line down below this on my notepad here for the show Where's your heart? Where is it? You think this is a mistake Do you think that every time socialism is implemented the mass starvation and death that follows afterwards? It's just some mistake If it is a mistake Why is it a mistake unique to socialism? Why is that mistake not happening here In other words for you defenders of socialism out there Who will defer to the Joe typical explanation i hear oh oh it's that's not really socialism that's just corrupt people involved So there's no corrupt people anywhere else Joe in other words they're only dying and starving in socialist regimes Everyone else is non-corruptible. It's just socialism that corrupts people How is that a defense of your argument for socialism? So corruption which is a problem everywhere in the world. Joe can we agree? Yeah, the united states in monarchies and tyrannies and oligarchies in socialist countries human beings are always corruptible That those corruptible human beings only seem to cause massive death and starvation when socialism is implemented and that's the best defense you have Where's your heart? I'm serious. I'm really probing you for a second to ask you to dig within your soul If you were a young kid that's been suckered by a college professor into believing that socialism and i'm going to explain to you in a minute Why this is happening? In case you have any illusions otherwise that i'm making this up I'm asking you where's your heart? The reason you support socialism by the way is because you've never been subjected to socialism You know i'm not going to give you my exact address because it would expose who he is But my my neighbor has came from a Cuban regime He is um pretty darn conservative Because he actually lived in social in a socialist country in kuba Folks here's the problem now too they're having in minisuela because i'm getting back to just the quick economics on this because this is Pretty simple stuff for you college kids are having a tough time and you adults who are having even tougher time Shaking the scourge of socialism because you're some it's like it's magnetical law to you and it's rhetoric matter Equality for all yeah equality and death and starvation you're absolutely right Except by the way for the government bureaucrats who enrich themselves here's what's happening When you price control and economy You're always going to get a couple of things or actually you're going to get four things to be specific You're going to get increased uh demand For products because the products if you when you push the price lower than the market price more people are going to want them You're going to get decreased supply You're going to get black markets in quality control. You're going to get decreased supply because no one's going to produce a product i e joe Food if the government says hey, um johnny apple seed farmer Farmer guy Hey johnny here's the deal you can only charge a dollar for whatever 20 bushels a wheat whatever it may be Yeah, but it costs me two dollars. Yeah, but we just said you can only charge the dollar This is socialism. We know better than you shut your mouth So joe, what do you think johnny apple seed farmer does? Well, this johnny apple seed would stop producing baby You would be right joe's right again. Ding ding ding ding ding. We don't want to chicken dinner Joe you're amazing. You're really really you're like a phd economy No, I think you're smarter than a phd economy because they're a phd economist like crewman who actually believe in this type of crap Yeah, so you're actually more intelligent than they are i'm not kidding i'm i'm dead serious You are actually smarter than they are So they're not producing food A price control is a hallmark of socialism when you don't let the market determine a price You let the government determine a price which is below the market price Which forces people to scoop up what they have now and produces to produce none of it later It also causes black markets and quality controls because if you're forced to produce it a dollar Even if you're done at the end of a barrel of a gun you will produce for a dollar You're not going to work as hard as if you were actually making a profit Mm So you wind up getting crap products like the lotta the russian car which fell apart the minute you drove it off the lot But here's the problem they're having now, Joe They're going through hyperinflation because what did the government do? Well the government you know the socialism they're all geniuses they control the economy and the means of production They also control what the printing of money? So of course government bureaucrats who've got they've got the system Pank Joe they've got it pegged they said I got a great idea. Let's just print more money I Yeah, it's just like I know I know we're living in like bizarro super bad land So the government printed more money which devalued the currency they had now So what happened the venus whelan currency collapsed because if you're if you're making a bunch of bagels for a market for bagels And you know as a hundred people for a hundred bagels and you decide you're going to make 400 000 bagels your bagels aren't going to be worth anything because you're going to overflood the market with bagels the same thing happens with money So the venus whelan Currency is basically collapsed and they have no hard currency in other words foreign currency that hasn't collapsed joe They have no hard currency to exchange reserves that they they can buy in far Remember I told you about trade deficits that not to worry too much about trade deficits because us currency is only spendable in the united states Or on us denominated assets. Mm-hmm. Well the venus whelans are running out of hard currency us dollars euros They're running out of it. So what's happening now? They can't buy us products to replace the food. They're not producing at home due to the price control so people are starving and dying So now what happens of course what happens next in socialism regime so the implement price controls producers stop producing people starve You run out of hard currency because your currencies collapsed and the trade value for it collapses So you don't have any hard currency to buy things from overseas in their currency joe Because your currencies collapse your your trade value your exchange rates completely collapsed You need 25 billion venus whelan Bolivars red to get a dollar. I mean i'm exaggerating but you get the point you can't buy anything from overseas So now your people starve even more because you can't supplant production that stop locally due to price controls with foreign production because you don't have foreign money And then what happens inevitably what always happens in foreign regimes and mario grady puts us in there There now is a penalty of 20 years in prison joe for inciting hatred due to your politics Whoa, basically open your mouth and get 20 years in prison and getting a big ass kicking and in venus whelan prison Real nice cute folks You know, I bring it. I know like my show. I know we have a lighter tone sometimes sometimes not but I know we could be sarcastic at times But folks is really serious It's not a joke you know, this is You have a group of people out there in the united states who despite all available evidence of the death and destruction this sick deranged Economic organization system we call socialism Uh, it imparts on to people They still still propagate the myth that this is a successful path forward It is so deeply disturbing to the college kids out there.

So I get all I was breathing really heavy. So I'm uh, I'm sucking a little wind still I did a show a little while ago on bitcoin and crypto currencies and blockchain and I got a lot of feedback 90 positive 10 percent I wouldn't say negative but some people said I you know I didn't go in depth enough or in depth enough and some people said I went to in depth I'm not going to redo that show on what bitcoin is and crypto currencies are Uh, but I just do want to lend a note of caution here And I'll put this story in the show notes and I strongly Strongly encourage you to read it if you are either an investor in bitcoin or crypto currencies or are considering it Folks, they've been all over the place in recent weeks. They've had three plunges or more of 25 percent of their value Now my caution to you at bitcoin. I'm not saying it's not a good idea. I'm not it's not an investment show I'm not telling you to invest or not. I'm just I give opinion. This is my opinion. If you don't like it disregard it. That's fine They've had three plunges of 25 percent or more in value in the recent weeks and they've recovered they've recovered Substantially, it's now over $45 Bitcoin as if I think last friday when they closed Here's a couple issues I haven't just why i'm encouraging you just to be cautious I'm not telling you don't to invest don't invest in it We clear on that show because I know i'll get an email. Mm-hmm say don't Folks bitcoin is an exchange is a value exchange It's no different than say the use of gold coins to buy something or the use of frn's federal reserve notes What we would call dollars in the united states Understand this is not an investment. This is an investment in money Now you may say oh well, we're investing in the technology blockchain Okay, kind of but that's like saying you know with the with you know federal reserve notes Oh, well, we're inventing in the we were investing in the intaglio printing process That's not what blockchain is in other words the use of bitcoin is as a proxy for currency Which is a store of value, right? We don't trade in frigerators show I know but you know go i'll give you two refrigerators for an hour your work. What we give you money Why because it's convenient it's transportable and it's exchangeable and it's relatively liquid So if you're investing in bitcoin understand that it's not the technology you're investing in because the blockchain technology By the way, which is very good There are other ways to invest in that where it's not in fact the money you're investing in you get what i'm saying joe There's going to be blockchain technology for everything encryption methods everything that's fine You can invest in a cyber security company But if you're investing in bitcoin based on the technology that's not what you're investing in it in the actual currency that uses the technology My point in this is it's a simple one Don't invest in money or monies or transferable, you know Semi liquid assets like this on the hope that it's the technology that's going to get you through because the technology by the way I think in the in the relatively near future due to quantum computing and the use of qubits over bits blockchain, I think in the future will Maybe render it obsolete May so i just be cautious i'm big i'm not saying it's not a bad idea i'm not saying it's not a viable alternative But understand this people who invest in currencies as investments Like people who invest in gold as an alternate currency are investing it for a security Security is the value it adds to their life and I understand that you get what i'm saying joe I get like if you're investing in gold because you say the united states government is printing money and the money's going to be worthless soon You're paying a premium for gold for money You're basically paying money for money But you're paying extra money for money a premium because you believe in the security it offers you rather than the security of the united states currency the federal reserve note I get it, but you have to ask yourself with bitcoin is that premium for the safety of bitcoin and blockchain technology? Is that worth the premium you're paying now at eight thousand dollars? I don't know i'm not sure you know i'm saying i've actually seen a bitcoin being Some of these firms advertising this use for retirement accounts Yeah, I mean there's there's actual banks out there now that are going to be doing Uh futures in bitcoin and i listen i think it's a wonderful idea Please don't send me hate mail on it and again i'm not telling you Not to invest in it or look into it to diversify your portfolio at all it's not an investment show I'm just telling you i read this story this morning I'll put it in the show notes about bitcoin going up and down and I would be very cautious I read a story a while ago showing how you know the value of bitcoin right now You know it's it's more than the value of basically most of the products you can purchase with it based on the liquidity of it I mean that doesn't make any sense So just be a little bit cautious there Oh boy. All right. Oh, hey, here's some good news Let me get some good news by the way because it is a monday and we need good news and this is really good news So you can smile at the end of this story There are a number of different entities right now that are extremely optimistic about the future growth potential of the economy and folks I have to agree Um having said that about qubits and quantum computing and blockchain which I think is fantastic the technology if the quantum computing doesn't crack it By the way, we'll find some way to weaken it I mean i've never cracked it because of the way it's designed but find a way to weaken it in the future But these are all unbelievable things gene coding stem cell technology Which i'm going out. I'll let you know by the way, i'm going out next week to do my shoulders again Which stem cells we are on the verge folks have some really big things and I think the fact that donald trump has brought some sanity back to the courts through Relatively conservative constitutionalist court appointments show. Um, he's engaged on a pretty robust vibrant anti red tape agenda Regulatory reform in washington dc and this puss she's doing for tax cuts if we can in fact get them tax rate cuts and get more money in the hands of private Consumers, I think we are on pace for a and absolutely incredible 2018. I'm not on my own here I've said that before um, I'm not you know, I I'm a big believer in the power of the american economy Uh the federal reserve right now is and i'll put this story at the show notes By the way, it's one of the wall street journal and one from blunberg You know in case you think i'm randomly pulling these numbers out of thin air the federal reserve General's looking at potentially 3.5 growth next quarter, which they're upping from 3.4 growth that is an Extraordinary number compared to the two years, uh, excuse me the eight years of 2 percent and less growth by obama Remember obama during eight years in office Never folks never ever reached 3 growth in any year of his time He is the first president to never do that and he had the worst recovery based on gdp growth in modern american history post world war two Trump has now hit two consecutive quarters of 3 growth during his presidency and just to be clear and be fair I don't blame every single economic problem on obama and I don't blame every single economic success on trump But I do believe the president sets the tone I do believe that it is a fact that president obama was not a big fan of capitalism as we know it and set a generally Antibisis environment to obama care and tax hikes and things of the sort I believe trump has reversed that trend and I believe business confidence is skyrocketing So is consumer confidence the fed is now predicting 3.5 growth folks that is a big number in the next quarter That is a huge number. You know what that means? That means the competition for employees because businesses are going to grow That's what growth means. I'm not trying to be sarcastic, but that's what 3.5 growth means and they we're producing more stuff businesses are growing Why would they produce more stuff Joe because they're selling more stuff? That's going to mean what they're going to need more employees, which is going to mean what? Competition for labor, which is going to mean what? Which is going to mean people like Joe and I and everyone else competition for our skills and our labor and our services Joe Are going to enable us to do what? Ask for more money Now just in case you say well the federal reserve and grant that I agree with you there I'm always skeptical the federal reserve because that 3.5 number to be clear was their prediction for the next quarter The Goldman Sachs is predicting a 2.5 growth Which is still a pretty decent number compared to where we were now. I'm not a you know huge advocate for Goldman Sachs They've been right. They've been wrong. They sometimes all over the place, but even at that number We're still looking at enhanced growth from the Obama years folks So I say around this Christmas season Thanksgiving season This holiday season at the end of the year where people are generally pretty cheery and it's great to give gifts and the economy gets a little bit of a boost from the The extra consumption around the holidays I think 2018 is going to be a really really fantastic year and I think you can um I think you can all smile. I think it's going to be getting out. I you know this stuff is always of course Hope if we don't get the tax cuts this could all change in a heartbeat But uh one quick note on that too just to the republicans listening I don't know I don't know if they understand Joe how deeply and peril they are if they don't pass this tax cut plan You will be in a world of trouble I'm out there. I'm still an activist. I talked to people a little time. You better get this tax thing done You better get it done. It's going to be deeply disturbing if you know Okay, uh Oh Gosh, man. I missed this. This really pisses me off. I'm sorry I was talking about the Venezuela thing in the beginning and I had a quick contrast and I missed it because I was so excited Thinking up to the bitcoin story that I've Casually glossed right over it, but just a quick note I'm not I'm not returning back to the venezuela store But for those of you you know you listened to the show you didn't just tune in right now Obviously you heard me talk about the destructive power of socialism and how kids are starving tragically in venezuela This was the point I wanted to make for the for the socialist listening And for the parents who are listening to them. There's their kids listen to this Folks Contrast this which would go with what's going on in the united states So again, we had this starvation in venezuela an average loss of weight of 30 pounds in koraka's kids are crying Because there's they're crying from hunger their parents have no food for them a horrible human interest story going on right now comparing contrast with a relatively free market a relatively capitalist society in the united states What's going on now joe Joe turkey demand it's around thanksgiving right yeah Do you know turkey demand is doubled in the united states in the 1980s? Well, no, I didn't I found that interesting. What does this have to do with venezuela or anything else and it states that it's been stable since so just to be clear venezuela Food demand is going up Socialist government because the population is growing socialist government is implemented people are starving losing weight their kids are crying In the united states turkey demand doubled in the 1980s in state stable ever since and by the way How does an article in bloomberg about this i'll put in the show notes you can read it yourself turkey joe is 1.6% cheaper this year in the united states than last year and the whole meal is the cheapest since 2013 oh Oh Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, let me get this straight So let me put myself into the college kid mode right now in the college camera insulting college kids You're doing the right thing in college, but you're listening to your socialist professor who's uh extolling the virtues of socialism Where people are literally losing weight and dying and kids are crying because they have no food and they're drinking water So that system you haven't you haven't increased the man for food and increased demand for services You also have increased starvation increased death poverty hunger and destruction everywhere you go The united states the you know what your socialist professor would call whatever the evil empire The imperialist nation the white privilege racist is the phobic homophobic racist misogynist islamophobic transaphobic lgbt phobic nation Uh the worst country on the history of mankind Turkey demand doubled as stable state stable ever since and turkey is now 1.6% cheaper than it was last year and the whole meal is the cheapest it's been in four years, hey Big round of applause for capitalism. I would say round one Ning ning ning ning capitalism now again given the old do you want to live right now? Just let me ask you yes or no college kids right now Who've been suckered by socialism? Do you want to live in a country where the price of turkey and the whole meal is going down? Meanwhile people are working less hours to pay for the same food they ate four years ago What do you want to work in a country where you're having squirrel for Thanksgiving? If there is a squirrel left in your backyard because someone has needed just quick yes or no Which one you want to you want to live in? capitalism cheaper turkey cheaper meal or socialism Squirrel Thanksgiving if there's a squirrel left yeah, which one just quick Okay thoughts up. Yeah, thanks You can't get through it. I'm Joe. Hi You can't All right, uh, oh a couple more folks just cuz these are do's Now the story is so in the journal today. You know the uh the tax bill Right now has a provision in it to get rid of the exemption for state and local taxes So in a nutshell if you live in a blue state where you pay an exorbitantly high state and local tax rate where Joe lives in Maryland New York, California. These are typically blue states that charge high state income taxes local taxes Uh that used to be exempt you'd be able to write those off in your federal tax bill The effect of that is high tax states People get in I don't want to call it a subsidy because they're still keeping more of their own money But they get a break and they basically make the paying of state and local taxes less impactful on their wallet Then for people in other states, I live in florida. There is no state income tax So I don't get the benefit of that. But if you live in a blue state, you do you basically get a write off I don't get I don't think that's particularly fair So the tax code is getting rid of that the the um, excuse me the tax law Joe New Jersey lawmakers are going bonkers. Let me give you a quote by their senate president a guy named What is it? Steve Sweeney? He says they're quote going to have to reevaluate everything now They were now they were considering passing a million heirs tax in new jersey And now that they've elected this uh, this far left governor phil murphy It looks like this million heirs tax is going to pass But now just to show you the power of common sense tax reform because I got an email from a lady in new jersey Joe she was really upset at us. She seems to think you were attacking new jersey Well, I'm not attacking new jersey. I'm trying to get your taxes lowered. What are you talking about? And by getting rid of this state local tax deduction At the federal level do you understand how now this has even hit the liberal lawmakers hard How liberal lawmakers now who wanted to institute a millionaire's tax? Joe are quote this is there can the guys the democrat folks. Steve Sweeney senate president new jersey The democrats that i'm quote going to have to reevaluate everything Why Because they're now not being you know, I hate the word subsize But they're now not getting their little carve out for blue state taxes that they got before This is forcing them to reevaluate it because now they know that the taxes they're imposing on their citizens Are actually going to be paid by their citizens not the citizens of other states makes sense Joe. Uh, yes Yeah, so I again before you send me a and I listen I appreciate your listenership But before you send me a nasty gram because I I think this state and local tax deductions a horrible idea I'm telling you in the long run. This is going to benefit you not hurt you because now every tax hike They try to ram down your conservative throat in a blue state is going to have to be reevaluated on the actual cost Not the cost Joe minus the deduction you used to get in the past And maybe you won't get the tax at all So, you know, I again, I appreciate your emails, but I was not Hitting blue state people it's not your fault I'm trying would trying to save you from your own lawmakers there. I know some of you can't leave I get it I was trapped in blue states most of my adult life. I get it Hey on email by the way Another one of these tangents, right? I got an email from a guy this morning. He was He's all upset about you know, sometimes I veer off into the topic of you know religion and spirituality Hey, man. I'm sorry like viewer feedback. Obviously matters to me listener feedback. I should say matters a lot but that's part of me that's not going to go anywhere and I Strongly, I mean, I have to strongly suggest that that that you this may not be for you I know it's not you know the thing you're supposed to say in this business, but I mean it My faith and religion mattered to me. I mean, I get it. I'm not burger preacher. I'm not trying to Convert anybody out there. I'm just that's the bedrock of everything I talk about freedom liberty God given rights And he said something at the end which I found kind of strange. He's like like I he goes you're alienating At least the 30 or audience and I thought Joe say what? Yeah, I know well I thought how does he know that is he have access to a libson account? That's kind of strange like is he hacked in Um, that's actually entirely inaccurate our audience for that show was enormous So I don't I don't know what you're talking about. I it's just I mean why you're just making that up and I don't understand also why you would be offended about a common sense non professorial very non preachy conversation about spirituality Uh, you know and and the origins of consciousness and religious that bother you. I mean, I don't understand why that bothers you So you so bothered by confrontational ideas that you tune out you may have to that's fine I'm not I'm I appreciate you listening, but this may not be for you that If you know if you're a committed hardcore atheist in any conversation about any alternative idea bothers you the show is definitely not for you Okay, I'm sorry. I don't know what else to tell you. I I respect it. I have an atheist who emails me a lot He has some very thoughtful comments You're more than welcome here, but again I I listen to commentary about atheism all the time because I try to sit there and say well Why are they thinking what they're thinking if you can't accept the alternative? Again go tune in to another show. I don't know what to tell you, but I really was bothered by the email That's a kind of commentary that uh, I really don't know. Hey. All right one more quick thing getting back to the point Great article in cano today about another liberal program Designed to so-called help joe air quotes here that actually kicks you in the teeth and knocks you on your buddies You try to get up Uh, there's a program out there called the low income housing credit. I've talked about this before It's a credit given to developers to provide low income housing for poor people. Oh, oh, Joe great idea I So wonderful the government's so smart aren't they let's give a credit to developers to put low income housing and well The crease the price of housing for poor people Eh lose again. So there's a great great report and cano would be in the show notes today one third one third that means 33 repeating uh 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 3 33 of that goes to tenance. Why wait wait wait hold on It's a low income housing credit show shortly this helps poor people. Yeah one third of it Okay. Well, where does the other two third six six six six six six six six where does that go? Banks developers and accountants and nice job government you guys are really terrific and here's the tell this is great This is that they want to talk about like completely kicking you in the teeth as you go to get up Nearly 100 percent of the low income housing produced due to the quote low income housing Credit is offset by a reduction in the number of unsubsidized low income housing So now you have a go taxpayer subsidies going lightless I got no problem with developers or accountants, but I do have a problem You taking taxpayer money, okay Two-thirds of it goes through accountants and developers right only a third of it goes to tenants and a hundred percent of the homes are offset By the decrease uh building of low income homes when they're not subset. This is this is it Great. You guys are just awesome in the federal government and they write about it because apparently I love Ben Carson, but he was touting the benefits this program the other day and kato was like wait wait what come again on this? I love the guy, but listen get the government out of the housing business. My gosh. Have we done enough damage at this point All right folks. Thanks again for tuning in.
