    "text": " Okay, welcome to the show everybody feeling feeling pretty good today personally my my Baltimore Ravens demolish the Rams last I don't mind a football I don't know if you watch that and you know I was thinking last night as I was watching as I was watching all unfold on top of everything else I love how the the Ravens are named after an Edgar Allen Poe Poem because Poe lived in Baltimore Died in Baltimore. He also married his 13 year old cousin in Baltimore Which we don't really talk about that part of it that that part we leave to the side but the point is that Bottom the Baltimore Raven refers obviously to the poem the Raven Which is why their mascots the Raven mascots are named Edgar Allen and Poe so it's very subtle and I remember when when Raven The Ravens came to Baltimore in 1995 When we stole the team from Cleveland Which which was fine because our team had been stolen from by Indianapolis in the 80s and so we turned around and stole our team from Cleveland and You know fair is fair if you get your something stolen you can steal from the next person. That's the way it goes in America and Anyway, so there was a poll a vote to see you know what we would name the new team and everybody in this city was voting and Yeah, as a kid at the time. I wanted something like the dragons You know something fierce like the dragons or the butchers the Baltimore butchers that would have been good but the nerds wanted a 19th century literary reference and they won and And I was mad at the time, but I appreciate it now because now that I'm Older and I'm a nerd myself. I really appreciate the literary reference every time I watch football great stuff. Okay speaking of nerds Pete Buttigieg He's a nerd which which I mean as a compliment smart guy obviously Rhodes scholar. I don't know if you heard about the fact that he's a Rhodes scholar So we're only reminded of that every time he's does a debate, but probably the most talented politician the Democrats have right now and That I don't that's not that's half a compliment and half an insult. I Think he's wrong about everything. I also think that he's cynical and manipulative Especially in how he slanders Christians while pretending to be one So I'm not a fan of his by any stretch of the imagination, but he is smart and he's good at what he does as a political candidate But he was trending on Twitter this morning in a not so positive way in fact the phrase Pete Buttigieg is a lying MF was trending and That's about as bad of a trend as you can get I think as a as a political candidate That's the title of an article in the root and it's an article that just Blasts away at at Buttigieg calling him a lying mother blank Basically painting him as nothing more than a lucky privileged spoiled lying brat essentially And taking issue and this of course is from the left. This is an attack on him from the left Taking issue mainly with something that he said about about Something he said about eight years ago while he was running for mayor of South Bend and he was talking about disadvantaged kids and the education system and Anyway, they taking issue with with what he said and take a listen to it right here You know the kids need to see evidence that education is gonna work for them, right? So you see a lot of parts as part of the motivation Yeah, because you're motivated because you you believe that at the end of your educational process there is a reward There's a stable life There's a job and there are a lot of kids especially the lower-income minority neighborhoods who literally just haven't seen it work There isn't somebody they know personally and I think that's who testifies to the value of education So yeah, you bet that's what this writer at the root is mad about and That's what makes him a lying MF Bunch of leftists are also mad. It seems now the question is What was wrong with what he said? You know far be it for me to defend Buttigieg, but what did he say that was wrong there? What where's what's the wrong part of that? well, this guy at the root says that It's it's the problem is not about bad role models Despite what Buttigieg claims. It's not a lack of role models. It's about minority neighborhoods being neglected underfunded schools in the inner city being underfunded and Racism and all of these external circumstances you see And the thing with Buttigieg is he just got lucky and that's why he's been successful And so for him to just sit there and judgment is racist and wrong and it's deceptive But of course that's all nonsense The big advantage that Buttigieg had is that he had a mother and father growing up Okay, that is a big advantage That's not luck though. It's gonna. That's that's not a role of the dice the mother and father shows decided to be present That's a choice. They made it's not luck The point is that in the inner city You're talking about 70 or 80 percent of the kids Don't have a dad in the picture 70 or 80 percent Now of course that's gonna have an enormous impact Of course, that's going to mean a dearth of male role models, especially for boys who have a special need for male role models in their lives they need a man to show them how to be a man and It's it's much easier and better and more effective if you have that example in your life that you can look to Okay, it's kind of the the show don't tell thing As you could tell kids all day long. This is how you're supposed to act But you need someone there to show you how to act someone that they can emulate now so To this is all really obvious and to deny it is madness It's not bad luck fathers abandoning their families are not unlucky, okay unless they died But if if they're still alive and they've abandoned their families They chose to do that. They chose Not to be there for their kids or if they're in prison or something they chose to commit a crime It's not luck. It's a choice made by those fathers so You've got a huge amount of men in the inner city who conceived children and Then don't stick around to raise them. That is a statistical reality the article says just reading a little bit from this article in the root It says It proves men like him but a judge are more willing to perpetuate the fantastic narrative of Negro neighborhoods being Needing more role models and briefcase carriers Then make the people in power stare into the Sun and see the blinding light of racism Get along moderates would rather make crap up out of whole cloth then weighed into the waters of reality Pete Buttigieg doesn't want to change anything. He just wants to be something This is not just a lie of omission is a dangerous precedent This is why institutional inequality persists not because of white hoods and racial slurs It is because this insidious double talk erases the problem by camouflaging it because it is painted as a problem of black lethargy and not white apathy he's saying he's making stuff up. He's making crap up actually said he's making s up What is he making up? What? Okay, here's the question Is the fatherless rate? Very high in the inner city or not Yes or no Answers yes, unless we're gonna say 70% isn't very high another question Are kids without fathers at a huge disadvantage and do they lack? Essential male leadership and an essential male role model in their life answers. Yes question Do men who conceive children and then not stick around to raise them? Make that choice because of racism is it is it racism that prevents them from raising their own kids? answers no So where is Buttigieg wrong? You know, I don't have a dog in this fight. I'm not a I'm not a fan like I said a Buttigieg, but the truth is the truth and This is a truth that we need to be able to talk about And when it comes to the fatherless problem by the way It's not just a problem in the black community. It is it is it's it's a problem and I don't have the numbers right in front of me but If you're talking about especially in the inner city like I said 70 or 80% Even in in in white neighborhoods in the suburbs. It's not that high, but it's a lot higher than it should be So this is a problem across the board in America I would say this is a cultural problem shared across the board to one degree or another is a macro a lack of male leadership in the home and a lack of of the influence of fathers Listen every time or most of the times when we've had a school shooting a mass shooting This is one of the things that some of us talk about that I talk about and Very often the kids who do that are white But you know what else you you find very often is that those kids didn't have dads in the home Not in every case, but in many of them in most of them So Obviously we need to talk about that And to insist that we focus the conversation entirely around these sort of external environmental things racism and all of that And we make people the victim of their own choices And when I say that I'm not referring to the kids in the inner city who grow up without a dad They're not a victim of their own choice. They're a victim of the choice their father made And when you read articles like this it sounds like we're trying to take those fathers who abandon their children and make those fathers victims of their own choice of abandoning their families And that's just that's just wrong Now politically this shows why the Democrats I think might be doomed They're they're they're tearing their most talented candidates apart Nobody's allowed to rise to the top of the pack without being ripped to shreds The SJWs have this purity test that nobody can pass even a young gay man like Buttigieg can't pass it Camila Harris a black woman can't pass it Elizabeth Warren a female socialist can't pass it who can pass it? Nobody can pass it. So they all get eaten alive by their own people and Trump just hits back and enjoys the show So it's working out for really well for Trump. I Agree with what Tucker Carlson said I think last night where he said that he still wouldn't count Michelle Obama out and I think that that is their only hope and I wouldn't counter out either I think Michelle Obama on the left is is Basically untouchable or the closest thing to untouchable among leftists that you can get Probably the one person the whole country who could unite all of these disparate warring factions on the left You're not gonna see any Michelle Obama is a lying MF articles about her. That's That level of disrespect and that kind of attack is reserved for people like Buttigieg You're not gonna see that Michelle Obama. There's a reverence that they all all the leftists seem to have for her She also has a some appeal in the middle as well. So I think she'd be a formidable general election candidate. I think that's Maybe they're only hope right now I just don't see anyone else obviously someone's getting nominated among the Democrats, but They're all gonna come into the general election extremely wounded After all of the slings and arrows they've taken from their own side and that works again to Trump's advantage Okay, speaking of people getting attacked for speaking basic facts I have another example of that that I want to share but first a word from field of greens Have you ever wondered why so many Americans are sick unhealthy and overweight? Between the food supply and sedentary lifestyle Americans are in the worst shape they've ever been and I'm sure you've seen all the news reports about that It's a well-known problem.

That's brick house Walsh calm promo code Walsh Okay, so as I said speaking of the left's war on facts Journalist Andy no He's best known for his run-ins with Antifa. He's the guy that got assaulted sent to the hospital With a brain injury by Antifa a few months ago Something that by the way Democrat candidates still have not condemned That's a real attack on the press on a journalist hasn't been condemned media didn't condemn it Democrats in condemning well He is now Expended by Twitter for relaying in objective Fact and and relaying it in a in an objective and dispassionate way He he shared some verifiable Statistic statistical information and for that he was banned now. It started with a tweet from Chelsea Clinton Chelsea Clinton tweeted Since 2013 more than 150 trans people have been murdered in the US the majority black transgender women on TDOR 2019 I guess it's trans on this is the trans day of remembrance. They call it We remember an honor the lives lost Hold their loved ones in our hearts and must commit to doing all we can to end this epidemic of violence and hate Now Clinton is connecting this with hate Obviously insinuating claiming That these are all or mostly hate crimes Throwing in the black transgender woman detail mentioning the race Also tries to turn it racial So the idea is to make it seem like there are a bunch of racist transphobes out there murdering black quote trans women left and right Now Andy no responded saying and this is what got him banned or at least suspended The US is one of the safest countries for trans people the murder rate of trans victims is actually lower than that for the cis population Also, who is behind the murders mostly black men? That's it that's what he said got suspended for that suspended for responding to an Inaccurate claim with some verifiable empirical facts so what Twitter is saying is We support this false narrative And if you try to debunk it we're gonna punish you you're not allowed to debunk it. It's it doesn't matter if it's not true You're this this is what we're going with But the fact remains they could suspend you for saying it But the fact is a fact as I talked about a few weeks ago sharing a piece from Chad Felix Green over at the Federalist The anti-trans hate crime epidemic is a fiction. It is a myth. It's been made up. It's invented. It's not real the vast majority of trans murder victims Are not the victims of a hate crime the vast majority of trans murders have nothing at all to do with bigotry or anything like that They've mostly been the kinds of murders that you find in the non-trans population Murdered in the same kinds of circumstances for the same reasons. It's sad. It's terrible. It but it's not a hate crime Also a sizable number of murder victims among trans people are people who live a high-risk lifestyle So prostitutes and that sort of thing The murder rate among prostitutes generally trans or not is higher than the average population But that's not because of anti-prostitute hate crimes That's it's because you're you're you're living a high-risk lifestyle. You're living in a in a world where in a dangerous world You're dealing with dangerous people. You're doing a dangerous thing That's not victim-blaming. That's not saying they deserve it obviously because nobody does It's just pointing out that this is there's no connection here with racism and hatred The what's driving this is something completely separate from that Now or it may be hate anyway, but it's not Maybe you could make the argument that anytime somebody is killed. It's there's hatred behind it, which I think is actually probably not true I think more Very often I think what lies behind Murder is in other crimes as a sort of indifference to human life Less than than a hatred for human life, but either way And that's just the fact That's all None of this is to say that the murder rate among trans people or black people or any group doesn't matter Actually, I'm saying the opposite. I'm saying let's deal with what's actually happening Let's let's deal with the reality Because only if we deal with the reality is there a chance of making a difference It's the people who use murder victims like political props who obviously lack empathy and lack compassion When you're doing that when you're taking trans people have been murdered and You're turning them into a political weapon to bludgeon your opponents with Then you're the one who lacks compassion for them And We're not going to be able to solve the problem Call it an epidemic if you want. It's it's not really but Whatever you want to call it. We're not going to be able to solve the problem if We insist on Diagnosing it incorrectly It's a very basic thing if you want to solve a problem whether we're talking a societal problem or a medical problem any kind of problem you have to diagnose it correctly to begin with and And so I think what Andy know was trying to say what I'm saying But a lot of us have been saying is let's diagnose this this problem correctly and then we could talk about solving But Twitter says no, it's better to it's better to diagnose it incorrectly in fact we insist that you do All right, let's move on to emails because there's a few Topics brought up in the emails that I wanted to spend a little bit of time on Matt wall show at gmail.com Matt wall show at gmail.com This is from Jake says hey Matt quick talking point for tomorrow's show as I am sure you saw Bezos Donated ninety eight point five million dollars to charity Jeff Bezos And that still was not enough. I saw some comments going around that if you make fifty thousand dollars That would be the equivalent of donating forty five dollars My point is I doubt all the people complaining have ever donated that forty five dollars to any cause it is easy to virtue signal and demand more Social programs when it when it is someone else's hard earned money big fan of the show people could work and God bless Yeah, Jake. I saw that Bezos donated as you said ninety eight million dollars and People were attacking him for it Which is amazing and if if you want to diagnose this problem I really think a lot of it is garden variety jealousy. That's what a lot of it is people clinging desperately to their narrative of the greedy rich person To have a rich person who also acts generously Interferes with the narrative and so they find a way to dismiss it that it's also I think that People are upset That they themselves are not billionaires and they look at Jeff Bezos and their main problem with Jeff Bezos is that they are not Jeff Bezos They they want to be him That's that's what you have to understand all this attacking of billionaires Most of the people doing the attacking their main issue with billionaires is that they themselves are not billionaires That's what they don't like about billionaires is that they're not in that population So I think and this is Unfortunately human nature a lot of people do that we all do this in in some way or another to some degree or another where You know You see someone who's got something you want and their life seems to be working for them well and You feel jealous you're envious And so you want to tell yourself that there's something wrong with them And that's what people do. I think a lot of these socialists and everything these would be faux socialists They look at rich people and really in their heart they want to be rich, but they're not and So instead they tell themselves. Oh, well, you know, these are all a bunch of greedy these are all a bunch of greedy bastards and At least I'm not like that at least I'm a better person They might have more money than me, but I'm a better and more virtuous person And then when you see that the billionaire isn't greedy and they're donating a lot of money and doing a lot of good in the community Now they're thinking wait a second. Is this person richer than me and better? That can't be they can't be richer and more generous. I can't allow that to be the case And I agree with you All these people saying oh Bezos giving ninety eight million dollars is like me giving fifty well first of all no it isn't Because I'm pretty sure the charity would prefer the ninety eight million to the fifty Okay, it makes a difference to them There are practical things that 98 million dollars can do that fifty dollars cannot now if all you have to give is 50 And you give the 50 it's like the parable that Jesus told the woman that just gave you know put two coins into the You know at the synagogue rather than the rich people that made a show of giving more so yes in terms of The moral act itself the moral significance If you give less and that's all you can give that's a great thing and it does make a difference, but it Obviously practically speaking Nine eight million dollars. That's gonna help a lot of hungry and homeless people Whereas fifty dollars will help a lot less So in a practical sense, it's not as good But also I agree with you in in that all these people saying well, it's like if I gave 50 Are you giving 50 though? If you are great, but I kind of doubt that you are These people Complaining about rich people all the time and greedy and everything every time they see Philanthropy among rich people they find a way of dismissing it all these people that claim that say oh, you know, I I That's not as generous as I can be well. Are you generous? Are you actually giving your money to charity? I Tended out it I Think a lot of these people are are hoarding their own money And that's what really gets them is that they know in their hearts They even though they're a lot poorer than someone like Jeff Bezos than a billionaire They've a lot less money. They're actually more greedy Because that's the thing if you're making you know seventy thousand dollars a year or something and You give none of it to charity and you don't help anybody with it And meanwhile you've got a billionaire giving millions the billionaires more generous than you and Yeah, you could say he's got more money to spend but you're giving nothing. You're not doing anything I mean you could spare some of that I Mean seventy thousand is not seventy billion, but it's it's there still you still have some room Like maybe a few of the coffees you buy at Starbucks Maybe maybe don't get that iPhone upgrade You know, maybe you already have Netflix. You don't need Amazon to You could sacrifice some of that and give to the less fortunate But you don't because you're actually more materialistic and greedier than some of those rich people And I think that's what really gets them. They hate to think that Oh my gosh, am I am I not only broke but greedy too? No, nobody wants to think that about themselves All right That's one thing I've talked about before you see in our culture in our consumeristic culture Consumeristic isn't really a word, but let's go with it what you find is that even people who are not rich Like me and you assuming you're not rich who's ever watching this a lot of us have sort of inherited the vices of the rich Because living in this consumerist culture Even people aren't rich can tend to be materialistic Greedy just hoarding goods and things for themselves And so a lot of us we have the vices of the rich we have the greed and materialism We don't actually have the riches of the rich and so we've got the worst of all the worlds Okay, this is from Marie says I'm a young mom of two little toddlers and my two and a half year old is really pumped for Santa to come this Year, I've told her the true meaning of Christmas and I basically made Santa helper for Jesus Emphasis on helper so she'll still get the point. I've never thought of not giving her the fantasy of Santa until talking with a friend recently The friend said that her parents made Santa very real with noises on the roof jingle bells and everything So when she found out that all that hope and joyful anticipation was complete nonsense. She was devastated She still is devastated and refuses to tell her kids about Santa. I've had a few friends experience something similar. It makes me sad What have you done for your kids? Are you ever worried about the day that they inevitably discover the fantasy of Santa Claus? I'm at a crossroads of what to do because both pose their pros and cons. I'd love your opinion You're a great dad. Thank you for all your talk for all you talk about I'm so disappointed the sexualized obsession of the young in our culture never stop speaking you make such a difference God bless you and your family Yeah, Marie first of all, I would say about your friend It seems like their parents went way overboard But if she's still devastated that Santa Claus isn't real Might be time for her to get over that one You know, we all went through that as kids and it was a little difficult at first But probably by the time you're an adult you should be over it. I don't know I know maybe you can't say that to her. Maybe you should just say to her just put it flat out next time she's Complaining about the fact that Santa Claus doesn't exist. Maybe say to her listen, you know that you're like 30, right? But in terms of what to tell your kids Here's the way that I look at it And I've brought this point up many times before when talking about gender issues and kids choosing their own gender and everything My point is that very young kids you say you're toddlers, okay two and a half years old well A two and a half year old has no idea what reality is there is no concept of reality Doesn't know the difference between fiction and truth and fiction So if you were to say to your two and a half year old Santa Claus is not real that wouldn't mean anything anyway So my point is you couldn't convince a two and a half year old that there is no such thing as Santa Claus Because a phrase like there's no such thing as just doesn't mean anything for them They don't have the cognitive ability to understand that and So that's why children naturally live in a fantasy world You're two and a half year old if you have a three year old a four year old They also probably think that spider-man exists and Superman exists and they watch Bugs Bunny They think that that's real they watch cartoons. They think it's real It's not because you've told them that you haven't gone out of your way to convince nobody goes out of their way really The convince a four-year-old that spider-man exists But if they see spider-man on TV if they watch a movie They're gonna think that's real Because the whole idea that you could be watching something in image, but it's not real It's just that's there's a disconnect there because they think well, what do you mean? It's not real I can see it of course. It's real So I wouldn't worry about it. I guess is what I'm saying if your kids are young enough where believing in Santa is appropriate then They're also so young that you couldn't convince them anyway that Santa Claus doesn't real so you might as well just go with it And as they get older and they're capable of understanding that there is this thing There is reality which set which is set apart in some way from fantasy as They get older when they get to be you know five six seven they start to understand that Then they're getting to the age maybe where I think You break the news, but also at they're also getting to the age where they're gonna they're gonna start figuring that out anyway In fact for me with Santa Claus I actually I actually did not have the devastating moment where my parents sat me down and gave me the bad news I kind of just figured it out on on my own Because I had older siblings and they had stopped believing and so just over time you're just kind of like oh, okay Hold on a second and you start piecing it together So if you told if you told your kid if you told your kid nothing at all about Santa Claus You didn't you didn't say real or fake or anything. You just didn't say anything about it. I Think your child at a young age would naturally believe in Santa Claus because he would pick it up from his friends and from the culture and from TV and everything And then you know around six seven eight would stop believing and that would happen apart from you completely So all you're doing as a parent is maybe Hurrying it along a little bit or you know kind of guiding them one way or another a little bit, but Kids are gonna live in that fantasy world and there's also nothing wrong with that. So If you if you would not I say we don't we don't go out of our way to convince our kids that spider-man is real Yet they do believe that spider-man is real Would you would you sit them down and go out of your way to convince them that spider-man isn't real? Would anyone would any parent do that? Why? Your look your daughter believes that there are fairies in the garden Are you gonna sit her down and say listen there are no fairies stop believing in fairies? What kind of crazy parent would do that? No, she believes it just let her believe it Now yeah, you play along a little bit and because it's fun and she's a kid. She's just who cares All right, we'll do one more this is from Zach says dear Matt since the Christmas season essentially starts on Friday Please rate the following five gifts from one to five five being the worst socks a Warren slash used item that's clearly been re-gifted Scratch off lottery tickets a Christmas ornament or a clothing item that is clearly two sizes too small and comes with a gift Proceed. Thanks for all you do and watch the show record religiously Well, I need more information Zach because you talk about socks are the socks the fancy high-end socks that you buy You get a pair of them for 14 bucks at at Target that for me is fancy and high-end That's not a bad gift. I have no problem with re-gifted items in principle Now if you're saying they've been worn or obviously used okay, if someone's giving me a blender that still has chunks of smoothie in it I'm gonna have an issue with that, but re-gifted in general. I have no problem with now You talk about ornaments. Okay, that's definitely a five. That's a 20 really if five is the worst than 20 It's a 20. It's off the scales bad Ornaments are the worst gifts We all we've all been guilty of giving Christmas ornaments as gifts to other people Yet we all know that none of us want Christmas ornaments as gifts. So we all participate in this thing where we give a gift We know we wouldn't want You know Jesus says do unto others as you would have them do it to you well Give gifts that you would want also in some world Nobody wants a Christmas ornaments You give this you get a little thing a little ball or whatever that you hang on a tree for a few weeks Along with all the other ornaments. It just gets lost in the shuffle Who's gonna be excited about that and the worst thing is this is why gift giving stresses me out And I would be in favor of just abolishing all gifts giving occasions and just never giving never giving or receiving any gifts I'd be fine with that What stresses me out is you're sitting there on Christmas morning and you're doing your family gift unwrapping thing and you get a gift like an ornament and It's obviously super lame and you don't care about it But you have to act excited because the person who gave it to you sitting right there Even though they know unless it's a child, okay That's an exception here, but if it's an adult they know that you're not gonna be super psyched about the the ornament But they still expect you to act like you are and they know you're faking it And so there's this the psychological back and forth the Mind games that are being played. I don't like it And I'm very bad at it faking enthusiasm So I open up the ornament and I and I have to go oh cool That's the best I can do. Oh cool. Is that a in ornament? You got ornament? Yeah. Oh, yeah This will look great on the tree. This will look great with a 300 other ornaments I'll just put that in there and I'll forget about it's great. No, thank you so much. Wow Wow Where did you get this? Where'd you have to ask a few questions, right? That's that's the one way I sell it to try to distract from the fact that I'm not excited I'll start asking question. Where'd you get this from? Oh, you got it from you got it from the mall Wow what mall? Oh wow? Look at this ornament. Oh My gosh, I woke up this morning. It's hoping I get an ornament You got 600 ornaments. I just I was thinking I need I need another one I mean I need a 601 ornaments. So thank you so much for this ornament. Thank you so much for it You obviously hate me Could give me a gift that I want How about just a gift card if that's you you wanted to spend seven bucks on a gift so just get spent gets you get a seven dollar gift card to Just to Starbucks, okay, that'd be much better. I gotta actually use that That's my reaction I it's it's Christmas morning gets awkward at my house Anyway, that's my feeling about that. Thanks for the question. I think we'll wrap it up there.
