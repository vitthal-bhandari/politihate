    "text": " Good morning, Governor DeSantis. around here Don't say gay Don't say as the first two words in a sentence spoken by a political leader of a state In the United States of America don't say Don't say you not see pig say First Amendment Read about it then run for office you piece of Hey, how are you that's a fun way to start the show don't you think I'm Dave Rubin. This is Rubin report direct message It's March 30th 2022. It's happy birthday to my brother day March 30th 79 42 years old 43 years old now man. We're getting old you're catching up to me, bro That was Hollywood actor Ron Perlman with a ridiculous ridiculous selfie video yelling At Florida Governor Ron DeSantis for something that is completely made up in Ron Perlman's head And I think the theme of the show today will be enough is enough It is time to fight back against these freaks and their imaginary problems So of course we are live streaming on rumble on YouTube and on glaze TV do me a favor subscribe all that good stuff But you know over the last week or so I've really been hitting hard on just the ineptitude of Our government our officials the lies of mainstream media and I think maybe something's turning right now I think so many people are waking up so fast I think the the curtain has been pulled back to the point that so many people Are seeing what is really going on here that it is time we start going on the offense and Ron DeSantis has been doing that right here in Florida So we're gonna be talking about this from this idiotic. Don't say gay bill, which by the way Ron Perlman If you're watching and you don't know who Ron Perlman is he's he's an actor. He was in Hellboy What else was this guy in he was in Hellboy and Hellboy 2 they weren't so great. Can we Google? Maybe what else this guy was in I don't know what he was in the guy needs an orthodontist more than anything else That was the main takeaway from the from the video there, but this is what they do to people they have broken people so deeply so profoundly that you have a grown man Taking a selfie video that he sends out to his over million Twitter followers, right and He talks about don't say gay the implication being that don't say or gay is In the bill and it's not it's not you guys know that we're gonna unpack it a little bit in just a moment But then so he makes up what's in the bill because the the media has you know Push this meme of don't say gay out there And then not only does he make it up and then his response or he makes it up or he's been duped by the made-up thing that the media pushes But then his response is to call Ron DeSantis a Nazi Let me just tell you something about Ron DeSantis. I actually I'm not saying this to brag But I've met him a couple times now since I've been in Florida I was an enemy of the state in California and now I've hung out with the governor a few times I actually had dinner with him and a few other people last week And the word gay was set at the table it was and the first lady wished me well Because we're having kids. These are good decent people who are fighting Massive corporations and it's the individual versus the machine right now and DeSantis is modeling the right thing These are bad guys. He calls him a Nazi a Nazi you Ron Perlman would be the Nazi So anyway, the theme of the show today is it's time to fight back There are there are signals out there that are showing us that fighting back is winning and we're gonna model a whole bunch of that for you Over the show today. So it's gonna be DeSantis versus woke Dins Disney John Stewart who's gone fully woke. It's it's so depressing. He was sort of a half good liberal I suppose something like that. Well now he's just gone all in on like the anti-white hate and all just the stupid woke Bullshit on his show that I guess is on Apple TV I don't think anyone's watching it, but I did see this one clip We got to show it to you and then some covid stuff where if ouchy is now admitting and and data is coming out that they They just didn't know what they were doing. They have no idea that anything that they did work So that's what we're doing today So buckle in people because today today we're going on the offense. It's not just about commenting I try not to do that in general It's not just about commenting on what these people are doing and exposing their nonsense But now I think it's time for a shift and the shift is we go on offense now and and let's start beating these people and these bad Ideas because they they deserve it and it's being done correctly here in Florida and speaking of Florida the tour The don't burn this country tour kicks off in Florida in Orlando on April 18th. There are all the dates I don't want to belabor it, but tickets are selling really fast especially VIP tickets You can go to Dave Rubin calm slash events Don juniors joining me Michael Malice on me parkland Beck Meghan McCain Meghan Kelly whole bunch of other people Dennis Prager Larry Elder a lot of my good friends Will add some more people pretty soon and I look forward to seeing you good people out there And before we get to anything else I want to talk to you about battle box.

So I've been try battle box calm. So I've proven and now back to me. Okay so the Don't say gay Bill which doesn't have the words don't say or gay in it. It's actually called hb 157 has officially passed here in florida. It has been signed By ron de santis So first off, why don't we just go through what is in the bill one more freakin time So first off, there's the basic thing that you cannot talk to children in kindergarten through third grade About gender identity or sexuality and if that think may if you think that's weird Then just I want you to picture what a first grader would be doing talking to a state employee About gender identity really think about that try to picture that in your mind a first grader a six-year-old that you know and that that state Employee could then hide that from the parents. That's what they're trying to get rid of That's all this is really about but now please show that image again It also adds a couple things related to transparency Which we should all want notify parents of changes to health or well-being of the kid of course you would want that Don't encourage withholding information from parents. Of course you would want that Allow parents to access child student records. Yes, the parents should know what's going on at school Let parents refuse school health care services. Sure. The school does not own the child Get parental permission for health screening. These are all Basic obvious things and everything everything everything coming out of hollywood Coming out of the corporate press coming out of the blue-checked journalists. They lie about everything we have We've crossed the Rubicon people They've lied about a lot of stuff for a long time But now there's nothing they don't lie about like everything that I talked to you about yesterday with bide and lying about everything The machine all it has left is lies and defamation and slander And the rest of it that's all they got Left so here is florida governor ron de santis Signing the bill into law and saying that he ain't going anywhere I Don't care what corporate media outlets say I don't care what hollywood says. I don't care what big corporations say Here I stand. I'm not backing down Here I stand i'm not backing down This is the individual Verse the machine. This is the american story This is why american Ingenuity has flourished because of individual rights that the man You the man the individual can stand up to the man You get it and de santis is doing it It's not fun to say i'm fighting disney the biggest corporation in the world that owns so much of our cultural Apparatus It's not a fun thing like there's this feeling like i don't know could disney destroy me like is that what is that really where we're at? But I think we all kind of feel that like if I say something bad about disney. I don't know what disney is going to do to me It's like disney is the bad guy in A disney movie so he signs the bill And he tells disney. I am standing up against you and by the way, it's not just that he's standing up against disney As if they're just some company that exists somewhere. I mean disney florida or lando It's like there's a lot of floridians here that work for disney and he's saying no. I will do what's right So then of course on cue here is the statement from disney florida's hb 1 5 5 7 also known as the don't say gay bill should never have passed and should have never been signed into law Our goal is a company is for this law to be repealed by the legislature or struck down in the courts and we remain committed To supporting the national and state organizations working to achieve that We are dedicated to standing up for the rights and safety of lgbtq plus members Of the disney family as well as the lgbtq plus community in florida and across the country Screw you disney You're lying about what the bill is you are being held hostage by a radical group of leftist woke activists in your own company And I hope I hope and believe that they will actually destroy your entire company because once wokeism is in a system We've seen this at educational institutions. We've seen this at other corporations. We've seen this in our government once wokeism is in And your your eye is off the ball, right? You're not looking at what the goal is What is the goal of a of an entertainment company? It should be to produce the best entertainment to sell the most tickets And that's what it should be But you guys have decided that agenda matters more than that and I hope it destroys your whole fucking kingdom I hope micky gets crushed by the pillar on top of that stupid castle. Okay, that's what you people deserve At this point that is what you deserve. It is there is nothing wrong with this bill I happen to be gay big damn deal. It just it doesn't matter. It's one thing about me. I'm married to a gay Okay, we're having kids Regular gay people want nothing to do with this thing. What does being gay when they say disney we're defending our lgbt employees What does being gay? As an adult and entering a consensual relationship with another adult where now you can get married because we have a quality in america You can have a family and all of those things What does that have to do with a state employee telling a kindergartener that their gender and their biology does not match What their gender identity could be and then to hide that from their parents These people are genuinely evil It's extraordinary how evil they are and they're doing it right in front of us Disney are the bad guys They also have all sorts of relationships in china. We'll get to that in just a minute But now we have this incredible compilation. It's about a minute and a half Disney had an internal meeting of a ton of higher-ups I'll tell you after we play the clip who some of these people are but a ton of higher-ups They did this internal meeting about the don't say gay bill and how they intend to continue to Infect people with this woke bullshit and it got exposed of course because everything gets exposed of course these days because things are on zoom and everywhere else So just take a look and listen to these series of people Uh who they want your kids Last summer we removed All of the um gendered Greetings in relationship to our live skills. So we no longer say ladies and gentlemen boys and girls Um, we we've trained we we've provided training for all of our our cast members and in relationship to that So now they know it's it's hello everyone or hello friends We we're in the process of changing over those those recorded messages and so many of you are probably familiar Well, we brought the fireworks back to the magic kingdom We no longer say ladies and gentlemen boys and girls. We say dreamers of all ages I'm here as a mother of two queer children actually um one transgender child And one pansexual child And and also as a leader many many many lgbt coqia characters in our stories and And and yet we don't have enough leads um and narratives in which Gay characters just just get to be characters on my little pocket of like, you know, proud family disney tv a um The showrunners were super welcoming marytiff roberts and like the our leadership over there has been so welcoming to like my like not at all secret gay agenda and so like I I feel like I felt like it was I mean like maybe it was that way in the past But I guess like something must have happened in the last like like they're turning it around They're going hard. Let's have these two characters kiss Let's in the background this like I was just wherever I could just basically adding queerness to like If you see anything queer the show For proud though, but like I just was like no one would stop me and no one was trying to stop me Also reacting from the reality that When they can erase you when they can criminalize your existence when they can demonize who you are the next step Is to criminalize you and take your kids And we're already seeing that in texas. So the slippery slope between these ugly messages um You know emanating from legislative leaders in our state and then amplified by our governor Who spokesperson immediately began calling everyone who opposed this bill groomers a.k.a pedophiles Yeah, um, I have had the privilege of working with the moon girl team for the last two years And they've been really open to exploring queer stories And so I put together like a tracker of our background characters To make sure that we have like a full breadth of expression And uh, we got into a very similar conversation carry of like oh All of our like gender nonconforming characters are in the background Okay So who are these people that just spoke there? I'm just going to break it down real quick The woman who said that they're not going to use gentlemen ladies and gentlemen boys and girls anymore That's disney's diversity and inclusion manager vivian where she's up there She has a ridiculous amount of power because all the kids that were going to disney And that you know before you get on the ride they were going boys and girls line up get on the ride That was actually causing hate and they were all sorts of hate crimes They were murdering children apparently because of that Uh, the next lady who said that she has a transgender child and a pansexual child I don't know what that has to do with her work at a giant corporation. That's disney corporate president carrey berk Um, so congratulations. You have those kids. That's just fine with me. I don't have a problem with gay people actually I think it's a perfectly Normal part of society. There are gay animals. There are gay human beings. It's it's part of the experience Right? It's it's an outlier sexuality, but it's part of the thing But you think because you have these kids that somehow that should In fact all of your work Uh, the next person was disney executive producer latoya revenue She said that she's implementing her not so secret gay agenda into all of the movies again This has nothing to do with being anti gay But do you want your children to be propagandized by people that are telling you that they are activists and if Even if remove gay from this whatever that they would want to propagandize to your children Whatever thoughts they would want your children to have they're saying hey, we operate as a propaganda Outlet not as an entertainment outlet. Uh, the next person was disney's activism partner d Nadine smith of equality california She said that they want that the sanitus wants to erase you criminalize your existence and take your kids Again, I had dinner with him last week There was no moment of taking my kids or criminalizing me. I had the stake It was pretty good actually We went to this place flagglers in west pom beach. It's really excellent. I had a i had a tomahawk They seared that thing just freaking perfectly and desanthus made sure that I had dessert So, uh, that's that's the reality of what's going on here I want to give a quick shout out to uh, chris rufo who you guys know He's been on the show many times who is exposing most of this I think he was the one that got this video because he gets all of these leakers at these companies to send him videos And it's important to know what these people are doing This has nothing to do with being prejudiced towards gay people This has nothing to do with breaking up gay families or not allowing a kid to say I have two dads Or that the parents can't come to the play at the school or anything else This is about transparency and education and making sure that state employees Cannot infect children with whatever their ideas are and then hide it from the parents But unfortunately, we don't have a mainstream media that is honest We have a corporate press that is a propaganda outlet for a bunch of woke lunatics And uh, then guys like me have to do this Uh, but we can fight back We can fight back and you guys are fighting back people are fighting back glen yunken one in virginia Over this over critical race theory. It's connected to all of these things. It's connected to the gender stuff Right? He he ran against critical race theory and he ran against wokeism and he won the governorship in virginia So there are wins, but before I fully move on Uh, I decided to take not just talk about this stuff, but to actually do something So you know what I did this morning? I canceled disney plus and many of you may say dave why did you have? Disney plus and I was trying with star wars and you know what man valorian wasn't that great Boba fett really wasn't that great, but I mostly had it because I have We have young nieces and nephews and when they come over I wanted them to be able to watch but you know what? We're going to get a stick I'm going to go out into the backyard We're going to find a stick and when the kids come here Well, they can jump in the pool if they want or they can play with the stick outside enough is enough enough is enough Stop paying these people Stop giving them your money and your attention and your time You don't have to give it to me, but don't give it to them. I really mean that I really mean that enough is enough Cancel them don't go to their movies anymore. Don't buy their crappy overpriced products They destroyed star wars they destroyed my childhood dreams That's what they did and now they want to infect and control you and you want to go there and spend I think the new star wars land that they have now which which supposedly sucks is five Thousand dollars a night for a family of four. Yeah, these people really care about you But fight back and how do you do it? You model this guy because here's the santas more Even more so going off on Disney for Disney to come out and put a statement And say that the bill should have never passed And that they are going to actively work to repeal it. I think one was fundamentally dishonest, but two I think that crossed the line This state is governed by the interests of the people of the state of florida. It is not based on the demands Of california corporate executives. They do not run this state. They do not control this state And then for them to say they're going to actively work To repeal substantive protections for parents as a company that is Supposedly marketing its services to parents with young children Uh, I think they crossed the line and you know people ask me, you know kind of about you know They're posture on the bill. I said, you know what? If we would have put in the bill That you were not allowed to have curriculum That discussed the oppression of the weigers in china Disney would have endorsed that in a second And that's the hypocrisy of this and um, you know, we're going to make sure we're fighting back When people are threatening our parents and threatening our kids You get it fight back and I do want to address one specific thing he said there Which is that they're going to work to overturn this legislation. That's what Disney said Disney is a giant corporation What right does it have to go against the will of the people of the state the legislature which Rights the laws and the executive the governor who signs the laws Uh In this state what right do they have they are not our overlords But these corp and I thought the I thought the people I thought the meme out there was that corporations are bad Right? What do we always hear from the left these bernie corporations a bird Elizabeth Warren That was my Elizabeth Warren that wasn't so good, uh, but the Bernie was I thought corporations are bad, but oh, I guess corporations are good when it comes to You know injecting this insane leftist woke bullshit, right? It's just enough of all of this But it's infected everything with hollywood and that's why we have to cancel and move on from all of these things And I mean cancel this I don't mean cancel culture destroy human beings Which is what they do and try to infect people. I mean stop giving them their Your money and stop paying attention to them So we're going to get to a little bit more on woke hollywood in just a sec But I want to talk to you about cozierth because i'm fired up And one thing that's nice when you're fired up is to get to a nice pair of cozy pants people If you appreciate the softness and comfort of truly luxury bedding You're going to love today's sponsor cozier earth cozierth is renowned for offering the softest most luxurious Environmentally friendly and ethically produced bedding today So it's not surprising that cozierth has received thousands of five star ratings Like this recent review from carol who would have ever thought of a set of sheets could make a difference in how you sleep The first night I used the sheets I slept straight through and every night since no more overheating waking tossing and turning just incredible sleep Cozierth sheets are made from the finest luxury materials including soft soft viscous From highly sustainable bamboo and their bedding is not only super soft lightweight and breathable But temperature regulating too. So you sleep at the perfect temperature year round. I love this stuff I truly truly do the sweatpants the sweatshirts the whole thing cozierth even offers a hundred night sleep trial Which means you have a hundred nights to sleep on it wash it try it out If you're not completely in love just send it back for a full refund and for a limited time You can save 35 off on cozierth just go to cozierth.com slash dave and enter code dave at check out to save 35 Now that's cozierth.com slash dave and be sure to enter dave at check out for 35 off and now back to me Okay, so more from hollywood because all it does Is choke out propaganda so you guys remember john steward john steward was the host of the daily show for about 20 years 18 19 20 years something like that Little known fact some of you may know this I actually interned at the daily show in 1999 When john steward had just taken over you may remember that kraig killborn who was a former espianak or a guy I really loved in college. He was the first host of the The daily show and then john took over it was a very weird time to be there because there was a lot of turnover They were firing a lot of people their senses of humor were different so there was a lot of churn in there But it was it was a formative experience. I was doing stand-up at night I was interning there during the day. I was working at electronics boutique, which you now know as game stop In my free time so I could have a little little money eat some food I was eating a lot of tuna back then I'll probably die of a mercury overdose because that's all I could afford In any event over the 20 years the john steward hosted the the daily show You know there was a idea out there that this is where young people get their news and it's that's what everyone kept saying This is where young people get their news and it was a culturally Important show right and then you know and he was sort of a good I basically a good liberal like sort of it was before woke is him really Uh, he completely went in on trump derangement syndrome and then he dipped out Uh as trump had his four years. So he kind of went away for a while now He's back apparently with a show on apple tv and he's gone full woke He's gone full woke these lefties and this is like the bill marthing. I always talk about they just don't know when to stop And thus The problem with white people I'm just gonna stop for a second and and pose so you can get your memes out. Okay, there we go Get a good picture for you clickbeats For however sincerely we want to reckon and listen The truth is america has always prioritized white comfort over black survival It's such boring bullshit and trust me it went on and on and on and he had a ridiculous panel Uh where he was basically applauding as a white woman was calling a white woman who seemingly didn't know she was white calling all white men evil This stuff is so yes america has always been based on white comfort All the men who died in coal mines and who were laying track and died and got burned in horrible accidents in oil rigs and all of those things It was all done in the name of white power so that white comfort ultimately could rule the day This is the best maybe not for much longer and you freaks are doing a pretty good job of destroying it This is the best country in the history of the world. John steward give up your show man. What are you doing? You're a white dude You're a white dude. Okay, uh, maybe you should give up your show and give it to a black guy Is there not some black guy that could do comparably what you do you're pandering woke bullshit What are you doing? Why are you taking the 10 million bucks? I'm sure it's got to be at least a 10 million dollar a year deal From apple tv right that's a lot of money. Why don't you give it to a black guy? But you're not going to do that colbert. You're not going to do that jimmy kimmel You're not going to do that. You're just going to tell white people how horrible they are and it's like man I've just had it with these freaky freaky people But the funny thing about john steward is the same thing as bill mar Which is he sometimes kind of gets it and then you see all these people that are like oh my god He kind of gets it. He's a liberal who's not a complete moron. It's a miracle. My god. We should somebody should say something It's so wonderful. You may remember a couple months back Uh, I believe this was june when john steward was on Uh the colbert show and even though for a year and a half a whole bunch of us were saying Uh, do you think that maybe coven was a lab leak? Well john steward said it on colbert and then suddenly everyone was allowed to talk about it I think we owe a great debt of gratitude To science science has in many ways helped ease Uh the suffering of this pandemic Uh Which was more than likely caused by science There's a chance that this was created in a lab. There's an investigation a chance Well, I Oh my god evidence. I'd love to hear it. There's a novel Respiratory coronavirus overtaking wuhan china. What do we do? Oh, you know who we could ask the Wuhan novel respiratory coronavirus lab the disease is the same name as the lab That's just that's just a little too weird don't you think and then the afroscientists are like how did this so wait a minute You work at the wuhan Respiratory coronavirus lab. How did this happen? And they're like oh a pangolin kiss the turtle There's been an outbreak of chocolatey goodness near her she pennsylvania. What do you think happened? Like oh, I don't know maybe a steam shovel made it with a cocoa bean or it's the Chocolate factory Maybe that said that couldn't be All right, I don't know is he funny anymore like I don't know It's not for me to say like it's just it is what it is But the point is that after that suddenly mainstream media said we were allowed to talk about the lip the lab leak before that people were getting banned from twitter kicked off facebook shadow ban the rest of it from all of the social media sites for even questioning that maybe There was a lab leak Maybe there was a lab leak that led to all of this so so john gets some stuff right but he's unfortunately This is what happens and and there's a reason there's an entropy to it Why do so many of the the supposed good liberals or these people who are not complete idiots? I don't think john in his heart is a complete idiot. I really don't I think he's probably Mostly a decent guy but once you go into that thing on the left once you go into collectivism once you go into wokeism There's nothing you can do to defend yourself against it because now you have to bow because at the end john You are now a I don't know 60 year old white guy You are a 60 or white guy so you know you have to bow to the activist base So give up your show. I really mean that give up your show Give up your show or at least john You I have no I mean you must be worth 50 million bucks at least give up 20 million bucks to help young black tv hosts Get shows If if you really believe any of this but none of them believe any of it He just want clicks. I don't know. He's anyone watching apple to people pay for apple tv. That's the thing people pay for Ridiculous, but anyway speaking of covid it all continues it all continues because anthony fauci the man We were not allowed to question For two years the man who lied about masks lied about social distancing lied about what the nih was doing in wuhan all of the stuff Well now he's kind of admitting that he doesn't even know if lockdowns worked I'm interested in your reluctance to use the word lockdown Do you think two years on that they were worth it or were they too severe You know, I don't think we're ever going to be able to determine what the right balance is I think the restrictions if you want to use that word which I tend to shy away from Lockdown there's certainly prevented a lot of infections Prevented a lot of hospitalizations and prevented a lot of deaths. There's no doubt about that Obviously when you do have that kind of restriction on society There are unintended Negative consequences particularly in children who are not allowed to go to school In the psychological and mental health aspects it has on children In the economic stress that it puts on society in general on individual families Obviously those are negative consequences that are unintended Or are they intended you freak so when he talks about it prevented lockdowns in Prevented infection hospitalization hospitalization and death notice as always he never gives you numbers How many hospitalizations did it prevent? Lockdowns locking people in their houses doesn't tell you that How much how many people didn't die because if it doesn't tell you that because he doesn't have data on that And when he talks about the unintended consequences Was it not obvious from beat one if you locked people down that alcoholism rates were going to go up and drug use was going to go up and Depression and all sorts of stuff that we have seen I mean crazy rates of all of these things and I'd love to see numbers on how many more people are on prescription pills These days as opposed to two years before although i'm sure he would love that Mr. Science over there and what this all proves is that DeSantis again I'm trying to show you that there is a way to fight back and it starts with the individual because DeSantis is just one man There is a way to fight back and what it shows you is that when when all hell was breaking loose Some people didn't completely lose their minds and in florida they didn't completely lose their minds So if any of it worked If any of it worked the rates of covid and death and hospitalizations and all the stuff would have been Completely out of control here in florida and completely under control in california And you know what from all the studies that i've seen and I welcome you to show me counter studies It's been pretty much comparable pretty much comparable on top of the fact that florida has the second oldest population In the united states. Okay, so they have lied about everything and that's all they can do That's all they can do and uh, if you think they've well no they don't lie about everything They wouldn't just make up numbers and a whole bunch more on that Well, first i've got some info here on just generally what has happened with covid This is from the daily wire More than half of americans 52 say they have contracted the virus according to a new mon myth university pole This appears to be the first poll to show a majority of americans saying they've been infected at some point An august poll from the pew research center showed that 30 had tested positive or were pretty sure they'd contracted the virus Okay, so that means a whole bunch of people got it in states that did lock down and didn't lock down and you know what? 99.9 whatever percent of people survived and everyone should take whatever precautions they think are necessary But now back to the line because they do lie about everything you're not going to admit this the cdc Yeah, they bungled the numbers. They're they're admitting it now. We've got more from the daily wire here The center for disease control updated. It's covid 19 death statistics last week Revealing that the agency had included an additional 72 000 deaths 72 000 deaths that should not have been counted as covid Deaths the change impacted 26 states and all age groups The cdc explained in a footnote that the overcount stem from a coding logic error Yeah, they forgot to carry the one with a total of about 970 000 deaths from covid 19 the extra death The extra deaths compose about 7.5 of that number that ain't no small number 416 extra pediatric covid 19 deaths also represent a significant revision From the initial data the question of how to differentiate between how many deaths were from covid 19 and how many deaths were Deaths were with covid 19 still remains meaning that if you went to the hospital And you had some other infection or something else that was going to kill you, but you also had covid They would just chalk it up to covid But okay, so they're they lied all along about what they were doing and whether it was working or not They never really tell you the number is they fudge all the statistics and now they're admitting Oh, we had a coding error at the cdc, you know, somebody is anyone going to be fired? Is anyone going to be reprimanded? No, no, no, because the machine is evil people Okay, I just realized I haven't taken a breath in in six minutes. All right, so let's uh, let's recap the show today There's a lot of weird stuff out there. There really is We are fighting corporations. We are fighting what seemingly Are inept? Governments and officials and all of those things But do you know what we have? We have the individual We have our own free minds. There are places in this country where that's still flourishes We still Even if it's hampered have the ability to communicate with each other through these pipes, but we must build new things We must build new Entertainment outlets the daily wire is doing a hell of a job of it. The blaze is doing a hell of a job of it I think we're doing a hell of a job of it We must build new technology rumbles doing a hell of a job of it. Locals is doing a hell of a job of it We need new payment processors. We need we need Everything literally everything We need to figure out how if you don't want to be a cog in this very very evil machine That you must find a way to do business with people you want to do business with i'm not for jailing these people I'm not for destroying them and Pushing them to the margins of society. I just don't want anything to do with them And I am going to continue to devote my life to making sure that a flourishing America and it starts here in a flourishing, Florida exists and That's what we have to push on and Desantis is just one guy. You know, I know I talk about him a lot here, but it's like one guy is saying enough's enough One guy is saying a pharaoh. No Let my people go like it's enough of this enough of this and I know you've got power And I know you've got armies and I know you've got big tech and I know you've got corporations And I know you've got the media and you can lie and slander And and seemingly destroy all of us But if that's why you're not saying anything Then you're digging your own grave because it will only get worse. It's your silence that acquiesces to it, right? It's your silence that feeds it so that it keeps moving and moving and moving so it's us versus the mob It's us versus the mob and the mob guess what the mob it's powerful and it eats people that otherwise sort of get it It eats people like bill mar it eats people like john steward. That's not an attack on them But they they're yes. It's white people that are the problem We live in the most tolerant society probably in the history of the world We really really do The only people who are really intolerant right now are the woke leftists and yes, there are some on the right there are There really are they have no institutional power. They have no institutional power But are there some racist are there some old school white supremacist racist somewhere Are there people who really have true bigotry in their heart that are that are more right leaning or whatever you want to call that? Of course there are But we are all being dysregulated We are being dysregulated by algorithms and bots and trolls and all of these things And we need to figure out a way to win this battle. I think I think desantis is doing it just by saying here I am here is what I believe Um, I am trying to say here. I am here is what I believe I think if you do it whatever that means to you whatever small step you can take we can do this No one else is going to save you no one is going to save you I Guys I got a book tour coming out Daverouben.com slash events you can see me in Orlando and west palm and rolly north carolina And braya and oxnard and a whole bunch of other places don't juniors joining me megan kelly You know the spiel already Daverouben.com slash immense.
