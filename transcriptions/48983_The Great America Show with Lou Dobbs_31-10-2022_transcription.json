    "text": " Hello, everybody. I'm Lou Dobbs, and welcome to the Great America Show. Great to have you with us today. We're getting closer and closer to Election Day, and believe it or not, our countdown is down to single digits. How about that? We'll be talking about that, and I think I should mention that President Biden has a new count on the number of states in the Union. We'll take that up, and I think we have to at least lightly examine, mention at the very least, that Pelosi Hammer attack episode in the speaker's home. She wasn't there, but unfortunately for her husband, he was. One week till the election, as I said, the most important midterm election of our lives, it's an existential election, and if that sounds like hyperbole, let's examine the facts. Biden has pushed through $6 trillion in federal spending. Think about that, $6 trillion, and he hasn't been president for even two years yet. The national debt has grown to more than $31 trillion. Yes, that's $5 trillion more than our entire economy, and that's part of the reason for high inflation. The reason we're living through this period of outrageously high prices for food, for gasoline, heating oil, clothing for almost everything. But in the midst of all the angst and despair, the stock market is looking up. The Dow Jones industrial is up more than 14% just this month. It's the best track in almost 50 years, and depending on what happens on this final day of trading in October, this could be the best October on the Dow in history. That's going back to 1896. But what a mess all around these markets, because the Fed this week is expected to raise interest rates up 75 basis points again, and that could set off another sell-off in the market, not even two years in office and six million illegal immigrants as well, entering the country. That's an invasion by any standard, and Biden and Harris say our borders secure. Check. Don't you love these people? In no sense talking about the cartel's sex trafficking and poisoning of America, fentanyl is now the number one killer of Americans, ages 18 to 45, and not a peep from the Biden White House, where apparently they just love the Mexican drug cartels because they're putting tens of billions of dollars into their coffers, and they've turned the entire Mexican border over to the cartels. Who knows? Maybe the big guy is getting a 10% cut like usual. The cartels get 12 to $15,000 for each alien. They smuggle over the wide open border. Six million of them. Six times. Let's see. Let's be conservative. $10,000 for each illegal alien. That equals, are you ready? Doing just a little quick math? $60 billion in two years. If Biden were to get as usual big guy cut of 10%, that's $6 billion in the Biden vault. I'm sure the Biden crime family does have expenses on all this, so that number is probably a little lower. It's still a hefty take, and not so great for the hundreds of thousands of Americans being poisoned and killed by the cartels and the Chinese who are providing the fentanyl, or the millions whose wages are being undercut by illegal workers. But for Biden, I'm sure he just considers all of those Americans killed and wages caught to be merely collateral damage in his fight against inflation, the inflation that he's created. Quite a little racket they've all constructed, isn't it? And no wonder the Marxist Dems fought so hard against that wall that President Trump wanted to build on the Mexican border. That would have been a real hit on Biden family finances, wouldn't it? In fact, not only this puppet president of ours, but his masters, the Marxist dim cabal that runs him, the Democratic Party, and the country now. And with all that going on, the hogs are getting fatter by the day in the swamp under this administration. They say the rest of the country be damned. Either his puppeteers or the puppet Biden forgot how many states are in the union as well. He was in Philadelphia campaigning for another impaired candidate, John Federman, who wants to put as many felons on the street as possible. And in his remarks, President Biden referred to 54 states. Biden, it seems, is gone or going, folks. It's that straightforward. Remember when Obama said there are 57 states while campaigning in 2008? So by some recordings, Biden has a case to say that he's at least three states smarter than Obama. That case can be argued, I realize. And speaking of arguments, a doozy has been unleashed out in the People's Republic of California, or to quote the new owner of Twitter, replying to Hillary Clinton, quote, there is a tiny possibility there might be more to this story than meets the eye in quote, and the story to which Alon Musk was referring is this, a man clad only in his underwear, a tax speaker, Nancy Pelosi's husband with a hammer at 2 30 in the morning, and the Pelosi's San Francisco home. Got all that? Paul Pelosi is now in a hospital recovering after surgery for injuries, including a fractured skull and injuries to his hands and arms. And by the way, you should note, all those injuries came as the man attacked him in front of the police that had responded to a call for help. Police have given conflicting accounts of what actually transpired. And some news outlets, liberal news outlets, of course, tried initially to label the assailant 42 year old David DePape as a maga extremist. The truth obviously is more complicated. DePape is, it turns out, a nudist activist who lived in and near a hippie collective and homeless encampment, most recently living in a bus in front of the house of his ex-partner, also a nudist activist with, according to Breitbart, a black lives flag and a window in her home, an LGBT rainbow with pot symbol hanging from a tree in her front yard. She's the mother of his two children. And a neighbor says, DePape is mentally ill. As I said, complicated, and we will update you, of course, on this story throughout. And so it goes. The polls are converging in this final week of the midterm campaigns all over the country. And Pennsylvania is no exception, where state Senator Doug Mastriano is in a bitter battle for the governor's office with one of the state's establishment Marxist Dems. And Mastriano is also opposed by an establishment. He's being opposed as well by the state's GOP establishment, as well as Mitch McConnell and the RNC's Ronna McDaniel. Because you see, Mastriano is endorsed by President Donald Trump, because he's America first, he's MAGA, a strong faith, family values, pro-life candidate. His is a great story. Mastriano is a retired US Army colonel, combat veteran, has a PhD in history, opposed by the GOP establishment, as I said, because they still hate Donald Trump. So much so, they prefer a Marxist Dem win in Pennsylvania rather than Doug Mastriano. Senator Mastriano is our guest here today, and welcome back to the Great America Show, Doug. What a race you're in. Your opponent has outspent you by something like 27 to one. That's insane. Yet your polling numbers are closing. Give us your assessment in this final week before election day. Thank you, Lou, for having me back out. And you're right, we're massively outspent. The Democrats see that the road to the White House goes through Pennsylvania, and so they've invested a lot of money in my opponent. And they also see that, you know, if if better man does win and he can't stay in office, the governor gets to a point, you know, his replacement. So if they say it's a two-ferf, if the Democrats get it, the establishment on our side does not get it. But we're funded by the people. We've, my wife and I've campaigned in all 67 counties multiple times. We're hitting hard in the battleground areas of the state right now in the southeast, in Philly area in Pittsburgh and Erie, as well as some places up in the northeast, the Pocanoes. And our reception, Lou, has been, you know, astoundingly well. I mean, I campaigned yesterday in three events in Bucks County, which is just outside of Philly, to the north. And our first event we went to in the middle of the workday, we had standing room only. It was like 400 or 500 people. I mean, when my opponent goes to these events in friendly territory, he can't draw about 12 or 15 people. So we've seen that throughout the state over the past six months. This is an odd thing. He doesn't seem to have much of a following, and he doesn't seem to have much of a plan. And in frankly, I don't know what he stands for. I mean, that's all to the aside here. I mean, I know what you stand for. And frankly, I mean, I look at the two of you, the energy that you and your wife, by the way, are bringing to the campaign trail. That's the stuff that I really like as an observer of politics for a very long time. I've seen it work well, and I've seen it also represent candidates who are really for the people. And the best kind of people are outspinning the most energy. And I would include, by the way, amongst those candidates, one Donald J. Trump, a man of tireless, endless energy, working for the people and enjoying being with the people. I don't sense that from your opponent. But I mean, I look at you and you're a 30 year veteran of the United States Army, a retired officer, a retired colonel in the Army, a combat veteran. You've got four master's degrees, a PhD, you've been in public service since you got out of the military. I'm wondering what in the world, I think you're the perfect candidate with an almost perfect record. And I say almost because I have to believe you got to see somewhere in school, maybe in elementary school or something. I don't know. But I would describe that to you. None of us is perfect, but you're a come offal coast. So give us a sense of what you think the people in Pennsylvania are looking for. In the southeast, it's largely law and order and the governor's been taking on crime. My opponent's been the Attorney General for six years and we have lawlessness in the streets in Philadelphia. 4,400 robberies this year, 2,000, almost 2,000 shooting victims this year, 1,000 carjacking, 439 homicides are ready this year. And it looks like 600 before the years out. Now that's filling out into the surrounding counties and the suburbs that are normally safe. We see Wawa leaving in part the city because of the lawlessness and the dangers of their employees using the damage to their stores. And so law and order in one side of the state, the rest of the state inflation, the economic situation, a hope for the future taxation. There's a lot of talk as well about the wokeness in our schools. So there's a lot of bad stuff going through the schools. And my opponent, he said he's going to basically continue the policies of Wolf when he was an interview with his past June in Philadelphia at a local affiliate. And if you're happy with the way things are going, then you know, he's the guy. But if you want James and then Doug Matt Strano is the man of the hour and that's what we're hearing across the state. Yeah, I would hope that that would be the case because the people of Pennsylvania frankly have a lot to prove to the rest of the country right now. Doug, just to be straightforward about it. I mean, the election of 2020 was an awful, an awful spectacle in Pennsylvania. Your court system looks, you know, I mean, pathetic. By the way, the US Supreme Court didn't have any glory to shine on itself either with two opportunities to intervene and do what's right, at least in terms of getting to the bottom of what was going on in your state and others. But also the Republican leadership in the state legislature, my goodness. And now we got 250,000 votes have been sent out by your secretary of state, unverified ballots. This is the time it seems to me the people of Pennsylvania would want reform, would want change and to raise the level of the quality of public servants in that state. I agree. I mean, it was a laughing stock would happen in 2020 and, you know, asking questions of the senator does not make anyone an election denier. I mean, I don't think Hillary's conceded the 2016. I mean, I stated that Abrams hasn't conceded in Georgia, you know, four years ago. And we have a lot of unanswered questions. Sadly, our governor has vetoed most of the good legislation we had, but we have tightened up election laws a little bit. But here's the thing, Lou. It's time for people in this state and across this nation to stop waving their fifths at the TV's and, you know, being angry, do something about it. And so, you know, volunteer for a campaign, support a candidate, give money if you can, be a poll watcher. You know, this time last year, Glenn Johnson was told he was going to lose, but he had 90 some percent of the polls manned with poll watchers who made sure the shenanigans were at a low level. And because of that, I believe he won the race. So we still need another thousand or so poll watchers out there. So go to dug for go.com, sign up and do something about it. Yeah, I think that that's an important invitation to all of your supporters, because basically, we need about we need two Republicans at every poll in the country. It's that straightforward, that simple. And without it, there's going to be an opportunity for, well, for illegal activity. And we learned a lot in 2020, it'd be a shame not to put to put to work what we learned in 2020 in 2022. So you still need a thousand. What are you doing to get them? We're pushing real hard on social media and any platforms, such as your show. You know, I'll mention that. And people are rising up. Our goal is to have all the polls covered in the state. It's not that hard. We'll provide training. Our state GOP in Pennsylvania is fantastic, Lou. Absolutely no complaints there. They're helping us with the training and equipping, as well as overwatching voting integrity in Pennsylvania. There's a lot of issues out there, but it can be resolved with transparency and people in a booth on the ground. And boots on the ground are important voters everywhere are important because they're not only voting, they need to be participating in the process itself, whether it's just simply watching that poll, making sure that there is no still Dougery, a foot as as Oliver Wendell. Sherlock Holmes wants to say Oliver Wendell said something else. But I've just, I'm marvel right now at where we are in this country. In your state, you have the same problem. We have so many of the same problems in every state in the union. Teachers, the two major teachers unions have declared war on the children that are going to school in our public schools, the great equalizer and they're treating it like the children are theirs to do as they wish, not as their parents would have them and as the community would demand. There should be safe. They should be taught at the highest levels. This is not a time for nonsense, like CRT, ESG, DEI. All of these programs are nonsense. Your thoughts about what is happening in the schools and how Doug Mastriano would fix it. We had a hearing in the state Senate a week and a half ago and we brought in moms from across the state, especially the southeast part of the state and it was horrific. And we know the stories, but the hearing out of the mouths of moms who are confronting this and being pushed out and pushed and told be quiet from a bureaucrats. I mean, the indoctrination and for first and second graders with pronoun games and the kids are told, you know, pick your pronouns today and don't tell your parents by the way that we're doing this in school. Gender transition surgeries, they're being offered to minors without parental consent or they say they'll have the parents catch up to it later on. Wait, wait, wait, wait just a minute. Doug, I gotta say that again. Say that again, please. In the southeast, there's a hard push in Shapiro's part of this together, of course, with Dr. Levine, who sets the standard for this as their health secretary. There's being offered and paid for now by the Philadelphia Children's Hospital, gender transition surgeries and the schools are playing a key role in that because they're playing pronoun games. You know, some of the schools are where they have radical educators there and the kids, the mom testified under oath that the kids that are being indoctrinated with pronoun games and confusion, the standard, you know, the conditions for gender transition surgeries later, they're told not to tell their parents what's going on in the classroom. Well, that's amazing. They're using public schools as a feeder program to clinics for gender transition for children. That is transition and surgery. I mean, this is there's been no public debate on this. There have been no federal hearings to my knowledge. There have been no statewide hearings anywhere. Perhaps New York, perhaps I don't know Pennsylvania. Have there been hearings on this nonsense? It came up during the hearing that I help organize in our state committee. I don't chair the committee. The state chair is Senator Argo and that's where this came up. And so then of course it was pushed back harshly by the Democrats, but the moms would have nothing of that when the Democrats started trying to hide behind race and what have you. I mean, the moms are real heroes there. And so what has happened is, you know, my movement here is called the Walk is Free People movement. It started during the shutdown. It's comprised of just not very conservative Republicans. It includes a lot and a lot of Democrats, independents who find their kids being mishandled in the school system. So what I'm going to do about it, Lou, on day one, for gender pronoun games and in our schools executive order on day one, see our TLD band on day one will have, of course, curriculum transparency schools will have to post all their curriculum online parental review and parental transparency. My opponent fought really hard in Pennsylvania last year for the right of boys to go into the girls bathroom. And he was not content winning in Pennsylvania. He also fought in Virginia. And this time last year, because of my opponent's work, a beautiful young 15 year old girl was raped in Loudon County, Virginia. We remember what happened. The school board tried to cover it up. The dad were front of the school board and the dad was hauled out and handcuffed not the school board. I mean, this is insane. So on day one, boys are not allowed in the girls bathrooms or the girls locker rooms for that matter. And then this ridiculous encroachment on women's rights and on day one of my administration, as far as the female athletes will no longer have to compete against male athletes. What are we descended to? Doug, we have to tell the boys, you only go in the boys room and girls, the only go in the girls room. I mean, that's sort of elemental, isn't it? Yeah, that is how far the left is pushing, how hard they're pushing in this country to destroy the identities of children, to confuse them further and to go well beyond anything like education, reading, writing, and arithmetic, which used to be this. That was the mission. When I was fortunate enough to be growing up, how dare these unions get involved in all of this and how dare state officials, local officials, permit these school teachers to usurp the rights and responsibilities of parents. Parents looked at them for help for support in the care and the development of their children. And instead, they're talking sex with them at the age of what? Five or six on up. This is insane. Let me ask you this. Is anybody helping on this issue in Pennsylvania? Is there an outcry against or is this is the state of Pennsylvania just rolling over for this? The outcry is from the moms and grandmoms out there. I mean, there and many dads as well. I mean, just a Paul Blue, hello, it's gotten your exactly right that I had your list of things that I just did that I'm going to have that I'm going to reverse on day one when I'm sworn in on 17 January. Shows you how low the left is have gone. They've gone too far. They're destroying our kids' education and our test scores in Pennsylvania are tanking this fire left school union and my opponent are waging war on every parent and student. I mean, they sued to keep kids in mass. They sued to get boys and girls bathroom. And instead of focusing on getting our kids opportunity and educating them so they can break out of poverty and Philadelphia. You know, Lou, many of these young men and women get girls and boys less school in Philadelphia during a shutdown because they're not being educated. And now they're finding themselves, in the middle of crossfire or in gangs because they make some bad choices. The grave diggers in the southeast say they can't keep up with the dead teens are bearing. You know, that could have been and this is not hyperbolic. That could have been my dad in the 50s. My dad dropped out of school and you know, and he was getting in trouble with the law and a judge said basically, either join a Navy or go to jail. And my dad went to he said, they dug I was a punk until I joined a Navy and the Navy turned his life around it. It turned him around to one of the hardest working one of the most patriotic family men that you'd ever meet. And he's passed on. And that's, I think some of those kids in Philadelphia who've lost their way are finding that they've lost opportunities because they're caught up in a cyclic crime and even being killed on the streets. And that's as a result these failed policies of the far left Democrats in Pennsylvania. That needs to end. Yeah. Well, what it seems to me that they would be begging Doug Masteriano to be governor. I know that you were running a very tight race, but I mean, here you are with all of your life experience talking about what is important, coming at it from a from a perspective of patriotism, commitment to self improvement, commitment to decency and honor. And Shapiro is trying to strip children of their identities. This is this is a bizarre moment and the national media and the state media. I understand are all controlled by the corporate left in this country. But certainly there's the churches. Are they rising up? Are the are the are the are, you know, the synagogues? I mean, what in the world? Where's the rest of the community on these issues? Because they're fundamental. The foundation of our nation. Let me speak to that. So, you know, I've been with the Indian community, the Asian Indian community and they're very supportive. You know, they believe in an education opportunity in America, you know, as a community. The church is in Pennsylvania kind of a mixed bag. You know, some of the churches, that leave blue, they share all our values by, oh, you know, I might lose my tax exempt status. Romans chapter 13 and a quoting that out of context. Thankfully, we're heartened. There are some churches here like, you know what? This is America. This is not about my tax exempt status because the left the left all the time has politicians, you know, preaching from from the pulpit there, you know, their politics, not even talking to testimony. And so, you know what? It's time for the churches in Pennsylvania to stop playing these games. Either you're part of the solution or you're part of the problem. And this race here, you know, Rev. and I have stepped out. We believe in our state. We want to change the course of the state here and save it from the directions going. But we can't do it without the people of Pennsylvania. So, you know, churches and pastors, church leaders out there, you have 11 days to make a choice and take a stand. And if you choose poorly in a safe way, you know, and ring your hand, though, we can't do this in our congregations while the Democrats do all the time. I even had a pastor last night telling me, you know, Doug, we'll pray over you if you come. But, you know, we try to keep politics out of the pulpit. But, you know, the Democrats come in all the time, like, and I get no pushback for that. I'm like thinking, you know, we need a little courage here. It's time to stand up and do the right thing. And we're going to lose our country if we blow it in Pennsylvania on November 8th. Yeah, I don't know that, you know, I can't say that that's hyperbole. I think I agree with you on that issue. I hadn't thought of it that way, but it is a fulcrum, a pivot. Point certainly to have a state the size of Pennsylvania with your immense resources, which I know you talk about and freeing up those resources and your economy to restore prosperity to the state. The state has been led by left wing hacks. And I just don't see what the discussion is here. When you look at a president like Joe Biden impaired, most 60% of those surveyed say that this president is unfit to be in the Oval Office. We watch John Federman in a debate with Dr. Oz. And we've got Chuck Schumer saying, well, we've got a little problem in Pennsylvania. The Democratic Party in Pennsylvania should be held to account for every step that he takes from the moment they put him forward after he had that stroke. They're trying to run a fraud game. And it is irresponsible. And the national media and the state media to not talk about his health, if his help, if that of the president of the United States isn't, isn't appropriate for scrutiny by the American press and people where have we come as a nation, the left has seized control of minds and frozen the very idea of free speech. I agree. And you know, you and I watch this double standing. You remember in 1984 during the Reagan-Mondale debate, I think was Ted Topple. I can't remember. But he's like, Mr. President, you know, you'll, when you leave office and for your should you win reelection, you'll be 78 years old. You'll be the oldest, oldest president in office. And there was no questions about Joe Biden days going in at 78 years old. And it's this double standard, this just duplicity here needs to be called out. And I'm tired of the hypocrisy because they gave Federman a free pass loop. The one job of Lieutenant Governor John Federman is to provide as the president of the Senate. He has not shown up to any of our sessions in person to provide since May. And could you imagine if that was me or another Republican? I mean, there'd be het to pay in the media. You know, he's out there painting, do your job resign. But since it's one of their guys on their team, you know, they look the other way with grace and mercy. Well, good grief. I mean, we're in a situation where the guy who is an absentee, by the way, I think you're very fortunate he didn't show up from what I've seen. He's a complete fraud. He is a left wing hack has no visible means of support over the course of his adult life, other than the money that he gets from his parents. And suddenly the left wing media wants to put him in front of the people of Pennsylvania. This is disgusting to me. The Democratic Party is behaving this way and conducting itself. It just demonstrates that the Democrat Party, the Marxist Dim Party in this country, they're devoid of values. They're devoid of any aspirational and I think patriotic impulse that I can see. They're authoritarian. They want to tell you and your children, when they go to school, when they wear masks, what they do, and when they do it. This is in America. This is this is some sort of freak show put on by the radical dims to benefit home because it doesn't benefit America to have our borders wide open to shut down our energy industry in this country. Fossil fuels are suddenly the enemy when they those fossil fuels have fired American progress for almost 200 years in this country. It's you get the last word here. I'm going to say it. Governor, it just has a great ring to it. I think you are the right guy at the right moment to be governor of Pennsylvania. I can't imagine why there is even a moment's choice of the part of any Pennsylvania to make it make it so. So this is where we always give our guests the final word. You're concluding thoughts if you would. Thank you. Thank you, Lou. It's always an honor privilege. Thank you for being a voice of reasons for so many years on the airwaves. At least, betterment had the courage to show up, Lou. I mean, my opponent, Shapiro, refuses to debate me. I offered him over 75 days ago now to debate. He could even bring Donna Brazil and have a cheat sheet in her pocket for him. But he's getting away with it because the Democrats have the media on her side. In the end, the future of our nation is decided by Pennsylvania. We are the Keystone state. We're sitting on a gold mine of energy resources, which under Shapiro will be crushed and destroyed. What's the inflation in gas price will even go up higher in Pennsylvania or under mass, we're going to have an economic renaissance. I'm going to open up our energy sector like we've never done before. We're going to drill and dig and export to our allies over in Europe and bring all those billions of euros over to a Pennsylvania and it'll be a place of energy and prosperity and hope and opportunity. And a place where people can walk is free men and women and not be looking over their shoulder, whether it was a criminal coming or there's a government bureaucrat at a Harrisburg coming after them because Ronald Reagan is right. The most terrifying words are, I'm from the government, I'm here to help. Under mass, we're going to roll back to bureaucracy massively and put the power back in the hands of the people. Well, Doug, Master, we appreciate you being with us. We thank you so much. And we wish you Godspeed in your campaign. It's closing. And I know that you're going to bring that thing right to the edge and prevail on election day. We certainly hope so. We pray so and Godspeed. Doug Monsteriano, thanks for being with us and God bless you. God bless you too. Thank you, sir. Doug Masteriano, Republican for governor of Pennsylvania. As you heard, his website is Doug ForGov. That's Doug ForGov, the letter for Gov.com. If you want to help him out and send a message to the establishment GOP, that's DougForGov.com. Thanks, everybody. Here tomorrow, our guests will be leading Republican pollster and strategist John McLaughlin of the McLaughlin group to tell us how these elections are unfolding all over the country. Be sure to vote and to join us here tomorrow on The Great America Show. Till then, God bless you and may God bless America."
