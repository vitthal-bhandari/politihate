country he's done an amazing job building one of the most powerful youth organizations ever created turning point usa we will not embrace the ideas that have destroyed countries destroyed lives and we are going to fight for freedom on campuses across the country that's why we are here so brought to you by the lone experts i trust andrew and Todd at c r pacific mortgage at andrewandtodd.com i really like creative ideas creative ideas that push the overton window that find ways for us to be able to really push back against the regime join us now there's no fridge from national file no you have a very unique idea and i asked you is this legit is this legit when we were texting together no take as much time as you need walk us through it sure thing charlie thanks for having me so our legal analyst at national file i've been rickland is a constitutional attorney he's a jag attorney retired lieutenant colonel in the army of green berry and um and he sat down with oan about a week or so ago and um rolled through this theory and uh it's online you can go uh read about it at nationalfile.com basically it's this the speaker of the house nancy flossie brought all of this boghous j six persecution against uh bannan and navarro using her boghous j six uh prosecution committee they're in the house which of course had a couple republicans on the committee and a speaker can do away with those criminal referrals and so uh kevin mccarthy uh has abrogated his and his responsibility and his duty i would argue to go ahead and do away with those frivolous criminal referrals and so now we were sitting in a place where bannan has been convicted and now he's appealing uh navarro uh that case just wrapped today evin is there covering that trial for national file and uh that that has just wrapped the jury is deliberating it's obviously dc so we have to assume it'll be a you know a guilty verdict yep and so uh we we uh they've been deliberating about three hours now but the the point is this is that kevin mccarthy is complicit in allowing the weapon weaponization of this doj this biden doj against the trump administration and key figures in the trump now orbit yet so let let me ask just and it just to make sure i'm saying and i'm totally on board with you like we have if we can do this we got to do this so does it take a vote though because it took a vote to authorize a contempt to congress didn't it so but and then number two does it change when there's a new congress number three has that have we ever rescinded or uh revoked a referral before i know those are a bunch of questions but they're they're somewhat technical well there's a couple things that kevin could do kevin could actually uh haul them in and they could testify because they didn't do that before and so he could bring them in and they could testify and then he could say oh based on testimony this is gone okay because it's a new speaker of the house and so the the basic point is this when republicans have power they never use it so here we are nine months almost into this speakership that he made all kinds of promises to achieve to secure and he's not using any of his power to try to defend patriots in the trump administration against and out of control uh congress polosi led congress or biden led doj so let me ask you what what would they count what would their devil's argument be no i don't have the power never been tested just let's let's let's let's superman our own argument here what what would they say so that as i lobby for this which i will i want to make sure i'm prepared right that that's exactly what they will say they'll say there's no precedent for this well that's what the democrats do every day they go to do the pressed things and then they they hoped that it sticks and then uh nobody says anything and then it does well why don't we do that i mean that's this is the base of the core essence of this discussion so the the ask would then be the current speaker of the house kevin mccarthy resends the criminal referral and then it would probably be challenged in court right but then that's correct but is it matter the jury's deliberating right now for pewd and avar like right now doesn't need to happen before a conviction or i mean because we're kind of running out of time aren't we i i think on appeal like there's going to be an appeal assuming a conviction right and that's that's the status that bannon is he's in that limbo status right now um and so uh if if they were actually able to to hold those testimonies right and they said say they came in and they talked to congress which they didn't do with palosi uh that would be a an actual substantive proactive step in the right direction to figuring out what happened and and the congress can gavel out and say hey we find no criminal referral necessary here moving on it doesn't doesn't seem overly complicated let's kind of broaden this 930 is a big funding fight you guys at national file have been talking about this what is the order we should ask for more broadly from leadership because we are we are being persecuted non-stop by a Gestapo illegitimate Soviet regime and finally we have an opportunity on 930 to draw September 30th to draw a line in the sand talked about the stakes here null what we can do in harmony with this creative idea that you've presented right so uh there is this deadline looming um i'll be totally honest if i had my dr others look the the government can continue to fund social security the government can continue to fund the dod to to perform our core promises and uh responsibilities that we've made to the american people other than that why don't we just shut it all down i don't see why we just don't have a total government shutdown no act that the Biden administration is engaged in at present is legitimate zero uh apart from cutting checks to veterans for retirement uh current servicemen in the dod and social security other than that let's shut it all down charlie why not why wouldn't we do that and they're gonna come wine and they're gonna say oh and they're gonna bend McCarthy over a barrel and he's gonna whine and complain and oh well we got it governed we got to keep the government open a lot of americans are ready for the shutdown ten years later after ted cruz did it about a decade ago i think we're there now and so what they're gonna say is oh well it's gonna hurt our reelection chances well devil's advocate null how do we respond to that we're we're gonna lose all these elections if we don't keep the government open and you know keep the military trust look but do finally doing your job is gonna lose you an election i don't think so i don't think so buddy i think doing your and it goes back to the mangani thing we were dealing with this stuff with uh kevin macartes always trying to hold some issue out into the next election to use that issue whatever it was been gazee in 2015 you remember that's the excuse that the deep state used to fire macarti after he had his illicit affair with uh rene elmer's which is a bad habit that mr macarti has with affairs with congresswoman but uh they the excuse to fire him that sadly gave us paul ryan was oh he was he's gonna use this bingazi thing as a political football to go into 2016 well here we are the year ahead of an election again and and he's gonna use these issues to go into an election with a political football how about use this how about this for a political football how about hey i did my job how about that kevin use doing your job as a political football going into the next election so let's talk about then the order we need to ask for what what what is from a negotiation standpoint what should we say i mean i say obviously jack smith fbi doesn't get a new building reduced the head count of d oj no what should be the top priority no no new money to ukraine we have the purse right so we have the power it's about time we use it that's right uh well we've been look people say that it's extreme that we talk about defunding the department of education ronald ragan ran on defunding the department of education back in 1980 that's not extreme to say defund the federal department of education especially now after we see what these monsters are doing and with these creeksons in our schools uh in our kids uh that's an easy one um but across the line texas has a great uh environmental protection agency we should model our state environmental protection agencies after texas and get america back to work again literally we could go almost every three letter agency charlie and and knock them all down one by one and and really cut uh a ton of spending um obviously that's a wishful thinking uh the kevin get barely has enough uh bravery to get up and uh even pretend to be conservative which is what he does he just barely pretends to be conservative on tv every day um and and i think he might even enjoy it a little bit because the the conservative the liberal media helps him pretend to be a conservative which is of course a joke as you and i both know um but yeah you got to start with the d oj you have to we got to get back to basics we got to have we got to restore faith in the judiciary um we've got a hundred percent got to stop stop handing out this cash we've got some big reports coming in national file on this ukraine rope-a-dope of course you know as soon as you oppose the war in ukraine you get accused of being a a lackey for vladimir poutin which is i don't think fair of course either um we've got some big reporting coming on that's gonna uh put the lie to that whole fake trope at national file dot com um but the bottom line is i think mccarthy's got to go i think this september is his moment to it's a make or break for kevin mccarthy and i don't think he picked it strong sell is amazing i got to tell you the combination of nadh coq tenon collagen is really something you know people ask me

slash charlie no fridge continues so no should be in p2 show by it should we put that aside and just do the funding fight where where are we at on this because we're running at a time that's right yeah i i mccarthy has engaged in in gross negligence here in these last eight months or so since he won that gavel in uh in early january uh i tended to think that the impeachment thing will be just a boondoggle it won't go anywhere they've been talking about and they're not even talking about impeachment they're just talking about the inquiry right um and uh so they're still tip toeing into that whole idea they're very scared of it and obviously in the senate i don't think we're likely to see anything i think because of that that's the main reason that i think it would be a waste of time and then we should honestly if we could have a speaker of the house that would actually rule and use the gavel for conservative means to actually oppose the biden regime that's that's the goal that's what we should be doing um and look it's i can break this exclusively for for you guys here charlie on this air i was talking with the producer offline um um kevin kevin can't even release the j6 footage he doesn't even have the power to do that and um this is something that he's known for quite some time but that hasn't stopped him from going out in the press with bright bard and others uh even voice of america news well that's deep state news and saying hey we're gonna release this footage and and voa carries his water and others carry his water uh and and cnn plays this fake pro wrestling thing saying like oh he's gonna release that footage but of course he never does the thing is he doesn't even have the power to do it and so there's only two there's only two possible conclusions there either he just doesn't know what power he has and he's extremely incompetent which we know is not the case because he's been in leadership at a high level for a very long time he knows how that house works you know or he's lying to us which we know is the truth and so he's been lying to us this entire time heaven card he's been lying about opposing the Biden regime lying about holding the Biden doj accountable and he's got to go he's not the guy we obviously uh the house the conference the GOP conference made a mistake in electing him speaker of the house on january 6th so just don't understand so he does have the power or he doesn't have the power to release the footage i was interested so so yeah yeah he says he has the power but he does not so there is a bizantine uh path by which um the uh the footage can actually be released now this uh not to get too far into the weeds but the the speaker can set up the pieces in place on the chessboard to be able to release that footage basically on his say so what kevin has done is he's actually been working with the Biden administration to select Biden pawns on the chessboard that will then block the release of the footage so while kevin is going out and saying yeah we're gonna release this footage behind the scenes he's working with biden to oppose the release of the footage and he's done so successfully and he will continue to do so for that reason he's a liar and he has to go so then so walk us through null the the kind of timeline here of what you think's gonna happen 930 voted no confidence what does all this look like two minutes build it out you know help help go through that sure and and and to your point you we have to operate in the realm of reality what's possible what's realistic uh that's not lost on me of course uh but to a lot of the naysayers who will come back to to uh the conservatives who are looking for a real speaker and say yeah but who are you gonna pick some of margaris team was on the phone with me at 2 a.m. earlier in the summer wine and about uh banging on margaris for for being such a McCarthy uh acolyte who are saying who you gonna pick who do you got and my answer to them and the american uh people's answer to them should be anyone who will use the power against the biden regime literally anyone find me one guy there's got to be one person in the us house who will use and that's the only litmus test it's so it's a yes no will you use power against the biden administration or won't you and biden uh or mccarthy will not use power and so as we move to that vote we're gonna have to have that conversation and those can get long and those can get ugly and the question is is the republican conference going to try to oppose loudly and and vociferously somebody who will use power to oppose the biden regime this could go really quickly or this could take a long time and we could hamstring the congress and get nothing done and and look even getting nothing done in the congress would be better than having a McCarthy house working together with the biden regime to prosecute american patriots across this continent no fridge check it out nationalfile.com and on the cutting edge and this is going to be a very eventful couple weeks we'll be watching very closely no thanks so much thank you charlie email us freedom at charlie kirk.com and subscribe to our podcast

and tifa blm and all that i think you're gonna have a very busy year coming up school board meetings and all that however you have been working on this other project that's now public i've been watching it and it's really amazing where you you're gonna have to walk through the actual specifics but the end part we could play where it's it's kind of in the tradition of to catch a predator right yes where there are these trans pedophiles who want to go after young children and you're able to catch them in the act and then confront them i want to play a piece of tape here here's kaolin confronting one of these trans pedophiles play cut 57 got all the audio we got all the chat logs okay come on come on chris you know talking to alie we're gonna talk about it all right oh my god just trying to have fun here leave me alone i told you chris all right so we're gonna have to take a step back that's kind of the action trailer kaolin walk us through all this right so i mean this project started a while ago but i knew something that's like close to me so i'm like how do i figure out how these people are out there everyone knows they're out there we have a huge problem in this country with it so i figured you know what let's make a decoy account so i got some pictures of and i made it personal i asked my sister i said hey you're nine years younger than me do you have some photos regular photos i'm just gonna put them on this instagram account let her know christopher kara was someone who was following one of these kitty sort of kitty it's not pornography but it's children it's an instagram account so i go i'm gonna i'm gonna follow this guy see what happens sure enough high and that's when the conversation starts on instagram fast forward to july we really the team really like sort of upped our efforts in getting contact with him so we started uh recording phone calls with him and he started telling us about how you know he would get into a relationship but you know we would have to keep it a secret and is it okay if you know he's transitioning and i'm on estrogen and i want to grow my breasts and do you have um you know any victoria secret for me to wear or lingerie or things like that he says how much money do you have can you can you buy me some some bikinis and things like that how are you gonna get out of your house you know maybe we can go out into the wilderness go to a river and um you know spend some and hang out and things like that um far away you know maybe i can take you to a dark place and we can kiss and make out and you know i think honestly and how old was the person you were pretending to be uh i always say like almost 13 and so they go oh 13 but it's year 12 that's a 12 year old so yeah he had he he knew 100 percent that he had he is above 18 he was a 23 year old the 23 year old knowingly communicating with a 12 year old yeah got it yeah and so just coordinating everything from talking to him when he wants to talk getting you know the team together so that we could record the phone calls and then coordinating getting out there and meeting up with him because we actually got there and he actually bailed uh the first night so we actually had to go and find him and have him meet us at a Walmart and then he didn't want to come inside the Walmart but because he really wanted bikinis i said i'm not coming outside because you know i just drove all this way and here's a picture of bikinis which one do you like and he was like oh give me a second i'm coming in right now and so he comes in and that's in the video where you see us confront him uh afterward he gets into a car accident and then he takes off so he has a hit and run and so we go and i just bombard him from several fake numbers with you know chris it's in your best interest that you come and meet us and he came back yes yes i've never seen that in any video i've never seen anyone get the the perpetrator to come back so we met him at a subway and i told him hey i'll get you some food i'm not getting him food and so he comes back and that's where we question him more about some other things that didn't make it into to the video and we asked him about his you know pornography habits and things like that and um you know of course he denied everything um but law enforcement came they cited him for the hit and run but right now the issue is that nebraska has interesting laws and if this case moves forward it'll set a precedent in nebraska um for operations like this um because right now you have to be law enforcement evidently which means christopher karais just out there wait so you have to be law enforcement to sting a predator yeah so basically his defense will be even though i thought i was talking to a 12 year old that i wasn't talking to a 12 year old so even though he had pedophilic intent absolutely so is that we're law and so the local hastings pd is not arresting him because of that if that is going to be one of the issues on top of the last thing that the attorney's office told us was that they just don't have the prosecutors to like assign the case to so they don't have a pro so again i i want to do this gracefully first before we do it not so gracefully uh-huh um this is Hastings nebraska yeah not exactly like Berkeley right right right it's not a big city or anything yeah but no but it's very conservative right i mean i would imagine like from a time is that right i would assume that it is so they there is a resident pedophile who you now have evidence wanted to have rape young a young girl yes who's a tr he's a trans person yes trans pedophile and the local pd is like yeah we don't have the manpower to handle that that's exactly what's happening yeah so i i just want to make understand this was months of work that you and the turning point usa team underwent under this kind of theme of like we know this is happening and we want to try to hold these animals accountable to correct because it's conceivable that this pedophile will just act again and or has acted before or actually find a 12 or 13 year old and rape that 12 or 13 absolutely if this was a real person it would have it would have actually happened right there would have been a real victim had we not been there doing what we did so he wasted his time on us and we caught him um the crazy part Charlie is that he actually messaged my decoy account on Sunday and he still doesn't realize that it's not a real 12 recently yes on Sunday what did he think the thing that happened in walmart was i have no idea his message said hi and i said hi i didn't say it was me or anything i just said hi and he goes why did you send those two guys after me after we talked about meeting up i i'm shocked i'm i'm really shocked what yeah i'm shocked so he still thinks there's a real person yes these people are really demented and sick do you think that the local law enforcement and Hastings is afraid to proceed because this person is trans it's a possibility it's a possibility but there wasn't any mention of that so i'm not going to i'm not going to say i know that but anything is possible today because we know how the world is and people are afraid to act against any class of protected people so i just want to make sure of one of the signs this is the best you know reporting team in the country you have a lot going on you are literally trying to save children it's a it's a big deal to talk about it you're exposing it it's been very successful millions of views online kind of in that vein of to catch a predator right right and that's that's what we're doing the the number one thing here apart from from any of the social media stuff is that we want to do our part to protect children and we know how to do it we should be doing it everyone should be doing it everyone should be vigilant and should educate themselves on how they can protect their children at home because those are the people whose kids they're going after and there are so many apps out there i didn't even know what they are and we are people who are on social media yeah are the feds doing any of this is like the fbi actively in these chat rooms so that is that is something i've yet to discover but i will say a good friend of mine named uh ryan montgomery he's a hacker he recently did a special with shawn ryan and where he actually hacked a website caught some pedophiles but actually law enforcement feds came to him and said you need to be working with us so i'm assuming that there are some um federal federal agencies that are working on these things um and every once in a while we'll see a huge huge operation uh there's a there's things every so often yeah i mean just it doesn't sound like you had to go through a ton of work to find this pedophile though not as much as i'm sure they probably have to go through but what i'm saying is that this is pretty common oh it's a totally yeah i mean how how common do you think it is i'll tell you charlie there are there are accounts on instagram hundreds hundreds of these accounts that post images of children who have thousands hundreds of thousands of followers of of grown men who are following multiple multiples and that's just instagram our most of them trans are homosexual um that would be hard to say that would be hard to say uh but i i'm i'm sure that on uh grinder that is an app where a lot of homosexual men are absolutely willing to meet up for sex with someone who's with a 13-year-old boy probably nothing to that email us directly freedom at charliekirk.com turning point usa is literally saving children's lives we got to get this guy in prison now we got to do this k-lum got to figure it out this guy's got to be arrested that

Kaitlyn Dalmeida continues with us Kaitlyn will play a piece of tape here kind of setting the stage cut 56. Over the last year my team and i have worked tirelessly to develop methods to proactively protect children from online sex predators 23-year-old christopher karae a transgender online sex predator from Hastings, Nebraska who also goes by the names amelia avry and brittany believed he was communicating with a 12-year-old girl from lincoln, Nebraska not only did karae discuss cuddling making out sleeping together sex and his penis size but he expressed to our decoy his desire to travel with her hours away to promote wilderness to spend time alone with her. So so Kaitlyn this is this is now really going viral talk also just about you know right now there are kids that are being preyed upon parents have to be aware of this that's one of the other reasons you you decided to do this to really kind of increase the exposure right so as far as parents should be concerned it really is a couple of things going to be the phone they have to know what is on their child's phone what apps are they going on what apps are they using and then also on a bigger scale it's going to be the education system because the reason these pedophiles are on there and they stay on there is because they're getting success and they're getting success because children are being told that they should be exploring all kinds of these sexual things and they find that they can do that on those apps with strangers but what they don't know is that they could meet somebody and get kidnapped they could get raped they could get murdered and so parents need to know their apps like whisper their apps like that whisper is going to be a big one what what is that app never heard whispers like a it's a these are all geolocation based apps that they're that they're using so you get on the app you put in how old you are you make a little profile and now you can meet anybody in your area and so pedophiles love these apps because they can find anyone within a small area that they can you know 10 15 minutes be at someone's house and kidnap someone or rape someone i mean i'm going to try aren't these apps also should be held accountable right i mean from a law enforcement standpoint i would agree with you and i think they do have some measures in place i know that you will get banned if you are underage on certain apps but there are easily ways around that and that's how i can stay on apps like that what has been the biggest learning process or just kind of like sick to your stomach moment as you've been doing this because this took a fair amount of restraint i mean you're literally communicating with a pedophile and that's it's gross it is disgusting and i think that some some people are built to handle disgusting things i think i might just be one of those people because i knew good for you going into it that i know what these people are they're evil they're disgusting they want to harm children and a lot of times they don't have any limits they they might want you you could tell them hey i'm a parent and i have an infant that i want to sell to you and they're like great i love infants that so communicating with this you see that that that hell basically has no limits of their morality like there's none there's no limitations on their evil right and it's fair to say as you say that this is happening actively right now with thousands tens of thousands of kids across the country absolutely yeah i sure hope Hastings Nebraska acts so what would be the best case in our Hastings Nebraska does act on the evidence i think that it would again i think it would set a precedent if they act on this evidence and they charge him convict him and send him to prison because if there's one guy doing it but the evidence is right there it is this is not a you have all the evidence right and you've given it to the law enforcement yeah gave it to him the same day i gave him a full drive with intent and you have the evidence that shows he knows he was communicating with a minor that there was no yeah he a hundred percent new from day one of age of chatting the age and he still wanted to have sex he still talked about you know impregnating her or the possibility of impregnating her that's rape that's not sex that's rape correct correct kaolin from turning point us a front lines who do a great job kaolin and i think you got some big stories coming up excited for that school board stuff and some other things we were discussing off here so i love front lines i go to wet where things are happening and they tell the truth i love it thanks kim thanks charlie thanks so much for listening everybody email us your thoughts as always freedom at charlie kirk.com thanks so much for listening and god bless for more on many of these stories and news you can trust go to charliekirk.com hey what's wrong santa?
