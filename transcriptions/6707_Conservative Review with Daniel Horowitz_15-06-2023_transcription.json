    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash the blind. Politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true. The conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Miniman standing at the ready to fight anew for our life, liberty, property and all that matters here at CR podcast. This is your host, Daniel Horowitz back here today for Thursday, June the 15th, which actually is a pretty important date in history. You know, when we talk about fighting anew as if it's 1776, it's actually even more than that. We're not just reverting back to pre-revolutionary time. We're reverting back to pre-enlightenment and pre the foundations of the enlightenment, which were a couple hundred years before. So June 15th was the date that King John signed the magma carda and it was clause 39 was one of the most important. No free man shall be arrested or imprisoned or deceased or outlawed or exiled or in any way victimized except by the lawful judgment of his peers or by the law of the land. And yet here today we have gone back to pre-magma part magma carda notion. We are now run by a government that believes it can't it can do because it can. Okay, if they believe something, if they will something, they will make it happen. It doesn't matter. And then you have half the country that abides by that seem to talk about a lawful judgment of your peers. Well, you can't get that anymore because if you're on the other side of this cold civil war and you're in a place where the jury pull is like that you're screwed. So today is a actually very important date in history and it just underscores that we cannot fight yesterday's issue. We have to look ahead of the curve. The conservative movement in one of their hallmarks is that the only fight after it's too late after we lost the game, after the ball is no longer in play. When we need to be pre-empting the next onslaught that we're going to incur. It's like I watched the GOP. They're still they'll fight school closures. Mind you, they didn't fight it at the time and they went along with it. They're hearing so far. I've been very weak on COVID. We haven't had that reckoning and I want to start off today with that reckoning and how they're already approving new shots. They're continuing this. There's so many people who need help. The window is closing for this game as they go on to the next and we're not even on the previous game. We're a couple of tranches behind. So we'll talk about some of the new information that came out and what needs to be done. But there's this general lack of a sense of urgency that you have to articulate the key points, utilize every leverage point statement, focus, state discipline, and go for the kill. A lot of this is going to be with the budget bills. We need to put our riders into the budget bills. It is going to tie into the presidential election. It's going to tie into other primaries. I mean, heck, why do we only have one governor seeking a grand jury in the reckoning? So, you know, we have other gubernatorial races. We have Mississippi, a rhino up there for reelection. We need to focus on the issue in front of us. Republicans will always be right on an issue after it's long too late. So I view COVID biomedical fascism and transgenderism as the consummate issues for which we're on the cusp of breaking through if we would only fight now, but that window is narrowing. And the leading voice that silences all others on our side is bed on both of those issues. So just something to keep in mind there. The first before we begin, as always, we are sponsored by a new sponsor, actually a new product of an old sponsor, pure health research. They have a lot of great innovative products that are anti-inflammatory. One of them is joint support. After I read to you this new Pfizer report, you're definitely going to want to head over to getjointhelp.com slash Daniel to order your joint support. What is it? It contains seven of Mother Nature's best superfoods for supporting comfortable, healthy and flexible joints.

So I have this piece out that went viral when everywhere about Pfizer's latest document. And I want to just build the foundation here. So we were told for so long, oh, it's just theirs. Anyone could wrap hearted. It's just made up. Well, now we have the document where Pfizer themselves observed everything that was being reported to theirs from day one, everything that the academic literature from the academic studies, the case studies were reporting from day one. And that is that typically when you have a product, even a bad product, it has one or two known side effects, mainly, and they're usually not serious. Whereas this one has side effects that span the scope of every single organ system, every corner of the body. And one third of them were serious. It's like, it's not even like we've reverted back to times where government treats their people like lab rats. It's not even a lab rat, because they they knew exactly what this would do. They know the lipid nanoparticle spread inflammation everywhere they go and they go everywhere. But now we have Pfizer themselves. So we talked a lot about we've had British journalist, Sonia Elijah on. And she talked about these European medicine agency post marketing pharmacovigilance documents. And we've mentioned these top lines before. But what this is, and you could go to conservativereview.com, you'll see my piece. And what you'll find there is a 393 page document linked to that lists the it tallies, the categories of organ system reports by numbers. So you could see a bunch of macro numbers. You could see you could search by element, all of the you that feel like you have some sort of element. So we already have the Pfizer document from the FDA in the USA, much earlier in February of 2021, where they list about 1400 or so elements, again, many serious rare elements that they were seeing. This is a little bit more detailed. It tallies the exact number. And again, this is just what they had reported to them. But the point is, this is Pfizer themselves, a confidential Pfizer document that the European medicine agency order release. It only came to light it circulated on the internet. I don't even know the first person to release this document. Maybe it was last month. I found it. It looks like no one else really did. Maybe someone else didn't write about it. I can't find it. But the point is, this was the cumulative observational adverse events they had through July 2022. That's almost a year ago. They were sitting on this. Now, imagine all the months subsequent to that, because only recently that a lot of the mandates fell, they had all these mandates and everything, but we're well beyond the mandates. This is straight up genocide. And how we cannot have a reckoning is just unreal. But anyway, I made a little bit of a mistake in not being clear in this piece, because there was a certain analysis and I'm about to mention that was done based off of a tranche of 1.6 million adverse events. But that was just a certain analysis portion of it. The total amount of AEs that they observed was 4.9, 4.96 million, just shy of 5 million. So they knew about 5 million adverse events, many of them serious and rare, spanning the gambit of 10,000 at least somewhere between 10 and 11,000. I haven't tallied it up completely. 10, 11,000 categories of ailments, the breath of scope of injuries. And again, it's nothing we didn't know from theirs, from all the case studies, from everything. But the point is this is Pfizer's document. This is what Pfizer was observing the entire time. They were observing the entire time and the FDA knew about it, the European Medicines Agency knew about it, the British equivalent knew about it, and they said nothing. I didn't estimate and trying to find it here that if you were to read a quick 200 words per minute, and that's very quick. I'm just estimating because it's hard to know because each ailment, some are three words, some are five or six words, but a very conservative estimate, it would take Pfizer at least three hours to read the disclaimer with all the categories of known potential AEs in a commercial that they've been running on taxpayer blood and money, but of course have not been disclosing this. And again, this is part of the prep act in the 1986 act needs to be repealed. Shockingly, we do not have a bill introduced in Congress yet. It's unreal. It would take over three hours for them to read something like that. I mean, you know, you typically have pharmaceutical drugs that you often have the disclaimer of the ed longer than the portion of the ed that's promoting it. And mind you, a lot of these things are it's not that it's 100% proven they cause it, but any signals they see, you have to put it. So that they've not the fed that that that that's a part it's not proven. It doesn't work that way, buddy. Now, first of all, by now it is proven with the mechanism of action and all the studies of the macro data, there's seven different ways that it all coalesces around the same thing. But the point is Pfizer knew this. And the point is, even without all that stuff, it's guilty until proven innocent. When you see within that window, and again, the ones reported to Pfizer are overwhelmingly going to be immediate. The long-term ones, no one reports it. They don't even realize it's happening. It's woefully underreported, obviously, but they had a database of five million as of last July. The report was issued August 19th. The reporting was through July and they knew about this. And yet not only is it not taken off the market, and heck, people are still being pressured in some cases, discriminated against for not getting it even now. Not only are people from Pfizer and FDA not in jail, but they were rewarded for lying and covering up five million AEs with approval of their next rushed prima facia dangerous vaccine, the RSV shot. So, we want to delve into some of these numbers and what needs to be done in the sense of urgency we need to have. And we can't be, yeah, I know, I know in a few years from now, everyone will be saying this, but we can't always be three years behind the curve. We have to fight it at the time it matters. Now, speaking of fighting at the time it matters, folks, increasingly, when you're stuck in a BLM situation with a jail-braked criminal targeting you and your loved one, you need to be able to pull that trigger effectively, efficiently, and not miss. When it comes to handgun defense, you need to practice. Practice is very expensive because ammo is expensive. That's why I recommend I target pro. What is I target pro? It's recommended by law enforcement for dry fire practice. You put a dummy bullet in your gun and you and they have for all calibers from 9 millimeter 45 cal, 223 for rifle. So, you could do rifle rounds as well. And you could use their boards, their app, and they also have the iTarget Cube, which is the next generation. It's fully compatible with your existing laser bullets. And you could station different cubes throughout your house and do clearing drills. And it will on the app track your accuracy and time. So, this is a fun way to practice. Again, make sure to follow all the safety regulations shooting the safe direction, not have anyone else within the line of fire and don't have real ammo with you. Right now, save 10% plus free shipping with the offer code CR when you go to the letter I target pro.com. That's itarget pro.com. Offer code CR 10% off plus free shipping. So, pretty much after one practice, that's going to get you enough savings that you're pretty much going to save the cost of your purchase with preventing you from going to the range one time and putting about 200 rounds down range, about 100 bucks there. So, this is really, it also makes a great Father's Day gift. I don't know if it would come in time now. But in general, if you're looking for a great dead gift, a husband gift for you women out there, this is a great, great gift. As long as you own some sort of firearm, you know, just know the caliber and again, go to itarget pro.com offer code CR. So, folks, number one, we find that 35% of all their AEs were deemed as serious by Pfizer. So, that in itself is a huge, huge problem. And again, they saw all of this from day one. We talked about this before, both Pfizer and the FD and CDC, forget about January 2021, August 2020, they were contracting with general dynamics to run the Verre system, expecting thousands of entries per day. They knew what this would do. And I have more stuff I can't talk about, but that's that's going to come down the pipeline. They knew. But, but, so, so there's a safety signal of the amount of AEs you have, but then there's a separate distinct safety signal of the percentage of whatever AEs you have that are serious, because that shows there's something really wrong. Because typically, yeah, you you you screw with the body with anything, even something that's generally safe, you'll have some diarrhea, you have a little queasiness from things where we know what our common side effects, um, blurred vision to a certain extent and certainly headaches. When you start seeing these rare, vascular and flamatory, nervous system, auto, antibody type of things, it's like, what the freakin heck? The, the point is you can't miss this. My occur, Ditis is just the tip of the iceberg. There's over 500 categories with a greater safety signal. This is not from the Pfizer document, but it reaffirms it. It's from, from various, from CDC's own analysis of various, by the way, courtesy of Professor Josh Goodsko, who found this in, in Foyas. So the breath of this and the scope of it is astounding. It's not like, oops, you know, throughout history, we kind of missed a safety signal. This tends to do this to your liver. It tends to, you know, it's kind of like one pathway. This thing screws up every corner of your body. It's nuts. Women reported aes at three times the rate of men. That also is a huge red flag when, when you see such a big gender divide, like what, what, what's it doing there? 60% of cases were reported with either outcome unknown or not recovered. Meaning it wasn't known if they recovered or they definitively did not recover. People like Matted Gary. So many of these injuries were not transient. And again, this is another thing with like, Daniel, I thought for a pod that you didn't prove to me, I made dang. Again, that's not the standard for pharmacovigilance. What's the purpose of pharmacovigilance if you're going to even ignore it? And it's not just like you ignore it for a couple of weeks with the intent of doing autopsies and following up and affirming or denying the safety signal, we're on three years and they won't affirm it or deny it. But, but here's the kicker, the highest number of cases occurred in those age 31 to 50 and 92% did not have comorbidities. So it makes it extremely unlikely to suggest it's just incidental. So just here, here's some top lines I that I just gleaned from this. Pfizer was aware of 73,542 cases of 264 categories of vascular disorders. Again, many of them extremely rare. The breath and scope of this is astounding. Hundreds. I don't know the exact number because it's like a bunch of pages. I want to guess 400 500 categories worth of nearly 700,000 cases of nervous system disorders. And this is this is really where you start getting into long term things, you know, anything that's going to be stroke related, auto immune, just just crazy. And by the way, I don't know if I mentioned this before, but one of the things I looked for is is the case of Manny DeGary. So it's chapter 16, my book. If you haven't gotten stolen, uh, rise of the fourth Reich, it's chapter 16. Manny DeGary was diagnosed. It took, it took many years to diagnose her because doctors wouldn't want to diagnose because they don't get reimbursed. So they had to go without insurance and just, you know, pay out of cash. They finally got a diagnosis of chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy. And it's basically an extremely rare disorder of your nervous system attacking the body. And that's why she's wheelchair, brown, bound, trouble breathing, swallowing. I mean, it's, it's really bad news. I found they knew about 68 cases of that. And again, that's going to be all these things are going to be woefully underreported. You know, obviously out of the five million, you're going to have a couple of incidentals, a couple of random things that are not from the vaccine, but it's overwhelmingly um, overcompensated for a net underreporting of all the things that did happen that certainly uh, are from the vaccine that never got into them. And the longer you get outside the window, the more people just don't report it, don't even realize it. All of you guys that email me every day about how you're certain you have a family member that it's obvious to you. It's from the vaccine, but to them, you know, they don't realize it. You have 61,500 AEs from well over 100 categories of eye disorders. Again, when do you ever see something like that? But that's again, the lipid nanoparticles breaking the hardest, most impervious, God designed blood barriers and all different barriers in your body that this thing allows the mRNA to get the immune system response in every last aspect of your body. And that's the key. The key is that, and we're going to have all the documentation eventually that they knew from long before a single person got this, that it didn't stay in your shoulder muscle and the LNP's created inflammation in a wake of destruction wherever it went, which is everywhere. And similarly, 47,000 ear disorders, I saw 16,000 cases of tinnitus, right? This even the Mayo Clinic admits very common. We see this all over the place. And it's, and I don't know, I don't have it in front of me now, how many designated serious they might not designate that as serious. But for a lot of people, their life is over. I mean, if you have, if it doesn't go away, I mean, tinnitus is really bad. There were roughly 225,000 cases of skin and tissue disorders, 190,000 cases of respiratory disorders, over 178,000 cases of reproductive or breast disorders, including, and then also on the male side to 506 cases of erectile dysfunction. I'm just, just, these are just, I mean, you can go through it and let me know what you find. I haven't had time, but I've seen like even a couple cases of male breast cancer. Again, and the point of this rare, these rare disorders is because God created your body that there's a lot of things that it's hard for bad stuff to get to. The Pfizer shots were created to ensure that as many bad things could get to as many places that it shouldn't get to. And it was done on purpose. There's no way it wasn't. You couldn't create this if you tried by accident or if you didn't try. Now, we've talked also a lot about Dr. McCullough has led on this that there's people that are just nuts after they get the shot. Meaning when you say you have a neurological disorder, it's like physical where they get, you know, like a stroke or dizziness, demyelination or whatever. But he's noticed that there's just psychotic episodes afterwards. They have 77,000 cases of psychiatric disorders. I mean, this is Pfizer's confidential document. Don't shoot the messenger. 3,711 cases of tumors. And this is a big deal because again, cancer is going to be one of these things that is is going to be very rarely traced back. You just don't because it's like you don't feel well the next day you feel paralyzed. Okay. So that you'll be more likely to report back. But cancer is not something you in your own mind, much less the doctor, anyone else is going to trace back to the vaccine. So that is a massive signal, even though it's not like a gargantam number, 3,700. That's, that's huge. That's more than theirs. Obviously, as expected, there were over 127,000 cardiac disorders running the gambit of about 270 different categories of heart disorders, much more than just myocarditis, pericarditis, all sorts of things that, you know, cardiologists will tell you they don't see too often. 100,000 blood and lymphatic disorders. And again, obviously there's a wealth of literature on all of this stuff. And then I saw and I'm trying to see the number in front of me. And I'll dig this up, but congenital defects, like birth defects. That's a really, I mean, this is another one of those things that if you mentioned to people, they'll say that's a conspiracy theory. And yet Pfizer's own. So before that, I just, I'm jumping around here, almost 20,000 cases of gastrointestinal pain. So that, that's a little bit more than just, you know, a stomachache or diarrhea. But I'm trying to find here congenital, familial and genetic disorders. 1,143. Again, that's similar to cancer, because that's really removed. That's a delay in the pregnancy. And then that's a new life. The baby, when you start seeing him, I don't even know what to say with, we can't, we knew this before. But the point is this is, this is not even a government document. I mean, the government ordered it, but it's Pfizer's document. This should be like blowing the roof off of every investigative to Corey committee in, in, in the house. But instead we got nothing. They're focused on yesterday's battle with the school closures. And they think this is over. But obviously this is not over. Now, I want to see some more specifics, but I like what I heard from Governor DeSantis. It wasn't on the campaign trail. It was some, he was signing the budget. It was a, it was a, you know, state official business. And it's about two minute clip we'll play here, two minutes of it. It's a little bit longer. He was asked about the grand jury. And he starts about talking about that and a few other things. Let's take a listen to the governor here. If you look at those studies that were provided in, in December of 2020, they said you had 100% effectiveness with M NRA COVID Jabs. That is not true. We know it's not true. How do we know? Because we had so many people get it and then you had Delta variant, you had all this stuff happening. And they've never been honest about any of this stuff. And I think Florida's Department of Health is the only one that's even looked at any of the incidents like myocarditis. We've seen an increase in Florida, particularly with men under the age of 40. So that's just the reality. And I think the idea that somehow you just sweep everything under the rug when people were not told the truth, that doesn't fly. So Florida, we're going with this. There is going to be action. I am not involved in it because it's a secret proceeding. You know, unlike feds, we don't leak this stuff. So it's actually going on. They're doing it and they're following the rules. And so, and I can't be involved in it. And so it's happening. So you're going to see stuff with that. But, you know, what I've said in Washington is, you know, we need a reckoning about what happened during COVID with this federal government because they underwrote, they supported policies that were destructive to this country. And they did it without remorse. They have not made mistakes, whether it's lockdowns, whether it's masking. There was a U.S. congressman just the other day on the house floor saying that he regretted that two year olds weren't forced to wear masks more during during the pandemic. So these people have not learned any lessons and make no mistake, if we don't bring accountability to bear on Fauci on CDC, on NIH, on all these on all these corrupted institutions, they are going to do it again. The folks first, um, well, let me start backwards. He calls for a reckoning. They will do it again. He referenced the congressman. That was Jerry Nadler, the ranking Democrat on judiciary. DeSantis served with him when he was in on judiciary in Congress. Jerry Nadler, I don't know how I'm trying to get it here. It was a brief clip. He basically said that there was no bill on ending mask mandates. God forbid your Republicans actually do that. The bill was on the reigns act. So the reigns act says that any regulation that the government makes up has to come before Congress for approval, right? I mean, I think it's something we all agree on. And they were trying to give examples of how many like life saving amazing things that the executive wants to do that would be impeded. And he brought up the mass mandate and he said, he literally said two year olds need to be masked to this day. That's what these guys believe that they will do it when they get the opportunity. And we still have not put in place ways of stopping this. So they're not done with that. Moreover, they're on to bigger and better things. I don't think they'll do a full scale lockdown. That was done one time so that now in the future, they could remind people, Hey, do you want that to happen? So here is what you need to do. Vaccines, surveillance, tracking that other stuff, the cards and everything, the biomedical security surveillance state, they might not do a full bore lockdown again, because they can't get away with it, but they don't need to. But masking could still be a part of that. Now, you know, we've been calling for various policy riders to be put into must pass authorization bills like the FAA and NDAA, as well as the appropriation bills. Now, some of it, I do have to say I have seen they are putting some of this stuff in. Now, the key element will be do they stand behind it in September? Or do they cave and wind up, you know, signing a bargain that doesn't do it. But I want to give a shout out to the Freedom Caucus Chairman Scott Perry, who is a member of the transportation and infrastructure committee. They held a markup on the FAA reauthorization bills. Another thing considered a, you know, federal aviation, considered a must pass bill. And one of the things we were calling for an FAA re-off is to ban the FAA from ever having vaccine and mask mandates on pilots, on passengers. And he did get that in there by one vote. It did pass in at a committee into the bill. So that will go to the floor with that in there. And we have to make sure they stand behind that. But this reckoning, I mean, look at the contrast between the Santas and Trump on that. There will needs to be a reckoning. They will do this again. And the first part, and I didn't play all of it, he talks about the grand jury. Now, a lot of people have been pinging me and I see a lot of people asking, hey, Daniel, it's been about five months or whatever it's been or maybe four months since they've sat. They were, they started in February. Hey, you know, I'm not, I'm not hearing anything. Was this just a gimmick or just a talking point? So, you know, you hear the governor mention that legally, he cannot be involved and he cannot leak. And unlike, you know, Alvin Bragg and the feds, he's not going to sit and leak stuff. He's going to follow the law. That's what he said. But I have other information. I, and I will make sure to say, no one in the governor's office or the attorney's general Moody's office gave it to me because they wouldn't. I happen to know people from Florida in the vaccine injured community. And I'm just going to say they are very heavily involved as witnesses, as victims, as well as their doctors and their lawyers. And they are working very heavily with the attorney general's office. So this thing is very deep. And I'm just going to tell you, the point of the grand jury is not to replicate what people like myself and smarter people and Dr. McCulloch and Jessica Rose have been doing for the last two plus years. Here's information. Here's information. That's, that's nice. It is to go to the next level on taking people who directly died and got injured by very specific ailments caused by very specific things that can be traced back to provable malfeasance and willfulness conduct of how Pfizer knew about that and hit it. That, remember, this is a criminal proceeding. Now, it could be investigatory. As the governor said, it's both. They don't have to issue criminal indictments against specific people. And I don't have information on that. Like, is there a Pfizer executive living in Florida? I don't, the jurisdiction issues, you know, how exactly that will, you know, take what's the punchline going to be. But at a minimum in terms of policy recommendations, similar to the one on human trafficking with illegal aliens, you will have, all I'm just trying to tell you is, I found out about it in a way that's totally legal and it has nothing to do with the governor's office or the attorney's general office. I could assure you there's a lot going on there. This is a big deal. So that will be important. And I wanted to, you know, as soon as I was able to find out information to convey that, at least in general terms, that I am very happy about what I'm hearing. But I'm not going to delve into the kind of, you know, specific people who, what, where, when, why, I will just say that obviously some of the experts that will sign off on the testimony will be people that you're familiar with, as well as, you know, some new people as well. So that's what's going on in that world. There's just a couple more nuggets of information. The week ending May 26 in the UK. So this is the most recent data. Nobody's getting new shots. So when you're talking about this, you are talking, again, all of this Holocaust level, known degree of injury is short term, a short term. When you're talking about the last few months, you're talking about long term, because they're very unlikely to be driven by people who just got the shot. The number of deaths for the week just ended, the young, two weeks ago, three weeks ago, May 26, week 21 of this calendar year in the UK, the number of deaths in private homes. This is a very important is 17.3% above the five year average. Whereas in hospitals, it's only 6.3% above. So, so almost three times greater at home. And again, that has the COVID shots written all over it well beyond anything that the losers will want to say, because the other things will be more like, yeah, you know, you create long term hard damage or this or that. This is boom. It suddenly gets you. It travels all over the body, or it could suddenly you have several mechanisms. We talked about how the either the DNA itself is still there to produce more mRNA or the mRNA is still there and could produce a spike at any given time and just strike you down. It's this sudden death. Nothing else could explain that. You could say like, you know, that there's a legacy from the lockdown of long term neglected care, but you wouldn't find such sudden deaths at home. Most people nowadays die in a hospital. So, you know, unless it's planned hospice, but that's likely I can't prove it, but that's when you find, you know, just one in a one in a million event like this, it's not going to be driven by excess hospice. It's going to be something anomalous like sudden deaths. So that's written all over it. And then they have other settings. I don't know what that means, but it's non hospital. So 15.8% so similar. So again, it's a lot higher over all the number of deaths registered in the UK was 9.4% above the five year average. That is still going on. But there's only one man calling for a reckoning. And one man believes that this was the greatest thing ever. No one that no one's ever been injured. So this is something we need to demand. And again, I want to reiterate, aside from the HHS appropriations, that's going to oversee NIH CDC FDA, FDA, BARDOP. You also do have the agriculture appropriations, which is going to cover the FDA. And we need our policy writers on that. And then obviously, pop off the pandemic and hazard preparedness authorization act that expires. And we need to make sure that that is not taken off. That is not authorized until this is dealt with multiple ways. Like for example, one of the things it does is it oversees the national vaccine stockpiles. Every COVID shot needs to be destroyed from the vaccine stockpile. Again, I mean, we should be well beyond destroying it. We should be like putting people on jail and making sure this doesn't happen again. But I would note that what is so astounding here is that the same Pfizer, could you imagine covering up 5 million known degree of serious rare categories every organ system? And they give them a new rushed shot with prima facia, more death and injury and reproductive problems. By the way, premature births and urinero deaths in their own trial data versus placebo for their RSV shot. A rushed shot in 18 months. A known problematic shot for for half a century. And there is no backstop. There is no reckoning because there is no sense of urgency, just like there's no sense of urgency to deal with the green new deal and the irreparable assault on our way of life, our prosperity, our ability to live freely. The border, the grooming of our children by the year, the percentage being born into not or reared into thinking there's opposite gender. It is truly unbelievable. Truly, truly unbelievable. One other document here from Pfizer. This is an FDA briefing document prepared September 17, 2021 for the vaccine and related verbac. That's the FDA advisory committee, not CDC's but the FDA. But this was Pfizer's data. And I note at the time, okay, there's nothing new to you guys. But again, this is their own briefing document at the time the FDA and CDC started mandating. That's when the A approved commodity and B mandated it in the military and healthcare workers, government workers, private contractors, and then signaled to every employer to do it. I'm going to read you straight up. Among 18,727 study participants originally randomized to BND, Yabba Dabba do the Pfizer shot. On average, about a 10 month follow-up period. There were 70.3 cases of COVID per thousand person years, because they extrapolated for person years. In the trial, meaning 70.3 per thousand COVID cases per thousand person years, among the COVID people, among the Pfizer people compared to 51.6, 51.6 cases per thousand among those assigned to the randomized placebo. They knew in their briefing document while they were deciding to mandate it. They knew from Pfizer's own data. Okay, this is not now. This is almost two years ago. They knew the more you inject, the more you infect. And that's statistically very significant. That's almost a third more. Okay. What is that? I mean, do the math there in 28% or so off the top of my head, more cases of COVID in the trial group than the placebo group. That is unfreaking believable. That is unreal. Again, it's vaccine and related biological products, advisory committee meetings, September 17th FDA briefing document application for licensure of a booster dose for community. So we're going to say, get another dose. Yes, the more you inject the more you infect. Imagine you have the more you inject, the more you infect as a pretext to go ahead and say we now need another dose. I mean, I will tell you my book is, is pathetic. Rise of the fourth Reich. Like it needs to be rewritten. It doesn't, it doesn't capture the extent of the willful genocide. There is no other way around it. The only thing I'm shocked about is here we are in June 2023. And there is no impetus. I promise you, it will not get done in Congress. And it's not being done in almost every state legislature and governor. And for that reckoning alone is why I think it's so important to support DeSantis. For that reckoning alone, even though largely I want to focus on national divorce rather than somehow trying to fix the federal government, I think I'll do a hundred times better job than Trump, but I still don't know, you know, you're really going to fix the federal government. We need to protect ourselves from it. But again, as I said, having a national voice with power to do that is going to be important. Now, one more important thing, and I think this could be done at a state level too. So we talk a lot about the pandemic treaty, the international health regulations that are coming down the pipeline. But we have here an interstate, forget about the WHO, but within the states, an interstate compact to synergize and ratify and codify gubernatorial emergency powers of public health. In other words, what everything that they illegally did in the states, they want to have a compact to bring it under the color of law and ratify that yes, you can do this. We talked a lot about with the digital currency and cryptocurrency, the uniform law commission, the ULC, and they're very well respected because they do a lot of much needed coordination of state policies. So we have, we don't have chaos and contract law and things like that, which everyone agrees is necessary. And it's very well regarded. And it's everything they do is accepted. You know, and when they have a draft legislation that they send to the states, as we saw with the cryptocurrency provision where they wanted to basically, you know, grease the skids for our national digital currency and exclude cryptocurrency from an option that would be legal legal tender before the South Dakota Freedom Caucus raised awareness to it. No one knew about it, even good people. And you know, all these states, they're going to support it. And then, you know, we pressured Christie known to veto as she did, Governor DeSantis got ahead of it and a couple others. And you know, we defeated in most places in North Dakota, dirtbag, Governor Governor Bergam actually signed it. And he's now running for president. People need to know that. So they, this comes from David's wag. He is, he has a sub stack that's independent, but he actually wrote for that Atlantic. And he was one of the few with kind of a mainstream journalistic pedigree that was very good on COVID. He did a lot of good investigatory work. So ever since 2021, in response to COVID, they've been working on a draft model public health emergency authority act. And he notes that they are working, they have a memo that indicates that the ULC expects the adoption of this act will result in people suing only if the act itself wasn't followed, rather than suing based on the claim that the governor's actions were unconstitutional. So what it does is it's not like designed to, oh, you know, we don't like everyone doing health or skeletal, just these governors doing what they want. They want to make it more legally acceptable for the governors to do lockdowns, tracing, tracking, control, all that stuff. So that's what it does. The act threatens to strip Americans of their legal ability to oppose mandates, lockdowns or other government orders. It offers total deference to governors in deciding what constitution and emergency. No evidence would be required for state leaders to impose arbitrary and irrational limits on human liberty. Schools, businesses, churches would be subject to the whims of executive authority and and all of that. And they're meeting in July and they're going to vote to adopt it. Now their vote itself is meaningless. But what is meaningful is once they send their draft, if if people don't know about it, even conservatives, they see anything with ULC, oh, they're just kind of synergizing things. No, at a time when we need to abolish these powers, they want to basically synergize it. And you know, it will basically give the governor like 90 days to issue 90 day lockdowns and and all this stuff. And then he could totally extend that pretty much indefinitely. The emergency could be 90 days and he could repeatedly renew it every 90 days without limitation, as long as written notice is provided to the legislature. And the legislature has an opportunity to be in session, meaning not that it has to get approval by the legislature. It's unbelievable. It's unreal. So if you, you could tell they have to give like a certain bone. So they didn't want to say the governor could do whatever he wants, but that is what it does. So they have this fake provision. Oh, it's 90 days. Oh, but he could renew it indefinitely. Now, in order to kind of, you know, nuance that they say, well, you know, you have to literally, you were written notice while the legislature's in session, it is unreal. Every Republican governor needs to be informed of this. Call your state legislature, even if they're not in session. We talk about this all the time. They're not just a vote. They're a voice. You get 20 of the best conservatives in your right state chamber by camera Lee to put to write a letter to the governor and say this garbage is dead on arrival. I'll try to put out a piece on this that you guys could pass around. But again, what are we talking about with this, with the pandemic treaty? Get ahead of the issue. Don't fight an issue only after it's too late. And we are late into the game with a lot of this stuff. And I'll just close with the transgender stuff. We really have a window, even the left and the media is talking about it. Oh my gosh, the polling's going the other way. The pushback. Now is not the time to go for, you know, little, little place here and there. You can't afford that. You can't limit it to female sports. We could live without female sports. We can't live with 50% of children thinking they can be the opposite gender. Thinking it's normal for this androgynous society and everything that comes with that. Okay. See, that's what the Bruce Jenner, Rick Grinnell, Mar-a-Lago, Carrie Lake, I hate to say, orbit is trying to push on you. That, hey, you know, let's just not do the castration of minors. Let's not screw up female sports, but absolutely gender is fluid. And, and you know, the same way they wrongly set it with homosexuality. They take every licentious behavior. And now that's an immutable character trait, like being born with blue eyes with bond hair with whatever. That is an immutable trait. And you have to respect that and promote it. And, and again, they, they're engaging in their own form of grooming of getting conservatives to accept that as the new normal. No, no. It's fine if you have extra allies fighting against the castration for minors, but you cannot allow it to stop there. And it's, this is true for every issue. We need to, we have never been at a crossroads like this where we face such peril on the one hand. But on the other hand, because the left has overplayed their hands so much, precisely because they've had no opposition, so they had no reason to do it. If we actually created a monocum of opposition at this point, the sky is the limit to how much we could stop. We need to utilize the strategies, the leverage points, the bills, the ideas, the talking points, all of it together with a sense of urgency. To fight the issues now as they actually still matter.

Doesn't have to be something long, but just a couple sentences really helps with the algorithm. We need to get this word out. That's what we're going to do, provide unique information. I'm not going to, you know, if you notice my shows this week because I tell about what that down, that, okay, so what are you going to do about it? Okay, what are you going to do about it? And that's what we're going to talk about. What we're going to do about it. Until tomorrow, God bless you all. Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind Today at blazedtv.com slash The Blind."
