    "text": " As it going people, I am Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report Direct message for February 24th, 2021. And my entire team for the last 10 minutes just had an insane laughing fit. I feel like I have tears in my eyes still at the moment because someone sent me something that was absolutely hilarious. A former sitcom star sent me something that was incredibly funny and we had to debate for 10 minutes whether we could play it, the video, because it would bring down the angry cancel people on me. I don't think I'm going to play it today, but I think we may play it tomorrow because it's not. All right, we got a great show for you today. You know, yesterday's show, I did four stories and it was just like endless stupidity after endless stupidity about the media and Fauci and masks and lockdowns and everything else. So I thought today we're just going to mix it up a little bit differently and try to hit a few different things. But there's just so much stupidity out there. And I hope that if you give me this 20 to 30 minutes a day, that you feel a little less dumb, because as I tell people all the time, if you're watching CNN, it's either making you dumber or angrier, like who's watching an hour of Don Lemon and comes off feeling smarter or more enlightened. You pretty much feel dumber or angrier and that goes for Cuomo and pretty much all of it. So I hope that we don't do that around here and that this is worthy of your time, which I sense that it is by reading your comments and hearing from you guys. Quick reminder guys, you can get $30 off your Blaze subscription, your annual subscription. This ends. This sale ends on Friday night, February 26 and just a couple of days, just go to blazetv.com. You don't even have to enter a code and you're good to go. The four stories that we're going to hit today, first off, the Guardian posted a hit piece on me yesterday. It's been a while since I've had a mainstream hit piece calling me far right, but they did it. And we're going to talk about that. What's old is new again. How nice. It's been a while. I was kind of feeling left out. Nobody's called me alt right or far right or well, the usual Twitter losers do, but I mean, I haven't had like a mainstream media go for it in a while. So that was kind of refreshing. Also are we going to ban grand theft auto because of auto thefts? Well, we'll find out. Biden's trans health and human sex human services secretary is now advocating for puberty blockers on young teens, which this is obviously one of the issues that even though it affects just an obscenely tiny amount of people, that's not to diminish the importance of dealing with who you are and all that kind of stuff. For some reason, the trans issue seems to be paramount on everything else. And I think there is really linchpin of why everything is so out of whack culturally. And then finally, you may remember two weeks ago, we did a couple episodes where I showed you throwback clips to Ronald Reagan on the Johnny Carson Tonight Show and people really loved it. Because I felt like it frames a little bit about today by seeing something from the past. So there's a clip that's been going viral on Twitter for the last couple of days from Ron Paul. You guys know Ron Paul, the former congressman from Texas, who also was the founder of the Tea Party. And he's been basically the leading light of libertarianism in America for the last couple of decades. He was on the Morton Downey Jr. show in the mid-late 80s, I would say this was. And get got into a little fracas with somebody. And it's just worth watching because it makes you realize that the things that we're dealing with now, although they seem crazier and at some level, they are, especially when, you know, I just mentioned this trans issue, like when we see these things that start really sort of spinning out of control, everything seems crazy. But it's good to look at some of the stuff in the past and realize, oh, people have been fighting about all of these ideas forever. So we're going to cover all four of those before I get to it, people, I want to talk to you. What about Bill Barr, the former attorney general, I want to talk to you about Bill Barr. I've got the coconut almond in my hand right now. If you're having trouble avoiding leftover candy from Valentine's Day, I've got just the solution for you.

So there was a hit piece. It's been a while. It's good to be back everybody. There was a hit piece written in the Guardian and it was basically about Sky News Australia. Now one of the hosts at Sky News Australia is a friend of mine and a former guest on the show. Her name is Rita Panahi. Rita was actually born in the US but grew up in Iran. I had her on the show years ago. I've done her show in Australia a couple of times when I was on tour with Jordan Peterson in Australia. I did her show in studio. I've done it on Skype. A few times Rita is an incredible voice for what I would say is old school liberalism. If you want to call it current day conservatism but individual rights, freedom, free press, open inquiry, all of those things that are now thought of as far right and all right ideas, right? So I love Rita. I think she's an actual journalist, which is very rare these days. She's an excellent writer also. And I highly recommend you follow her on Twitter. I think it's just at Rita Panahi. But in any event, she hosts a show that she's one of several hosts I believe called Sky After Dark. And this is where they interview all sorts of people from all over the world. And I've been on this show a couple of times. And we talk about the usual stuff that I talk about here. In any essence, the show is obviously picking up some steam. And as you know, Australia is having all sorts of crackdowns on things right now. You probably heard over the last few days, Facebook has taken out a ton, a ton of free thought and libertarian leaning and even centrist, basically non-woke Facebook pages have been annihilated off Facebook. So they're having major censorship problems. They're having all sorts of lockdown problems like we're having here in the United States and everything else. But obviously the show Sky After Dark is picking up some steam because what happens once you start doing something sort of outside of the mainstream and even though Sky News is a giant corporation, you know, there's always sort of shows on these networks that are a little outside of the mainstream, right? Remember Red Eye on Fox News? That's where Gutfeld sort of got his start and it was like, it was like, whoa, these guys, these guys even realize they're on cable TV? Well, there are shows that are a little looser, a little more fun. Anyway, I don't want to make it all about the show. In any event, I've done the show a couple of times. And the title, what was the title of the article? Do we have the title here? It was Sky News Australia is tapping into the global conspiracy set and it's paying off. Very, very scary stuff. And then here's the quote about me, which I just thought was great. I hate to, I hate to make the news about me, but I just thought this perfectly illustrates like the never ending nonsense that we're all kind of dealing with these days. Quote, the sky after dark team also regularly interviews far right figures who have big social media followings in their own countries. Recent interviews have included the reform UK parties Nigel Farage, Katie Hopkins, the UK commentator who was banned from Twitter for hate speech and US political commentator and YouTube personality Dave Rubin. Now first off, Nigel, I like Nigel. I got drunk with Nigel in the morning once in the UK in London. That was fun. We had a couple of big gin and tonics. And then I gave his speech over at Oxford Union, the most important speech of my life, which I actually think I nailed even though I was a little buzzed and knocked back like three shots of espresso right before I did it. You can find that online if you just search my name and just search Dave Rubin Oxford Union. Anyway, Katie Hopkins I've also had on the show. She's a bit of a flamethrower for sure. No doubt about it. But and US political commentator and YouTube personality Dave Rubin and they are describing us all as far right. Now that's all it says about me in the article. It does not go into any, not even one of my political beliefs, my far right political beliefs. Dave, right? Oh, book. I've got it back there defending old school liberalism. Anyway, I only mentioned this not even really because I care. You know, years ago when these things would happen all the time, right? They were always happening to Jordan and they were happening to Ben Shapiro and they were happening to Sam Harris and a whole crew of people. It's like we all get that the mainstream media is awful. And basically at this point, I mean, they've done something so dangerous here because they've really cried wolf to the point that when the wolf shows up, when the really far right person shows up and they will, by the way, and they exist obviously. And what I mean by that is someone forget far right specifically when the really racist person shows up, when the really xenophobic person shows up, when the, when the real authoritarian shows up, no one's going to listen anymore because you've run around and called people like Dave Rubin far right. So years ago when this was happening virtually every other day, there was a hit piece written about me on Mother Jones or Daily Beast or Huff Po or any of just these awful publications that are all now floundering, right? And we all know it. It used to, I used to feel like I had to fight it and I'd be arguing with Twitter people and usually, you know, tons of you guys would come to my defense, which was great. It's been a long time since one of these happened, probably about a year for me. So I just thought this was worth mentioning because maybe in your life, I suspect that you get it like when you were to come across an article like this and they just say someone's far right and they don't even say why they're far right or anything else. It's like, well, you know that, but it's important to really understand it so that when your friend says, when your friend sees scary Dave Rubin on your, on your iPhone, and goes, you listen to far right Dave Rubin, well, you have sort of the ammunition to go ahead and say, well, not only is he not far right and wrote a book defending liberalism, but this is the way that mainstream media deals with people they don't like. And that's really what this is about. By the way, I tweeted this morning, I found the author of the article. Sometimes these articles are completely anonymous. The author did have her Twitter name attached to it. So I did ask her to clarify her statements and let me know if I do hold any far right opinions. You're not going to believe it. I did not hear back from her. Okay. Anyway, moving on. I want to talk to you guys about N-Guard watches. I've got one on right now. It's pretty, it really is pretty beautiful. Look at this thing. Can you see this thing? It's really nice. The CEO of E-Guard watches has used the brand to make, to take a strong stance against censorship and continued lockdowns with incredibly powerful video, which with an incredibly powerful video called What is Freedom, which has gone viral.

Let's talk about Grand Theft Auto. Some guys know and I don't like to brag around here, but yes, I was assistant manager of electronics boutique, which is now known as GameStop, which of course became a huge Wall Street situation a couple of weeks ago. I was assistant manager of electronics boutique in Broadway Mall in Hicksville, Long Island in 1999. I moved a tremendous amount of red Pokemon, tremendous amount of yellow Pokemon. You could not get video games on Long Island if you didn't go through me. I know a little something about video games. Okay. Well, an Illinois Democrat by the name of Marcus Evans, he wants to ban Grand Theft Auto, claiming that Grand Theft Auto, the game that I'm guessing many of you have played. I used to have Grand Theft Auto Vice City. I think it was on PlayStation 1. And yes, you can, you can car jack somebody's driving down the street and you can just run into the street, stop their car, pull them out of the car, take the car. You can also punch hookers. You can blow up helicopters, all sorts of stuff. He seems to think that all of the bad stuff that you can do in that, you can shoot random people, you can steal things. Flame thrower is God only knows what else you can do. He's very worried that kids are playing that game and then going, you know, I just car jack in the game and I'm going to do a little car jacket in real life. By the way, there's no evidence before I even read the quote from the Daily Wire. There's no evidence that video games cause violence. This was a thing for many, many years. You guys may remember 20 years ago when it was Joe Lieberman and John McCain were leading this fight to get Mortal Kombat out of video game stores and then there was this huge, it was a really interesting thing. There was this really big fight between Sega and Nintendo when Mortal Kombat came out on the consoles because in the arcade there was blood everywhere. Sega said, yeah, we're going to leave the blood in. Nintendo wanted to be a little more family friendly. They got rid of the blood. But the point is, nobody in the name of Mortal Kombat ever froze somebody, then ripped their skull off with their spine attached to it and finished them. Nobody's done it. Nobody's done it. So video games don't cause violence. There's a lot of studies that prove it. If anything, they've proven that they actually lessen violence because you're able to get some of that angst and that rage and that stuff that we've all got. You're able to get it out of your system in a healthier way. But the Daily Wire did a piece on this. They said Chicago, Illinois has seen a spike in carjackings in 2021, even though carjackings in 2020 increased more than 135% compared to 2019. So 2020 went up 135% more than the year before to combat the spike that they're suddenly seeing again. An Illinois lawmaker has proposed banning grand theft auto a video game that has had a new entry in almost a decade. The Chicago Sun Times reported that Evans's new bill would amend the 2012 law to quote Bam the sale of anyone of video games depicting psychological harm, including motor vehicle theft with a driver or a passenger present. The bill would also amend the definition of what constitutes a violent video game to include one where players control a character within the video game that is encouraged to perpetuate human on human violence in which the player kills or otherwise causes serious physical or psychological harm to another human or an animal. Okay, so you can already see. I feel like I don't even need to explain this that thoroughly. Why this is completely ridiculous. Once you start saying the government should tell us what art we should watch, what video games we should play, what books we can read, what movies we can go to, you are opening a Pandora's box where the only thing that any of us will be allowed to do is sit in a dark room and stew in our own juices. And that's kind of what they want from us. So maybe that's where this is all going. It's not just that video games don't cause violence. It's that they are an escape as I just said. And the idea here, okay, we're human. You can't have human on human violence. Okay, goodbye call of duty. I mean, goodbye virtually every game. I mean, so what do you say? So Star Wars games because you got a wookie killing an e-walk. Is that all right or that's too much or you can have cartoon violence? Like it's all just, this is all just humans trying to manage the human mind. And it's simply not possible. Now in their defense, because I will give the devil his due, I had never, this is a fact, I had never eaten magic psychotropic mushrooms before I played Super Mario Brothers. Okay. So I got Super Mario Brothers. I was nine years old. It was 1985 and my buddy John got, he was the first one to get a bit NES Nintendo Entertainment System. And we saw Mario eating mushrooms and I had never eaten magical psychotropic psilocybin mushrooms until that point. I waited about 10 years and then when I was in college, I did try magic mushrooms. Is that directly related to Mario eating the mushrooms? I don't know. I don't know. Sonic the Hedgehog. I played a lot of Sonic the Hedgehog. I don't want to tell you what I did after playing Sonic the Hedgehog. You know what I mean? Okay. We've all made mistakes in life. But all right, I think you guys got my point. This is all just silliness. If you're watching this and you like to play video games, play video games. But don't blow up cars and don't steal things and punch hookers. I think that that suffices. I don't think we need a bill to say that. But you know, these people, they just want to manage every little part of your life when you can go out, who you can talk to, what you can say online, how many people can be at the restaurant you eat, what type of people can be at your house. And we track you all the time to see if you've gotten the vaccine. Are we going to make sure that you play Mario Brothers while sitting on a couch and not a chair? Like it's all just like endless silliness. And speaking of endless silliness, this woman, Rachel Levine, this is President Joe Biden's transgender health and human services pick. Well, a tweet from her from about a year ago, it's from January of last year has come out. And it's got some people kind of raising their eyebrows going, what exactly is going on here? So I want to throw to the tweet. And it's pretty interesting here. This is, as I said, just about a year ago, Dr. Rachel Levine, now Secretary Levine, a new study has found that transgender youth with access to a puberty blocker have declined in chances of suicide and mental health problems now and in the future. This study is important because it's the first to show this specific association. Let's leave the tweet up for just a second. First off, I just hate people that use the hashtags that way. It's like you're mocking yourself. Hashtag transgender, hashtag mental health. That's a little insider baseball for you on the on the Twitter side of things. But interesting. So in essence, what she's saying is that young children should have access to puberty blockers if they feel they are trans. Okay. Now we can have all sorts of debates about when and if children should be allowed to do this, do they, what age they should be at. I would highly recommend that you check out my interview from about two months ago with Abigail Shrier, who wrote a book called Irreversible Damage, where she uses data and facts to show you that there is actually an epidemic of young girls. It's mostly young girls transitioning to being boys and they're doing at increasingly younger ages. And then there are all sorts of regrets. There are all sorts of medical problems. There are all sorts of psychological problems. Now all of this, as I always say, is in no way an attack on the trans community. It is no way on an attack on anyone who wishes to live their life as they see fit, which I would always defend as long as they're doing it within the laws of the United States, obviously. But the idea that the person that is the assistant, what is she, the health and human services pick, Dr. Rachel, I mean, that this is an idea that they're going to be pushing that younger and younger people should transition, that we should give these people puberty blockers. This is seriously dangerous. We've got a quote here from the National Pulse, a professor of pediatrics and psychiatry at the Penn State College of Medicine. Levine has given lectures in various settings since at least 2012 on how to perform sex changes and gender conversion therapy on children. According to Levine, children ought to be given the latitude to choose their own gender. Levine has advised adults to try not to force them one way or one way or other and instead to follow the child's lead. That is deeply dangerous. Now I don't care that Rachel Levine is trans. I don't care. It is irrelevant. Now it's obviously why she got the job, right? Because we love diversity, right? We've got our gay secretary of transportation and Pete Buttigieg. It doesn't have any knowledge of transportation. It's irrelevant. He's gay and we've got our trans health woman over here. Okay. Let's put the identity politics behind what I don't like are her ideas. The quote that I just read right there that instead of it being up to the adults, we should follow the child's lead. You know that part of growing up in life is sort of figuring out what the world is and how you feel things and how those things that you feel kind of match up to the world. And that in many cases, there are, you might feel something when you're five years old and not feel it when you're 12. And in some cases, get this guys. You're going to think something at 18 that you won't think when you're 44. It's really crazy. But the idea that you would not, that you would take the capacity for the decision making about something that's like basically the most extraordinarily large existential issue that a person that a potentially trans person could face. And you would say, oh, the five year old should decide that. One of the other things about this that people don't really understand is how these are the same people who love to tell you that they're pro gay, right? They're pro gay people. But really, what are they saying? So now you've got a five year old who happens to be a feminine, let's say, happens to be a feminine and likes playing with Barbies instead of G.I. Joe's. Now, first off, the parents get a whole bunch of social cred, right? If they have a trans child, so they're going to sort of feel like, ooh, now they're going to get some sort of value in this crazy intersectional Olympics that is being played all the time. So they're going to kind of push their child to do it. But what you may actually have when you have, say, an effeminate boy is just an effeminate boy who perhaps will turn out to be gay. And if gay is okay, which that's what, well, certainly what I believe, but it's also what the lefties and the wokesters are always telling us, well, then it's perfectly fine to be an effeminate gay boy. And it's certainly fine to be, say, a butch young girl, right? Like we shouldn't be caring about all these stereotypes. But when she says, when Rachel Levine, who I'm using her preferred pronoun says, oh, we should leave it up to the child. Well, the child is going, okay, I have these parts. I like to play Barbie. I can just become a girl, like not having any clue of the problems, the medical procedures, the money, the psychological stuff, all of those things. But we should follow what the child says about this thing and not with parents' sake. And I would say this is just consistent with the sort of ridiculous woke equity policies that this government is throwing at us. And I do think that, as I said yesterday, more and more people are just going to start basically checking out of society in a certain way. More and more people are just going to be getting off the machines, figuring out how to educate their children, take care of their families, defend their property and things like that. Because the thing, the thing itself ain't working anymore, right? Like the thing itself, any given day, wear masks, don't wear masks, stay in your house, don't stay in your house, transition your child, don't play video games. It's all like, it's this weird cocktail of lunacy that we're all negotiating with all the time. This is actually very much what my next book is going to be about, which I'm working on right now. Okay, I want to do one more for you. And this is going to be the throwback. I am going to keep trying to do these because I think it helps us frame the present when we look to the past. So Ron Paul, libertarian tea party guy Ron Paul, who I had on the show about a month ago, he was on the... Wait, what? Oh, this was on. The Morton Downey Jr. show. I was going to say the Morrie show. No, this is Morton Downey Jr. show back in the mid-80s. If you don't remember Morton Downey Jr. if you're a little younger than an old timer like me, this, you got to, after this on YouTube, just Google Morton Downey Jr. show. This show was wild. There was this guy here, these really big teeth and he was very loud and very boisterous and angry, sort of a precursor to Trump in a certain way. And he would chain smoke on the show all the time. And he'd bring on all sorts of people to yell at each other and they'd argue about race and they'd argue about politics and the audience would be screaming. Like in many ways, the reason I was going to say it was the Morrie show is like the Morrie show became this thing about, oh, who's the baby's daddy kind of thing. And then, you know, there was all the other daytime talk shows and Jerry Springer showed people come out and punching each other. In many ways, this guy, Morton Downey Jr. he was the father to that. So he was on at the same time that Phil Donnie was on. Donnie, who was sort of the respected one. And then there was Morton Downey Jr. It was more the clownish one you might think of as the Trump of the situation. Anyway, he at times would have these really, really great political debates. And I remember watching this stuff as a kid. So this clip that I'm about to show you has been going viral last couple of days. And I want you to listen to Ron Paul and not only because he's saying the exact same things that he still says now, but you tell me if you think basically what he's saying is right or completely crazy and then just watch like the beautiful back and forth. It's such a great moment here. All right, take a look. Ask me why we still finance the communists. Ask me why 70% of the military budget is spent overseas. Ask me why the good airplanes are overseas and the lousy airplanes are not here in the lousy airplanes that are in these air national guard. I would say clean out the state department, spend more money on our national defense, have an anti-communist policy. Don't sign these treaties with the Soviet. Don't extend loans with the Soviet Union. And not to fight these wars with the funds raised from the illegal drugs. So under the libertarian society, no, we don't fight Vietnam wars. We don't fight the Korean wars. We fight wars to defend America and we stay for America. We stay for the United States. We get high. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. Second. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. First. first. First. Second. First. First. Second. Third. First. Second. First. Second. thighs. First. Third. Now, to Bo's hands, to a script of aboutuffedprop and Marching. kindergarten. We do it through music, a cartoon character call, little no no, the drug fighter. No one else in the United States is giving us a hand. It's a tyrannical approach to solving a social medical problem and we endorse the idea of volunteerism and self-responsibility family, friends and churches to solve problems rather than saying some monolithic government is going to make you take care of yourself and be a better person. It's a preposterous notion, it never works, it never will. The government can't make you a better person, can't make you follow good habits. Why don't they put you on a diet? You're a little overweight and I think it can be a better habit. You know, I'm tired of people like you. I'm tired of people like you using the constitution to do whatever you want to do. If we legalize drugs, we're giving up on the whole country. God, there's so much great stuff there. That line where he basically tells the fact I had to lose a little weight that the government can't do it. I mean, it's just perfect. The woman at the end there, I'm tired of people like you using the constitution and this bad wife. Anyway, I thought there's a lot there because it's like people were emotional, they're screaming. We're always told that things are so much worse now and we're more afraid and it kind of feels like that because of social media. But we've always been afraid. These are always the big issues of our time. But the interesting stuff there is at the beginning, you can see how consistent he is, right? Like he's absolutely consistent with his beliefs 30 years later, get out of wars. He wants to end the drug war. Now, the funny thing is they're all chanting just say no, which was the policy, obviously, of Nancy Reagan at the time Ronald Reagan was president. Now, I lay this out of my book. I am for a decriminalization of most drugs, but I don't want to decriminalize, say, meth or other hardcore drugs. I would prefer not to be putting people in jail for these things. If you sell them, then I think there's something else. But I personally don't take the pure, pure libertarian approach on this. I've debated this, by the way, several times with Michael Malice. I don't want a meth lab next door to me, right? And by the way, I fully understand the libertarian arguments on this. But the point is in essence, what Ron Paul is saying is there are psychological problems, there are personal problems, there are problems about dependency. But these are things to deal with in your family, as he says, in your church, in your local community, things like that. We shouldn't be just saying to the government, oh, can you fix all of my problems? If only that thing out there that's not really good at anything, but it's above me, if only that could tell me what to do, I would be a better person. So I just love the fact that 30 years ago, these debates were being had. And by the way, nobody, as far as I know, nobody got violent in that clip. And maybe we do need some more shows like this. It was actually making me think once this pandemic, whatever you want to call it at this point, once this thing ends, maybe I should be doing a studio show and we'll get people in from both sides and people can start screaming at each other. And as long as nobody's violent, we'll have some fun with it because maybe we do need a little bit, a little bit more of that. Anyway, guys, oh, part two of my interview with Stephen Crowder just went up this morning. Crowder was actually banned from Twitter yesterday. He's back on today, but most of our interview for the hour with him and his lawyer, Bill Richmond, is about their ongoing lawsuit with Facebook. And the fact that he got banned from Twitter yesterday because he just did a video on what he claims is some pretty rock solid evidence of voter fraud. Did I just get booted from YouTube while saying it? Did the whole channel just black out? Am I talking to nobody right now? I guess we'll find out in a minute. So I think you'll find it really interesting. And we get into the, the, you know, do you want the free market to solve these things issues? We get into the deal, just leave it to competition. Do you get the government involved? Is it a problem? Because you had a sort of more friendly government to our ideas a few months ago. Now it's worse with the Biden administration. We get into all that stuff. It's super interesting. Part two is up now. The full episode is already up at Ruben report dot locals dot com. That's all I got for you today. Have a great day, everybody. And stay sane. It's going to be all right."
