    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in friday edition clay Travis buck Sexton show. I appreciate all of you hanging out with us We have had a lot of fun so far this week and we're going to finish strong I hope you all have started your weekend maybe even a little bit early Uh and you are rolling in here for what is for many of you going to be a graduation weekend We've got so many different people out there high school and college graduation season underway We've got a loaded program for you. Let me give you an idea of what we got going on at one o'clock Justin marino is going to join us. Justin marino is the attorney We're going to get into this story and we've hinted at it a couple of times this week Crazy viral video of a six-month pregnant nurse Trying to get a bike to ride home after her shift at a hospital in new york city area Um and she was accused of being racist she was attacked Uh just in incredibly graphic detail all over twitter She's had to to relocate so she and her husband are safe. Uh, we're going to talk with her attorney He's coming in studio at one o'clock. We'll also be joined Uh in the second hour by riley gains Uh who has been fighting out for women's sports and then in the third hour senator josh holly of mazuri has a new book out He's going to hop in uh with us in the final hour of the week all that Uh scheduled to uh to break down with you Uh, we've got news that tem scott senator from south carolina has filed paperwork to officially become a candidate for president He is reportedly going to announce on monday Uh and began his campaign for president, which means that to south carolinians nicky haley also already in the race And then there are reports that ronda santis is going to announce in miami on wednesday So we will give you all the latest analysis there Uh with ronda santis prepared to announce there is a monster probably four or five thousand word attack piece On kc desantis his wife. We will discuss that Federman uh more audio of federman attempting to uh inject himself into the body politic. We will discuss that Uh georgia and arizona battleground states new polling out. What does it tell us? We will discuss and Uh, there is a lot of uh news out there Surrounding what has suddenly become a very controversial topic and buck if I had told you If I had told you buck in 2016 That we were going to be in a situation where 14 and 15 year old kids were going to be having surgery to remove body parts And change their gender And that the idea that a state should say, you know, we're not going to allow that Would somehow be a battleground issue Would you believe that we were going to end up there? I mean in all honesty I I would not have ever believed even in 2016 that a 14 year old having for instance her breast removed Uh stopping that from occurring or some of the sterilization basically procedures Yet that is where we are where left wingers in this country are up in arms over the idea that we would say Hey, if you want to be trans you have to at least wait to adulthood Uh, are you stunned that this is where we are? You know As a normal person just walking around day to day. I could understand how somebody would say how did we get to this place Couldn't have seen this coming But when you understand the nature and the inclination of the left and the way that they engage in uh in relentless Activism and and the way that they're willing to lie endlessly You see that from the very beginning clay. It was always Premised on A man can become a woman. I mean there's always been this incoherence all of the different um You know qualifications or all of the different modifications that have been made up to this point We're all rooted in a fallacy and so What the left is realized is that the only way this whole thing sticks together The only way that they can get their preferred policy is to take it all the way Because otherwise there are limitations right? Otherwise there are concerns What I mean is If you don't believe that that you can transition your gender Then you don't believe you can transition your gender all this stuff that we're doing all these accommodations Was the word i was trying to think of before all these accommodations usage of preferred pronouns You know that the bathroom policies under obama if you remember all of this stuff It can hold together. It makes no sense Um unless you actually believe that a man can become a woman and why are they going after kids? Why do they say that doctors get it wrong when it comes to the gender of a baby now? Well because otherwise you start to get into well if this is a psychological condition Is it one that is healthy that should be celebrated? Is it one that requires the suspension of reality for everybody else? Clay you may have seen this nbc news Had parents file a police report after teacher offers lgbtq themed book to her middle schoolers But when you actually look at what nbc news is uh is sharing on this when you actually look at what? The book is they're lying about what the book is And they're lying about what's in the book and this reminds me of here the uh the reader context on twitter here The incorrect book is shown by nbc The book in question is this book is gay which explains how to find sexual partners online and contain sexually explicit pictures Yeah The only way nbc news can make this argument about how look at how terrible these parents are for stepping in is to lie And that is where we are lie about the book that the parents don't like because no sane person thinks You should be teaching fourth graders about where to find partners Uh for any sexual proclivities online. No sane person can make that argument Yeah, it's crazy And I actually went and looked up this book and I would just encourage Because there is this argument on the left as you well know that these are books that are being banned They're not being banned. This is just a discussion about what's appropriate At what age for kids to be exposed to a variety of different subjects Which is and has long been the province of parents and I just go back to movies every time Every time you hear someone say this book has been banned. You should respond Really? Is it banned? Is it impossible to get it anywhere in the united states or Is there just a discussion about age appropriateness in the same way that there is with every single movie? Right if you're going to the movies this weekend with your kids What's the first thing you're probably going to look at when you decide what movie to take them to see? What is the rating? You're probably not if you got an eight-year-old going to take them to an r-rated movie If you got a 10-year-old probably not going to do that So that is the appropriate response. I think but I want to play these book because I will say This is one of the first times where I've really felt and I think you can give matt wall shit the daily wire credit Because I think his documentary What is a woman which I would encourage people to watch we've talked about I think we had him on It really kind of opened many people's eyes to how aggressive and anti-children The trans movement has become and how much frankly they are Encouraging young children to be uncomfortable in their bodies and tell them hey, maybe you're not a tomboy Maybe you should get your boobs chopped off because you're actually a boy greg abbot And also I believe ron desantis are out here fighting this battle right now. Let's listen to greg abbot governor of texas Explain this bill that he just signed in the lone star state. Here's cut seven I'll be signing it heres. This is about protecting children Now remember this and and that is a person under the age of 18 They don't have the mental capacity to make a life-changing decision to Lose there's sex organs in the set of texas if you're under the age of 18 You can't get a tattoo you can't buy cigarettes and so many other things But people think that they should be able to make a decision to permanently alter their sex organs That's just outrageous In texas, we believe that cutting off the child's sex organs is child abuse and it's going to be treated that way by law I mean, it's crazy that this has to be said the same thing by the way also happening in florida Here's what ron desantis said let's play cut 10 We also did a bill which is sad that we're even having discussed this to criminalize the mutilation of minors who are undergoing the sex change Operations by these really rogue ideological physicians and we've had heartbreaking testimony from people that have gone through this when they were minors Now they're adults and this is something they're now having to overcome Really for the rest of their lives because irreversible changes were made We banned this Administratively last year through our medical board. So if a medical doctor did this they lose the license in florida Which is appropriate but we felt you had to do more I mean if you're taking off the private parts of some 15 year old kid, you know, you should go to jail for that This is the most obvious the most common sense Position that I think the gop has had to take an opposite opposition to the democrat left in a long time And and I think it's it's worth noting clave that One of the reasons that they're going after this remember they keep pushing this there are other states so that everyone Has the full context here that are creating sanctuary states. Yeah So that a 14 year old who's convinced that he is a she can go to colorado or can go to washington state I'm not even sure which all of the states are under this umbrella yet And and the parents don't even get notification and the parents can't do anything about it They're running to these clinics. These clinics are going to be funded by by the left. It's very ideological But if they don't intervene at this level one thing that you can expect is that a lot of these teenagers Who are you know believe their trans or they're going through this this psychological process of thinking they're the other gender What happens when we get data on the percentage of them who How else do you say it grow out of it? Yeah, which is going to be very high mark my words You know how you know this because you look at the practice of psychiatry before it was overtaken by left wing zealots Which unfortunately it has been the most left wing of all of the medical specialties is psychiatry by far Before psychiatrists were just all you know doing their their best To destroy civilization in the name of of equity or whatever Uh, they recognize that a lot of these kids just grow out of it And what's the harm if it's so important? What's the harm and the harm and waiting clay is what you have to you have to live Uh, you know Not the way that you think you should be for a few more years to you're an adult ever Heal They have open gashes folks that never heal And you're supposed to pretend that the gash is female genitalia This is the definition of monstrous I mean It really is buck and there was a good piece I know we've talked about it on the show and I saw the wall street journal build on it I believe it was monday or tuesday's journal They wrote all of the laws out about tattoos And you know giving kids under 18 in some states is a felony a tattoo Literally giving them a tattoo and the whole logic behind it is Hey, how many people when they're 14 or 15 they even have One of the most the the nations for most tattoo artists And he says like I won't do tattoos under the age of 18 and his quote and i'm paraphrasing is basically How many kids 14 or 15 get a tattoo? And when they're 40 or 50 they're like man that tattoo that I got when I was 14 or 15 is great I'm so glad I have it so we have some states treat kids under 18 getting tattoos as a felony And these same states, this is what's crazy buck to your point These same left-wing states are like oh, but you should be able to chop off your boobs At 14 or 15 and it's a human right they won't let you get a tattoo But they'll let you remove your breast and stop yourself from going through puberty These doctors are violating the Hippocratico. No doubt I mean this goes to the most basic These surgeries that they are doing these hormone blockers they're giving and there's also this massive Recognition among many of us after the covid fiasco Whether it was doctors rushing people onto ventilators which killed them or doctors insisting you double or even triple masks Which was useless or doctors saying get shots four five and six Those are the really good ones that'll protect you people recognize now the ideological rot that has spread within the medical community Such that yeah, the same doctors What I want to ask this what correlation does everyone think there is between doctors who support gender transition for minors And doctors who think fauci is a genius Masking was a lifesaver and the vaccines were a gift from well I wouldn't say god because they don't believe in god, but a gift from you know somewhere 100% clay. Yeah, 100% guaranteed they overlap We'll get into all this and more 800-282-2882. Obviously it is friday as well We will take some of your calls, but in the meantime.

Oh, hey, babe Buntanelle Welcome back to play and buck you remember yesterday. I talked about this story where adidas Is uh trying to sell bathing suits women's bathing suits by having men with hairy chests and male areas Bulges I believe is how they are described in the news sites um And that some people are upset about this some people think that this is uh an outrage riley gains here on fox news.com torches adidas for disgusting women swimsuit ad that accentuates models bulge Well riley made the news on this one We wanted to bring her in to talk to us about it riley gains of the independent women's forum is with us now She's also the best freestyle nc double a women's swimmer of last year um riley thanks for being with us Of course. Thank you so much for having me on So what's going on with a global sports wear company putting guys with hairy chests and bulges in female bathing suits I see this And of course, let's take it back. We just saw nike do this right with their woman sports bra They highlighted dillum Mulvaney as the best woman sports bra models Which of course we know sports bras are exclusively limited for just woman use and they did this And the reaction was an uproar um women across the aisle regardless of I mean take away Your political affiliation women across the globe were irritated by this. They were furious. They were offended adidas saw this they saw this uproar Yet they still chose to do the exact same thing themselves and they created a woman's swimsuit Modeled by a man Accessorized with a bulge. It's disgusting. It's perverse. It's offensive. It's demeaning It's belittling to what womanhood and what being a woman Really is because I can guarantee you there is no woman who would put on that suit And simultaneously have that same bulge that the model does Riley first of all I saw you yesterday or a couple days ago at the airport coming back from testifying in front of congress I thought you did an awesome job there uh, my wife watched your testimony and she was super fired up and Her argument is I'm curious how how you would think about this That the ultimate form of misogyny Is men deciding that they can replace women in women's events and even in women's modeling like this And i'm curious what you would say to this There are a lot of women Men pretending to be women right that become famous I'm betting that adidas has never paid you a dollar. I'm betting that nike is never paid you a dollar Uh, and you are an actual women's athlete unlike the people that they're paying to model women's athle- athleisure or athletic sports wear There are no uh men who uh women who identify as men that become famous Why do you think that is why do you think men pretending to be women? These people are making millions of dollars and there's almost no Uh flip side right women who decide to identify as men that are becoming famous in that regard Right, right and I actually like how you said it. It's the ultimate form of misogyny the ultimate form of man's fighting You have a man telling a woman what feminism is and how to How to embrace that but you're exactly right? You don't see women going into men's sports You don't see women going into men's bathrooms. You don't see women Getting paraded on Bud Light cans is this this big manly man. That's not happening No, we're seeing men dress up as Audrey Hepburn and they're getting The sponsorships and the endorsements and it just goes back to this systemic erasure of woman as a whole It's a lot bigger than just sports. It's a lot bigger Um Then that of course, look at what's happening in prisons. You don't see women identifying as men going into men's prisons That's not happening. It is only going one way across the board in regards to the language that we're deeming offensive. Why is it now that mother is deemed offensive yet? We can still use fathers I'm actually right here in green hills clay. I know you know where that is Oh, yeah And I just went to the restroom in Nordstrom and there is a unisex restroom And there's a men's restroom right here. It blows my mind. I took a picture of it and I'm just i'm baffled This is only going one way Where do you think it's going next right? We're speaking around the gains of the independent women's form nc double a national champion freestyle swimmer I'm i'm declaring a disqualification of lea thomas who she swam against in those finals here. Uh, so Um, tell us riley Where do you think the next steps are i'm in at this point? We can't even there's no parody that seems possible of this gender Bending and gender erasure moi well really women erasing is what's going on Um, because the crazier it gets the more they double down. What do you think happens next? I mean, are are we just supposed to expect that we have unisex sports and that's where it goes for women? You know, I hate to say it, but I do think it gets worse before it gets better And of course that's betting on the fact that women won't boycott their sports They won't boycott their sororities or whatever that might look like you do have to imagine it's going to get worse before it gets better But that being said I do think more and more people are opening their eyes And seeing just how harmful this is to women. I mean, we can't even define the word woman um part of the reason why I was just in dc Um earlier this week was to introduce the women's bill of rights Which is a bill that puts into law the definition of a woman I can't believe that that's necessary because of course the public knows what a woman is But it's time that our laws and these unelected bureaucrats and judges and officials who are interpreting these laws as to However, they want it's time they know as well Um, so to answer your question. I think it gets worse before it gets better. But ultimately I see this getting better. It has to I don't understand how this lunacy this insanity can continue Riley, uh, I think you're super brave. Obviously people have seen what happened to you Uh, I believe it's san francisco state university when you went to go speak there and obviously you are getting a lot of Negative blowback. I bet you actually get more positivity though when you're out and about i'm curious on that But also I think the story of how you ended up speaking out is so important You have said and and you can explain to our audience If lea thomas that is a man doesn't decide to identify as a woman and compete as a women swimmer against you at the nc Wh championships if he doesn't decide to compete as a she You would have gone where what would you be doing in your life right now as opposed to speaking out on this issue My intention my plan I graduated from school with my degree in human health sciences and health law and had every intention on being in dental school Actually, what I wanted to pursue is indedonic Um, which is essentially someone who performs root canal That's what I wanted to do. So by no means do I feel equipped for the position that i'm in Um, by no means do I feel brave either? I think it's crazy and it shows the true state of our nation when we consider someone brave or courageous For simply saying that men and women are different and that women deserve respect and equal opportunities I can't I can't bad them how that's brave. Um, but it has become an expensive brave to stay so Um due to this of course, it's canceled culture that we live in but i'll tell you about the public response Penfold support in comparison to anything negative. Yeah, um, I have never had On a personal interaction on a day-to-day my daily life. I have never had one person come up to me and say they disagree with me You mentioned katie porter who's taking shots at you. She's running for senate in california I saw you tweet about this and I wanted to give you a chance to talk about the difference between public versus Uh, you know like television sometimes in real life katie porters are grown woman. She's running for senate congresswoman right now. She ripped you on piers morgan. She ripped you on bill mar You said you tried to talk to her because you were up on capital hill. What happened? Yeah, i'll kind of back story what she said about me as she disagrees with everything i do entirely and she says that i'm just doing this for clicks I'm doing this for like That's what my fight to protect woman who sports is about it's about me and my personal advancement And so I did I saw her on capital hill and of course I I had to address it because I'm not someone who's going to let that go if you have something that You wanted to say I actually just wanted to respectfully ask her what she disagreed about And when I tried to confront her introduce myself. She of course Turned and ran the other way. I I said hello represent a porter. My name is riley gane To which I know you know that I bet you could catch her if you wanted to i'm just putting that out there Hey, I I very easily could I'm just saying And now i'm not a fast runner if that tells you anything Um, but she turned and walked the other way as i'm telling her you know, this isn't about clicks i'm like To say that is completely disingenuous and as a woman it's heartbreaking to have another woman Attack you for trying to protect women. It doesn't make sense, but that's what we're seeing again across the board And she couldn't say it to my face. She can only say it behind a screen or in front of a camera I I'm going to go on a college campus tour or something Let us know we'll promote it here on the show and make sure we get lots of of good and patriotic americans in the stand so the lunatics Can't surround the building.

This was on may 12th so about a week ago Um, and it's right outside of her hospital in new york city She is six months pregnant. She had worked a 14 hour shift at the hospital We now know also that she was somebody who worked in the hospital throughout Remember we used to you know, clap our hands and the pots and pans for the first responders and all that in new york I remember I was there So she's trying to get home and she gets to her city bike Which are these bikes for those you don't know that you can rent you put in a credit card And you're in some sort of a program and there's these docking stations And a young black man in fact, I believe a number of young black men uh surround her And actually place hands on the bike push the bike into the dock again claimed that She is taking one of the that effectively one of the Men have rented this bike that she is taking a bike that they rented Here is we have the audio of it. Here is some of what this exchange sounded like place Please, please Please help me Please, help me unfunction Thank you Thank I took you No, no, no, I don't know. So you get the idea this this woman Sarah Comrie being harassed at one point one of the one of the black men in the video says you're putting your fetus on my hand Which I don't even know what that is supposed to mean but claiming that she's initiating the contact They were initiating contact. She felt like she was in a difficult and uncomfortable situation She wanted help and the interesting part of all this is guess who the bike actually belonged to Well, we have now somebody who can answer some of these questions and more in studio in New York City is Justin Marino Sarah Comrie's lawyer Justin. Thank you for being with us. Thank you for having me So let's just get to the facts of this and by the way, you please feel free to I just know the media reports You're the lawyer on the case you're representing Sarah Comrie But we do know for a fact and you can add anything else you like in terms of facts That Sarah did rent this bike and that she had every right to take this bike That's a hundred percent correct The only misstatement is it was actually a 12 hour shift not a 14 hour shift Which sorry which still is remarkable for a woman who's six months pregnant She's a physician's assistant by the way Bellevue Hospital in New York City, which has the most Economically disadvantaged population ever and so One of the most within the country and so she literally saves lives with her colleagues on a daily basis work through COVID and Has spent her whole life helping people she could have easily got a job on Park Avenue and in another medical capacity making more money But she literally selflessly is trying to help others and so for her whole life helping people It is effectively ruined with a one-minute video Okay, so this to me is so fascinating and we got just a merino in studio here in New York City with us He's the attorney representing this this woman who did nothing wrong and has gone viral as Buck mentioned somewhere around 40 million views of this she was labeled as a Karen as a racist Benjamin Crump who is a professional racial agitator tweeted out that she was in some way engaging in racist behavior based on her interactions With these young kids they were the ones who took the video they edited it I believe and then shared it and it has been distributed widely What has happened because I think this is a fear of many people out there It almost has a Nicholas Sandman Association with it where for those of you who remember the young high school kid who was standing on the Lincoln Memorial steps did nothing wrong But they labeled him as a racist because he was wearing a MAGA hat. This is a six-month pregnant nurse This video goes viral. What has happened to her since this video has gone viral? How has her life changed and and what is it like right now to your understanding? Her life is devastated. She quite literally is in hiding. She's received threats to her life and her husband's life This is the absolute worst thing that anyone could envision Happening to anyone and it is it's simply tragic and it's quite literally The result of the irresponsibility of the media Can I ask also what the status is with her employer? Justin we were about we were speaking to Justin Marino lawyer for Sarah Comrie the woman in the ultra-viral video being accused of a Karen and of being a Karen and a racist These these are all rooted in lies about what actually occurred Justin her employer placed her on leave and is investigating What is there to investigate at this point other than she didn't do anything wrong? Initially they came out and their first reaction is to you know look into it and frankly I don't blame them for doing an investigation and I would expect them to do so and as an employment lawyer I think it's perfectly acceptable They're basically looking they're trying to presumably speak to other witnesses. We presented our case to them on day two they immediately put her on leave on day one or the first business day and You know they're gonna fulfill their their their role but part of me being here is so that you know public perception is going to change because now you know the reality of what occurred so then this Employer is gonna be hopefully harassed by you know the mob saying you must fire her and hopefully they can be compelled to make the right decision How do you unring the bell in a situation like this when you have a false accusation and to be fair there are lots of false Accusations about public figures, but they have the opportunity sometimes to go out and defend themselves for instance Trump can say Hey, this is fake news. He can go out when you have a legitimately false accusation made against what is it to this time? And you can correct me if I'm wrong someone who's not a public figure right someone who's just a private individual working in the hospital as a nurse Six months pregnant living her normal life suddenly she is branded as an awful heinous racist How do you unring that Bell in your experience labor and employment lawyer? What can she have happen in the future that in some way? Helps to provide some form of normalcy in her life. How do you get back to that? I? Suppose we're hoping time heals all wounds and knowledge and evidence of these receipts will show that the underlying Chaos that calls this is actually completely false the the problem of course is there are individuals irrespective of You know what we talk about now and the evidence we have that are still gonna have you know this anger and hate towards her and You know there's crazy individuals that may you know follow her? So this is a problem and ultimately it cannot be cured completely Justin is there anything that Sarah wants the public to know either additional context or just something because clearly this was this was edited released and Framed in a way that was dishonest and meant to defame her meant to really really harm her In all the ways we've talked about but I'm just wondering if there's anything that either Transpired right before right after additional context that doesn't show up in the video that she wants the public to know about Despite everything that happened to her despite that a complete stranger inadvertently had his arm on her pregnant belly She wants everyone to know that we her and and her lawyers Do not have any ill will towards these young men She legitimately wishes them the best because the fact is is the hatred and the scrutiny that's been applied to her We don't want that to apply to anyone else including these young men And and so despite everything she's gone through you know She is so compassionate that literally she wishes these people the best and she hopes that no repercussions will ever occur to them because they're young men You know people make mistakes, you know, that's fine that this we would not be here today it had Their skin color everyone in that video been the same yeah, and and it is the media's fault for for blowing it up So you I mentioned Nicholas Sandman earlier and we're talking to Justin Moreno labor and employment attorney for Sarah Comrie who is a totally innocent nurse six months pregnant who was accused of being a racist And and now has getting death threats because of a viral video that over 40 million people have watched Nicholas Sandman sued many different media Organizations individuals and ultimately those were settled because he was not a public figure right and there was a video that was Distributed many different news organizations piled on at the idea that he was an awful racist You know Trump supporter is a high school kid who was doing nothing wrong when the full context of the video came out Piers your client also done nothing wrong 100% innocent has been vilified dragged through the mud Do you believe that you have because she's a private figure when this video went public? Do you believe that you have causes of action against some of these individuals in media or with large public profiles that have tried to Attack her as an awful racist essentially defamed her and as you said made it very difficult for her to get back to her normal life Without question. There is a reason in this country. We have a cause of action called defamation Yes, it is to for this very purpose and so you can't take someone who has literally just she's a hero She's saved people's lives with her colleagues in in the most economically disadvantaged hospital potentially in the country and with one fell swoop You call her a racist you call her a thief you call her a white supremacist you call her a Karen All of those words in my opinion Excuse me according to the law and we'll prove that Karen is per se defamatory But every single part of it is outrageous and we do plan to go after the media to rectify this so that they don't do it again So what's the timeframe on when those lawsuits might be filed in your mind to try to send a message much as Nicholas Sandman did himself? Right now our focus is her employer making sure she still has her job to her safety by making sure the general public knows the truth That she is a hero After that the statute of limitations give us a year to go after them. I would imagine we'll be filing lawsuits well before then Justin Marino appreciate you coming in to tell us about Sarah Comrie and to really set the record straight and we'll continue to follow This this case in hope that there's some justice and please give Sarah regards from us and everybody listening that we wish her and her family well We're thinking about her and praying for them. Thank you very much Next Tuesday morning is gonna be really a lot of fun I hope a lot of you will join at 10 a.m. Before the show starts here Join me for an exclusive interview with an extraordinary market analyst who's got an awesome name Mason Sexton, that's why it's my dad my father.

They do it work. Gagob. Oh, they pay Punta now welcome back in clay Travis bucks extern show appreciate all of you hanging out with us We are joined now by Missouri Senator Josh Hawley father of three He's got a new book manhood the masculine virtues America needs and I Mean I'm sure Senator you look around and see some of this ridiculous stuff the Adidas has men wearing women's Bathing suits we've got men winning women's championships I don't think anybody can argue that masculinity in many ways is under siege so is femininity So is the very idea that there's a different in the sex difference in the sexes. How do we fix this? Well, thanks for having me on it's great to be with you and you nailed it It is the left is it's waging a war on the whole idea of gender. They're telling men that they're inherently toxic They're telling women that they don't exist. You know, I mean anybody can be a woman today I mean it is crazy stuff the way we fix it. I think is We first of all insist that on the reality of biology that there are really biological men That's a real thing and there really are biological women and those things are different number one number two It's good. It's good to be a man It's good to be a woman and then I think they for young men We need to send the message that hey there are role models out there of what a good strong man looks like We need strong men in America. We need men who are going to take responsibility for their lives for their families Ultimately for their country and we need to send that message to young people especially Senator Holly it's buck. Thanks for being with us. I want to know you clean. I talk about this a lot I wanted to hear your take on it, which is why does the left? Want to undermine masculinity so much it's very clear. There's a concerted effort here What's the motivation behind that? I? Think it's power You know, I think that men who are strong and independent are a threat to the leftists and to the elitists who want to run the country You think about buck their message to men for the last 20 30 40 years. It's been hey go turn on a screen Go entertain yourself buy some stuff being an androgynous consumer, but don't rock the boat You know let us let the experts run the country you just sit there and do as you're told I think men who are independent who say no actually I got a job. I'm economically independent I provide for my family. I'm morally independent. I've got my own political views That's a threat to the liberal elites the so-called experts running this country and that's exactly why we need them To stand up be stronger to take responsibility. That's what liberty is liberties when we run our own lives Right liberties when we run our own government so to reclaim the promise of liberty in this country preserve it We need men who are going to stand up take responsibility be strong and independent You know buck and I talk a lot on this program I mean there are certain things that I see and it's almost impossible to have predicted that this would ever occur even Even if you go back to like 2010 2016 even the idea that there wouldn't be and I know you guys just voted on this There wouldn't be a single Democrat in Congress in the house or the senate that was willing to say hey Men's sport should be for men and women's sports should be for women Blows my mind. Did you ever think I mean you grew up playing athletics? You like we said you've got three kids as well You're in Missouri. I'm sure that most of your constituents think this is wild too Do you ever think we'd see an entire political party unwilling to say hey, we should separate men and women's sports No, no, I did not I wouldn't have thought that just three or four years ago. Yeah, I mean it is incredible this Radical ideology that is so totally unhinged from reality and clay, you know, you know, parent Parents don't want this and that crosses political lines at least it doesn't mind state democrat parents independent parents They don't care. They just want their kids number one to be affirmed for who they are not that you know If you're boy, you need to be a girl if you're a girl you need to be boy crazy They want their girls to actually be able to play sports And not have men pushed into their same sports leagues or into their same walker rooms This is pretty basic stuff and I think the left has gotten so out of control here. They've gotten so far a field That they've just completely lost touch with reality and that's why you're gonna conservative This is the time for conservatives to stand up and to defend manhood to defend womanhood to say those things are real Those things have value and we should recover what healthy role models for both of them look like Senator holly with us now from azurea senator Your democrat senate colleagues on this gender issue Do you think I mean without asking anyone specifically but as as a general matter Do they believe this stuff the slogans they mouth on tv about how It's fine that you know men can actually be women and they should compete or they just So afraid of the cult and their political power demands it that they're willing to go along with it You know what I mean? Are they true believers or are they just they don't have a choice in their minds I think it's probably the second thing and and I say it because I have I have respect for these people and I just can't believe they actually believe That stuff, you know, I mean I think it's that The the lobby here the radical left lobby Let's remember who the base of the democrat party is now It's people who fly around the private jets and go to conferences at Davos Like that's their base Those are the people with the power the radical activists who also tend to be very rich and well connected So I think they're very responsive to those people and those people are pushing this this Trans ideology this no gender ideology All the way I mean hook line and sinker. I think they left spot it So that to me is what's driving this but you know, it is it's crazy I mean it's crazy talking I think of the hearing that I had Some month back where we had what called by the democrats where we had an elite law professor who wouldn't even say the word woman You know she kept saying persons with birthing capacity and it's like wait. You mean you mean woman, right? Here's the point that we're at in America with the left They won't say man. They won't say woman I think one of the reasons I wrote the book is to cut across all of that all of that nonsense Let's tell the truth. We need good strong men. We need good strong women too But for men this is really a call to step up to take responsibility And to go out there change your own life first and then change your family change this country The book is manhood the masculine virtues america needs Um, I'm sure i've got three boys So I spend a lot of time thinking about this 15 12 and 8 and and obviously I see a lot of their their friends around and everything else And one thing I hear from them and i'm curious if you're hearing this from your own kids or if you're hearing this from constituents A lot of young, you know men a lot of boys They look around and say, you know, we're being told that we are toxic because we are boys And and like i'll hear from my own kids like there's a lot of you know Pro femininity still out there the girl power Initiative and whatnot. I think that a lot of young boys growing into men are really lost And and and they don't know how to be comfortable in their own skin I think this is also happening with women because you look at high rates of suicide and depression that exist out there How do we fix it? Because this is something that I think is so important. There's a lot of lost souls in the younger generation Um, i'm sure you see it. I'm sure you're trying to address it in in the book But do you feel it? Do you feel that uh when you're around the country senator holly that even for something like when you and i would have grown up Uh, you know 20 30 years ago. This didn't exist. It really feels like men are truly under assault in this country 100 and I think the message that you just articulated is 100 What men especially young men here, which is that if you're a man you're toxic If you're a man you make the world a worse place just by being a man And that is incredibly disorienting to young men You know who naturally come built in with a sense of adventure A longing to you know, grow out and discover and push boundaries and be aggressive like that You know, that's just listen. I mean you've got you've got boys. I've got boys like this is how boys are And when they're told from the time they're little that's a problem. You're a problem. You need to stop that It is profoundly disorienting disorienting to them. So how do we change that? I think part of the answer is we try and tell good stories recover role models This is what I tried to do in the book. I tell stories from my own life coaches mentors who are significant to me Uh from american history from the bible What does it look like to be a good strong man? And I think we can hold up those role models for young men today and say look here This is what it looks like it's good to be a man. It's good to have ambition It's good to want to be strong channel that in service to others And then you've got the recipe to really make a difference with your life The book is manhood the masculine virtues american needs senator josh holly. Thanks so much for being with us Thank you for having me There's a lot of momentous life-changing decisions going on at each of the pre-born network of clinics nationwide every day Take katlin's circumstances as just one example.
