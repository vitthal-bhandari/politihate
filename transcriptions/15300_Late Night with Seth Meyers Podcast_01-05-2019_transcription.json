Former Vice President Joe Biden has officially announced he's running for president and he's already a front runner, which is ideal because nothing good happens when he comes from behind. From 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, please enjoy this podcast edition of Late Night with Seth Myers. On today's show, Seth talks to comedian Desi Leiden, who also takes a few more questions backstage just for this podcast. But first, a closer look. The president is in a standoff with Congress as some Democrats call for impeachment for more and this. It's time for a closer look. President Trump has defying subpoenas from Congress. His attorney general threatened not to show up to hearings this week. And several Democrats have called on Congress to begin the process of impeachment. So Trump has a lot going on, which means, of course, that he decided to take time out of his schedule to call into a Fox Morning show. And once again, spent so much time on the phone that at the end of the interview, the host, Maria Bartiromo, repeatedly tried to get him to hang up. Everybody wants people to go out and find out what the hell happened. Where did all of this corruption start? When you have- Sorry, our viewers want to know. The lovers we call them. Yeah, our viewers want to know that. This president, thanks so much. Hillary Clinton loses. We want an insurance policy where we can get Trump out. Well, it didn't work so well, but I'll tell you what, it really hurt our country and it hurts our country. These people are corrupt. And then you look at a guy like Brennan with his big mouth, but it's a disgrace. Everyone wants to know, Maria, and you might be number one on the list. I watch your show. You're incredible. You may be number one on the list. Everybody wants to know how did it start? Why did it start? What about the dossier? How much did Hillary Clinton pay for the dossier? You know she paid for it. You know, everybody wants to know about it. And that's really, hopefully they'll be going there. My God, that was like watching your grandpa try to get off the phone with his grandpa. She ran out of minutes on her plan. He's like one of those guys who calls a restaurant to place an order for delivery and then tries to have a conversation with the staff. Yeah, I'll take a large pepperoni and hey, what's your name? You always been interested in pizza. I know it's hard to remember this sometimes, but that guy is the most powerful man in the world. He should be like doing stuff. And Maria knows, I mean, look at her face. That's the face you make when your friend says, I want to set you up with a guy. He's a count. And then halfway through the dinner, you realize she meant he can count. Oh, I know him. Oh, one, two, three. Can't live without that number. But aside from rambling and coherently about whatever he was rambling about, Trump also repeated a dangerous line. He's been using lately about the investigation of him and his campaign, that it was an attempted coup and the people behind it were traders. He used it in the interview with Bartiromo and repeated it in speeches and interviews over the last few weeks. This was a, an attempted coup. This was an attempted takedown of a president and they got caught. And what they did was treason. This was really a coup. It didn't work. We caught him. Yeah. They tried for a coup. Didn't work out so well. This was a coup. This was an attempted overthrow of the United States government. So there you go. That's what the president said. This was a coup and the people who orchestrated it were traders. And if there's anything Trump hates, it's traders who try to overthrow the United States government. I've answered that question. And if you look at what I said, you will see that that question was answered perfectly. And I was talking about people that went because they felt very strongly about the monument to Robert E. Lee, a great general, whether you like it or not. He was one of the great generals. First of all, no, he wasn't. He let an armed rebellion to bring down the United States government and he lost. In other words, they tried for a coup. Didn't work out so well. And on top of that, on top of that, giving you a containers because your response to Charlottesville was not perfect. There were no very fine people on both sides. They were literal white supremacists shouting Jews will not replace us. And they were carrying tiki torches, which is something we will never forget because now, when you buy a tiki torch, you have to go out of your way to say, we're having a barbecue. It's for barbecue stuff. But of course, Trump couldn't just stop at heaping praise on a trader's general who defended slavery and tried to bring down the United States government. He also had to heap some praise on himself. Well, I think that I just feel like a young man. I'm so young. I can't believe it. I'm the youngest person. I am a young vibrant man. I am. I can't believe I have to say this, but we can see you. I mean, what are we even supposed to do? With that information, that's a 72 year old president in the United States, a man who spends most of his time watching cable TV and riding around in a golf cart and stands like he's in weekend to burnies. I mean, here he is at his golf club recently with fellow lumpy grandpa, Rush Limbaugh. And look at that. It's like an episode of Star Trek where a transporter malfunction creates a second Trump. In a case defending Robert E. Lee or calling himself a young, vibrant man wasn't enough, Trump also made a bunch of public appearances where, as usual, sounds came out of his mouth that sounded vaguely like human words. Look, it's a rig system. Okay. If I told you how crazy it is, the web, it's a web. You need a 193 IQ to even understand this web of geniuses. They put this thing to lower a drug price. It has 19 effects here and 27. We got it down and we're getting it down further. We have the smartest people, the best people in that world working on it. This treaty threatened your subject. And you know exactly what's going on here. You're right. I always say this because as good as that equipment is and it's genius, the greatest equipment in the world is a dog. Dogs. A certain type of German Shepherd in particular. Dogs do a better job than $400 million worth of equipment. I mean, good Lord. It's like getting cornered at a party by a guy who's almost run out of cocaine. I use a dog though. That's what I use. The only thing that's impressive about Trump is that the range of subjects he rams about gets wider and wider every day. Most of the time, they'll say the same stuff over and over about building a wall or cooking Hillary or fake news. But once in a while, I'm mixing something totally bad. Crazy. Like smart dogs with high IQs or whatever the hell he was talking about. Honestly, there's a good chance someone switched his Fox News to an episode of Wishbone and he thought it was real. You have to see these dogs so smart. So solving mysteries. Also, also, can we hear the crowd reaction to that line? The greatest equipment in the world is a dog. Dogs. A certain type of German Shepherd in particular. The weird thing about being at a Trump speech is those moments you have to hesitantly clap for stuff you know you don't understand. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Dogs. Yeah. The best equipment's a dog, right? We didn't elect a f***ing. Ain't he not great? Yeah. Yeah. Because all this dumb stuff keeps happening. It's impossible to remember the Special Counsel Robert Mueller's final report came out less than two weeks ago and it confirmed much of what we already suspected about Trump, including the fact that he and his team openly welcomed the help of Russians seeking to interfere in the election and repeatedly lied about it and tried to interfere in the investigation of it. We basically know that for two years, but now we have a 400 page report to prove it. I mean, even the page count looks bad for Trump. If you hired a private detective to find out if your wife is cheating and he sent you 400 pages, you wouldn't even read them. You can go straight to your lawyer's office. Chad has his own section. Let's remember the report specifically listed 10 times Trump may have obstructed justice and Mueller's team even went out of their way to say explicitly that they could not exonerate them. Instead, Mueller specifically turned it over to Congress. While Mueller stopped short of taking a position on obstruction, his words suggest Congress now has a role to play. He writes, quote, we concluded that Congress has authority to prohibit and presidents corrupt use of his authority in order to protect the integrity of the administration of justice. This is from the Mueller report. The conclusion that Congress may apply the obstruction laws to the president's corrupt exercise of the powers of office, the courts with our constitutional system of checks and balances, and the principle that no person is above the law. It's amazing Trump and his supporters are celebrating this as an exoneration when Mueller keeps hinting that Congress could take actions that were unavailable to Mueller. For example, in foot note 574 of Pendix B, subsection 48 C, Mueller writes, The facts couldn't have been any clearer in Mueller's report. Congress has the authority to investigate Trump for obstruction of justice and hold him accountable for it. This is why we have a Congress to reign in a lawless president. You have all the evidence you need, but if you still want to find more evidence, just remember, the greatest equipment in the world is a dog. This has been a closer look. Yes, it's a very funny daily show. Correspondent, her special Desi Lydic Abroad airs May 13th on Comedy Central. Please welcome to the show Desi Lydic, everyone. Welcome to the show. So this is very cool. You traveled. You went to Nubibia, you went to Spain, you went to Iceland. Talk about gender equality. The United States, 49th in the world, which is pretty embarrassing. Not great. We could be better. We could be better. 48 slots available. How do the other countries, I think obviously in America, most of us would be very disappointed by that. How do other countries react when you tell them the United States is 49th? I feel like they were as shocked as we were to find out that news, but they thought that we were ranked lower. I did man on the street in the blue lagoon and asked people, where do you think America is ranked? They went 75th, 119th, I might calm down. You were in Iceland, which as you said in the clip is number one for Jen. You got a tattoo in Iceland. What is it and how did it come about that you got it? I met with this incredibly inspiring group of women. They were in the clip. They're called the daughters of Reykjavik and they are an all female rap collective. 22 members strong. So they're basically like Icelandic lady Wu-Tang Clan. And they all share this matching tattoo. When you go to a frat party and someone draws a on your face, it's like that. But this is the feminist version. Oh, wow. That's very... How do you have you had to explain it to anybody when they see it? Yeah, well, actually I just went home to Kentucky to visit my parents for Easter. And my dad was like, so talk to me about the significance of the tattoo. And I was like, well, it's a triangle. So it's representative of female empowerment. And with some dots above meeting the individual is stronger with the support of others. I barely regret it. Yeah, yeah. I don't think she'll regret it all. Nubibia, how was their time there? What was their take on America if you asked? It was amazing. They too were surprised that we were ranked as well as we were. But they... Yeah, I got it everywhere. But they are... They're incredible. They spoke with this really wonderful woman, Rosa Nomisis. And she spoke about how Nubibia has almost 50% representation in parliament and how a lot of that stems back from when they gain their independence. Women were on the front lines. They were part of writing the Constitution, which is something we're still fighting for, equal rights in our Constitution with the ERA. And she's telling me all of this. She's holding this feather that she picked up. And she's kind of caressing the feather. And she looks down at the feather and then she looks back at me and she goes, Desi, I want you to have this feather. And I went, oh, thank you. Wow, is this a sacred Nubibian custom? Well, it brings me good luck. And she goes, no, no, it's to dry your tears when you're sad about America. I am used in many times. Oh, my God. She's feather-burned you. She's feather-burned. Classic Nubibian feather-burned. Your parents, as you mentioned, Kentucky, fairly conservative. Yes, very conservative. And you work on The Daily Show, which is a show like this one where we sometimes talk about the president. How do they react to it? Well, they haven't spoken to me in quite some time. But when I reconnect with them, I'm excited to ask the question. They're very, very supportive. I think being an actor and looking for work for so long, they're just so happy that I actually have a job. So they are supportive that they will watch the pieces. But my mom kind of has to compartmentalize it. Like, well, we could get into it. But you have to believe what you believe for your job, to keep your job. I don't want you to lose your job. So we just won't talk about it. Do you have, as humor running your family, or do you have some relatives with comedy chops back in Kentucky? Yeah, my aunt has like a really dirty sense of humor. She's almost 80 years old. And just to give you an idea, she, for my wedding when I got married, she gave me a slow cooker, like a crock pot. But she changed the outside of the box to read crotch pot. And she filled it with crotchless panties and moves and like dusting powders. I don't know what they're for. And you had not registered for that. I had not registered for that. And she filled it with these dirty recipes. So she wrote a recipe for roasted chicken. It was like gently massage the oil on the skin of the chicken and spread apart the thighs. And I'm like, oh my gosh, she's almost 80 years old. She's my hero. We should all aspire to that. You should. Yeah. I mean, I feel like that alone should bring us up to like 48 or 47. What? If we had more Aunt Jan's in the morning, we would need so much better. Hey, thank you so much for being here. Congrats on the special Delightful Dreaming YouTube. That's Desi Lydic, everybody. Desi Lydic Abroad and May 13th, come to Censored. Hi, this is Henry from Lydic Night and we're at Desi Lydic from The Daily Show, who has this awesome special. I really, really loved it. Thank you. How difficult is it to pitch going abroad for like three and a half weeks or so when you have a day job at The Daily Show? Part of what I love about The Daily Show is we get to really shine a spotlight on things that matter to us. We get to go shoot these field pieces and talk about things that aren't really necessarily in the minutia of the Trump administration, but some subjects feel a little too large to do in a four to five minute field piece. So something like gender equality from an international perspective seems like we could use maybe a little more time for that. So yeah, it was something that I took to the network and they were shockingly like very eager to go do it. I feel really lucky that they let me talk about it. It's really great. It's super funny and super interesting. And I'm wondering when you're regularly at The Daily Show, what is your production schedule personally like? Because you're doing this field piece like how often you go in field pieces? What are you doing when you're not on field pieces? Are you writing for other parts of the show? Is it only these field pieces? How does a worker's a correspondent there? So as a correspondent, you're pretty much only writing when it's your own piece, but you are involved in every step of the process. And I think that the way that they look at it is you can be as involved as you want to be. So some correspondents like to be very involved, some are more hands off. If I'm part of a chat, I'll sit with the two writers, there'll be two writers assigned, and I'll sit with them throughout the process. And then when it's a field piece, we are usually pretty involved from every step of the way, from writing the questions, figuring out what the comedic take is, going out into the field, and then we often sit in the edit and put the pieces together all the way until the last minute. But in terms of a day-to-day schedule, our writers' meeting starts around 10. We have a field meeting right around 1130 or so. And then usually, if we're not on the show that night, we have something going on. So we're either prepping to go out on a field piece, or we're editing a field piece, or we might be out shooting. And when we travel, it'll be like two days, three days tops. Got it. And how do you pick stories? How does that happen? Obviously, everything comes from the news. We look for something that's happening right now that we can react off of. Sometimes we see stories that just feel like a funny story that we want to tell. But usually, what we try to do is we take something that means something to someone in the room and then figure out a way to make it funny. But we always ask ourselves, if we're going to go shoot a field piece, what is the benefit of going and talking to this person versus just having a chat in the studio? And how often Craig Finn is warming up outside this door, if you're just like a slow brass section. No, for the listeners at home, I'm just doing a little just a little sax practice. I like to multi task. Right. There's nothing you don't do. Hold on, let me just finish this. Really beautiful. This is amazing. Thank you. Wow. Yeah. I feel like we're being played off. And this is your time. One of the my agents. I do have more questions despite this rude interjection of music. You have said that the Daily Show was a dream job. Being a correspondent on the Daily Show was a dream job. When you get there before, how did you choose your character? Because there are different types of Daily Show correspondents, but there's a certain like aura they all have. Yeah. I always love that. It is so loud. It is so loud, you guys. You know what? I'm going to curate what I talk about to the music. So that it will feel organic. Like you're scoring. Yeah. I just had ideas. My mind was full of ideas. Now, this is the desi-latic Craig Finn crossover. People were dying for years. And here it is. I am a fan of correspondents who always act as if they're the smartest person in the room. And sometimes they're not as informed on everything as they should be. Like that's a really fine quality to me playing high status. And I love this idea of the way journalists always pretend like they are exactly the same as the people they're interviewing. Oh, interesting. Like Lisa Ling does. And I'm a huge fan of Lisa Ling. But she has this thing where she will like go deep in bed with this group of people. Oh, wow. Yeah. And she will act. I can't do it. We should just have them come in. Yeah. We just haven't come in. Craig and the whole the whole horn section. They're too busy for us. Yeah. They're too busy. Oh, man. Now that you mentioned, I totally, I've never really thought of that. That like the TV journalist off want to be in the same page and relate to their subjects. Like I lived a rough life too. I totally get it. I know what you're experiencing or or journalists who are like so empathetic that they talk about how empathetic and then they look to do you see how much I empathize with this person. They dress down for it too. Exactly. Very field, field attire. What was your first field piece? My first field piece, I was eight months pregnant. It was on the death penalty. So super light, fun stuff. And in the whole, the take was we were trying to kind of debunk the idea that a criminal in the heat of the moment would have the patience and the logic to let the death penalty be a deterrent. So I was supposed to illustrate this sort of absurd idea by screaming in the middle of Lincoln, Nebraska, downtown Lincoln, Nebraska at nine o'clock at night, eight months pregnant. I threw on a ski mask and held a crowbar and ran into a liquor store to prove this point. And can I tell you that when you're that pregnant, you can almost get away with anything. I ran into that store full ski mask and crowbar. A gentleman opened the door for me. People got out of my way. I felt very heard. Yeah. Although it's funny that you can almost get away with anything. Like if you take one sip of wine when you're that pregnant, people are like, how dare you? You could have shown her. You could steal the wine, but stone you if you drink it. Exactly. Almost anything when you're pregnant. Yeah. Well, thank you so much for being here. It was such a pleasure. The special is great. Your work in the daily show is great. And please come back soon. Yeah, for sure. Thanks for having me. Craig Finn and his band outside. You just want to thank the the free score that we got. Yeah. We should do this every you should really do this every time. We really should. It adds a mood. I know it adds a mood and it was a it was real thrill. Thank you. So Michael, see you soon. Thank you.
