    "text": " Politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative truth the conservative review with Daniel Lawrence and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minutemen standing at the ready to guard our liberties and preserve and protect our Republic this is Daniel Hurwitz back in the house Wednesday the last day of March the last day of the first quarter of this year we began the year with a hopeful tone that perhaps 2021 would bring us our salvation our freedom but here we are the first quarter in the can and our country is more of a basket case than it's ever been we have a legal aliens flooding our border and our government rather than deterring it completes the cycle the criminal conspiracy of human smuggling sex trafficking we have a legal aliens in San Diego who are getting more in-person instruction than our own American children because of a virus that doesn't affect the legal even though they test positive at higher rates that's America for you we have all these black on Asian attacks being blamed of course on white supremacism that it turns out as we predicted the one that beat that 65 year old woman in front of a Midtown Manhattan by the way apartment nobody doing anything about it either had just been paroled for murdering his mother again that's America for you America 2021 black on Asian attacks nobody doing anything about it standing there and filling it with their camera and then of course explained on white supremacism when in fact it was not not just a black individual which really shouldn't matter what does matter is that he was paroled in 2019 that was the big jail break in New York City that we reported on for murdering his mother he stabbed her to death he was extremely violent but they just let him out because that's America is this country even worth fighting for that's the question we're gonna ask today is this country worth fighting for and when it comes to the most illogical things whether it's illegals having more rights than Americans whether it's violent criminals being released whether it's men or women women or men COVID fascism where is the strong alternative we don't hear it so is this a country even worth fighting for an answer is we've lost our country already there's nothing to fight for we're just trying to find an oasis a couple of places where we could live with some sort of semblance of normalcy so later today we're gonna talk about this dynamic of Republicans making excuse excuse after excuse for the most extreme things of the left governor Kristi noem continuing to champion her veto of a simple bill not even fighting transgenderism in general just simply barring men from female sports we're gonna have the author of that bill from the south go to legislature on the show a little later today but I want to start with a very important story that I thought really embodies every story every absurdity that we watch in this country and we see how could this take root well an article written by Phil Shiver my colleague here at the blaze for first time ever majority of Americans don't belong to a church or other house of worship first a word from today's sponsor my son hunter movie calm last week we had the producer of the hunter Biden film on the show to discuss the filming of it the mainstream media and big tech have worked tirelessly to censor and cover up the corruption of the Biden crime family but now you have a chance to help make this story be heard around the world these are the same film makers as you heard last year last week behind the gosnell movie that was really very successful in telling the story of abortions that weren't told for decades this new film is called my son hunter will expose expose not just the hunter Biden scandal but also the cover-up of media and big tech from hunters wild escapades to the contents of his laptop his shady farm business deals in Ukraine Russia and his ties to China but these independent filmmakers need your help because obviously it's a not-for-profit Hollywood and YouTube certainly aren't going to promote it they're gonna censor it it's too controversial that's why they're bringing this film directly to the people funded by you your gift of fifty hundred dollars even ten dollars will help expose the most corrupt family in politics since the Clintons and the good thing is at least until the federal government goes after it your donation is a hundred percent tax deductible so please go to my son hunter movie dot com right now to make your donation my son hunter movie dot com now folks back to this story church going citizens are now minority demographic in the United States the percentage of Americans who belong to a house of worship such as a church or synagogue dip below 50% for the first time according to a survey released by gallop basically they've been releasing this survey since 1937 at a time when 73% of Americans reported belonging to a house of worship it is now at 47% okay 1999 as late as 1999 okay 62 years later still 70% of Americans reported membership in a church so in just 20 years it went from 70 to 47% over the past two decades the percentage of Americans who do not identify with any religion has grown from 8% in 1998 to 2000 to 13% in 2008 2010 and 10 and 21% over the past three years folks this is the answer to everything if you're asking why why do people accept covid fascism why they expect except a legal migration why is there moral compass so flipped upside down inside out on every issue well that's it 66% of Americans born before 1946 our members of a church 58% of baby boomers 50% of Gen X and then it drops all the way to 36% among millennials and I'm sure the next generation will be lower and lower and folks this is just a measure of church membership as you well know very few people small percentage of those who are members really believe in godly values a lot of that's the rock gut from the top in these church establishments but that story just embodies where America is now you know what else embodies where America is now this from the UK Daily Mail US Navy tells staff on extremism training course they can advocate for BLM network but they're not allowed to discuss politically partisan issues so basically you know they were asked in these training courses people like hey you know what about everything BLM's they're saying no BLM's not political and by the way I was I'm gonna put this out on Twitter later a rancher near the Lackland Air Force Base near Del Rio Texas which by the way is right at the epicenter of where illegals are coming in I was speaking with her about ranchers being attacked by illegals running in and we just happen to be talking about the Air Force Base because her husband worked there they have BLM signs and the rainbow flag up on Lackland Air Force Base we now have a diversity training officer who's gonna oversee special forces there is no country left to save that's my point in some ways it's comforting we got to start from scratch but it's just bizarre you look at you know Tennessee is another state just passed constitutional carry I can't figure out why that's the only issue that they will fight for to the to the degree that our country existed in 1789 when it comes to guns it's it's kind of shocking I mean I'm all for that but why can't we have that on the other issues I just don't get it meanwhile we have more stuff going on at the border the Uvaldi mayor told me his schools in his city have to be on lockdown because of three pursuits into their town more than are coming armed crazy stories going on there so we're gonna be covering that another story I'm working on I just wanted to let you know where are the girls so if you notice the border from the border invasion if you look at the facilities they're all boys every one of them you could find in Donna Texas a family unit facility with parents but where are the single girls it's not that they're not coming usually this split is about 70 75% male but there are unaccompanied females on a company so to speak they're not really of course because they're being self-trafficked I'm working on this but from what I'm hearing there are no girl facilities they come with a phone number and DHS calls up that phone number and someone comes down and picks them up sex traffickers our government is complicit in the sex trafficking operation again where are the girl facilities where are they being held I don't think you'll find any so that's a story I'm working on it's a lot of other sundry things that I'm not gonna have time to get to today the insurrection probe is falling apart all these charges and holding people because of the capital attack people people being held on flimsy charges without bail judges are starting to get fed up it is some good news that at least you know because I didn't think they could get fair justice in the criminal justice system but at least is a modicum of that so maybe we'll cover that tomorrow this from going back to the border Raul Ortiz the deputy he is the deputy chief of border patrol so he said he confirms what we were saying all along that it's self-separation the cartels are spinning off the minors from the family and it's because they announced they're not title 40 doing them I mean this is the one thing everyone's complaining about the border the border this oh man it's terrible the facilities they're not training their fire on one thing it's title 42 I don't know why there's no united message behind that it's a little bit bizarre so that's going on there he told reporters that he anticipates more than a million encounters of migrants this year alone cost 6.1 million to stand up the processing facility in Donna Texas 6 million per month paid for by by us of course we have a country of buying for illegal aliens but that's what that issue there's also a lot more on the academic side of um COVID some interesting things going on we could try to get to either at the end of today's show or tomorrow but I wanted to get back to our guest today's guest is sponsored by Constitution coach calm you only have a little bit more time to sign up so now is your time April 25th or May 30th we are going out together on a trip to front site Nevada with Constitution coach calm for both defensive handgun and Constitution training during the day we have the best defensive handgun training you will ever get you will feel comfortable handle handling of firearm shooting from the holster clearing malfunctions really enjoying the camaraderie of fellow patriots in this audience and other patriots around the country terrific classes from Rick Green at night on the Constitution and yours truly will be there and we will also help organize and strategize some of our state team leaders for con action that network so again go to Constitution coach calm to check out the details 90% off the regular training but only if you do it through Constitution coach calm make sure you reserve your spot bring your family members I mean I don't want to hear these excuses oh my wife doesn't shoot again this course it runs again it from beginners to people that you have handled firearms their entire life you will all gain something from this course come out really knowing how to handle firearm which is obviously something that needs to be done today now before I introduce our next guest representative Rhonda Milstead from South Dakota I just want to review a little bit what happened there in the state with this female sports bill HB 1217 so obviously like all of these heavy heavy red states Republicans have insane majorities on paper in South Dakota I believe there's only about eight House Democrats and three Democrats left in the Senate there so they have just insane majorities and you would expect something as bedrock as hey men being men women being women would sail through the legislature and be signed by the governor with lightning speed and indeed HB 1217 which was introduced by Rhonda went through the House pretty uneventful the governor never raised any concerns about it although never really talked about it much went to the Senate well that's where you start having the issue with the Republicans in name only and they bottled it up in committee they had to use a smoke out what's the equivalent of a discharge petition in in Congress to get it out on the Senate floor and they got you know they did get it passed but there were a number of Republicans that voted against it and the governor announces hey I'm really excited to sign it she announced it on International Women's Day almost to tweak the left which is you know claims to be for women but then they're they're not because they think men are women too and then suddenly she lets the bill lay over a little bit and then we hear she has concerns and then she sends back this veto threat in the form of you know a modification for style which is typically only used for grammar or certain you know just provisions that were overlooked not to gut the bill but she suggests cutting the bill and they didn't accept her suggestions in the legislature and then she vetoed it and all along it's been really bizarre she hasn't really explained why she's fighting it specifically other than she's worried about legal challenges and you know she doesn't really say she's scared of the Chamber of Commerce but kind of does and big tech and she's scared of NCAA but she's not scared of them she's gonna fight smarter but doesn't say how she's gonna fight smarter she has issued an executive order and said that she is going to bar men in female sports but there's of course no teeth in it so it's a really bizarre song and a dance and as I've noted before I generally like the governor I don't have anything against her it's not really about her this is a problem that's occurring in many other states where we think we have read leadership but we really don't have conservative leadership and to the extent we do they're too scared of the business interest that now I've taken over every bastion in this country they promote cultural Marxism and no one wants to stand up to them and this is helping paint red states blue and that's going to ensure that we don't even have anywhere to escape a lot of a lot of you guys wanted to go to South Dakota given what's going on there with COVID and everything and you know the governor does deserve credit for doing a good job on that issue but what is going on what is the truth how did this bill come about why is the governor opposing it where do things stand now with us today is none other than the bill sponsor Rhonda Milstead she is in the South Dakota House of Representatives she also happens to be a small business owner she was into a real estate she served as executive officer for the Sioux Falls board of realtors she was also a manager of a real estate firm she also owned and operated a small business a cafe so really you know fly over country small business owner who joins the legislature typical citizen legislator that is just trying to make America great again in terms of its family values faith family whatever happened to that Rhonda thanks so much for joining us today well thank you Daniel I thank you for the opportunity and you kind of said you used an interesting word that I really appreciate you said bedrock and and this is a bedrock value especially for the Republican Party but in in terms of families as well it seems that this is a bill that comes in and it spun one way but the reality is it is about a family value the people that we've heard from in support of this bill and they're not just a few there are hundreds and even thousands and I'm sure the governor's heard from them as well let's say it's insanity to let males plan female teens and they want this for families you know another interesting thing we talk about South Dakota and South Dakota is a great place to live I raised my family here it's fantastic because of those values and we say right now we say we're open for business businesses are coming they want to come here we want to bring them here we want to increase our economy but at the same time we're saying don't bring your politics with you and then here we have this bill that just wreaks of family values and supporting females and our governor vetoes the bill actually she says she didn't but she did so that that's kind of what we have sure so I mean I've never seen someone so she's kind of bashful about it but resolute about it it's kind of bizarre so I want to start from the beginning here because a lot of her supporters would would give you the impression that oh she's been on top of this from day one and very supportive of it and pushing it but always had a concerns from day one and wants to do it smarter but it's kind of a retroactive argument that was conjured up late in the game when she kind of felt she was in trouble with conservatives nationally I want to start from the beginning last year because I'm glad that you talked about the family values aspect of this I find it interesting that even the Republicans that rhetorically indulged this issue they can't even speak to the family values and the sanity of God given sexuality the best they could conjure up is it's not fair for men to be in female sports which we agree with but it's like you know that that's like the ceiling to which they'll even militate against that agenda it's it's not even a family values thing it just it's not fair to females like that that's the only thing you can even get to get them to talk about but the reason I start with that is because last year you had a bill that really spoke to the family values of this this notion that you're just gonna castrate and mutilate so on impubity blockers of from minors so just a simple bill that I mean we have all sorts of health care regulations in this country that I think we both agree or sometimes too heavy-handed heck doctors are even having trouble prescribing Ivermectin hydroxychloroquine dealing with a pandemic and you know somehow we are told that that it's okay for doctors to just do stuff that is that harms the body especially the minors so you know you guys had a bill to block this so talk about the history of that bill because there's no NCA involved in that bill right there isn't but people will bring it in that will bring it in because they anytime you have something that kind of crosses cultural lines then that's what people start screaming at you and and we had the trans community come out against that bill but it was that was a bill that protected children and if you look at the people in our country if we look at other countries and we see countries doing things to children we scream bloody murder that's just those are atrocities and we don't have us to happen but yet when it happens in America now we want to overlook it and this was family thought it was about children and to have up I mean a hundred percent support from many legislators that that could see it that way it had nothing against anyone we just wanted children to be able to grow up and figure out their own life and what came out of it was many people any any even the hospitals the doctors in town there were probably 20 doctors in the room when that first hit a committee hearing in their white coats kind of intimidating saying we're gonna hurt children by this children are gonna commit suicide those are the arguments come up on that bill and on the sports bill so you could cut their stuff off you could you could you could amputate them and that's medicine I mean like we're seeing wearing a mask blocks of virus but early therapeutic treatment for it they ban I mean so so this is what you're dealing with even in red states where the medical establishment every establishment every business establishment seems to be an ex-urably against values that you know weren't even questioned until few years ago where is the governor on that bill that bill she she kind of took the same stance she did on this one after the fact that there were some problems with the bill that's just kind of an easy excuse to start it out and get you if any any person can say well I think there's a few problems with it and that way they have to avoid conversation about it or any stand on it but we have a Senate who is much more liberal than the houses and the feeling was with that bill as well as with the sports bill that it would be killed in the Senate and that one was absolutely killed in the Senate but it had to do with medicine too I mean and that the test there are tests out there and you can go either way on it but if there's any risk to a child and there the risk were testified to in committee that it could cause children to become sterile it would weaken their bone density those tests are out there I don't know why any doctor would even consider it well it violates the Hippocratic oath but I think we've seen some interesting decisions being made by some doctors this past year on what to do and not do about this virus so the governor again was very quiet didn't really support it much but then retroactively comes up with these concerns okay so now we get to this year HP 1217 you introduced it in the house you push it through it seems like it got you know overwhelming support what was the governor saying at the time the governor never said openly said anything out the bill she had sent a message through her staff back in December and January through different staff people that if if the bill got to her death she would sign it that was the only message and they were aware of the bill her attorney her general counsel had seen the attorney so they knew of the bill we didn't drop the bill until February 1st but they knew that that bill was out there that that bill was coming but they still stayed silent we had four public hearings on this bill to in the house to in the Senate nothing was brought forward on that bill to say as in the after after effect that it was poorly written it was an excellent written bill that bill is very similar to the bills that have passed in Idaho Arkansas Mississippi Tennessee's is a little different but it's a strong bill it was written by attorneys through Alliance-defending Freedom it was tweaked and kind of brought to a South Dakota level of legalese by our legislative research council there's many attorneys that sit on the house side and on the Senate side so lots of people had seen this bill and had no problems with any of the language sure and and mind you that the bill you know when people are used to Washington the bills are hundreds of pages any major bill this bill is literally just a few pages so it wasn't like it was some buried provision or complicated thing it was the meat and potatoes of the bill that she had issues with long after she kind of didn't have issues with it so could you explain what happened between the time of this bill just sailing through the house as you would expect any strong Republican legislature especially you know in a time like this when the bottom administration is really pushing this stuff you're naturally gonna have the opposing party push back very strongly in the states that they control and we are seeing that in Arkansas and Tennessee Mississippi what happened there that kind of got this derailed I guess just the message that she kept sending out the uncertainty the yeah I think that there probably were definitely influences I don't know that they came outside this from outside the state but even in committee it was the Chamber of Commerce the sports authority the board of Regents the active high school activity Association the public school district they all came out very strongly against the bill and that pressure was kept on after the bill had gotten to her desk and at that point in time to the governor's office was pressuring legislators I mean if I don't know if you saw but we had seven Republicans which their vote they voted for it in the house but when it came time to overturn the veto they voted against it but at that point in time I'm gonna be real honest it was later in the day and people wanted to go home and so I I think maybe you know the Senate adjourned at 3 30 we were debating the bill from 3 30 till about 4 10 Senate was gone seven people probably figured you know why bother because they're not gonna do it anyway so they switched their boat and and we are in service we are elected to serve the people of South Dakota we knew we had to give it a day why anybody would be a her in a hurry and switch their vote is very disappointing as well and then that comes back to our you are Republican and do you hold to these values and do you hold to your oath of office that you are there to serve the people and so that's very disappointing sure so you so ultimately you had the votes despite the defections to override in the house did the Senate vote vote at all or they just left town they left town left town they didn't know it's okay no the governor left town the governor left town and right after we delivered the message to her that we weren't going to accept that we said her style and form changes were not constitutional so could you go talk about that a little bit as well just the process of the style and form recommendation that she gave which is kind of like the way I view is a pending veto that if you make the changes it automatically becomes law but if you don't then it's rendered a veto why don't why didn't she have the prerogative to do that why doesn't she have the prerogative to do style and form yes she does have the priority to do style and form but like you said style and form is I write an essay from my English class and the teacher sends it back style and form is maybe I reversed a couple words right through an adjective wrong or I punctuated wrong best style and form but the reality of what she did is she got at the bill she completely took out two sections and rewrote the very first section she pulled which was another issue I mean the birth certificate the birth certificate we had a bill in South Dakota that you could not change your birth certificate the sex you were born with is the sex estate on your birth certificate that was another bill that got to the Senate and was soundly smashed and so the governor came back with this when she edited this bill and said well we're going to use a certificate instead of a fine form that says this is how old you are and this is what sex you are and you don't take any drugs well anybody can change a birth certificate in South Dakota so what good was that going to do and know more than if you move on to those two executive orders that say you shall or you should but nothing about you will there there's no teeth in them and both organizations have pretty much said we're going to keep doing business as usual so I'm trying to get to the crux of this debate here you know you put all these bills together you mentioned the third one now with the birth certificate so you put it all together it seems clear that both from the governor and from the liberal Republicans in the Senate that this issue is kind of a no fly zone it's just something that they will not broach they will not touch they will not end you know go after status quote doesn't seem to be any issue of technicalities but I want to try to be as fair as I can and it's kind of hard because I want you to give your side of the story where you disagree with the governor but I first have to understand the governor's position she wrote in op-ed for national review yesterday fighting smart for fairness and women's sports so I was hoping to kind of glean from there her argument of what she felt was wrong with the bill and why she feels her strategy is better and I come out not understanding either I don't even know what her strategy is she basically says that she you know badly wants men at a female sports she's done so many other conservative things in her life and she's such a good conservative and basically she feels this is smarter most of it it's really about other issues actually just how she's a really a good conservative and that's great and she's going to continue building a coalition of athletes governors attorneys general and other leaders to take on the NCAA you can join our efforts at defend title nine dot com once our coalition is large enough there is no way the NCA can possibly punish us all so I guess if I could get her strategy is something like and again I'm not trying to be cute here I I guess there's two arguments one is she saying it's gonna be challenged legally number two is that politically she feels were maybe in a weak position the business community and the NCAA has too much power you'll get mowed down now but let's build a cross-state coalition and then maybe later we can do something more but then now she issued an executive order banning men from female sports but somehow doesn't fear the NCAA doing anything for that what's your take on her her strategy the strategy is I mean it's just words it doesn't do anything I know that somebody had sent her a legal opinion several days before this veto vote had sent it to her attorney allowing males to play in sports is it's not legally defensible right from the beginning so if you're worried about having to defend something you need to put some teeth into what you're trying to write people say we're I mean that the bill discriminating gates against a certain person but really if you don't do it you're discriminating against a female who wants to play in the female specific sport I mean we live in a society where people are just gonna reach out and sue over lots of things that make no sense but it has been defended in court despite what Biden has done in his equality act has been defended judges have issued opinions that say that you can segregate sports by by their the sex that they were born with because there are significant physical differences I don't know that I'm answering your question because you want to know why I don't know what her strategy is but what I do feel is that it's just words it is words and we can say things I can say something to my child I think you said you have four kids you can tell your child not to lie you can tell your child that they should share their toys but if they don't do it you have to have consequences and so a coalition if you can put something on paper and have people sign a petition but if you don't have any any consequences behind it who's gonna listen to you the fact that she issued an executive order that says to the universities you should not allow males to play in female sports it still gives them the right to do what they want it's bizarre because it's almost like she plays two sides of the fence at the same time on the one hand she's like I'm doing something much more effective it's really good but on the other hand she's blatantly saying it has to not be effective because if it is then they're gonna retaliate and we can't have that and we're gonna lose the business and you know she openly says we can't butt heads with NCA so I don't even I honestly don't understand and I find it with some of her defenders online too is actually a long-standing friend of mine I wrote a defense of her is that PJ Media and I was really excited to read it because I was you know wanting to see what this smart strategy is and I came away from it not even being able to articulate it much less debated because I don't know what they it is I guess my question to you is you've been involved you know you you weren't really in the business community of Sioux Falls it really seems like the Sioux Falls Chamber Commerce is very much in an opposition to anything that opposes the gender bending transgender agenda how has this come about you know where I live I'm in the body of blue America on the east coast so it's pretty obvious but I look at a state like South Dakota and my question is why doesn't the business community reflect the values of the majority of the people I think that you might find I mean I know that there are people that have dropped their chamber memberships over this that's what's going to speak to the chamber I guess you you see the chamber when the chamber needs a new executive director they hire somebody from someplace else and when you bring in some of those outside influences they they do bring their politics with them that's what happens but I I do believe I mean even our tourism industry feels like people are going to reject us because of it but I I just I think that it's a false claim there's been people that have been thinking about moving here that have read read reached out to legislators I know I've seen them and say I thought you guys were grounded but apparently you aren't and I still believe that we are I think that we are a faith-based state that is grounded the majority of people are grounded are very grounded this matters to them and I think that they've sat back I think we sit back and we think that these things won't happen we talked about a little bit earlier who would have thought ten years ago that we would be talking about males playing on female teams at this particular time people just think everyone's going to do it right and so they're quiet and and they're not aware of it and then when it comes out then they're hopping mad and I think that you're gonna see that in South Dakota is that people are and you'll see it in our elections in a year and a half so that's what I was wondering that's where I wanted to kind of finish this discussion with where you feel we're headed with the legislature I'll never forget a friend of mine call me all excited after the election he's like look we did really great in the state legislatures and you talked about different states and one of them was South Dakota you know the Democrats almost got wiped off the map in the South Dakota Senate they lost a few seats they're down to three people and you look and you see almost half the Republicans were opposed to this so how does that happen over the years where there's such a disconnect between the Republican elected officials in these red states and are you hearing from people on the ground finally taking note focusing on these votes focusing on who voted that you know the right way I am and I was at a luncheon yesterday of some legislators but a lot of people that just are concerned about what's going on and they're already looking to who we're gonna primary they're talking about it they're digging for people and they have been encouraged to to not listen to words somebody knocks on your door and they say hey I'm gonna do this then you maybe you vote for him but then you watch and you see the way that they vote and I heard from one lady yesterday she said you know what that's this represented this Republican representative told me this and I watched your votes and I called her and I said you're voting like that Democrat that you told me not to vote for you're voting the same way and that's what you're gonna see and if we can but you know you can't take your eye off that ball and I'll use 9-1 is an example I've done that before 9-11 was something that could have turned our country around and made us aware of things but a few months after it happened we all got busy with our lives kind of put it out of our mind we do that here we live normal lives we you know live the happy days experience and and so we're not we're not paying attention we think things are going along really smoothly but it takes something like this to wake people up and say I should have been watching and I must start watching now because we still have a few cracks and we need to fix those cracks and feel them up for the doors open wide I think that people in South Dakota are gonna see that and they will I think you'll see in our elections Wow that I mean we're certainly all hopeful of that what will my concern is it seems like even in redder states it's just like all of the political leadership the business leadership they often seem you know the medical establishment as you mentioned they seem to be just as liberal as those from my state of Maryland it almost seems like there's no difference in the culture so the question is how do you fight back when the business interests the people with all the money who donate to the candidates and whereas in in my state let's say those type of people will be donating to Democrats because most people in South Dakota identify with the Republican Party they'll just get involved in the Republican Party in those particular states and donate to them how do you get around that the only way to get around it is by paying attention and you can still throw money at something but when it comes to the ballot box because down to the ballot box it's raising awareness that grassroots move and raising that awareness and voting for your principles and just paying attention I just that's what people need to do pay attention I mean it's that it's that simple and I think what you're basically saying is we could discuss play calls and strategies on the field you know we've been talking about sports but if you don't get on the playing field then there's not much more to talk about then then of course other sides gonna win by acclimation and you know I've seen this in red state after red state where it's only the left actually on the field no one's pressuring the Republicans to push certain things and and that's really where I wanted to end this discussion I've been speaking a lot about state legislatures my audience knows I've been obsessed with it after Democrats kind of one sort of the election at a federal level I said look you know Republicans control 31 state legislatures 19 of them with super majority use 23 of them along with the governorships there's so much you can do to push back against all the bad stuff going on the country now and I've been trying to get people focused but one of the things that concerns me and I want to get your take as a citizen let it legislator a lot of these states they pride themselves on being part-time it's just a couple months a year and then they're out it's part-time they don't really get much of a salary and that that sounds great my concern is that you guys are already out of session okay it's it's April and you guys are done with you're not gonna come back for another three quarters of a year isn't there a problem now that you have the federal executive branch controlling everything what what is left over it's the state executive branch and the courts controlling state legislators were supposed to be the voice of the people how could you be the voice of the people if the executive branches are legislating 365 days a year and you can't get in the session to invade against that to counter it well we're starting to see that that is a bit of a problem we operate and I'm thinking back in 2013 they established something called the executive board and so the legislature it elects five ten I think there's 15 people on this board half from the Senate half from the house and they carry on legislative business during the course of the summer and fall until we go back again that's how we've been doing things for that eight nine years but what it does is it gives that executive branch more strength that absolutely does and so for us to go from a part-time legislature to a full-time or even a more of a part-time it is a significant stretch for some but but it I think it might be important I think you might see that with the COVID dollars that came and with the budget process and with some of these things I you could see some changes but legislatures need to be more active ours is active through this e-board yeah we do do some summer groups but it's nothing that has a lot of strength is it as much as being there we and the other part of it is we are running for election every two years so even stretching that out to four years would make more sense because you're active in the legislature sure and then you have a summer then you're active and then you spend a summer campaigning and that hurts us as well so increasing that to four years is something that we talked about last session somebody get I'm a big fan of that I mean I think two years is is too light elections are good I love elections but the important thing is that you guys actually served and actually do something you know what happens if fighting comes out with passport vaccines you know and we just have to rely on the governors to fight back and as we see there's a lot of problems with these governors they're hooked into the same donors and establishment it's the state legislators that represent the people walk among them and you know look if I can go back to the 1800s then I'd be fine with the part-time legislature because it was a part-time executive but you can't have a super duper full-time over time executive branch federal and state level and then the the legislatures are just a bunch of nothing then what's the point so I mean I think we need to make the legislators stronger I thank you Rhonda for having the courage to introduce this hopefully you could reintroduce this and push it again push similar bills I'm really looking forward to staying in touch with you and and let's you know keep keep this audience informed as to what's going on South Dakota right absolutely and appreciate what you're doing to reach out to people thank you god bless I got bless you but so again that was Rhonda Milstead she is a South Dakota representative from southeastern South Dakota I believe Hartford South Dakota outside of Sioux Falls and folks I mean this is the thing I think in each state there's a handful of people like Rhonda more so in the house than the Senate usually that are kind of like normal people just like you and me we don't have majorities typically leadership is bad and this is where we need to fight back but we're gonna need those tools this is where we need to understand that we cannot be passive and conservative in strategy because the status quo every day is the executive branch and the courts destroying the country so this is our only way to get back in the playing field and this is what I'm trying to do with our state teams if you are from South Dakota please sign up for con action network if you want to be a team leader and head that team now is your chance as Rhonda mentioned there might be a special session there will there has to be one for redistricting anyway but with all all these dollars being spent billions of imagine like three billion dollars from the feds being funneled into a state as small as South Dakota that's going to influence the culture and trajectory and economy of the state well who's going to decide how that money is spent well if you don't it'll be the Department of Education Department of Health which we've learned is just as liberal in a state like South Dakota as it is in California so again our Constitution Action Liberty Strike Force teams are gonna focus on this and I look forward to having more of these legislators on the show to get a flavor of what's going on in the states but this is some of what we're going to do we need team leaders to meet with state legislators and county officials raise concerns or voice and support for important issues that affect our national character publishing issue briefs on legislation disseminating them to elected officials and the public engaging in your local media social media to name names of those pushing bad things and blocking the progress of good things focus on the actions of local officials who are often overlooked recruiting candidates to run for you know state legislature county could counsel sheriff prosecutor county judge school board member sheriff whatever it is conduct research for our strike force teams on legislative issues organized social media campaigns naming the heroes and the zeros pull resources together to hire attorneys and school and sue different you know corporate interest or units of government like school boards for violations of basic human rights which we're gonna have to do a lot with the COVID fascism I see research state policy and budgetary data that could help drive our narrative our agenda and also help inform these members because remember part of the problem is in states like this these people often don't have a single paid staff or if they do they have like one temporary one shared among three to five people I know that's true in the Idaho House and while we always like to say oh we want limited government but how do you have legislators with no ammo and no staff and no information to combat an executive branch that has infinite resources but this is where we are this was Kristi noam one of our better governors it's just it's the whole thing is so bizarre I don't understand it I mean I do understand it basically she's become kind of a conservative hero with COVID so she felt she needed to she didn't want to lose all of her support and just twisted herself into pretzel if you again if you understand the timeline of events what she was saying is simply indefensible and just doesn't add up we know exactly what it is she's terrified of the business interests that are totally involved in her own staff and this is the problem we need to create our own parallel universe but again to end off on a positive notice I mentioned last week Kristi noam is not wrong on one point that we do need to build coalitions cross-state lines now the way to do that is not with fluff it's with bills that have teeth in it Arkansas and Tennessee and Mississippi did this Alabama she needs to she should have worked together and get all the states to pass HP 1217 like bills so then it's not the NCAA fighting South Dakota but fighting half the country so she had the right broad idea but obviously she wasn't trying to make it work because she's bought out by the transgender lobby like we saw on some of those other bills as well so getting this is a glimpse to what is going on there you know when I first spoke to Rhonda I asked her I said look I noticed in the Senate you lost tons of Republicans so I said to her was that also you know were they influenced by Kristi noam or the chamber of commerce and she was like now with those people they always vote that way so that's the thing you have all these people running as Republicans they vote like Democrats because as Rhonda mentioned it boils down to one simple thing we are not paying attention so again getting back to our original question is this country we're saving no there's nothing to save we need to create a new almost a new country but we have to get get on the playing field we have to create our own team we've already lost years ago when we decided not to pay attention to politics and made that just a left-wing venture well they took advantage of that filled the vacuum did what they wanted so that's what I'm trying to do with these state based teams we have over 1,600 people signed up so far we need people in states like South Dakota so feel free to sign up and again if you join me out in front of the website at ConstitutionCoach.com for our defense training folks the sky's the limit in terms of what we could plot and strategize together so really looking forward to that trip as well a lot more left to this week we are just getting started so send this show to everyone of your friends relatives please give us a five-star rating at iTunes till tomorrow we'll be back same time same place stay armed stay safe stay"
