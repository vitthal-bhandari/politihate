When Freedom Calls, we're here to answer. Call us at 1-888-Freedom. We'll be glad that you did it. You can search out Clay Travis. You can search out Buck Sexton. And you can also go download the iHeartRadio app. And if you do so, you will be able to take this show anywhere in the country and indeed anywhere in the world. We got a lot still to come with you in the next couple of hours. At 1.30 at the bottom of this hour, Stephen Miller, one of Trump's top advisors is going to be with us. And he's got a lot to discuss including the fallout of the Supreme Court striking down affirmative action. What does that mean for larger governmental decisions that are being made based on race? We will discuss with him at 2.30 in the third hour of the program, Tudor Dixon, who ran for governor in Michigan against Gretchen Whitmer and lost a close race there. She now is a part of the Clay and Buck podcast network. She will be in studio here in New York City. We'll talk about what she sees in the Midwest, what has to happen in order for Michigan to flip back to a red state, what has to happen for Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and more. We're going to discuss Ron DeSantis replacing his campaign manager at some point. What does that say for that campaign? But in a moment here, I want to talk about NIO, who is an R&B singer. That would be honest with you guys. I'm not familiar with NIO's body of workbook. Would you know a NIO song buck? No. Okay. I tried. I thought I know I do not know. All right. There must be one really famous one that we've heard. Let's put producer Ali on the research train for what NIO songs are out there that we may have either you or I heard of. I would bet that a large percentage of our audience does not know NIO, but I'm going to play a clip. I think it's emblematic of a story that I write about an American playbook buck, which is we have opened up an opportunity to take over comedy on the right side of America. You just by liking to laugh, Democrats have become so self serious that they don't allow entertainers to actually entertain anymore because there might be a joke that makes somebody a little bit uncomfortable. And I write about this in American playbook. And I just want to do this off the top of the show. You guys are amazing. Uh, top of the second hour buck yesterday, we were ranked 15,422 next year. You're going to have your book out right now. We are number 38. If you guys listening to us right now can go to Amazon type in clay Travis type in American playbook. I'm donating all the proceeds to whoever the Republican nominee is. And I'm taking it a step further because I would love to be number one on all of Amazon books. This audience, I believe can take the book to number one overall. If we hit that, I will donate 10,000 more dollars to the January six political prisoners out there. You are by buying this book, helping to fight a battle for sanity. Uh, and you can also get, uh, become a VIP and you can get assigned, uh, copy. So you can go to Amazon right now typing clay Travis. If you're out there and you're not going to be able to get assigned copy, you become a VIP. You get copies. I've signed all these myself though. Get shipped out to you. I promise you you'll like them kids, grandkids. If you're having trouble talking to them about politics, I bet they will be able to read this book. That's what producer Ali said. Very accessible. And it will address many of your concerns. If you have kids or grandkids, just get them a book, tell them to read it. Um, and again, I'd love for you guys if you could to drive this to number one overall clay Travis on Amazon, type it in right now. It comes up at the top where 38. Can we take it to one? All right, Buck, big part of this book I spend talking about comedy. I like the righteous Jim stones. I think it's the funniest show on television right now. So on HBO, what do you think is the funniest show on television? No, I've never even I don't mean, you know, I know this show at all. I've never heard of this. Has anybody in the studio here? Have you anybody watched the righteous Jim stones Greg raises his hand says he, uh, look, he's heard of it. This show is really funny, but at times it will make fun of people like me who were from the south and grew up going to church. It's basically the idea is like it's a Jimmy swagger like character who has created a big church and he has three kids who are total screwups that he's trying to find somebody to be able to run the church after he is gone. The Jim stones is the name of the family. It's really funny, but if you're religious, there are things that you might find to be a little bit offensive. Um, it's a Danny McBride who I think is hysterical. He played Kenny Powers for those of you out there. What I am seeing happen and I think we're starting to build what is legitimately a tidal wave. Remember when Ice Cube came out and said, I'm not going to get the COVID shot and he did a sit down with Tucker Carlson recently. Ice Cube's a famous rapper. You're starting to see musicians. Ice Cube, I know his work. I know his body with this work. I am familiar with it. Yes. What you're starting to see is a lot of entertainers comedians in particular are saying we had Adam Corolla was it last week Buck, they're saying, I'm done with this. I'm done with cancel culture. I'm done with walking around on my tip toes, not able to say what I think. I want to play this for you. This turned into a huge story and I love the way it's turned out. But first, R&B singer, Neo, uh, commented in an interview, he's a father of multiple kids, boys and girls. And he, uh, went after the idea of transgender surgeries. This is cut to. I have no issue with, with the LB, I have no problem with none with no, but we love, we love, do what you do. Exactly. I just personally come from an era where a man was a man and a woman was a woman and it wasn't but two genders and that's just how I rocked. You could identify as a goldfish if you feel right. I care that any of my business is it becoming my business when you try to make me play the game with you. I'm not going to go fish, but you want to be a goldfish? You go be a goldfish. I can't take credit for it, but I heard somebody say one time, he's like, all right, if your son comes to you and says daddy, I want to be a girl. Ask your son son. What is a girl? What is he going to do? He's going to say, uh, well, he might, he might want to play with dolls. All right. You want to play with dolls? Fine. Play with dogs, but you're a boy. Right. Play with dolls. That's right. We're pink. I cool. We're pink, but you're a boy. That's right. Wearing pink. That's what got everybody fired up, Buck. Well, it gets him. It gets everyone fired up in the activist community in the brain wash left because it's so obviously true. Yes. This is why it's so upsetting. It's the notion that and I know he put out initially a statement and now he's walked back that statement or he said forget that he's he's recanted his his bending of the knee as I is publicist put out a statement and that's what I want to play next. Buck. So he put out a statement. I didn't mean to jump ahead. Yeah. This is great. This is this is the the whole progression here really makes you think that maybe the country is not doomed. You want to play the yeah, let's, but so here's what happened. He put out a publicist statement, Buck and everybody said, Oh, look, this rap and the R&B singer, Neo, he's bending the knee. He's doing everything. He didn't say anything wrong. Publicist put out a statement and then he came out. I love this reminds me of what Charles Barkley claimed that he was misquoted in his autobiography, which is really funny because the way that this works for a lot of people out there, most celebrities don't write books. I wrote every word in my book book. You're writing every word in your book. Most people who write books who are famous don't actually write the books, right? They have ghost writers and some don't even know what's in them. That's right. And we're turning some conservatives, but I'm not I'm not naming their I loved when Charles Barkley claimed that he was misquoted in his own autobiography. It was just hysterical. You supposedly wrote the book, bud. But Neo, you know, these guys all have publicists. They all have apparatus designed to to keep their careers rolling. Publicist puts out a statement. He says he had nothing to do with it. And he says, I ain't apologizing basically. Here's cut three. First and foremost, I do not apologize for having an opinion on this matter. If my opinion offended somebody, yeah, sure, I apologize for you being offended because that wasn't my intention. My intention is never to offend anybody. However, I'm entitled to feel how I feel. I will never be okay with allowing a child to make a decision that detrimental to their life. I will never be okay with that. I don't I definitely plan to educate myself a little bit more on this matter. However, I doubt that there's any book anywhere or any opinion that somebody's going to tell me that's going to make me okay. We're letting a child make a decision like that. That's just period point blank. And that's how I feel. If I get canceled for this, then you know what? Maybe this is a world where they don't need a neo no mo. All right. And I got no problem with that. I'm a hustler. I figured it out. I need to create a neo playlist now. Did we put it on the I hard app on looking up some neo songs. I'm excited about listening to Neo's whole body work. Look, he's totally correct. Yes. Everything he says is entirely sensible. Everything that he's putting forward here makes sense to all the people who are listening right now across across the country. And and if you're wondering like how crazy can things get? Well, first off, remember, if they can make you say that a man is a woman, they can make you say anything correct the most most foundational fundamental observation of reality. If they can make you affirm the most obvious untruth, they've got you. So that's why it's so important. It's really tied into the totalitarian mindset that has overtaken the left. But just how crazy can this get clay? This is this is one of these things I had to be told by a friend who was running for Congress up in Illinois. And she told me the story about how she went to some of the, you know, the things that can Congressmen do where they go or would be Congress do where they go and raise money. And at one of the school board meetings, and they're talking about how there were kids who were showing up who identify as animals. Yeah. Not not I don't mean that I'm not trying to like say that in a foot like they're no no seriously, they're like, I identify as a tiger. And they're young kids there are you know, 10 years old or whatever. And the school doesn't know what to do. Because why can't you identify as a tiger? If that's how you identify what's the difference if by if identification is a feeling and not a biological reality. So if you're wondering how crazy it can get, if a kid shows up and a left wing lib is the teacher and the kids 10 and says, I'm a hippopotamus, the teacher says, you know, maybe we should put you in the kitty pool like they don't know what to do. I just I love everything about this story, Buck, because we get asked a lot. How do we win? How do we change? How do things get back to the 70s, 80s, 90s, 2000s, early when people might disagree and have a variety of opinions. But nobody tried to attack you and say, you can't believe that. You get fired if you believe that you get fired if you like that you get fired if you tweet that or Instagram that or whatever. Neo, I think this is how you win. You have to get artists, musicians, comedians, television performers, movie people. Holly, it's a great story. One of my good friends who lives out in LA said, LA used to be the land of eccentrics. Buck, you've talked about how when we grew up, California was this shining beacon that all I remember how excited I was to visit California. I was so envious to me. Malibu was just I'd never even been. I thought it was paradise. One of my roommates lived in the San Francisco area and we went out to visit him during college. It was the first time I'd ever been to California. And I was so excited to get on the plane to fly to California because just the opportunity to experience California. One of this guy, he's a buddy of mine, really successfully said, you know, Hollywood used to be the place where eccentrics went. If you were a little bit outside of the mainstream, you went to Hollywood and they embraced you. They said, Hey, we love you. We want you to be here. Live creatively, create new things. We want to be the land that embraces eccentricity and creativity. Now, Buck, Hollywood is the most stultifying, the most confining, the most one party state, almost anywhere in America. And I think there are in fact, there are a lot of actors and actresses I bet listening to us right now in the LA area, we know we hear from some of them. You're starting to see a rebellion build. And that rebellion is founded on, Hey, I should be able to make whatever joke I want. Hey, I should be able to say whatever I want in a song. Hey, I should be able to make whatever kind of movie I want. And if people are offended by what I say, that ain't my thing. That's on them. And I think we're starting to see it build. I ever tell you that I was, when I was doing the six to nine syndication, which is now our friend Jesse Kelly slot. When I was doing that slot, I was talking about how I watched a Bigfoot movie that was pretty entertaining, but really violent. Like I was a little sort of, I was talking about this movie and I was giving a real critique of it on the air, you know, eight o'clock at night, I'm talking about a movie I saw. And one of the main actors was listening and called in, called in, and we actually ended up hanging out having a drink in LA later on. But he called in, he was like, let me tell you more about that movie. I was like, and I actually, because I just see in the movie, his, I mean, his voice, I could tell, you know, it was actually so anyway, you never know. But your point about actors listening. Do you feel that building, by the way, the creative community slowly starting to rebel against the idea that everybody has to have the same opinion? That's exactly right. This is, and it's important to note, for those of you who, I mean, I'm fascinated by the history of totalitarian regimes, because I think it's an important lesson for today and maybe even ties into the book that I'm writing. But anyway, one of the things that the Soviets did very early on was they co-opted all the artists. I mean, you couldn't be a real artist. You had to be an artist doing writing, painting, composing for the glorification of the Leninist workers paradise, right? Kind of like what's going on a little bit with the woke in Hollywood today. They don't actually get to be creative. They are taking orders from the regime. And that's what we see. And I think you need to be a little bit comfortable with sometimes being the butt of the joke. Laugh, laugh and enjoy. I think slowly we're making a big difference in the creative community. I really love yourself as the best. Karen and I were talking yesterday after we finished our show about how honestly your book, a man with plays a man with many endearing stories, but you're sitting alone for eight hours at your first book signing years and years ago. That's that's very enduring. Ali can testify how nervous I was driving to the book signing in New Jersey. I was like, if there's one person there, I will be happy. I'm going to Cleveland tomorrow. It went, I've got a little bit of post traumatic stress after, I mean, you sit by yourself in a bookstore for hours. Like, I'm just happy to see anybody. I definitely back in the day was a conservative who's standing in line for photos when there had been multiple speakers and like no one came after me. So that happens. But you know, now it's things change. So you just got to stay with it. Companies like Pure Talk by friends, they are doing right by their customers.

I know Rockaway Beach very well, and the woman's okay. She had to go to the hospital. Now, this freaks everybody out. It gets a lot of media coverage. Clay, can I just ask you a question? I'm not trying to be provocative here, but I'm just wondering, why do they close the beach down for the next day? Like, you're in the ocean. It's very rare. It's shark probably took it exploratory, but do you know what I'm saying? Like, it's not a murder scene. It's not like they're trying to catch the culprit. Oh, I think they try to catch the culprit, don't they? I mean, if it's a really big shark, they may try, but how tough are you? You got a rogue shark in New York City just biting people and you're like, just getting the water, kids, you'll be fine. You're like the mayor and Jaws. I think pretty much. I don't understand what we're waiting for. You just made the legit. Can we pull the audio from the mayor and Jaws, who's like, we're going to open the beach. It's July for you legit. We go over the beat. You just made the same argument. The mayor and Jaws makes I go back out there. I don't know. It's probably, you know, it was probably a, I don't know, a broading serial killing shark. Some believe all right. We'll get back into this. The artificial intelligence gold rush will soon mint new millionaires. But while everyone's focusing on chat GPT and AI stocks like Nvidia, something smart's happening less than two miles from chat GPT's headquarters. For the past few months, engineers from Google and Microsoft have been working on little known crypto projects that could revolutionize the AI industry. And you have a chance to get on the ground floor of this project for pennies may give you a chance to turn a thousand dollars into a six figure nest egg. This information all comes from Tika Tawari, the same guy who picked the number one crypto six years in a row.

If you're interested and want to participate, go to AI 20, AI coin 2023.com. That's a coin 2023.com paid for by Palm Beach research group. Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. We bring in Stephen Miller. We got a lot to get through with him. He's doing some fabulous work out there. But I want to start with this. I know you were a monster fan of Cobra Kai, Stephen. And I love it. It's karate kids spin off for everybody out there. We were just talking about the righteous gemstones. Have you ever watched the righteous gemstones? No, I haven't. Do you recommend it? I do. It's really, really funny. If you want to laugh and we've got somebody who works on the show that we're going to talk to at the bottom of the hour who's called in they film it in Charleston. Did you ever watch Kenny Powers back in the day? No, I didn't. So it's Danny McBride. I think he's hysterical. They do really funny stuff. But we're talking in general, I want to start with this because you grew up in LA. If I remember correctly. And we were talking about how LA used to be a place for eccentrics for people a little bit outside of the mainstream and they would go there and they would live creatively and try to build new things. And sometimes advance the culture and make movies and film and everything else and television shows that the larger American population could embrace. And now it's become the stultifying one party system. Yeah. LA was from the 50th to the 80s was a paradise an absolute paradise on earth. And now it's ruined. Okay, so do you get the sense? I'm just curious I'm sure you have a lot of connections still in the LA area and in the entertainment industry. Buck and I were just discussing this neo controversy where he basically says, Hey, you're a boy or a girl and then he apologizes and he says, that was my publicist. That wasn't me at all. I get the sense that comedians, creatives and film and television, certainly people who are writers in general, that there's a monstrous backlash building against this woke culture that tries to destroy tries to determine what you're allowed to say. I feel it. I really do. And I think Republicans can own this. Do you feel it? I'm curious. I do feel it. I think the challenge has always been, you know, as conservatives or even just as normal Americans, we've been wanting Hollywood to produce content that speaks to regular people for for years now, for as long as I can remember, and we've always felt like we're in the edge, run the threshold, run the precipice. The problem is and remains that those two control access to capital uniformly think one way about everything, the heads of the studios, the heads of the talent agents, you can even get a talent agent if you think like a normal person in Hollywood. So while while you can do independent projects and occasionally you have these incredible breakthroughs, you know, if you watch anything on Netflix or Disney or HBO Max or just the regular to be something anybody's still watching just sort of the regular, you know, CBS, NBC, ABC sitcoms. I mean, the writers' rooms and the actors clearly are just completely monolithic and I bet people are still terrified of of challenging that in any way, which is what makes entertainment like Cobra Kai so refreshing or makes films like I just saw the Mission Impossible Directening Part 1. And now an ounce of politics in it. It was a blockbuster action film that could have been released in 1989 with more advanced effects. But other than that, just a true blooded American film. I think while you still have that, it's just rare and rare. And I hope we're going to see a breakthrough soon. It'll be a tipping point. I just don't know how you overcome the financial obstacles. Hey, Stephen, it's Buck. I want to talk to you for a second about what you're doing over at America First Legal. Because I think this is so important. What's happening now with the usage of the law to push after the Supreme Court said, you can't just do this racial discrimination thing anymore because you want to Democrats. That's not allowed. You can't do it in schools or school admissions, which also then seems to indicate, well, why should you be able to do racial discrimination policies in hiring or in contracting or in any other aspect of public life? Isn't that also an equal protection clause violation? And you're bringing lawsuits and going after DEI training and contracting, etc. Can you tell us about where that stands? Because I think that's, that makes the Supreme Court decision something real. It's not just in the theoretical. Yeah. So this is a very important point, which is that conservatives every now and again, will win a big Supreme Court ruling and will plant the victory flag. And then we'll go on about our lives, going back to where people's various jobs and occupations are. And then we'll wake up in the morning 10 years later and realize we won the case, but we lost the war afterwards. People forget we won a big affirmative action case years ago. That's the case where John Roberts famously said the best way to stop discriminating on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race. And what do colleges and universities do? They all programmed around it. And then here we are again. We have to now go and enforce the ruling. The ruling doesn't mean anything if we don't enforce it. And not just against, as you said, universities, but also against private corporations. So we launched a hotline. It's 1877 AFL 5454, 1877 AFL 5454. We have operators full time. So if you're an American and you have been victimized by a university, a college, a corporation, or a business in this country on the basis of race, call us. And we will pursue if the fact support it, we will pursue legal action. And that's what we are doing at America First Legal. And we also, you can, you can reach us at our website aflegal.org slash hotline, aflegal.org slash hotline. So one of our lawsuits, for example, is against Amazon. Amazon has a delivery service bonus. So sort of a, if you're a delivery service partner, they call them the drivers for Amazon. And you are Black or you are Latino or you're a Native American, but you're not white, you cannot be white, you cannot be Asian, you get a $10,000 bonus. So explicitly excluded from the bonus are any drivers who are white or any drivers who are Asian. No matter how good they are, no matter how reliable they are, no matter anything, they cannot under any circumstances get that bonus, they're walled off because of their skin color. And so we sued Amazon and we'll see how that goes. That's in federal court, but it's a pretty open and shut case. Federal civil rights law is explicit and now buttressed by the Supreme Court ruling. But we need to go after every corporation has legal policies like this. And you may not realize that you're sitting in home or at work right now, you may not even realize that you could be a detention plaintiff in some of these actions. I'll give you an example. Go back to universities, John Hopkins, after the Supreme Court ruling came out on affirmative action, they announced a new essay program where asked candidates to talk about how their race or gender has shaped their life experience. Clearly, clearly it's meant to be an end run, any legal end run to circumvent the Supreme Court ruling. So maybe you have a kid right now in high school who's thinking of filling out applications. Maybe they want to go to John Hopkins. Maybe they want to go to John Hopkins Medical School. Right now, you need to get in touch with us and talk to us like today or tomorrow and tell us what's going on, what your family situation is, where they want to go to school so that we can look at those facts and see what kinds of actions we can pursue. And that applies to anyone in a corporate setting, a business setting, anywhere else. It also means if you've been subjected to a mandatory critical race theory workshop that made you feel less than because of your race, that is harassment based on skin color, violates federal and state laws. And so again, you need to get in touch with us or if you protest it, it policy at work. And you think you were denied a promotion based on that or denied a race based on that we want to hear from you. So all of this, all of this could be sued on based on the facts, but it requires patriotic Americans to stand up and call us. Stephen, I appreciate all the fighting you're doing. You've been proven to be 100% right on the collapse at the border. When you look at Massachusetts Governor, basically coming out and declaring a state of emergency, New York City mayor, Eric Adams said, and I'm quoting him, our cup runneth over that they had no more space, basically. You've seen the same thing happen in Chicago and Washington, D.C. What would a Trump administration do? Because I bet you'd be a big part of fixing this to immediately make our border secure again. Well, I do hope God bless me with the chance to be able to return to some version of my prior role in a federal administration and restore law order and integrity help restore those things with the border. I think one of the first things that you would need to do would be to immediately re-implement all of the policies that were in place under the Trump administration. So remain in Mexico, safe third agreements, Title 42, and so on. But in addition to that, President Trump is outlined, it would be very clear here in saying that AFL, my group, America was legal, it's absolutely apolitical, has no partisan affiliation where it completely apolitical. But just talking to you here, Stephen Miller, President Trump has said that he would also invoke something known as the Alien Enemies Act. This is probably the most powerful statute on the books that has never been used. Under the Alien Enemies Act, you can instantaneously deport any illegal alien in the invent of an invasion event. And so there's a declared invasion from a foreign country. If you invoke the Alien Enemies Act, this was passed back in the 18th century and this remnant of this statute is still all the books. And President Trump has said he would use it. You can not only instantaneously deport the aliens cross in the border, but you can deport the aliens who have already entered the country under the Biden administration. You can also use that authority to dismantle the cartels. If you declare the cartels to be a foreign enemy state, then you can round up all of the cartel members all throughout the country and all of their affiliates and all their associates. And you can instantaneously deport them too. So it's a combination of using this extraordinary new tool and then putting back into place all the policies already exist. And the last thing, which again, President Trump has talked about, is using state and local law enforcement, using the National Guard, using other federal law enforcement like the DEA, the FBI, the ATF, etc. And you create this vast force that you can then go around into the country and start ejecting all the people to buy them that in. Because it's not enough just to stop all the new people. You have to go eject everybody that Biden has allowed into the country. Stephen, keep up the good work. I'm telling you, I think you'll like the righteous Jim Stones. There's humor making fun of religious people, but they make fun of everybody. And I think again, we should become the party that likes to laugh because the Democrats certainly are putting forth laughable policies, but they ain't enjoying just a good old laugh from comedy. Appreciate the time, man. Amen. Thanks, doctor. Look, we just talked with Stephen Miller, who worked in the Trump White House. Trump White House was filled with a lot of people with testosterone, a lot of men who wanted to do their best to protect this country and make it as the best version of itself. You feel the same about the Biden administration? I don't. I feel like the Biden administration probably has the lowest level of testosterone and the men that work in the White House in the history of our nation. It's not even hyperbole. You know, your testosterone levels declined by 50% over the past several decades. And many men out there today, as a result, don't have the same VIM vigor vitality that you might have had in the 50s and the 60s. And before, how about getting your testosterone backup?

We got to send some checks to some good folks, do an important things. So get out there, get those books. We have some calls, I believe, that are coming in. Clay, who do you got on the board there? Yeah. Alex in Charleston, South Carolina, I was talking about how we need to be embracing comedy on the right side of the political spectrum since the left believes that jokes that hurt people's feelings shouldn't be able to be made. And I was saying, I really like the righteous Jim Stones. And it's a show that's made in Charleston, South Carolina. Alex is calling in. He works on the show. I'm curious, are you hearing other people who've grown up in the South and maybe grew up going to religious, large religious churches, right? The sort of the Jimmy Swaggart style, which this show is a send up of in some way. What's the reaction that you're hearing from people? So hey, nice to be with you guys. Good fan. So the majority, the crew is from South Carolina, Georgia, North Carolina, and the people above the line. So the pyrops are usually New York and LA, some South Carolina. But I mean, the show, the crew has a smack on it. Everybody, political, walk in life. There are some rabid leftists that would probably never talk to me again if I found out I was a Republican. But everyone just wants to make a good show. And the thing about it, about the majority of these issues, as I was surprised with, is how more moderate people really are that you would think are typical leftists, and that they are able to see the absurd of what the Biden administration is doing. And I'll give you an example. One of the higher-ups, I'm not going to name names, above the line, came up to me randomly, unprompted, and basically picked my brain about the whole Department of Energy official, the guy who's caught stealing luggage. And this talk to me about how absurd and ridiculous, and just couldn't believe that this was enough government official. And I kind of, you know, just joked around, I was like, you're just hearing about this now, but secretly I was like, oh man, I can't believe this guy just came up to me and talked to me about this, because you would never expect it from this kind of person. I mean, the goal of the show, and I don't know exactly what your role is, but I appreciate you calling in, and I know it's filmed in Charleston, the goal of the show is to make people laugh of all stripes and persuasions. I think that's fair to say, right? And that used to be the goal, as we were talking to Stephen Miller, in the 80s and the 90s and the early 2000s, when I was growing up, it felt like, you know, sort of the goal was the South Park mantra, where everybody gets made fun of, Seinfeld, everybody kind of got made fun of, and then we turned into a bunch of interest groups where you're not allowed to make fun of certain people. This feels like a repudiation of that, and like everything can be mocked. Absolutely. And one of the things that I love about the job is that I have fun every day, and everyone on the crew has fun every day, and I can tell it, and no one's sitting there feeling, you know, ostracized or put in the corner, and that everyone just wants to make a great show that makes people laugh and entertain. And I think that shows in the comedy, and I'm so glad you enjoyed it. I never expected to hear you say you love the righteous gemstones. Is that well, you just so you sold me on it, buddy. This is I've never I even heard of this show. It sounds great. So I'm going to check this. What channel is this thing HBO? It's HBO. All right. We just finished, we just finished the third season. I've been with the show all three seasons, and we just got renewed for the fourth season. So go watch it. invite Danny McBride to come on the show. We'll have him on clay and buck. Thank you for the call, but should we play you as the mayor or should we play this when we come but we'll play the time we have time we'll talk about where we'll put it out there to everybody. Are you with me? Would you go swimming at Rockaway Beach, even though somebody got bitten by a shark, or you know, do you think that there should be some artificial like, well, if we wait a couple of days, there won't be sharks. I'm just pointing out it doesn't make any sense. The sharks are still out there. Look, if there's an 18 foot great white or something, I would say maybe we wait till it passes through. You know, maybe the seal colony will get whittled down a little bit, but you know, in the meantime, if I if I had you told me today, I'm going to come on the show and buck is going to turn into the mayor of Amity in jaws demanding that the beach be open no matter who gets bitten and eaten up, I would have never believed it.
