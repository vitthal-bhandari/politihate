    "text": " this past weekend let's connect that boom boom all right oh yeah thank you guys happy Monday happy Monday August 28th the year 2017 a lot of years huh a lot of years in the books this one's coming in hot coming in hot boy it's coming in wet we're celebrating dark days right now it's what we're trying to do I just want to send some some love and some light and some thoughts and prayers out to everybody that's affected by Hurricane Harvey you know and they make it sound so nice Harvey you know what's Harvey gonna do you know oh Harvey don't ever do nothing you know they make it sound like a like a you know a fellow in the neighborhood that you know still lives with his parents oh Harvey you know collecting bottle caps and doing that you know Harvey opened up his own window wash and business and they went out of business you know friggin Harvey stealing all the Christmas candies but then that's not what it is you know and it shows up and it's more violent a lot of times in its name and and my thoughts and feelings and everything go out to those people in Texas that are struggling if you have family members down there in Houston you can make a donation you can text Harvey H A R V E Y to 9 0 9 9 and then I'll make a $10 donation you can also I believe to the Red Cross you can also look online JJ Watt who is a I mean a just a volatile beautiful you know capable caveman from the NFL from the National Football League has started a fundraising program you can look it up online you can donate there as well but I'm happy to be here with you guys today you know that rain that rain comes in and it's heavy that rain comes in and it's heavy and if you're dry today and you're able to drive down your street or get out of your home you know for you that's probably you know you're probably doing better than a lot of people you know a lot of people down there struggling and I'm gonna find some other ways that I can donate but thank you guys for being here with me today I remember when I was young I was a heavy sleeper I was a heavy sleeper man I mean I would dream that I was sleeping and that's when you're dreaming that you are asleep you know that's that's heavy that's double sleep you know you you know you're under two realms of of brain peace and so that's where I was at and I remember one time I fell asleep and a lot of rains came because I grew up in Louisiana and a lot of rains would come and and one time the baseboards or whatever the thing was rotten at our place and and the water came in while I was resting and I remember it getting all on the floor and enter to and I've been resting in my mother's room and she had a package of I guess you know I don't know how to say this appropriately but feminine care sticks you know those feminine care sticks that women use and and that some men might even use I don't even know what's going on these days but you know these feminine care sticks and that were still in the packages and they had gotten you know a box of them had gotten caught in the water whatever they were floating all around the room and they had a bunch of a sack of marshmallows because I sometimes I'd have me a little bit of marshmallows you know before I go to bed or or just I'd keep a sack by my by my bed sometimes and they had a sack of marshmallows that had you know the water had opened up and there was just all these feminine care sticks and marshmallows kind of floating around the room and they had they had the neighbors cat was over and was kind of kicking these feminine care sticks around the water and and it was it was wild because I was so scared but here this cat was finding so much joy you know snacking on these marshmallows and kicking around these feminine care products around the around this little lake that had formed in our home so you know what I'm just saying is sometimes you just even though it's tough you know find those bright moments you know even when the rains when the water gets deep I had a friend I texted a friend in Houston to check on him see how he was doing and he sent me back a picture of this cage in Navy and that's people that have these airboats that are able to get out into neighborhoods and help people out and you see a lot of it I mean it's just I mean it's that's a neighborhood Dunkirk right there that's neighborhood Dunkirk flaring up you know when you got a fellow just showing up at your doorstep you know bringing you pizza or you know cold water or the phone charging whatever I mean and that's it's beautiful to see how people helping each other out but he sent me a video of in his own neighborhood you know of a boat going by is pretty just interesting to see you know something you normally wouldn't see in a neighborhood you know you don't see a lot of boats on streets so that was interesting man and I appreciate him sending that in but my thoughts and in prayers and well wishes go out to all those people struggling down there in Texas and and I'm looking forward to making more donations as those opportunities arise but Harvey you know the name at Harvey and that's what I don't like about some of these storms you know because if you're as a senior citizen you sit in there and you hear oh Harvey's coming you know what's Harvey he's harmless you know Harvey sounds like that boy in the neighborhood that never really got it together you know that maybe that boy that had a you know he had a flick of a tism in his brain or something light you know he still live with his parents and he was always you know doing small businesses pressure washing or you know painting people in the neighborhood would hire him to paint stuff that didn't need to be painted just so Harvey could get him a little bit of pocket money you know or Harvey would always be you know that you know Harvey never got it together you know he's still living in his parents basement in his thirties you know and he you don't invite him to the Christmas party because he steals all the Christmas candy and they give it a name like that Harvey that sounds like it could be a miscreant or a door-to-door salesman but then it shows up and it's violent and sometimes I wish they would start giving these these storms names that showed who they were you know you know here comes Manson you know here comes Ray Lewis you know what about that here comes Ron our test is coming out you know see who we got you know this Timothy McVay this storm you know give him something at least he's gonna put if you're a senior and you hear Harvey's coming might not be as aware you might not hide the cat on top of the cover but if you hear that you know that Lee Harvey Oswald is showing up you know you might be makes him different different adjustments in your home so it's just alarming you know when it's sad and I'm not trying to make light of the scenario that people are dealing with but I've been through some water times and they're really tough but it's amazing to see if you can if you can find him and you can find the joy to see you know what people are doing to help each other out and when we're far away instead of pointing fingers and thinking about this or that what we can do is to donate you know because money helps money helps at all I thank you guys for joining me on this Monday August 28th 2017 you know it's crazy to see winter is coming you know winter is coming and mother nature you know she lifting her dress up and she got a cold crotch and we're about to see some of that wrath show up you know and people talk about these you know the climate change and the warming and this and that and who knows you know how much that's affecting us at this point exactly in certain areas you know I was in Canada in Vancouver this weekend and there were some drunk girls who were all fired up about global warming saying we want beaches you know we sick at the winners we won't beaches out here and it's like look you can't have beaches just so everybody else can suffer in the world but outside of that I was in Canada this weekend I had a good time I went up to Vancouver we had a fantasy football draft a destination draft so every year my fantasy football league one of them we do a destination draft we pick a city and we all fly in and we meet up and we do our draft we've done some you know we've done Austin we've done Chicago New York where else New Orleans Los Angeles San Diego some other places Miami and we hit up Vancouver and Vancouver's the kind of city it's it's a small city I mean you can almost walk everywhere and you kind of feel like you're just waiting for the city to get going that's what I kind of felt like you know it's a small city very friendly as people I mean friendly men and women if you's talking to men or women it just there's a nice vibe in there you don't feel like anybody's putting on airs or trying to be too cool for school you don't feel as much pomp and circumstances you do here specifically in Los Angeles you know where you go to a bar to a night event and everybody's trying to be that fancy cat you know everybody trying to get you to you know smell their breath to let you know that they had the best tune of that night you know they trying to get you to take a hit off that albacor off their tongue but you don't feel that up in Vancouver it just felt like a good vibe friendly people kindness everywhere you know you stop and ask somebody for directions they take you there I mean you know we asked for directions to this beach and somebody just took us there I mean it was a couple of miles it was 15 minutes you know but it was captivating little city you're just kind of waiting for the city to get going you keep feeling like oh there should be more of a an energy or a bustle but people there just more at peace you know and I've always thought Canada was a very peaceful place but I was you know like and New York's kind of gotten that way New York it's gotten so I don't want to say gentrified because I don't know if gentrified just means white but whatever the financial version of gentrified would be it's gotten so greenified modified that in New York you don't even get mugged anymore you know you got to go up to you know north of Harlem they even get mugged you know in New York it's like you walk around these days and it's just everybody's it's just a bunch of business people people with money you know you almost want somebody almost have to ask somebody to you know fuck you up a little you know stab me a little or something just you know call me a pervert and you know hit me in the back of the knees with a broomstick could just if you want to get that vibe that you know that New Yorkie you know mug me you know I want to feel something want to feel like I'm in the city and you can't get that in New York proper anymore in Vancouver you're always you're just kind of waiting for it to pick up but it's just a peaceful city there's just peace going on we had a nice time though we had a great fantasy draft there we went out to this place called kits beach they have a beach and it's it's it's like right on the edge of the city and there's people out there just enjoying themselves it almost looks like you're in heaven I mean it's extremely multicultural and you're out there and everybody's just enjoying themselves everybody seems to be having a good time it definitely seems like they like kind of the heaven you were picturing your brain you know there's like there's mountains in the background and there's there's city there's skyscrapers and you know even the homeless people seem to be on the uptick you know like they were like they can still at least remember the homes they had you know they can at least still remember maybe a two-bedroom to bath that they used to spend time in you see the homeless people in America there you know it's just like they just been you know boiling soup in their own eye sockets you know half of them don't you know like they've been gargling their own bile you know the homeless people here there's tattered they've been through the ringer they've been through the you know they've been caught up in the dark arts for too long they don't even remember how to use a faucet you know a lot of me take them by a sink and they just you know they'll urinate or just jerk off into it but you don't see that up in Canada you see people even the homeless people they're ready for homes again you know they know they're not going to be homeless forever you know hell half them probably just camped I mean these people love the outdoors in its summer time but if you get a chance to go to Vancouver you want a nice getaway for you and your lady the nightlife was pretty chill it was chill nightlife which for me these days is good you know I'm not out there trying to find erroneous you know female tits and doing cocaine out of people's buttocks and all that you know I'm trying to be more relaxed and and so we had a nice time but a good fantasy draft I got a good team one of my buddies lost his mind and I hadn't seen this in a while one of my buddies the three guys went and they got themselves a chocolate bar from one of these marijuana outlets you know in the marijuana these days when I was young that marijuana it was just that brown that dirt you know I mean hell this shit half of it had was pine you know that was one of the flavors it was pine you know I mean this shit somebody could just cut it in their front yard earlier that day the stuff you were buying when I was a kid and you'd smoke it in the dark he had no clue what it was if you half the time you didn't even get fucked up you just acted fucked up and that was that marijuana back then but now these kids you know these young buckaroos they're hitting on this this stuff you know it's like it's like lying the witch in the wardrobe this stuff will take you to Narnia you know this stuff I have you fall out of the back of your own out of your own brain closet into the end of the next realm and they had a guy in our league who had never or who said he had smoked weed a long time ago I think he was still trying to live a little and catch that vibe and he ate a little bit of chocolate dude he started geekin he started getting lifted you know you could you could almost hear his brain stem just detaching from his spine this dude was just a human balloon just floating around the room he had to start marching he started marching took his shirt off dude fucked up people like to take their shirts off huh because they got to get out that cage boy let me out this cotton cage I'm fucked up this polyester this polyester can't hold me this dude was lifted and gifted you know he was feeling that vibe dude he could feel the vultures just start to play in tug-of-war with his um with his cerebellum and he was getting lifted dude and he's not like that kind of guy you know he even texted even sent the group text we're all sitting there in the room he sends the group text a text saying I'm having severe adverse reactions from marijuana at this moment and he said he did that just so he would have documentation of it like this dude is like a research kind of guy you know he likes that documentation but man he had his shirt off he had us call him the the place where he bought the chocolate bar he only have one square and he got bent he got bent out boy he got bent out he was catching uh he was catching um he was catching levels you know he was on that third fourth level dude he was hitting warp zones he was fighting bowser in his brain he started marching around the room in a circle the room made a full circle we could go into the bedroom and then come out through the bathroom back in the living room in this hotel room and he he he hit that circle I mean he was out there like Usain Bolton on them vote on that voltage boy on that plantography you know in that garden that was just growing up through his soul that we and that shit was powerful to watch dude we had to pray with him he we had to do a prayer circle this dude we bought on a bunch of orange juice we had him in the shower he was marching in the shower so anyway we got to dinner late we got to dinner late that night well we did our fantasy draft we had a good time in Vancouver I would recommend Vancouver it's not the not it's not as crazy nightlife if you would think but some great hiking extremely wonderful people I met a lot of fans just being out and about had some great seafood um and just a fun safe place if you want to get out to a vibe I mean I feel like I could have slept on the concrete out front and I would have woke up and somebody would have um probably put a couple of blankets over me and maybe even put them ear ear drums in my ears to make sure that something didn't wake me up it was that kind of environment where people just seem like they were helping each other out but we watched the fight man I don't know if you watch the fight or not man it was good huh it was interesting I mean right out of the gate I was thinking did you see the referee did the referee looked like first of all I look like he was just talking to Connor but I guess maybe the rules need to be readressed to him because it's you know boxing straight boxing is in his deal but the referee look like every Greyhound bus driver I've ever had if you saw that gentleman or not that beautiful and he had that booty like a that that DS booty you know he had that down syndrome booty and a lot of um you know some of you guys know one of my better friends growing up Derry had DS and down syndrome popular disease and he had it and he he was uh you know we used to do each sandwiches and stuff and do a little bit of you know light ghost hunting and stuff like that by the Ramada when I was growing up but but man this referee looked like every Greyhound bus driver so out of the gate I was like I'm into this thing you know this this fight feels already familiar it was exciting man it was exciting the ring girls looking lovely and at first I felt so nervous I don't know if anybody else felt that but for the first like I mean the first two rounds I was so nervous and I I can't even feel why you know when I think back like why am I why do I feel this way I think I was just nervous because you know McGregor was seemed so out of his element you know even his stance and everything it was just he looked so vulnerable to me you know what I don't know a ton about boxing I don't know a ton about fighting I know that both these guys are masters in their universes but it made me nervous man I was nervous for him you know the first two rounds and then after a while I just felt like you could see the flaws were just they were natural flaws in Conners he didn't have any finishing moves you know he didn't have that that Hayuk and he didn't have that power he didn't have that power play he did you know he had just a lot of these straight punches and you know I was just like where's that finish a move at one point I'm just like just you know throw a kick daddy you know throw a knee burst but he didn't have a finishing move and that kind of I feel like made it a little bit tough and I wish that I know he at the end of the fight he said you know I wish they were to let us go to the mat where one of us fell one of us hit the dirt and I think at the time he probably thought that but this morning I bet that he was probably glad that it didn't happen that way you know that it didn't go down like that that it ended how it did and it's really interesting to see I hope I you know I want him to fight somebody else next Andy Dick you know who else could he fight a rod I'd love to see him take on a rod I'd love to probably see him I'd love to see him honestly beat Chris Paul's ass you know if he going against if he going against Chris Paul I'd love to see you know or Martina in Avrita Lova you know some of these people that want to be young Gunners and get in there but we'll see man it was it was exciting I I wonder if maybe in in the original agreement if he would have asked for an MMA referee that was something I was thinking like what do you've read it like an MMA referee who maybe you know might have at least been able to judge and referee the fight a little bit more you know not to his liking but in a comfortable manner I think it would have made it a little bit more fair I mean it was it was heavily favored to Floyd whenever you whenever you look whenever you were looking at it like even when I when I first came on I was like wow okay this is this is boxing you know this is an MMA at all I mean this is boxing and you really saw somebody step outside of the comfort zone I mean it's really inspiring you know you saw they had a lot of videos and stuff of these guys doing the after-party and really having a good time and but yeah I mean I was look I was I was nervous it was exciting to watch you know but it was inspiring like man mate I want to work out hard you know I want to do something I want to step outside of my comfort zone you know I want to be a baker you know I'm saying I want to challenge you know I want to challenge a mother fuck on some donut level you know I mean want to step outside of my comfort zone you know I want to wake up and you know in in in four months I want to go you know toe-to-toe with the archeologist you know bitch where are these bones I'm out here are you digging I'm digging you could shovel I could shovel it made me want to kind of change up and feel inspired and then this morning I just you know pretty much that a little bit of that left me because you know inspiration man that stuff you have to be reminded man I wish you could have inspiration like an IV a drip bag of inspiration that's what I need a lot of times because I will feel inspired and then it will go away it will go away but good to be here with you guys hope you guys had a happy weekend I was in Vancouver I flew back this morning had a couple of sets tonight at the comedy store and at the

guys being supportive and sticking with me we got a lot of great calls that came in and I want to just get right into them and some of them are really really interesting so let's crack in to the hotline calls right now the number is 985 664 9503 if you're down in Texas and you had an experience from the rain you know where you saw something go on that you thought was pretty remarkable and I'd love to hear a little bit about that you know that's one of the things you can hit the hotline with as well if you're just going through something and you want to share it you can hit the hotline with that anything that if I've been through it as well I'm happy to share you know I don't have advice but I do have suggestions and I do have my own experiences so that we don't have to feel alone all right let's check in with this first call right here hey what's up they owe this is Tim from Tennessee all right Tim from Tennessee I can hear that I can hear that jingling in your in your jungle man and your neck and your neck instrument you know that vbox baby I can hear you spouting off that sweet southern you know you got that molasses in you and your sound canal let's hear more I'm calling about an issue I have so I have this cousin who's trying to be a rapper a Christian rapper actually he's got a cousin trying to be a Christian rapper man that's that's wild baby you know you know it's whatever I don't really like Christian rap saw pretty much terrible but if that's what you know people get all of that and it helps them you know go for it but problem is that he's he's terrible you know wow the problem is is that he's terrible man he dropping hymns and spinning rims baby you know what I'm saying he's caught up in that CR son that Christian rap having babies with virgin ladies part in seas and Negro please y'all turning up out there in that Bible belt he's dropping it off huh and you think he's terrible well look I feel you man I have friends that have thought that I think are terrible at stuff that do things you know and and I'm gonna stop you right there but I'm guessing that you're just wondering how to handle it and here's what I say what do you lose by him giving it a shot you know he's gonna go as far as he's gonna go with it you know he could be great there were times for years when I was not good at comedy and if somebody would have really said that to me I might not have kept going and I'm not saying that I'm great today but I'm saying today that I can do my job and I bet I and I can I can say that I do my job well but you know you just can't take away his hope so I think if you can offer you know if you have constructive suggestions fire them at him because dude I mean this guy is getting into a crazy game I mean I know there are some Christian rappers that are that are popular I think most of them are black so it'd probably be good to see some you know some diversity in the market could be good I'd love it if actually you could hit the hotline and and drop one of his tracks and maybe we could even start one of the podcasts off with it next week so if you have the ability to do that or you can email it to me at theo Vaughn T H E O V O N at Mac M A C dot-com but I appreciate you calling and saying this you know and you got to think that Jesus balled out you know I mean he was a rapper in a way if you want to think it whether you think about him as a the Savior you think about him just as a human being I mean I do was you know spitting in the desert Jesus was dropping lyrics in the desert you it's hard to even keep moisture in your mouth in the desert so at the very least boy he was a him and him if you feel me it's hard to even keep your tongue wet in the desert and he was roaming around dropping tracks dude you know so I mean there's some respect there you know I mean that's real stuff so I just support his ability to try something different trying to be too hard on a buy-up some gold teeth you know maybe maybe make it something that you enjoy you know buy some gold teeth like you know five gold teeth and spell out you know H Y M N S and put them him put that hymns in his grin you know or get him a gold necklace with three nails on it you know it's hard sometimes with family you know to support him because for some reason family when they do some shit it will drive you way more crazy than friends do you know I mean my first my sister used to she did one of those things on Facebook one time where it's like I'm gonna say something I'm thankful for for the next 700 days and man I wanted to speak up I wanted to say I feel like that's crazy but it doesn't matter what I feel you know so I'd find a way to embrace it you know maybe get a tattoo on your back of him fucking dropping mad tracks you know the lamb boy the lamb of GZ boy you know he's spitting straight fire wool you know so see what you can do there man of support and just don't take away his hope I think you can offer him some suggestions if you feel like it or ask him if he wants suggestions but don't fire him off and take away his hope maybe see if you could be a background singer that shit would be hilarious because then you're embracing it you're part of it so I'd find a way to embrace it if my brother came to me and said he wanted to be a Christian rapper dude I would gain about 150 pounds and put on a core address that them thick them thick girls them girls they got them you know them you know they got them them bassists you know they got that deep throat you know where they can gargle them they can gargle different sounds down there you know and I would put on a big robe and I would support my brother I'd be hitting them back round Jesus without any fuck desert dank dank dank dank dank dank dank three days three days later I'm back back back back Easter Easter play that backup baby you can help him out good luck with it thanks for calling onward next caller what's up Theo Johnson Josh I'm out here in Charlotte North Cackalack I'd like to see you come down to the comedies on here in Charlotte. I'd be cool to see you, man. I've been there before to Charlotte and the only time I was there I was there for at the Comedy Zone. I had a good time. I'll be back next year. I don't know the dates. But I saw Cam Newton. I was there for 40 minutes. I've been in town. I'm sitting on the on the out door patio of a McCormick and Schmick's. I'm sitting on the on the out door patio of a McCormick and Schmick's. Having me a little salad. And Cam Newton went by with a baby carriage. Pushing his son. He had a newborn. Already been a few months old and he's pushing the son in a baby carriage. And at first I thought it was a homeless guy because he was, you know, you don't see a lot of adult men at all just pushing a baby carriage by themselves down the street. And he also don't see a lot of adult black men. At least I'm not used to seeing that. Pushing a baby carriage down the street and he had on this, you know, kind of a Gucci hat and a scarf. And I'm like, dang, this dude might be homeless. But then he got close and I was like, holy shit, this dude is Cam Newton. So you never know, man. You never know when a homeless person might be Cam Newton. You never know when you might be surprised. Onward. You know, some advice from if you could help me with something. Started dating this girl and she's a bit of a squatter. Oh, okay. So you hitting them. You hitting them water works, baby. You passing. You passing. I don't know if it's Baltic Avenue or Marvin Gardens and you hitting them water works with the ladies. Okay. You know, this is kind of an edgy topic, but we're going to try to field it here. Thank you for calling onward. I always thought that was cool at first, you know, especially when I see it like it was in pornography or something, but. Yeah, them sprayers, you know, them gunners. You know, remind you going to the fair. When you play that game, you try to shoot that thing and get that animal from that old man. And I do usually probably look like you have some kind of a skin cancer or lung cancer. But onward, I know what you're talking about. Man, after a while, she's getting, I don't know, man. I have to change the sheets all the time and go into the store and get detergent. And these people are probably like, still got a lot of clothes or something, you know. Yeah, with detergent and also buying detergent, detergent, a lot of people think you might be cooking it down and doing some kind of new dope. And that's one of the issues I run because I, you know, I've at times in the past, I had me a little bit of an apron habit. You know, I get that apron and I use the suggested dose. Now, I'm not riding outside of my suggested dose circles, but man, sometimes coming around 11 o'clock, dude. You know, my hands start feeding for a hit off that apron for a hit to, you know, get my nasal passages sedated. But yeah, I can feel you, man. So you deal with a lot of extra laundry, a lot of extra laundry because you got old faithful in the bedroom. Onward. But I don't know if you can give me so many advice on that, man. It's just like, it's just a mess, man. And I really like the girl too. But, uh, all right, man, how do we do? You know, it's interesting, man, because I met a girl years ago who had, she'd moved to town. She dated one of the Jonas Brothers. I don't know which one. There's three of them. I think they all down looked the same. Beautiful young man. From what I remember, I never looked at them very closely. But this gal, uh, you know, she was, she was really in it. You know, she had that extra plumbing. And some girls, they just got that wild piping where they'd be spraying out a little. And yeah, first you're like, oh, this is a party. You know, daddy's here. You know, I'll do what I'll wash dishes down between this gal's legs. You know, but then after a while, it's, that ain't no joke. You know, that's a, it's a liability. You know, unless they're, you know, putting extra use to some of that activity, like their water and plants or, you know, refilling the fish bowl, it can be a bit overwhelming at times. You know, so I don't know what you do because you don't want to make her feel bad because this is a natural thing. And look, we all have things naturally about us that our love, when our spouse doesn't like. You know, it could be that you clear your throat or you pick your nose while you drive or that you have a lot of body gas. And sometimes if I don't sleep well, I'll get a little extra body gas. So, you know, I know that I can be, you know, I have things about myself. But maybe find some other ways you guys can be sensual without hitting that gasm, you know, without a, you know, hurricane Harvey stopping by y'all's bedroom every night. Because that can be wild, you know, so maybe talk to her about it. See how she feels. Because yeah, otherwise you got to keep a stack of towels there in the bedroom and you got to really sound off. Otherwise, other than that, I'd say make it fun. You know, put a couple of barrels. They used to have this thing, little buckets. They used to have this show called the Bozo Show or something. Where if you got a thing in a, you threw these balls, if you got it in a bucket, you got to a Subway sandwich. And they'd have children on there. And this might have just been locally, but they had this guy, Bozo the clown or somebody. The grand prize game, you throw these ping pong balls at these buckets. If you got it out to the five bucket, then you got you maybe a Subway sandwich for your whole classroom of children. So maybe do that. Maybe make something fun or cute about it. You know, we just make two nights a week where y'all do six and that's the activity night. You know, and this show up prepared. Put floaties on. You know, be a baller. You know what I'm saying, dude? Get that Michael Phelps neck piece. Do something, you know, but I think instead of, you know, if you want to keep her and you do care about her, then you're going to have to find a way to make it comfortable for you and then not talk to her about it in a way that makes it uncomfortable for her. Man, that's a tough one. That is a tough one, man. And if somebody, somebody out there has a good advice for this gentleman, you know, about his, about his damp damsel, if we will, then hit the hotline and let them know. And I'll try to do a follow up episode this week where other people can give you some return advice about that damp damsel and how to handle that. But yeah, it's interesting because the things you see in pornography, man, you get those things in real life, dude. That's not, that's not the same thing. You know, if like you got a girl out there, they had this one thing, you know, years ago, some girl was eating a, she could eat donut holes with a hoo-ha. And yeah, that's great. You know, that's cool on a, you know, on a brunch, maybe a Sunday brunch, you know, you partying with your new girlfriend, you know, and you having you a little bit of fruit or some, you know, a yogurt and she doing, she hiding donuts, you know, she calorieing up. But dude, come, you know, a couple months of that, you having to run to the store all the time and get donuts and shit, that shit's crazy. And what if her hoo-ha starts to upscale and that thing wants a butter finger or a payday, you know, or a hundred grand or a thousand grand? That thing starts hiding which of McCollum's and all men joys in its cheeks. Dude, then you're talking, I mean, then you're talking the dark arts. So the things you see in pornography, sometimes they can escalate when you get them in real life. But I would approach it in a way, if you do talk about it with her in a way that's comfortable for her, you know, cause you just don't want to make her feel bad because once she starts feeling about about her body, that's going to be uncomfortable for everybody, man. You know, but good luck, man. I appreciate you calling in about it, brother. Whoo! You partying out there, dude, wherever you are, North Cackalack, I ain't partying. All right, next caller, onward. What's up, buddy? This is Nathan from Kansas City. This is Nathan from Kansas City. I just picked your defense in my fantasy football league. I hope they do well. Onward, Nathan. I just had a quick question for you, man. I grew up with two real good friends of mine and it kind of slowly just came apart. And I believe that they're actually pretty upset with me. Now, I'm not sure what it is that they're upset about, but I would like to sit down man to man and kind of talk it out. Okay, so you grew up with two good friends and they're really upset at you, but you're not sure what they're upset about, and you'd like to sit down man to man and talk it out. That's what we got so far, onward. And they don't miss the phone. They don't like calling the text messages. So I'm kind of at a loss of what to do, and I'm hoping maybe you could help me out with some advice on this up here, man. Love the show. All right, thanks for calling, man. Love the show, man. I appreciate you enjoying it. I love you, brother. I want you to feel good about this, dude, but it sounds like you know they're upset. They're calling you. You know they're upset, but you don't know about what? You know, and I don't want to, I don't want to say I don't believe you, man, but you got to have some inkling. You know, if you know they're upset, you know, but you're not sure about what, you probably got to have some inkling. You know, and if they don't want to respond to you right now, then, you know, obviously, if it's two of them, you know, they must be really upset about it. So, I mean, I think there's two things here. One, I would just give them some space. You know, maybe they're moving along. Maybe you guys don't even need each other. Maybe, you know, maybe this friendship is running its course. Or two, it sounds like there's a little more to the story. I would own up to whatever happened and go see them face to face and own up 100%. And I wouldn't own up with a butt, you know. Look, man, you know, this happened, but I felt this way. I'd leave the butt off of it. I would show up, own up to whatever you did personally. And don't ask for like, you know, if you want continued friendship, then say, look, bud, you know, I want to still be friends. I want to still be buddies. You know, I want to still split Kit-Kats together. You know, I want to still, you know, sit around and hide, dip in our mouths together and do friendship. You know, I want to still sit in a room and have your body heat be in the distance. If you still want those things, then let them know that. But you're also going to have to probably, if there was something you did, then you're going to have to apologize to it. I'd do it man to man. I wouldn't hit the phone lines. I would do it man to man. And I wouldn't say any buts. I would just apologize and let them know, look, I'd still like to be friends. You know, adult friendship, dude, this shit's tricky out here. Because adults, they get busy. Sometimes their wives don't want them hanging out with other adults. You know, people start getting jealousy happens. You know, you get a new house, but your buddy, you don't have a house yet. And he's still out there in an apartment. Jealousy happens, you know. Your buddy loses his leg and you still got two legs. And next thing you know, he don't want to talk to you because you think you're showing off by having two legs. That's crazy. You know, but adulthood friendship is hard. That's one thing that was fascinating about young friendship. To be friends when you were young, all it was was proximity usually. It's like your best friends still to this day even were just usually people that lived near you. That was it. You know, it's not like there was this big friend search where you interviewed thousands of other children when you were a child. It was just who's nearby? Oh, they are. Boom. Boom. Friendship. It's, you know, it's like a lot of it's just proximity based. So, you know, if you value their friendship, then I would make it a man-to-man apology. I wouldn't try it on the phone. I appreciate you for, I appreciate you calling up. Let's hit another call here. We're cruising through some calls, man. And I appreciate you guys calling and hitting the hotline 985-664-9500-3. I'm feeling good. I'm trying to get through this. It's 12.45 a.m. here on the Pacific coast time. I got a cool week coming up. We have David Allen Greer coming in on our podcast for Allegedly. Spencer Pratt as well. That episode will be airing this week, I believe, on Allegedly. That's my Hollywood podcast. You can check it out with my wonderful co-host, Matthew Cole Weiss. And we have, who else is coming in? It's rumored, it's rumored that Chris Hansen is supposed to be coming on. So, that can be really, really exciting. All right, let's take another call. Here we go. All right, let's take another call. Here we go. Hey, CO. This is Cody calling from Boulder, Colorado again. This is Cody from Boulder, Colorado. You up there in the country up there where they, everybody's eating drugs and stuff up there in the mountains. Thank you for calling. First off, thank you for taking my last call about texting, being a phone culture. I really enjoyed your poo and the meat Taco Bell story. Yes, it's a true story. And everybody uses the, that there was feces in the meat in their Taco Bell in their town, but this really happened in my hometown when I was growing up. It really, really happened and it was alarming, but we made it through it as a community. And it's amazing sometimes what community can overcome together. Let's hear more. And when you said, I don't know if we can go back, relate to texting. I really kind of made me think about some shit. At least I'm calling this time is about love. I feel like you don't really talk about that other than like guys trying to blow you. That's really the only thing we've heard. Specifically, I wanted to talk about monogamy and polygamy from where men bolder. And I know in like San Francisco, polygamy is real big. Okay, so from Boulder, he's saying that I don't, he wants to talk about love. He's asking me, you know, I don't talk about love that much, except for if fellows is trying to blow me or run my poll. You know, if they trying to run my poll with the inside of their face. And that is probably in reference to when Andy Dick tried to blow me a few times over there in Shreveport, Louisiana. But onward, I'll hear the rest of this. From where men bolder, I know in like San Francisco, polygamy is real big. Personally, I'm just not sure that I can marry the same person for 40 plus years or whatever. Yes, it's scary if you're talking about it. Thanks again for doing what you do, man. You're a freaking legend. Peace. I appreciate your call, man. I appreciate your previous calling. I appreciate this one. I really do. I appreciate everybody that takes time to call in and help because this show goes. It goes because you guys call. You know, my brain, I'm short. I've always had a short, you know, kind of a short brain. You know, I remember they did a CAT scan on me and the man said, you got a short brain. And I was like, what the fuck does that mean? You know, and I got angry with them even though I was just wearing just that one piece in the hospital where the back is open where anybody could fuck you, you know, which is really, I think, very scary to put on somebody when they're already alarmed and they're in a hospital. I mean, I say put them in a full damn ski outfit, but, you know, they want to put you in that thing to scare you even more. And the man said, you got a short brain. He goes, the width of your brain from the bottom to the top is not very tall. He's, you got a short brain. But that doesn't surprise me. You know, I've always had, you know, a lot of medical deficiencies or abnormalities. You know, my father told me when I was young that I had the heart of a lesbian. You know, when the man told me, one of the doctors told me when I was a child that I had the rib cage of a large, large cat. Probably I'm thinking a mountain, some sort of a mountain cat, probably something you would see up in Boulder maybe. But anyhow, we're talking monogamy and polygamy or monogamy. And can you do it? What's it like these days? You know, I think I wouldn't be surprised if we get more towards a culture where, you know, where marriage isn't as necessary. You know, and I hate to say it because I want to see, you know, I love the family unit. And it's statistically proven across the board that children survive and thrive better when they have two parents in the home. And that's a statistic for every ethnicity. Go look it up. Every ethnicity. You know, and so it's, but it's like, is that what's popular right now? You know, is that what's going on? And I, you know, I don't know. It scares me too to think, you know. I mean, I've been talking to a guy and I was just talking to her about, you know, how that makes me feel very nervous. And I think part of the nervous thing about being with somebody forever is just the propensity for you to be able to mess up. You know, you know, to cheat or to lie or to, you know, to not be a good husband. You know, and that's the scary part, I think of monogamy these days. You know, is man built to be able to withstand all this constant barrage with the pornography and the, you know, the Instagram and the titties wandering by. You know, I mean, I mean, you open your eyes, if you even open your eyes outside, it's like everything has titties on it now. You know, when you start to see them and it's just, there's just a lot of breastwork out there that there wasn't, I think years ago, our grandfather, only time he saw some other breast, maybe if he went to the store, you know, or if he even held a soft melon back in the day, you know, if you probably in the 1930s, if he even held a soft melon, that's the only time he really thought of somebody outside of his marriage. When he was checking melons, you know, when he was considering buying fruit, I mean, he probably, that used to be the old playboy, probably pulling up to a fruit stand and filling the different, you know, the plums and the, and the different, you know, honey do's out there and just filling their softness. I mean, God damn, you put a, you put a seek up avocado in each one of my hands and off, I mean, I will, my penis will mount up on top of my nuts and it will be erect. So it's wild to think that, that back in the day that that's all, that's the only stimulation that they had. You know, when I was young, you had the pornography magazines, but you also, a lot of people, I think in our neighborhood, were drawing pictures of vaginas in the dirt. And I don't know if it was just in our neighborhood, even around town, there was a group or maybe just one person and, an artist, I guess you could even call them an artist. You know, or somebody that was trying to do graffiti, but didn't have any paint. And they would just be drawing pictures of vaginas in the dirt and you'd be wandering around town and just see if a giant in the dirt. And that would always be a little bit crazy. You know, to see that and that would make you feel erect and stuff and you never knew when you were going to see that. But nowadays, yeah, it's like, you know, it's, it's hard to just conserve your sexual energy for one person because there's so many things trying to take it from me nowadays. Polygamy, I don't know. I mean, it sounds like it'd be great, of course, you know, to maybe have a change of pace in your life. You know, but you gotta be a great multitasker. Would it be good for the kids? You know, I don't know enough about it. What the effect of polygamy has on children, you know, when, you know, when you get dad two or three nights a week, you know, when you got your different types of wives. And I mean, I feel sometimes like I have enough love inside of me to, you know, to be able to maybe live in that environment. But is that practical? I don't know. You know, I don't know, man. And I don't talk a lot about my past endeavors, man. I mean, I've had a lot of sexual, sexuality over the years. You know, some good and some bad. And I don't really even like sex that much. I'm not real keen on it. You know, people banging their bodies into each other. You know, it's just sometimes it just gets old a little bit. And maybe that's a dour look at sex. And maybe I need to, you know, have to have my chi, you know, reconfigured. You know, I need to take my chi into the chi shop, you know, and remodel my chi. But that's just how I feel sometimes, you know, that after a certain point, also it's just gotta be about more than that to have that connection. But it's a great, you know, I don't think there's a man, you know, every man thinks about it for sure about polygamy. You know, I think it's natural. They say it's natural to want to mount up and do love and do sex on others. They say it's natural. So it's your, it's a fight you're in. If you're staying monogamous and you're in a one on one relationship, if you've been in a long term relationship and you've stayed true in it, I'd love to hear some of what that feels like. What some of those values are? What do you, what, you know, what are the prizes there that you get emotionally for yourself? What does that feel like? Man, if you're out there, you know, we're ladies. A lot of these ladies we running around these days, slangin' that canal. It's wild out there. It's definitely wild. What are we, how are we getting on time here, man? I think we're getting a little bit along. I'm actually going to, let's take away, let's take one more call here and see what's happening, man. I want to say this. We got, we got a caller right here. What's up, P.O.? Hello, Louisiana boy calling in here from a street port LA. Street port Louisiana, that's Randy Dick, try to break me off with them tongue and jowls, you know, on my Beatles onward. Uh, just calling, calling with the problems that I'm currently having. I graduated high school two years ago. Congratulations. If you graduated high school in Louisiana, congratulations brother. Not easy for a lot of people and I appreciate you calling tonight, man. Thank you onward. I'm currently 20 years old. I still have some problems with excessive pornography use, lack of motivation to go out and get girls. I had a few girls, girlfriends and high school and, um, and every time I get the opportunity to go hang out with a girl or whatever, I always talk myself out of it. Whether it's, you know, kind of insecurity or lack of confidence. Alright, I appreciate this, man. I mean, you know, this is an issue that I've struggled with over the years. You know, you're having some issues with pornography and you were dating in high school, but now you're not dating that much and you're feeling like you might have, um, you know, a lack of motivation to do that. But it sounds like you are interested in women. So onward. Because I have in the past, you know, that girl, the knock talk to girls, I like to put it in there, but it was kind of under your shit right now with that. I was just, you know, calling to see what your thoughts on that and how to kind of pull myself out of this funk. Dude, you can pull yourself right out of that funk. I'm gonna tell you that, how to unfunk. Dude, how to un-gun your funk. How to un-gun your funk. This is how you got to stop the masturbation. You got to stop the pornography. If you feel like it's a, if it, you feel like it's gotten out of control, people that, that are just watching it and enjoying it and not, not everybody's calling and saying they feel like it's gotten out of control. So if you feel that way, it's probably based on something real, you know, that it's become a bad habit. It can probably be a healthy habit for you again one day, but for now you might want to address it. You know, and some people think I'm crazy, well, dude, he can jerk out. What is it making this fellow just trying to jerk out? But if he's, he now he's reaching out and he's, he's not comfortable for him anymore, then it's not a fun game for him. You know, yeah, I get it, dude. It's fun. You know, I remember cruising on the interstate and, you know, blasting one out the side of a open van door. You know, but then that was a blast, dude, but those days are over. And now when you're just doing it at home and it's, you're not going out and meeting people. So what you got to do is you got to cut it off. Not your wiener, bro, but you just have to stop it. You just got to, you got to find some ways to stop it. You got to find habits. Notice what your habits are whenever you do it and shut it down at night. No electronics late at night, shut it down. You know, and as you get away from, you get 30 days away from and I promise you, you'll just start to feel better in your body. You feel more motivated. You'll feel more confident. And I'll even tell you this, man. They got S.A.A. meetings. And that's, it's sexual addiction stuff. And that can be anything, man. It doesn't mean you out there per verton. You know, it doesn't mean you out there peeping, timing or, you know, being a weirdo. They got them. I'm looking here right here online. They got on, they have them on Monday, Thursday and Friday in Shreveport, Louisiana. So you can check them out. Nobody's going to know that you heard it on here and went. Nobody's going to know anything like that. But go check it out, man. You can hear about it. You can hear other people share what's going on with them. It's recovery, bro. You can get in there and get, and make yourself feel better, dude. You know what I'm saying? Get off that seed gun. Because you just getting handy with the seed gun, baby. You Wyatt Earp. When you come to your cross, bro, you are Wyatt Earp. And that's okay, man. You just got to settle that wild west down. You got to settle that. You got to take the wild out of the west for a while. And I promise you, you'll feel invigorated. You'll feel more confident. You got to let that chi build up. You got to let that chi build up. And I'm telling you that because I know that. You know, I'm telling you that because I know it. And you ain't alone, baby. I've been out in them skeet streets. And I know some people say that I beat this topic to death. Play on words, of course. But, but look, if you're calling about it and I can share about it, man, then I'm happy to do that. And I appreciate you guys all hitting the hotline. We got one more call right here. But good luck, man. And if you even want to just hit me on the hotline again, I won't put the call on, but, you know, just to let me know what's going on. Or if you want to talk about it in the future, man, I'm happy to discuss it. But, yeah, it's a battle out there, dude. It's a battle out there. If you want to be a man that's not caught up in the dark arts, you know, that's not out there, you know, you're hiding in the living room while your wife laying in the other room. And you, she's wondering why your sex life is bad and you out there spraying out, laying down in the tub, trying to be quiet. Jacked up on some porn hub, you know. It's tough, guys. I'm not saying you're not wrong for doing it, but it's tough. And we're battling that shit. We're better than that. You know, they create these things to weaken us, to beat us down. You think George Washington was jerking off at night, dude? Hell no. I do with sharpening his wooden teeth and being ready for the next day. And they say he just chopped down one cherry tree. I bet that my fucker chopped down all of them. Because he showed up. You know, he battled his tough times. Imagine having termites in your teeth and you still got to wake up and smile. It's tough to be a man these days. They don't want us to be a man. But we're not going to, we're not going to fall down, baby. We're not. We're going to, we're going to toe the line, man. Good luck to you out there. But you can check out those, uh, where those meetings are at, at SAA.Recovery.org. And it doesn't mean you're a creeper or weirdo dude. Trust me, this is, I'm the most amazing people you'll meet here in some of these meetings, dude. Businessmen, professionals, heroes, bro. Heroes.

Brendan Shaw is right here about to take the comedy game to a whole new level. Love you, brother. Take care. Love you, too, man. Congratulations, dude. You got that three-day-old baby girl, huh? Look at us, man. You want to support feminists? That's how we do it. We're bringing daughters into the world. We're raising them to be good women, to be confident, to be able to become good mothers. We're trying to lead by example. We might fail at times, but we get back up. I appreciate that call, man. I really appreciate that call. I appreciate the thank you. It's tough out here, man. It's tough out here for me. It's nice when I get to get these calls because I wish a lot of times that I'd left out of here to Los Angeles and moved home and had myself a family by now and had that. I get a little jealous, so I appreciate you sharing that with me. Makes me feel like I'm a part of something. But, yeah, man, girls, little girls are the cutest, dude. My family was never very close, and then my sister had a baby. When she first had it, I was like, man, I was so angry at her. I'm like, what are you doing? You don't even know about life. I was just so judgmental. Then, man, once I got to know this kid, and she's just the light of my life, and now she has two daughters, and anything they do just brings joy to me. They brought so much joy to me over the years just by being alive. Little girls are so sweet, man. I appreciate you sharing that blessing with us. That's what it's about.
