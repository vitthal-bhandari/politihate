    "text": " The Blaze Radio Network On Demand Love Courage Truth Let's come together on this. We firmly believe that every person has a right to live. That's a quote Liberals and conservatives can surely get behind something like that, right? Unifying? It's inspiring? It's not just American, it is human And it is rare and nice to hear an organization take a stand like that And it's great to see organizations getting awards for taking a stand like that We firmly believe that every person has a right to live This week, this organization won the Lasker Award, one of the nation's most prestigious prizes in medicine Fortunately, the Lasker Award includes a $250,000 prize because this year's winner is cash-strach And can use it Well, it's not cash-strapped yet, but it fears it might be soon And with President Trump and the Republican Congress threatening to block it from receiving Medicaid reimbursements And everything, it's probably going to be cash-strapped I don't know about you, but I'm sick of all of the politicians that are going to try to withhold funds from an organization That provides health services to millions of people And in the announcement of the award, it says, although the organization is most famous for aiding women, it helps men as well Now, for being honest, that part of the award announcement is a little misleading Because the organization is actually more famous for disposing of that pesky health issue of having a baby in the womb Now, I know things have changed and maybe men can have babies in today's world Maybe I'm having one right now, the world is upside down, and I just don't know it or won't admit it because I'm such a bigot This year's Lasker Award goes to plan parenthood But don't worry, because in the announcement, the Lasker Award people made sure to say that Abortions are only 3% of the health services that plan parenthood provides And last year, that 3% only included 328,348 babies that were killed That's it This week, Planned Parenthood's President Cecil Richards emailed supporters expressing outrage over President Trump's plan to end DACA Which is right in, I mean, right when you think of Planned Parenthood, you think immediately, DACA She writes, apparently without any sense of irony, here at Planned Parenthood Quoting, we believe, we firmly believe that every person has the right to live To work and to raise a family freely, and without the threat of deportation or separation And we will never stop fighting for this vision Cecil, you should know one thing We believe that every person has a right to live and not be separated from their parent forcefully We will stand on behalf of the unborn, because at least the dreamers can speak up for themselves The 328,348 babies that your organization killed last year never had that chance Friday, September 8, this is the Glenn Beck program Hurricane Harvey, which killed 60 people May end up costing 150 billion But this is the sound of Irma Hurricane Irma became the most powerful Atlantic hurricane on record, Category 5 It's over 800 miles wide It is roughly the size of Texas Let me say that again It is roughly the size of Texas Sustained winds of over 185 miles an hour for more than 24 hours Gusts over 200 miles an hour It really couldn't have been If you want to make the case for the weather machine Stu made a pretty good case this morning before we went on the air If you look at the way this thing is tracked It is almost as if the weather machine, or what I like to call God Is snaking it through? Nope, don't hit them Miami, yes, hit them No, it's not God, this is clearly George Soros It has to be Soros I'm not normally an info wars.com guy But I mean with this one, I don't see how you do It seriously looks like If you were playing a video game Designed in your job, which they have these They have these with the plague video games Where you try to spread the plague as fast as possible If you had a hurricane video game And which you were trying to create the most damaging situation possible You watch the center of the storm It navigates between all these tiny islands Which would slow it down Which would slow it down if it goes over land And it stays over water And it navigates through all of these like a maze And then it comes up from the very bottom of Florida And goes up the entire length of the peninsula And then curves back into the United States Into the mainland And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And all this kind of emotion And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes up the coast And then it comes on I would love to hear from you If you are sitting in that traffic up electricity a lot more easily. Yeah, but you don't. But you don't recharge it quickly. I know. I mean, I'm assuming I think the market eventually addresses that maybe with switching batteries out and everything. If we got to a world where that was the case, right, where you're talking 70% of cars are electric. Right now, you're in Miami and you're leaving with a Tesla. That is a real problem. I mean, your mileage is not designed for that situation, really. It's not, it's not, not its best use. There's just not, it is what's amazing to me is to remember when I said everything that you thought you could trust, you won't be able to trust where everything you thought you could count on. It is absolutely everything right now is upside down. Everything is in chaos. It is remarkable how it is for, I don't know if we've even paid attention to this. I am my apologies to California, to Washington state and to, is it Montana? Where's the other disaster? No, yeah, Montana and North Dakota. We have another catastrophe going on. We have wildfires in Washington and in, and in California. I didn't read about them in Oregon, but does Oregon have wildfires as well? I saw a time lapse photography that we're putting up on Glenbeck.com of the wildfires in Washington state. It's terrifying. It's just terrifying and I've never seen anything like it. We have a drought now happening in North Dakota and Montana that they're saying is going to cripple the farmers. We are a nation that is, is being told, hey, guys, you get back together. We are a nation that has the opportunity right now to come back together and to, and to stop separating ourselves and stop fighting for things that are crazy, just truly crazy. Think of what is important in your life. Think of you being on that bridge today, looking at your gas tank and going, I'm not going to make it off this bridge. And a category for hurricane is coming your way. Imagine being stuck someplace. Everything that you have is in your car and your kids are in the car. Imagine looking outside and going, we're not going to get, I can't get out of here. Kids, we're just going to stay in the house. Does anything matter? Does Donald Trump being a jerk or not a jerk matter? Does the media and its lies, does it matter to you? Does Hillary Clinton's new stupid book matter to you? None of this matters. What matters is what mattered on 912. Isn't it fascinating to you that we are being hit so hard and we will look this year at 912 and most of the destruction will be behind us and the cleanup will be headed our way. The choice to come back together and be decent to each other. Our choice is going to happen again on 911 and 912. I mean, I know it's not planned. You know, just like there is no weather machine. And Donald Trump isn't controlling the weather and neither is George Soros. But it is an interesting coincidence that we are facing the same choice we did almost 20 years ago. Now how do we behave this time around? My guess is exactly the way we behaved the last time. So if you want to get involved and support the relief efforts associated with Hurricane Harvey and coming soon, Hurricane Irma. But for Harvey, text the phrase M1 Harvey to 50155 M1 Harvey to 50155. And then choose the amount that you would like to donate and you'll be able to choose to donate via e-check or credit card. Again, it's M1 Harvey to 50155. And the same will be happening with Irma as well. Or you can just donate at mercury1.org. We already have people stationed all over Florida with food and water and ready to go in once the storm passes. Mercury. Mexico was just hit by an earthquake 8.1 on the Richter scale. Is it the largest one ever to hit Mexico? At least in modern times. One of the biggest ones ever recorded. 8.1 on the Richter scale it happened down by the border of Guatemala. It was felt here in the United States. It just happened in the last couple of hours. Our prayers are with Mexico. I will tell you, droughts, fires, floods, hurricanes, earthquakes. It's either George Soros or one of those things where you could easily be convinced, you know, what put on your Nike's, crawl up to the top bunk and just we're just waiting for the spaceship to arrive because this is the end. I haven't even arrived at that moment where isn't it time to kind of just shut this thing down? We've done a lot here. We had a good run. Yeah. You're talking not as us but as humans. You're kind of at the, it's like you own blockbuster video and you have like three stores left. You know, maybe it's just time to shut them down. Maybe this isn't the time we just move on with our lives and sign up for Netflix. We're kind of there. Or the trip to Mars. Whatever it is. I think it's time to abandon at least this planet. I mean, I want to keep humanity going fine. Let's go do this to another planet. Yeah, let's start over and do this to another planet. I like that. It's funny with all the horrible things going on. I mean, earthquakes, hurricanes, fires, war. You do see those things that give you hope that give you really bright signs. Oh, you do. Where you do? Yeah. Like, for example, the New England Patriots losing last night. Yes. That is. You know, all the tragedy. This week has been a depressing news week. We've done a lot. We, and what do you do? We have to talk about the big stories and people. We've heard people saying, well, that's a little depressing. You guys are talking about the nuclear destruction of North Korea. And yeah, sure. Thousands of people wonder why. And more hurricanes are coming and you got earthquakes and you got fires. Why aren't you guys more positive? I don't know. I can't trace a path to figuring out how that happened. We actually have had calls to the office this week. Glenn, we're a little concerned that the show is a little gloom and doom. Yeah, because there's gloom and there's doom. Hey, God, it's a second. I don't know if you've opened up your window and looked outside of the world. We're in. It's not like I'm predicting these things are coming. They're here. It's like, OK, so tell me about the New England Patriots because I'm about to become a sports fan. Well, the Patriots, we got to see them lose last night. In fact, I think it was USA today that had predicted them to have a 16 and no undefeated season game one, Kansas City hung a nice big L on them and I loved it. I loved every second of it. We have, by the way, we have Bill O'Reilly coming up in about 37 minutes that you don't want to miss and also later on in the program, the one and the only Mr. Don Imus is going to be joining me. I think that's a good idea. I'm not. I'm not really sure, especially after our email exchange yesterday. Interesting word usage by Don and the email you told me about. Well, let me see which part of it I could use on the air. He said, I believe the was in that sentence. Yeah, I remember that one. I was like, and he spelled it right. The rest of it, I don't think I can repeat on air. Well, we think he's coming out. I will say he never actually agreed to this interview. You offered him to come on the air and then he said, and you asked him, what do you want to talk about? He said, it's none of your effing business. What I talk about was his response. And that was us saying, okay, yeah, he's going to come on. Okay. I guess that's a yes. And I just said, I just said, you know, I really want to talk to Don about this scam that happened with the guys who replaced Don Imus on one of the guys. Yeah. Boomer Seisen is an involved, but one of the guys who replaced Don Imus on WFAN and he was involved in a Ponzi scheme. And it's a pretty big deal. It's a pretty big deal. And $5.6 million, allegedly. So I wrote to Don and I said, hey, I want to talk to you about a Ponzi scheme tomorrow. And he said, I don't know what they are and I have no interest. And I sent him the article and he said, I'm not talking about and he went on this tirade for a while. And I said, well, you know, we're open if you ever want to talk about it. He said, give me an F in number and a time. It's not a yes. It's not a yes. So we're kind of rolling the dice. He may be on. He may not be on. But if he is on, I'm not suggesting he's going to be in a good mood. Mercury. Oh, it's really nice. I love the season. I love you. Aaron Watson. Aaron Watson, a fantastic country star who is a friend of the program. A friend of humanity and, of course, a great Texan, is doing a concert next week to help with the hurricane relief. And it's amazing how everybody all around the country from all walks of life pitching in to help. Welcome to the program, Aaron, how are you? I'm good. How are you? Sir, long time. No talk. I know. I know. Well, you know, you're a big star and that big Hollywood live here. Let me just tell you how big a star I am and how Hollywood my life is right now. Right now I'm in West Texas and I've got my paint clothes on and I'm fixing to do some painting with the wife. That's how Hollywood I am. And not like artistic painting. You're like painting a room or a, yeah. Yeah, we're painting concrete. It's so much fun. It's yeah. It's beautiful and glamorous. So Aaron, I just wanted to get you on real quick just to give you a quick plug on what you're doing next. I think it's next Saturday. Can you fill us in? Yeah, we're playing at that. We had a show fall through and down near the Houston area and because of the hurricane and we're going to the folks at the Silver Saloon there in Terrell, we've been playing there for years and it's just an incredible venue. It's a big place and they invite us to come out and we're going to help raise some money for the hurricane victims. But you know, it's not just about that night. You know, it's like everyone seen on the news. We need everybody to have this type of passion and fire about rebuilding Houston and every little town along the coast for the next two years. I mean, because right now, it's in the headlines, but it's going to take a long time to recover from billions and billions of dollars a day. Yeah, they're saying that it's going to take it. It'll be at least eight years before things are back to normal and we haven't even started on Florida yet. We're expecting that this weekend. Okay, so how do you get tickets and where's the money going? Well, we've got a couple of different ideas where we're going to put the money right now that, you know, the state has their big fund that the governor set up. So we've been jumping behind that. But, you know, I'm also real fond of this thing called Mercury one. And, you know, I'm partial to those guys. So, you know, I know some people there. Yeah. So I'm going to be making some calls there. And actually next week, I'm going into the studio and I'm going to make an album for the for the good folks at Mercury one to use. And they can use that to help out with Houston and Florida and everything else, whatever their hearts desire. Thank you. I mean, you guys set a great example for all of us. So thank you. Appreciate it. Aaron Watson and Aaron Watson, of course, is just a great country star that you need to know. And so you know also, we have raised now over $2 million at Mercury one. And we've served 335,000 meals just in Houston over the last nine days. Team Rubicon, we have an update on that. We're bringing in I think 1,100 volunteers. And we've purchased all of the plane tickets. So those veterans can come in and help people in Houston rebuild. And we have semi trucks on the ground now in Florida ready to go in as soon as that happens. Aaron Watson, you can catch him coming to your town. He's going to be in Texas. He's in Michigan, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana. And they're even allowing him into Washington, DC, in Massachusetts, which I did not think was allowed to go to eranwatson.com to get the details. All right, Pat Gray unleashed. Pat is a little he's been he's been on a tirade and there's a lot of stuff to be on a holy tear about this week. But he's he's got a low pressure system moving into into his area and welcome back. Thank you. Good to be here. As just do was pointing out off the air. I actually have a Twitter page now. Shut up. This is huge. Shut up. Yeah. What is the Twitter page at Pat? I don't know. Why am I saying this is a big thing. I think people, you know, sometimes Pat can get fired up about occasional things. People may have noticed. However, the thing that people are most angry about against Pat is the fact that he's avoided Twitter all the time. He's been Twitterless Pat all this time. Now he is at Pat unleashed at Pat unleashed at Pat unleashed mainly because mainly because he is the only guy in media that could have had his name Pat Gray at Pat Gray on Twitter. But now some like homeless person, some realtor or something. Someone to seriously at Pat Gray, I think tweeted three times in 2015. And that's it. Oh, that's it. You could have had any of these times and they person doesn't even use the account anymore. But at Pat unleashed does I like it also thumb up me on Facebook. Thumb up. Thumb up. Thumb up me. Yeah. Unfateful. That sounds awkward. But okay. So this is going to be another tough weekend with Irma, Berlin down. And and to me, we need to we're we're naming these storms all wrong because Irma doesn't that sound like a frightful, big, bad hurricane? Yes. Harvey sounded like a big, bad hurricane. So instead, why don't we start naming them things like blame? Hurricane Blaine couldn't possibly develop into anything. Right. Could it? We know self-respecting hurricane on earth could be named Blaine or Ambrose or Aubrey. It just can't happen. Right. So we're going about this all wrong. But this has really been days of day Shavu watching the evacuation in South Florida because we did the same thing with Houston just on on less notice in 2005 at the very end. They said, okay, evacuate. And so 3.7 million people try to do that at the same time. That seems like a really bad idea. Really bad idea. Can I just can I just put Jamie on real quick because she's on the road in Florida evacuating right now, Jamie. Hi, Mr. Beck. How long have you been sitting in traffic and what does it look like? Well, I'm not actually sitting in traffic yet. I'm going down to return later and sit in it. I'm on a truck and I bring groceries back to the stores that are out of stuff. Wow. So we've got, you know, all your three main arteries are so called that we're taking rigs down down back roads and side streets. Holy cow, Jamie, I got to tell you, we will keep you in our prayers. You want to talk about a dangerous situation? Hey, be in a big tractor trailer as those winds come. God bless you. Welcome. We'll talk to them before, but we're the first line going back in as soon as it clears. Wow. I mean, I can't even go on to, um, race and secure. I'm hoping and praying that my kids are taking care of everything because I'm running, you know, on 14 hours a day and 10 hours of sleep and doing it again the next day, we lost everything to the storms 11 years ago. We lost everything, but my little family of four and we can rebuild, but we can't replace the people. Jamie in Florida, an attractor trailer, going to deliver aid and help. We keep you in our prayers. Had you sat in this or you actually didn't because I remember I called you and I said, we were talking about it on the air. You were telling me how stupid I was. Yeah. Yeah. It's a nice. It is. It is. It's well, I only said he was stupid because I cared. Right. Yeah. I was like, I'll get out of there. This was what two or three weeks after Katrina. So everybody was afraid that, you know, we're all going to die if we stayed, but we prayed about it pretty earnestly and decided we needed to stay. And so we did. And then I was really glad we did because, you know, everybody was stuck. A hundred people died. Many of them have heat stroke. You remember that bus with filled with senior citizens caught on fire? 24 of them died. It was horrific. So hopefully this will go a lot better in Florida. I think they've given them a little more leeway and a little more time to get out. You're sitting there after your experience. You're sitting there in Miami, Florida. And you know, you got to get out. I mean, this is going to hit Miami. Oh, you're going to be bad. You have to leave. You have to leave. So how do you do that when you know I'm going to probably be sitting on the highway? Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Are they opening the other side? Are they opening the south bound lanes at all? I would. I would hope so for Northbound traffic. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. Take the freeway and open both sides. Eventually. I surely they will. I mean, this is the thing. You're at that point now where they're getting pretty good at forecasting these things at least say four days in advance. You really once you see you're in the in the path of one of these things, you need to leave not one day early, but four days early or five days early. Yeah. And you know, about half the time you're just going to wind up being frustrated because you left for no reason, but these things can get better than getting stuck in the gridlock. Yeah. The Houston thing was the greatest gridlock in American history. So hopefully they could avoid that. Holy cow. I've been to New York with the president. Yeah. Wow. So, but the other thing was, have you guys heard about the the flooding in Asia? Have you talked about that at all? No, we just got to the fires of the east coast and the drought to the Midwest. It's the weirdest thing in India, Bangladesh and Nepal, 40 million people have lost their homes and livelihoods. What? 1,300 people have died. 1,300 people have died up to 40% of them children. I saw nothing about this. We have some friends staying with us at the house this week. And she said, she said to me at the dinner table, so what do you think of? I mean, the Houston thing's bad, but what do you think of the thing in Asia? Like the thing in Asia? What thing in Asia? She said, well, thousands of people have died in flooding. At a fire in the flood. Yeah. It's the monsoon rains. Did you hear this morning about Mexico? Yeah, 8.1 largest earthquake. Yeah. Maybe the largest ever in a century at least. Yeah. I mean, that's, I mean, what is it really? I mean, it is. I don't believe this, but I'm just telling you, you wouldn't be hard pressed to go to a church someplace where like everybody needs to put on our tennis shoes and come on up and repent and get up in the attic because the spaceship is coming and Jesus is coming. You wouldn't be. It's not hard to convince you. No. What's your call, your take on that? I mean, do we just shut this sort of planet down and figure something else out? I think we do. I think we stop all, well, certainly all human life so that the planet can live. Right. Because the planet is trying to commit suicide right now. It does seem to be. Yeah. It does seem to be human life or just trying to get rid of the virus. Right. That is, that is humanity. Thank you. At least the Patriots lost them. No, it's interesting how Pat missed the point on, you know, he's saying, we got to, you know, we got to come up with kinder names. Irma sounds like a woman who is a little upset. And we should come up with not kinder names. I believe, I mean, if we're not talking to Mr. Pat 1940, he would understand the real problem is how dare us assign gender to these hurricanes. That is a great point. How do we know Harvey identifies as a mail storm and Irma identifies as a female storm? We don't know. We don't know. How do we know if they're male or female at all? The oppressors once again at work. How dare us? We should listen to each hurricane. Let them say their gender, let them decide their name. And this is the problem with unleashing Pat. Maybe he should be leashed. Maybe he should be leashed on his new show starting Monday, by the way, on the blaze. Pat Gray unleashed. Very excited for that. Harvey and Irma have been married for over 75 years. Not the hurricanes. It's Harvey and Irma Schluter. They've been married for 75 years. He just turned 104 and she will be 93 in November. They both remember vividly the major events of the last century. They remember the first time they ever saw an airplane. They remember the Great Depression. They remember obviously the wars. Neil Armstrong walking on the moon. Irma just said recently she remembers that it was a cool and cloudy day. The day John F. Kennedy was assassinated. Now, as they celebrate their 75th wedding anniversary, we've named two storms after them. And they said, what are the odds? And as you get to know Harvey and Irma, they are the exact opposite of these two storms. They got married in 1942 and she wanted to wait to get married. And he said, no, no, no, let's get married right now. He worked as a barber. They found their way to Spokane, Washington. What the interesting thing about these guys, they have taken in over 100 foster kids. They were foster parents and most of them mentally or physically disabled. Really, truly wonderful healers Harvey and Irma. Mercury. Love. Courage. True. Never let a crisis go to waste. And that was the principle that was in action this week. Only 17 senators voted nay yesterday on the idea of combining hurricane relief and raising the debt ceiling. Only 17 people saw this for what it was manipulating a crisis. Did the other 80 congressmen take no issue at all with using federal aid for hurricane Harvey victims as leverage? This was ransom money bought and paid for to ensure the players on Capitol Hill get to play their little games in the months to come. I have a message for those in Washington and anybody who is using the threat of hurricane relief money to further their agenda. Keep your damn money. Every last cent of it. We don't need your help and we'll take care of our own. If there is one thing that hurricane Harvey has taught us, not even taught us, reminded us. Through all of the cacophony of lies in the media, we heard this. The American spirit is as strong as it has ever been. And we didn't wait around for you to come and save us. We saved ourselves. We didn't beg for government money and government assistance. We all got into our cars, our trucks. We had neighbors that had boats that just took it down themselves and rescued people. While they were in Washington cutting back room deals, we were opening up our wallets and our lives and our homes in droves. I don't know if this has really hit you yet, but JJ Watt took to Twitter and raised over $20 million and that number is still climbing. Michael Dale, Michael Dale gave $36 million of his own money. 16 million has been given from sports franchises. Hollywood has even stepped up with over 10 million. The US Chamber of Commerce reported that companies such as Bank of America, Verizon, Coca-Cola, Google, IBM, Shell, all have donated over $141 million and that number is going up every single day as of last night, Mercury One and this little audience has raised over $2.1 million and that number will be well over five soon. And this money, none of that money is going into some politicians' hands so they can take a cut, spread it to their friends and their families and their special interests that will help them get reelected. This is cash going directly from the people directly to the people who have lives and families and businesses that actually need it. There's a ton of work to be done in America. And America had become a country that relies on federal help when disasters come. But that doesn't mean you and Washington have to take advantage of those in need. Never let a crisis go to waste. How about we think differently? Let's think like Texans. To those in Washington playing your little games, we dismiss you. Stand aside. We've got this. Friday, September 8th. This is the Glenn Beck program. Bill O'Reilly from BillOReilly.com has a new book coming out next week called Killing England. He'll be talking to us about that coming up in the next couple of appearances. But welcome to the program Lots to discuss with Bill O'Reilly from BillOReilly.com. Bill. O'Reilly. I'm standing by. What can I do for you? I'm just wondering, were you at all disgusted by the game that was being played in Washington this week? You know, I understand the game and it's been added so long that maybe I'm jaded because I understood exactly what was happening there. What I can't understand, let me ask you this, because you're much more impassioned about government spending than I am. I see the danger as you do. But I'm more than a, you know, let's deal with a problem that we have to deal with today. Why do you think that the Democratic Party, almost 100% down the line and the people who support the Democratic Party want a government that is heading toward bankruptcy and insolvency? Why do they want that? I think they're looking, A, I think most of them are just so self-centered. They believe much as many of the banks did in 2007, there's not going to be a collapse. We can play this game forever. We got it. They're bigger minds than us. Look, there's too much to lose. It's not going away. I think the majority of them feel that way. But I do believe there are those that see a reset coming and get it while you can and push it over the edge and the reset will be, we can fix all these things. Okay, but one more question on this. Philosophically, the Democratic Party has now basically said, we will spend as much of the taxpayers' money as we can spend. All right, we're not going to cut back. We're not going to save. We're not going to do anything. We're going to spend what we have. We're going to tax people up to their eyebrows and make it very hard for people to live on a daily basis because so much is being taken out of their paychecks and every time they turn around buying a gas, gallon of gas, they got to pay a tax that every thing's taxed. So they want to weaken the individual back. They want to weaken the individual American. They want the individual American to be weaker because money provides security and power. Why? Why? I never got enough velocity. I've never figured that out. Well, because they believe, Bill, in this socialist utopia that doesn't exist and they believe that when they believe the people are not smart enough and they believe that if they can take their money, they can redistribute it in a way that is much more fair. I mean, I don't know if I posted something that I had not read from Bill de Blasio. He said it, I think, a couple of years ago, and he was talking about how he wants a very, this is a quote, a very, very large, powerful state, one that takes the land and the money and they decide the best way to spend it and the best way to use that land. That's crazy. But he believes, yeah, I know, he believes it'll actually work. You know, people, I live here. So I know he'll never admit that he's a communist, but he is. So that's a fringe crazed person to Blasio. But I don't know, I mean, you look at, you look at, here's the point. I don't believe that rank and file registered Democrats. And we, you know, millions of them, right? Yes. My family was, all right, rank and file registered Democrats. I don't think that they know or understand that their party at this point in history wants them to be weaker, is eroding their personal power by saying, I'm, we're going to bankrupt the nation and fund every crazy thing that goes down. If they cook back, they pour trillions of dollars into global warming, whatever that may be. If the Democrats could do it, they do it. And they're, and they tax people even more to do it. So can I ask you a question? I never understood it. I never understood. And I'm not a Republican, by the way. I'm an independent. Well, can I ask you a question? I don't think there's a, that much of a difference. I mean, tell me, and there is on degrees, but not on direction. Tell me the people who are actually standing up for responsible spending and, and getting the debt and deficit under control. Tell me who on the right is doing that, except the ones who are all being deemed. No, but they're all being deemed as those are radical, crazy people that just want everybody to starve. No, they're, they're not. No, and I think that there are many Republicans who want to cut spending. I mean, I think that's fairly obvious because that's the battle that they fight every single day. But let's get, let's get to this week and you're, you're agitated about the raising the debt limit in the country. Um, the reason that happened was because the Trump administration is in dire trouble. Okay, dire trouble. And the Trump administration needs to pass tax cuts, which will help individual Americans obviously. And in order to have those tax cuts passed, or at least a shot of getting them approved, they had to get this debt thing off the table because these tax cuts have to be approved in the next 45 days. And if you had a, a brawl over the debt ceiling, that would make the passage of tax cuts less likely. Do you really think, what do you do? Do you really think that the, the GOP or this administration is prepared to cut tax to pass legislation on, on meaningful tax cuts in the next 45 days? They have to. Everyone I've talked to on Capitol Hill say there's no way that that can happen. There's just no way they're not even prevailing wisdom. I know it's the prevailing wisdom that it's not going to happen because these, the mechanics are just inefficient. All right. However, it's a brawl to assign a blame. So if Trump gets a bill, which you will, if he gets a bill, and it says that corporate tax rates are cut to 15% and personal, there's three more, there's just three brackets and tax filing is simplified, he presents the bill to the American public. And the American public says, yeah, we like that. That's good. We want that. Then the Democratic Party is weakened severely in the short term. Now, whether it gets passed or not, okay, but if the Democrats vote against it, then they're pretty much dooming themselves for next year's midterm elections. That's what's going on now. So it's brinkmanship, bring the tax cut to the American people. And if they Democratic Party doesn't do it, then that party is going to be severely weakened. That's exactly what's happening. It seems, you know, like brinkmanship, to me, it looks like flailing. Because you just, you started the, you started the conversation with, why do, why do the Democrats in Congress, not the average Democrat, but how come these guys just want to spend us into oblivion, etc, etc. How are you going to get them, any of them? If that's your point of view of who they are, how do you get any of them to say, okay, we've got to, we've got to lower the corporate tax rate. There are six Democrats that are running in red states for reelection next year. Trump will be able to peel off probably three or four of them to vote for the tax cuts. Okay. Now, I think McCain and a couple of other Republicans are going to sabotage Trump on the Republican side. So he's not going to get all the Republicans to vote for the tax cuts. There'll be some that won't. But I think the calculation is we can get four Democratic senators to vote for it. Then we can pass it. And they think that's where it's coming, what it's coming down to right now. Bill O'Reilly from bill O'Reilly dot com. Our conversation continues on Hillary Clinton and so much more in just a few minutes. Mercury. Thank you so much for listening. We are thoughts and prayers are with you if you're in the Florida area or in the path of Irma. This storm is the size of Texas. It dwarfs Hurricane Andrew. It is remarkable. So you know, Team Rubicon is already on this. We're watching Irma as well as the fires in California through Mercury one. City impact, which is one of our partners for Mercury one already has 10 semis of relief trucks. They are in Palm Beach Gardens, Bradenton and Miami already. Relief aid trucks are are on the way additional. Plus, we have served 335,000 meals with Operation Barbecue in the last nine days that is in Houston in Victoria. They're on the ground in Beaumont as well. And we need to double our efforts now for Florida. We want to thank you so much for supporting this effort in any way that you do. If you would like to, you can donate to Mercury one dot org. All of the money goes directly to these organizations that are on the ground. And there's not a dime wasted. Mercury one dot org. Mercury one dot org. Your thoughts on the hurricane bill? Well, first of all, I can, you know, kudos to you, Beck. You know, not a lot of people doing what you do. And, you know, it's very impressive your organization and how your coast to coast, you know, the fires are bad. The fires up in the Montana Pacific Northwest, California, they're bad and they're getting no attention because of the hurricane. So anyway, kudos to you. You're using your power for good. The natural disaster situation is always going to be this always happening with us. And then all of us are going to go on earth. You said it pretty eloquently in your monologue, top of the program that Americans take care of each other. And they do. But there is a role for the government to play. And, you know, I think that I wrote a comment for the Hill on Monday and said that the response to the hurricane in Texas, Harvey, was much better than the response to Katrina and Sandy. And it looks like Irma is organized as well. So why is that? What's the difference now to then? And that's an interesting question. So when people, you know, say, Oh, President Trump is this or that or need that, that, that, well, look, under him, the federal organization is better. And there's no question about that. So, but you'll never, you'll never hear that reported. You'll never hear that analyzed. And that you showed you as you put it, you know, the lies the media tells are endless. But it's also there's somebody we said about, you know, the state of Texas is not the, you know, not the city of New Orleans. The state of Texas is this is totally different mind that in Texas. You said, you know, we'll solve our own problems. No doubt. There's no question about that. And in New Orleans, you've had generations of basic, well, here's your house. Here's your food. Here's this, here's that. And then all of a sudden, something hits and people are going, well, wait a minute, I have to, I have my stuff now. Yeah. I mean, you know, it's a mindset. So, Bill, the, the, the one of the real problems, I think is hurricanes are not getting worse. I mean, hurricanes happen strong hurricanes, strong earthquakes, everything else. These things happen. But we don't build, generally speaking, we try not to build huge cities on earthquake faults, forget California. We, you know, we, we look at things if, if California was having an earthquake, as often as we have hurricanes, we would never build anything around there. Yet we are now building huge cities right on the ocean that are prone to get hit by hurricanes. I'd like you to go into, should we rethink that whole thing of, you know what, you shouldn't be able to get insurance if you're going to build a giant apartment complex right in Miami. I don't know if we have insurance to cover that, at least from the taxpayers back in the second. This is the Glenn Beth program. Bill O'Reilly has a new book called Killing England that we'll get to next week. Really, really good book. And you need to read it. I mean, if you're into history at all, Bill O'Reilly is a great teacher. He was a history teacher for a while. And then he decided to inflict himself on all of America and became the legend that is Bill O'Reilly. Now you can see him five days a week on, on his own, no spin news at bill O'Reilly dot com, bill O'Reilly dot com. Bill, the question is, should the taxpayers have to pay for insurance for buildings that are clearly built in flood zones and hurricane paths when the market says, there's no, there's, I'm not going to, I can't keep my doors open if I ensure this area. So no, why should the American people be on the hook for others, especially the rich, who want to build their houses right there in the, in the path of hurricane after hurricane after hurricane? Yeah, a lot of it's a state-by-state situation. In New York, you have to have insurance from near the ocean. And you have to buy FEMA insurance, which is much, much higher. So really high, but you can't just buy and be uninsured. There's a very reason you're talking about it. And a lot of states are like that. And I don't, I'm not an expert in this, but there are a lot of them. The National Flood Insurance Program is now $25 billion in debt, just from Sandy. So at some point, we have to say there's no, there's no money here for this. Yeah, but you can't, because of freedom, say you can't buy a house on this land or whatever. Right. I'm not, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hang on just saying, I'm not suggesting that. I'm just suggesting that at your own risk and at your own peril. I mean, yeah, I don't oppose that. I mean, I don't want all particular situations, there's zoning in a lot of places that you can't do this. Environmental protection is very stringent, close to the water. So look, I don't think that that's a huge issue for the American taxpayer. I think that's probably a minuscule compared to the other fleecing that we're taking on a whole bunch of other issues, like disability fraud, which is the worst. That if you really want to look into how the American taxpayer is being conned and stolen from, take a look at the disability situation. That's a disgrace. Bill O'Reilly, let me ask you the switch back to politics here for a second. There are several deep conservative thinkers who say that what happened this weekend was Donald Trump took a hard turn to the left and turned towards Democrats. And one of the things they point to was he went up with Senator Heidi Heidkamp, who he said, you know, as a good woman, they're great people, they work hard, blah, blah, blah. She has voted with the president 40% of the time. While Jeff Flake votes with the president 93% of the time, and the president is doing everything he can to get Jeff Flake out of there. And there's a real chance in Trump country up with with Heidi Heidkamp that she's one of those people that's actually on the bubble and could be replaced. Why is he supporting? Yeah, but I think the fix is already in and that Heidi is only told from the chillhose of the tax cut. So I think that's what's that all about. So he's got one democratic needs for more. And for Flake, look, Trump's not ideological school. Anybody is signing him a conservative or liberal dentist way out. He doesn't care about that. He's all about the deal. And that's what he says. And that's true. Now, the reason he likes Flake is because Flake came out and wrote a book and he went on the shows and said that Trump's incompetent. Okay, as soon as you say something like that about Trump is going to hate you. And that's what's going on there. I've heard that. Let me switch gears to Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton has her book coming out. The Democrats don't want to hear from Hillary Clinton anymore. She has. I mean, this is an amazing stat. Her approval rating is lower than Donald Trump's approval rating. And I mean, she's at an approval rating of 30. That is almost impossible for she has gone away. Trump is actually saying stuff. And her approval rating is still going down. And yet the media would have you believe that Hillary Clinton was such the obvious choice with her being gone. Her approval rating is still going down. Keeps going down. Look, the thing about Hillary Clinton is that she's not really a real person. This is just like one of these octagons. I've had better a few times. And I think the word bloodless is my best description of her. Wow. It doesn't seem to be any real humanity flowing out of that. And people know that's why she lost the election. They didn't trust her. They didn't like her. It wasn't about Trump. It was about her. But in the book, from what I understand, she blames a lot of her losses on sexism. And I've had it back. I don't know about you, but I've had it with sexism, racism, homophobia, had it. And as soon as I heard that, I'm not reading the book. That disqualifies me from reading the book. Her excuse for losing the election is sexism. Come on. I mean, she got hammered by the press. I think that's fair to say. But not merely to the extent that Trump did. So, you know, Mrs. Clinton, I wish you a happy life. I'm sorry that it didn't work out for you in your quest for power. I thank God that you're not president of the United States. My life, I thank the deity. Okay. Whether the deity is a man or a woman. Doesn't it doesn't matter? I'm on my knees saying thank you. I'm willing to say, and you know, it's not a lie. I run a charitable foundation as you do. And I looked into the Clinton Foundation. Those people use that charitable foundation for their own benefit. And I don't think there's anything worse that you can do than take charitable concerns and turn it around to benefit yourself. And that's exactly what Hillary Clinton did. I will say too, on the sexism charge, the one truly like big decision Hillary had to make naming her VP, she picked a dude. So I don't know what that says, but it kind of seems odd that she'd call sexism. I'm concerned, though, Bill, because your book is coming out killing England. And it's going to be competing. Against Hillary Clinton's book. And you know, they buy warehouses of books. This is are you are you intimidated by by Hillary? First of all, the reason that you picked a dude for VP is because she was in her surfing mode that week. Okay. So yeah, should have known that. Second of all, you know, if you read killing England and you compare the sacrifices and the bravery, Washington and the other patriots to Hillary Clinton to Hillary Clinton. Who is a step away from being president? You will be shocked, shocked at how George Washington and other patriots conducted themselves compared to not only Hillary Clinton, but all modern day politicians. What has happened? What has happened? Hillary Clinton is is advising the Democrats not to give the mantle over to Bernie Sanders. And you have a lot of he have a lot of Democrats. I mean, the Democratic Party is deeply split. Bernie is coming out with this. I have to stop. I love Bernie Sanders. I love him. I think he's the greatest. I want him to have his own sitcom. It's a Bernie hour. Okay. I want Bernie. He does. It's called the Larry David show. We can we can all we should all be socialists like he is. And then he can take us to his palatial mansion in Vermont. Right. Okay. And then in Jerry can be in the backyard. And I can all have a few laughs right about the Huxterism from this guy from Brooklyn. I mean, he's about as much socialist as George Clooney. Okay. I mean, it's just insane. And people are buying it. The billion is okay. Bernie. You heard it. It's funny. It's amusing. All right. But you're alone. All right. You are a loon. You honeymooned Moscow. Who does that? Putin didn't even honeymoon in Moscow. Putin went to Istanbul. It was a little warmer. No one does that. Right. Alan refused to honeymoon in Moscow. I like how that's not a joke from Bill. He actually knows the location of honeymoon. I know. I know. But didn't didn't de Blasio go and do so? He was with the Contras for a while. Didn't he also honeymoon in like Cuba? Yeah. Yeah. The plaza went to Cuba. He went down there. I guess he couldn't afford the airfare. My boy's Bernie did. Well, I mean, Cuba is at least at least there's a beach in Cuba. Yeah. Yeah. But in order to go on the beach, you have to pledge allegiance to Fidel and Raoul. Right. So there are qualifications for you to dip your toe in the ocean. But these guys just amused the hell out of me. Anybody, anybody in America who thinks Bernie Sanders should be president of the United States. They should move to Cuba. Okay. Go there or go to Venezuela. Go there. Okay. See how Bernie system works. See it. Touch it. Feel it. What do you have come? What do you have coming up next? What do you have coming up next week, Bill? You want to alert the audience on? Well, we're killing England is tied into this statue controversy where they're trying to, you know, wipe out all the statues of everybody. Yeah. And I want everybody to read the book because then you'll have an argument. You'll have a debate. You'll know who Washington and Jefferson and Franklin were as men as men. Okay. How they conducted themselves as people, not myths. Because I'm so fed up with this stuff, this PC madness. I am ripping back. I am ripping. So I'm on a campaign next week to get the word out of a killing England, which will be out in the stories on September 19th. And we're going to tie it right into the PC madness in this country. And we're going to stop it. We're stopping it back. We're going to have a telethon that's stopping. No more PC telethon. Me you and that'll be right. Bill O'Reilly from BillOReilly.com. He will be on Tuesday to tell us the story of his book. And it is tremendous book. You can order it online now at BillOReilly.com or wherever great books are sold. Yes. Where they're selling great books. They're also selling this one from BillOReilly.com. Mercury. The one, the only the always outspoken, never predictable, have absolutely no idea if we'll even have a license after he's off the air. Don Imus joins us in about 40 minutes from now. A couple of after that, I think he freed me very joyous. Bo Dittle. The eyeballs in the morning. Bo is around anymore. Is he? I don't know if he's on. I have to ask him if he's in a good mood, I'll ask him because I think Bo didn't go to jail or something. I don't think so. I don't think so. But maybe I thought I read that someplace. Let me tell you about something that is really concerning and awkward. The press doesn't seem to really care about this. There was a town hall meeting in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, where a left-winger got up and asked Pat Toomey if his daughter had been kidnapped. Now, the only audio that we have, his question has been deleted because they didn't want it going out over the air. I wish they would have because you need to see and hear this. But here's what happened. Question and it looks like Brittany is ready. Our next question comes from Simon from North Hampton. Hello, Senator. Thank you for coming to answer our questions tonight. I know we've been here for a while. You probably haven't seen the news. He says, can you confirm that your daughter Bridget has been kidnapped? Then it goes in. And Toomey sits there for a minute and says, this goes on for about four minutes. And then he says, the reason why I ask is because this is the reality of families that suffer from deportation. Now, listen to that question again. I know we've been here for a while. So you probably haven't seen the news. Can you confirm whether or not your daughter Bridget has been kidnapped? Imagine getting that question. No, you'd obviously think it's real because it's so specific. Yes, you know the name of my daughter. You're saying that we've been here for a while. You're saying that you haven't seen the news, but I have information that you don't. The panic that that would cause. And it was all just to make a silly, ridiculous point, which doesn't make any sense at all about illegal immigration. He says, the only regret I have now is, is that the focus has been on me and not the question that I asked. Well, when you, when you try to basically make a senator feel like their kid has been kidnapped, you know, they don't react well to that. How about anybody? I mean, anybody, but we, particularly when you're talking government officials, there's usually not positive reaction to me said asking questions that are based upon kidnapping a child is not only reprehensible, but it is inherently threatening. People who were there in the room said that it was creepy and terrifying mercury. Love, courage, truth, you know, perhaps the art of the deal needs a sequel. The chance to make a real positive difference. Turns out the deal Trump cut with Schummer, Schumer, Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi to increase the debt ceiling for three months wasn't the only deal he was working on. Trump and Schumer also discussed developing a plan that would no longer require Congress to routinely raise the debt ceiling. What it would do is get rid of the federal limit on government borrowing. So they would never ever have to discuss the debt ever again. First reaction is, wow, that's a little irresponsible. Maybe of the highest order. And of course, that's completely true. True. However, the second reaction. Maybe this presents us with a sort of weird, unique opportunity. The debt ceiling has become meaningless. It doesn't mean anything to people anymore. And it just, oh, what? We're not going to pay our bills? No, that's a complete and total lie. So maybe we do look at this as an opportunity. What if the deal included automatic spending cuts if the budget is upside down? Yeah, I know. Never happen. But call me crazy. Maybe if they had to actually have to have a budget in place in the first place. I know, I know having a budget that's too much to ask, don't you think? Or a two-third super majority to exceed the budgeted spending levels. The principle of this sort of a deal would be to force Congress to prioritize its spending, because they're spending too much. And I'm sorry, there's no place to cut turtle tunnels comes to mind. That's no big deal. Then cut the turtle tunnels. The only thing we take less seriously than our border is our debt ceiling, and both of them will be the death of us. I like the fact that Washington, every so often, has to squirm. They have to feel the weight of their own failure and figure out another debt ceiling increase. I like that. The only way that it should go away is if you can actually pass something meaningful to restrain spending, not to continue this Kabuki theater that is the debt ceiling. If the president can pull that off, I think he'll sell a hell of a lot of copies of the art of the deal part two. Friday, September 8th. This is the Glendback program. This is what Irma sounds like right now. If you've never been in a hurricane, you just can't relate. Florida has a history of hurricanes, but two in particular that are truly frightening because of the devastation that it not only made to Florida, but also the devastation that it took on the United States. They both happen in the 1920s, and David Patruza is here. He's an author and historian, and a guy who knows this really well, he follows this time period really well. And the second hurricane, the hurricane of 1928, is called the Forgotten Hurricane because the politicians buried it. They didn't want anybody to know that things were as bad, and they were literally burning bodies in the streets because they knew if people stopped buying land in Florida or stopped going to Florida, that might lead to a depression. And it did. David Patruza, welcome to the program. How are you? Great to be back. So David, I know this is not your area of expertise, but you were the first guy that came to mind when I started thinking about the 1920s and how we got into the Great Depression, because one of your books, 1920, the year of the six presidents, you look at the way 1920 happened and when it kind of spawned what brought on the roaring 20s. Can you can you outlay a little bit of what was happening in Florida that these hurricanes kind of stopped? Yeah, what's going on is you've got three big areas of speculation in the country in the 1920s. There's a stock market which everyone knows about. At the beginning of the decade before anything else, there's a guy named Ponzi who is sort of like the Bernie Madoff of his time, and that ends very quickly. But right after that, you've got the Florida land boom. And if any of your people have ever seen on TCM Turner Classic movies, the Marx Brothers movie, the Coconuts, it's about how people were flipping land in Florida like crazy. And it was crazy. Sometimes a piece of land with a property would never be built on, and it would change hands three times. People wouldn't even go to look at it. It was just it was going to get bigger and bigger and Florida at the time is not the Florida of today for a lot of reasons. It's the smallest southern state. It had six electoral votes in 1929. It's got 29 now. It's got fewer people than West Virginia or Arkansas. And when you start piling all that speculation at the Florida, the infrastructure is going to crash. It it's not all the railway systems. It was a total mess. And then what you had happening, it started to collapse in 1925. But in September of 1926, and September is a really bad month for hurricanes, it's really the peak. And you get a hurricane which blows right through Miami. And the thing about hurricanes then is the loss of life is so much greater. And they are can be as large as what we have today. So like, don't tell me this is all about global warming because it isn't. The great hurricane of 1780 takes 20 to 22,000 lives in the Western Caribbean. The Galveston hurricane is from 5000, 6000, maybe up to 12,000. The best estimate is 8,000 people dead. There are just no warning systems back then. So that people don't know it's coming. This is the great thing about the weather channel and everyone else, more or less, getting everyone agitated about this hurricane Irma. Because it's a good thing to be agitated because people will get the hell out of the way. They don't get out of the way in Miami, which is a much smaller city then. And you get 372 people dying, 43,000 left homeless in a city which is probably not even then 100,000. So things are bad there. And that's followed up the next year by a run on local banks. The banks don't start to get bad in the depression. They are a lot of runs on banks in the 1920s, a large, large amount. But most of them occur in rural areas. They're small banks. And so the economic structure of Florida and the Mississippi Valley, there's really crazy bad weather in the United States in that second Calvin Coolidge term. The hurricane of 1926 in Miami is followed by the great Mississippi flood of April 1927, where you've got the Mississippi gets 60 miles wide at one point. There are again 250 dead. There are a million people affected. It is a great mess. And all of this is going to soften the economy as is also the overspending by farmers during World War I because they're producing foodstuffs for Europe and the rest of the world. And they over plant and they over borrow. And so that sector of the economy is weak. And that more than the hurricanes or the natural disasters is going to create conditions leading to the Great Depression in 1929. But then you get into the situation of 1928, which is the killer, the absolute killer that you were alluding to before that. And the storm, like all the other starts out there in the Atlantic Ocean, pounds an island called Guadalupe. 1,200 people die on this small island. The significant thing in terms of warning for this hurricane, and these hurricanes don't have names until 1953, is for the first time a ship at sea spots one of these things and is able to radio to land that something is coming. So that when it hits Puerto Rico, there are only 312 people dead because of the warning system. And then people think it's going to hit Miami again, but it hits West Palm Beach. And because it hits to the north, instead of pounding from the ocean with water, it hits Lake Okeechobee, that big freshwater lake in the middle of the Florida Everglades. There are huge amounts of migrant workers all around there. And the winds causes the lake to slash over. There's like a called Muck dams. It breaks these dams and it floods the south, and then it keeps moving, moving, and it floods the north. And you have thousands of people, absolutely thousands of poor black migrant workers killed. It is such a horrendous situation that there are 1600 of them buried in one mass grave at Port Mallarka in Martin County, one mass grave. They are spheres of typhoid. They have to put people almost at gunpoint to get them back to clear the bodies off the streets. There's another burial ground with 743 in a mass grave, which was unmarked for six decades. What you were talking about before is that people didn't want to talk about this situation. It was horrible. And most of the people who did die there were black, were these poor black migrant workers. They couldn't identify the bodies because whole families and whole communities were wiped out. So David, I've got about a minute here. Help me out on this. As I'm looking, you started with, you know, in the 1920s, you had the Ponzi schemes, you had Wall Street, you had land speculation, and then you had really bad weather situations. As you're watching the news today, does it feel similar at all or is it my lack of understanding of history? I think that with the wildfires in the West, hurricanes hitting again after a merciful hiatus and the situation in Florida, I mean, we are always at the mercy of mother nature or the universe or of God. If we think that we are just going to continue on with our prosperity, we haven't read the Bible with seven years of fat living and seven years of famine. And we are always on the verge of some great disaster. We should not get too full of ourselves. David, thank you very much. David Patruza, his book, 1920, the year of the six presidents, one of Glenn's favorites. You can get a link to it at World of Stu on Twitter. Next book is TR's Last War. We'll have it back for this one for sure. Theodore Roosevelt and World War One, his triumph and tragedy. I'd like to see how that goes. Mercury. It's a massive storm. It can be devastating. I'm a father. I'm a grandfather. I love my family. I hope every parent in the state and grandparents think, how do I protect my family? If you're an evacuation zone, you've got to get out. You can't wait. The roads will get worse when it gets out. I've canceled all the schools. K-12, state college and universities to open up more shelters. They're good evacuation, our shelter in areas. This is what everybody is listening to. It's what the people in Florida heard from their governor Rick Scott. I think people don't have any clue on what was headed their way. As usual, some people say, oh, Ben, I ran him through. You don't want to ride this one through. The thing that makes the difference now, these hurricanes would be devastating much more than they are, devastating if we didn't have an early warning system. And as David Patruza was just pointing out, that is what happened in the 1920s. Nobody had any warning. And that's why they were literally burying people in mass graves and burning bodies in the streets. It was horrific. It was so bad. It's called the Lost Hurricane because people didn't want to remember it and the politicians didn't want it to collapse the economy of Florida. And lead to the Great Depression, which in roundabout way, it did. Here's the other thing about the difference between 1920s and America today. When these hurricanes hit, they were pretty much taken care of by the local people, the state, and churches all around the country. People bound themselves together like you're seeing here in Houston. When the flood of 1927 happened in Mississippi, Congress wanted to load up an infrastructure bill with all sorts of things. They wanted to send $1.4 billion down for the flood to be able to help things out. Now remember, that is 1927, $1.4 billion they wanted to bundle up and send down to the people of Mississippi. The president stopped them from doing it. To give you some perspective, the entire federal budget, that year was $3 billion. So they wanted to send almost half of the entire federal budget. The people of Mississippi didn't want it and they didn't want a government that size and the people and the businesses took care of it. Now obviously there is a place for the federal government when it comes to helping rescue people, etc. But I think the people of Texas and the people of Florida are going to amaze those people in Washington who think, oh, they're just going to sit around and wait for us. Remember, I mean, they want you want to do as much as you can yourself. Remember the tax in Pennsylvania for the flood that happened 100 years ago? Yes. And they're still paying. If you live in Pennsylvania today, you're still paying this tax, which is supposed to help rebuild a city from a flood of 100 years ago. Yeah, it was wiped out. This whole city was wiped out. And the state wanted to help pay for rebuilding this city. And so they put a temporary tax in. Temporary temporary. It's actually been raised since. Yeah, it's actually raised it. It happened 100 years ago. We've we've made that we've rebuilt that town. We could have rebuilt it like 100 times since. And they're still raising the taxes on that. And they will use this, you know, never let a crisis go to waste. They will use this to do all sorts of things. I mean, the left will certainly try for global warming. You know, you'll have people implementing taxes. These costs will go on forever. It's I mean, it's incredibly tragic. It is a different definitely a change in philosophy of our nation to decide that the federal government is always responsible for this. We are the first responders. I am so sick of hearing talk about first responders. That's something that that was made popular by Jimmy Carter of all people. We think that's been around forever. It hasn't been in the 1970s. It's Jimmy Carter who started talking about first responders. We are the first responders. And if you believe in that, if you want the government to do less than we have to do more, I would love for you to get involved in any charity that you feel is responsible and helping out. We are working hard to make sure that we have resources on the ground now in Texas and in Florida. And you can help us help our neighbors by going to mercury1.org and donate now mercury1.org. Don't argue. This is the Glenn Beck program. Every time I say something like what I'm about to say, I'm in my head. It is always preceded with good God. The guy's still alive. Don Imus joins us on the program now. Hello, Don. How are you? That's not good. No fire started in here now, Glenn. So Don, you know, always, well, first of all, a manhole listening to these commercials, you got one for the IRS. If you're a deadbeat, unpaid your taxes, then the next part is a blood printer deal. And then the last part would they give you if you're 85 or you get a deal on a on a on a on a funeral or who's listening to your program? You those were fed down the phone line for you. So, so Don, first of all, were you affected by the hurricane because you you live in Texas? Most people don't know. We live in Brenham, Texas. We have a ranch here in Washington County, we're 85 miles from Houston. We got 30 inches of rain here to rent. My son, Wyatt, I must go to Rice University, which is right in the middle of Houston. And my other son flies finer jets out of Pensacola. So maybe this is God just trying to wipe the IMS family out. Have you thought of that? Yeah, it does sound like way. So we did now we weren't flooded here because we had a high point in the county, but you know, 30 inches of rain, like as well as as a tenor one dollar square foot, I've got a brand new copper roof on it, a roof start leaking. So, but nothing like God is people are so many. What's this operation barbecue thing you're doing? We thought that it would be, you know, helpful to go cook some food. So we're we are supporting the operation barbecue group that goes out and they're actually doing at the convention center. They've provided I think 335,000 meals since this all began. Is that your deal? Yeah, well, we're the we're one of their big supporters. Yes. Okay. Well, and who handles the money? Not me. Okay. Well, that's fine. Yeah. But I mean, there's a red cross and barber FEMA. I'm not I'm not sure how I'm not sure what everybody is doing. I know that we're supporting a couple of them. Operation barbecue team Rubicon. Do you know anything about them? They're amazing. They are a group of veterans all over the country that when there's a need, they just they just all kind of come in and we've flown I think 1100 of them in from all over the country and and they're just going in and they're mucking out these houses. Well, they're doing I miss you on my lovely wife and veteran. Yeah. Well, we call a little chopper around the ranch here. We wanted to give some money, but they're sort of organization if we won't give any money to. So maybe off the air, you can text here. Sure. Tell me who it is. We'll be happy to. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. We'll give you the deal. We're right way on. Oh geez, here we go. No, we didn't. Well, we mean, oh geez, here we go. Oh, because because Don, you know, I, you know, the the world has been, you know, at each other's throats for the last couple of years and then we've had a nice break where people come together and they love each other and it's nice and and I, you know, I did question my wisdom inviting you. I thought, well, you know, all good things have to come to an end. Let's let's just pile Don. I'm a son of this and reverse the thrusters. Well, we all know what a while we did and we all know what I did when I got fired for trying to be funny, which I shouldn't abandon and well, I wound up okay, but you know, I said, so when you think of the most morning, if we don't know what you're doing, wait, wait, wait, what? There's something you're doing that we the great honor washed out of here that we don't know. You could have a couple of midges and I don't know what it can say, mid to Thomas. You could have a couple of little people in your basement with a pony, right, and two hookers and who wouldn't know that you wouldn't have any idea. But I've hidden it pretty well, haven't I? Yes, you have. But here's the thing. You can bet on this. It's gonna come out. Nobody's going to come out. So here's what I'm saying to. All right. Okay. All right. Tell us now. Tell us, talk to me. I really I mean, to the pony, no, just you're trying to kiss me. Yeah, even ponies won't kiss me. I've your boy Trump, my boy Trump don't even don't even start with me on my boy Trump. You're the one who writes to me telling me how much you love him. You know, it's not the same guy I knew I knew him for 40 years. That's the same guy God, oh, my. So did he, uh, uh, you know, there's some people saying that he he's become the he yesterday was his first day as a Democrat in office. Do you buy into that? No, I don't pay attention. All right. I mean, I'm just waiting for him to say I've had enough and go back to Trump Tower, which is by the way ruined his name and everything else. So no, he's a moron place. Stop it. I thought this was your guy. Well, he's not my guy anymore, Glenn. So now what? So, you know, I was done by the money when he jumped on the cane. So not his car. Right. You know, his kind of war here was on one of his captured. You kidding me? This is this bad blood, but he'd more five departments to keep going to Vietnam. All right. No, why he didn't want to go to Vietnam? Because he's a coward. This is what happens when Don told you get to go to Vietnam, got shot down over Vietnam, John McCain, you know, but I was in the Marine Corps. I was in the jungles of Vietnam killing the comms of people like you to have these stupid radio programs. What are you talking about? I played the biggle in the Marine Corps band. Right. But you were there. You were there. You were there. So, Don, what has changed in Donald Trump since, you know, you say, you know, 40 years, this is not the guy you knew. What's different about him? Well, I just thought he was a lot smarter. And you know, once you're president, you wouldn't think you'd have to defend every slight. You wouldn't think you'd have to validate your presence on the planet with tweets about how big the crowd was or whatever this I mean. I mean, you know, I got in a huge fight with him. That's a press cover never came back. And 25 years ago, he was a he was a bachelor of that. And he was posing for some, I forget what it was. And I said, he had grandma arms. You know, he had the big old flap on his arms. So, and he was going bankrupt in his casinos. So I said, the boy was going from the back of the limo to the front of the limo. So he took great offense. That said that the doubt that I stood a lot of wood, wouldn't drink and liquor anymore. And doing cocaine, I wasn't funny. It used to be Howard Stern was a lot better than a kid. But it's delighted to see that Stern voted for Hillary Clinton. But is there is there is there any is there any difference though on, you know, a how you treated Bill Clinton, I'll never forget the flop sweat on Don I miss. Or was there any flops? Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh. It was it was it was. I felt like I was living. You know, if I would watch it again, there would be no difference between this and the coverage of Hurricane Harvey. There was so much water coming off of you. I had the guts to start up there and here is that. And by the way, I did. The next day on here, there's a back there. What are you talking about? You, I agree, you did. But it I've never seen you squirm like that. It was because you could, he was glad of me. And Hillary, she was glad of me. And they were thinking about walking out of the resort to our right. So what is the so what is the difference between what you said there and their reaction and when you talk about grandma arms and to quote you blubber did he's what is. I don't know. Well, I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't answer that question. Don't ask me difficult question. That's a real. No, but I don't know. I like to call your program. My wife and I wanted to give some money to this deal to talk some scam. But I didn't call up to take an S.A.T. test. All right. All right. All right. How much money you're going to give? I'd give a hundred grand if we would give a hundred grand if I were for legitimate. Wow. Well, what what it is legitimate, Don, there's not a dime goes through. I don't know who handles the money. If the Red Cross. No, the Red Cross is the money. The Red Cross have FEMA and Red Cross. This actually my charity was started because I don't trust FEMA and the Red Cross. And so there's not a dime that comes to us. If you market for Hurricane Harvey or Irma or whatever 100% of the proceeds go right directly to the things that we have here marked on the on the site. And you can even say I you know, I wanted to go to our Operation Barbecue or Team Rubicon or you can you can you can you have my email address. I get a little winey little email from me all the time. Send me it send me a note about who handles the money. What's it believes? Mercury arts or whatever. Yeah. And then where does send the money? We'll give you a hundred thousand dollars. All right. That's that's nice of you, Don. It's a little cheap now that you've gotten rid of the cancer farm. You know, I thought you'd be a little more generous, but you're not. You're really just the worst. You know, we're kind of like, you know, we're gonna be I want to know. We're so I just see you. Little fat boys that make it my flat dance. All right. All right. All right. I was I was in the morning. It would be I miss dot com. We get the updates on the whatever going to do it with that pony in the basement. That coming up along with Doris Kerns. Good one. Narrows. Oh, he's awesome. He is great. I have to I have to ask him for permission to print the emails the email exchanges from us over the years for like 10 years. We've been going back and forth on emails and they're the most cruel. Oh my God, politically incorrect. Just brutal beatings of one another. I mean, just beating of one another relentless and derrickle. There's not a moment of saying no, but you know, we like you like there's none of that. No, I said that the first time the first thing remember that the first time we went back and forth and I I, you know, I thought, okay, I'm gonna write Donnie gave me his email address. I can't write something nice because that's not who he is. And so I I gave him a backhanded compliment and he came back even stronger. And so then we just got into this war and about I don't know about six emails in. I decided to say, you know, but really, I mean, you're a great guy and everything else. And he just went off on me. Really? Really? This is who you are. You really need to think you need to say that. Don't ever write to me again. I mean, he's just brutal in all ways. But what I really like about him is he's a really nice guy and he can take the punch as hard as he can throw it. Yeah. And also say, should not brush off the fact that he just offered $100,000 for Harvey relief. You know, I mean, it still doesn't change that ends that in medication every month. That's true. But I mean, I think that's an every week is probably more accurate, but day. But all right. Well, but we we we accepted and it is really nice. It's very nice of him. Mercury. So, anybody look at that Equifax thing and go, huh, that sounds like it's important. Sounds like that's important. I should probably figure out what that means to me. Oh, well, what else is going on? Equifax is the credit monitoring service and they have suffered a massive hack and 143 million Americans have been affected as one of the, you know, three major credit reporting agencies and hackers gained access into the system in mid May and remained in the network until July. Oops. Probably should have probably should have had a life lock. Yeah, that's right. That's that was their answer to these things. Like, here's a brand you've never heard of that's somewhat kind of similar to some of the things life lock does. And you could do that because then if we really screwed up, you'll catch some of it. It'd be easier to just have it from the beginning, I suppose. They got the commercial, by the way, they got the social security numbers, the birthdays and the addresses. They also pilfered the credit card numbers of about 209,000 people in documents about credit disputes for 182,000. The CEO says I deeply regret this incident. Today's a humbling experience for all of us. Equifax will not be defined by this incident. No, I have a feeling that you're going to probably be defined by the fact that a lot of your, your higher ups there in the company started selling their stock because they knew that this news was coming out and the public didn't know three Equifax executive sold shares of the company worth nearly two million dollars after the breach was discovered. But before it was announced to the public, that's not worth that money. No, that's not going to work out well for you. They actually keep track of who buys and sells stocks. I think it's not like really bad. It is not a good idea. And not to mention it looks terrible. I mean, you know, who knows they could have had this plan for months. I'm sure they'll have some argument for it, but it doesn't look good. It does not look. Hey, we want to let you know that all this weekend, Mercury one will be working with charities all around Florida and Texas. Please get involved mercury one dot org and our prayers are with you."
