    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Ferellis with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. Happy Friday. Happy Friday. We made it through the week. We're here. It's the conclusion of the week. We have an awesome show. You know what? Let me let me backtrack. I hope we have an awesome show playing for you today. We're going to unpack this show different than we normally do at the insistence of our nearly comatost and brain dead producer, John Hadley, who had a good day yesterday and decided to double down. He decided to double down. Yesterday we ended the show with debating a young man, Joshua Alexander, over one of his approval rating scores. And so that has filled John Hadley with a bit of confidence and he has insisted from his nursing home bed in St. Louis, Missouri that we double down and unpack today's show a bit differently. According to John, my fire starter, which we normally start the shows with, he says it's very good, but he thinks it's a little too heavy to start the show out with, hey, why not start out on a lighter note, Jay? And so we're going to do that today, see how it goes. I do have a terrific fire starter planned for today. It is a bit heavy. It's about the events here in Tennessee at the state Capitol and at the House of Representatives here. In Nashville over, you know, gun violence, gun control, the covenant school shooting. I'm going to get into that at the end of the show. Robbie Starbucks going to join us and we're going to talk about the Tennessee three, two of which got expelled from the house. They'll circle back and be brought back in at some point, but we'll talk about that stuff, the heavier stuff, at the end of the show, because John Hadley thinks that we should start the show on a lighter note, a more upbeat note than that heavy discussion. Steve Kim's also going to be here. He'll be here in the middle of the show, but we're going to go out on a limb here and take the advice of John Hadley. So what I would ask all of you all to do is pray for Hadley because if this does not go well, his days here could be numbered for making such a silly suggestion that I put the fire starter at the tail end of the show to just today as we open on a bit of a lighter note. And so what I want to do before we get into what could be a Hadley inspired mess, I want to take care of my favorite best friend, the organization that gives this show and us direction and a purpose and inspiration. I want to tell you guys about preborn before, you know, we potentially make a mess of this show. You guys know what preborn does and you know what we do for preborn. We support preborn because we have a mindset that life begins in the womb. We understand that and believe that because the Bible tells us so. He made us in his image while inside the womb. And so preborn is one of the number one, if not the number one organization fighting abortion culture and helping women choose life over abortion. When a woman gets an ultrasound, here's that baby's heartbeat, sees that baby in the womb, she is far more likely to choose life than abortion. Preborn provides free abortions to expected mothers who are contemplating abortion. I think it's like 80% of the time when the woman sees that, hears that ultrasound, hears that heartbeat, sees the baby in the womb, she chooses life. It costs $28 per ultrasound, five ultrasounds, $140. We as fearless soldiers because we know life begins inside the womb have been supporting preborn. It's part of our mission. I love to get the emails from you guys telling me that you've done it, that you've supported preborn. I got two or three more yesterday. This is part of our mission. This is one of the things we can do to fight the culture of death, the satanic culture of death. All of this stuff is connected. Everything that you're seeing going on in the world, the whole transgender nuttiness, all of it is connected to a mindset that doesn't value life inside the womb. It really is. I just want you to think it through. If you don't understand that life begins in the womb, how am I expected you to value life once it gets here outside the womb? Any of you that are parents know that the actions, the precautions, the steps you take while carrying a baby, talking to your baby while in the womb, eating the proper things while the baby is in the womb. Peace and tranquility and a lack of tension, all important inside the womb. We know that you start caring for a baby inside the womb and the people that don't care for the baby inside the womb end up paying a price or end up costing that baby outside the womb. Common sense, the science, everything tells you life begins inside the womb and it's important that we support that life inside the womb and support women in their early years of not just pregnancy but in the development of that child and that's where preborn comes in and uses their money to support that woman, to provide her that ultrasound and then give her the support she needs the first two years of that baby's life so that she, the baby gets off to a great start. So you guys know what we do. We pick up our phones, we dial pound 250 and we say the keyword baby or we do it the Jason went lock away and we go preborn.com slash Jason preborn.com slash Jason be a loyal obedient fearless soldier. Hey even if it's just five dollars or five hundred dollars or five thousand dollars it all counts the same it all helps you get in that mindset about where life begins and you'll be amazed at how once you adopt that mindset it will change your whole approach to life in all endeavors preborn.com slash Jason pound 250 say the keyword baby be a good fearless soldier. All right I've taken care of our partner here at preborn that's awesome you guys know what to do now if we could just see you at home sitting there while you're hitting the likes button while you're hitting the notifications and the subscribe button while you're telling your friends to hey join the fearless army watch this show it's a great conversation for us to have it it's a great worldview it's it's talking about all the issues in the world from a biblical point of view it's an awesome show while you're out promoting the show while you're on apple hitting that five-star review over and over and over again and telling your friends hey it's just a small thing hit that's five-star review while you're fighting the algorithm say a little prayer for John Hadley that this goes well we're gonna roll out to Todd Robison as we did the yesterday we're gonna bring in this is an opportunity to bring in actual fans of the show audience members of the show John Hadley came up with this idea of incorporating them into the show while while debating them about their approval rating scores and if you haven't downloaded the approval rating app you need to do that it's in the apple store it's in the google store if you got one of those android phones we have a gentleman here I believe by the name of Todd Robison he has an absolutely ridiculous and stupid opinion I've been told about the movie New Jack City oh do we do we have I hope we have Todd's rating because now I got a fine Todd in my approval rating but let's call up Todd Todd yeah what's up handsome guy looks like he's pretty smart but based on this rating Todd you don't know what you're talking about look you need to rewatch New Jack City rewatch it I don't you don't look old enough to have seen it when it first came out so but if you rewatch it New Jack City is like what are you kind of that like a 90 a 90 you got it at a smoke show I mean that blazing hot yes one of the most overrated movies of all time uh to defend your position J I'm looking at what you said J it says that you said iced tea nobody is going to watch New Jack City for iced tea cut it out first of all we're there for Wesley Snipes Wesley Snipes absolutely kills his role I mean am I my brother's keeper listen which I know she was looking for you looking for a cameo use this use magazine in a camera nearby Coco you was looking for that button it wasn't on there she wasn't on that show I'm telling you what you got to say J. Well I can say this iced tea's acting was so terrible in this movie and so comical and he was so in over his head and his relationship with what was the white cop with the buzz haircut he's a popular actor uh very popular I think he was in breakfast club I don't know why I can't think of the white dude there was the other cop that was crazy their whole narrative around them was just silly and stupid and and the other actors opposite Wesley Snipes were mediocre to bad I look when I saw it as a young person like yourself when I was young and silly and didn't know what I was looking at I enjoyed the movie and thought it was great I just happened to rewatch it in the last year or two and I've got it at a 67 a grease fire and I've heard nothing from you that I'm sorry go ahead you must have forgot about iced tea see he had that song cop killed you remember that so he had to do that oh that was his apology for him doing that song that was him to get back slid into the the the uh what you call it the the la whatever that that lifestyle the movie style because he had to do that because he had to apologize that they had to make him play that role so he did exactly what he's supposed to do he looked just like a bomb he looked like an undercover cop being a bomb and he played it to the tee to the tee and then the most tip there's a reason why I'm the host to this show it's because I'm the smartest person on the show and uh Hadley I'm going to give you a strike right now you're down one Todd Todd brought nothing to the table Hadley I got it I got it I got it I got it I got it I got it I got it I got it I got it go Jack City go fill out other things on the approval after cut Todd off we're done with Todd we're done with Todd while you guys uh line up the next person for me the slaughter let me while you dialing them up let me tell you guys about nefarious that is the movie that my good friend our good friend our blaze co-worker Steve Dase heavily involved in he wrote the book Nefere I've seen the movie I saw a premiere of it right here in these studios a couple of months ago I can recommend it to you without hesitation it's an excellent movie it's an entertainment look you guys know I walk out of most movies probably half of them I fall asleep in half of the movies that I sit through I'm a tough movie critic when I tell you a movie's good and worth you paying money to see take that recommendation this is it's interesting for those of you that have a biblical worldview for those of you that are tired of of the same woke movies with the same theme all the time this is different it's a it's got a great twist it's going to have you on the edge of your seat it's going to have you a little bit scared that there's this guy that's being sentenced to death and they've sent this investigator into his prison or into the prison to find out if the guy's sane enough to be killed the psychiatrist they sit in there thinks he's the smartest guy in the world the the killer thinks he's the smartest guy in the world they have this clash I'm not gonna blow the whole movie for you but it's a supernatural thriller it's perfect for you and your friends that love scary movies but more than that it's not going to violate your biblical worldview it's you can go see it and enjoy it and feel like you're just at any other movie instrument instrument it's going to start a great conversation afterwards nefarious opens nationwide the weekend of april 14th mark the date and get your tickets now at who is nefarious calm that's who is nefarious calm all right who uh i believe uh brian Elias is my next victim brian uh welcome uh oh what oh god i remembered looking at this i can i can i'm not even the biggest kobie brian fan in the world i'm known for being a kobie brian critic okay but lord have mercy brian you slaughtered kobie brian on the approval i can't believe it you got him in 67 you gave me that that's accurate i hope your house has 24 hour security because snoop dog and everybody's gonna come looking for for you they're gonna do you like they did gale king my god please justify this broi listen man i think we have forgot a lot of stuff right we need to be americans and not be amnesians right people who forget we must have forgot that kobie he's snatched he's a rat shack right well shack shack pays women for you know hush money and in this and that can you imagine what shut kobie kobie kobie don't say that kobie kobie come on man listen oh dear what you say you don't snitch on your home boys right you know it it where i'm from what we say right snitches get stitches right but especially on your home boy come on y'all come on man you don't do that you don't do that and we forgot we forgot we forgot about that you got even like a three-end character man and listen i was right there with you i was right there with you but post playing career i like kobie brian i like where he had pivoted you know he had his bad moment a really bad moment in calorado and he did snitch on shack but you can't judge a man off of one incident you gotta judge the whole body of work and look look if you look at his career you look at his worth his ed factor i gave it to him i was a fan right when he came out i was kobie kobie but when he did this i was like no b no b don't do this that's suffice to go ahead to hear this character all right so uh Hadley i'll say this i think brian actually did a good job i disagree with him snoop if anybody's watching this and they get mad and they want to treat somebody like gale king make it brian not me uh you know i had i think i got kobie rated like an 80 on the approval rating that happened so uh i i think 67 is just too low you gotta you gotta be right in the middle with kobie on you know 14 13 15 and in character i can't go all the way down to a three and yes what the calorado thing from the alligators from the woman that what he did about shak i get it but i i i can't go there uh i think Hadley it's one to one right now you we got one good one one okay one uh before we go to our next uh approval rating person i want to tell you all that there's still time for you to sign up uh for roll call and i want you to sign up for roll call and i've had some people email me and i want to assure people that uh on april 14th and 15th here in nashville we are taking all of the necessary

back uh to your next yes and this one's going to be light work real light work for me uh he calls himself papi yang he's got the worst rating i've ever seen on the app so far uh he's got two poxicoor at a perfect score of 100 with a character rating of 25 perfection papi two pox went to prison for rape bruh help me out what is what does he got to do to lower his character we got oj rated 101 what help hold on hold on jason you got to check this out so if anybody should know anything is you and you should know that's fake news we're talking about the same park that's for the people the same park that love the kids the same park that believe in god now this is the same park that's raping women i believe not i believe not we're talking about we're talking about two pot the one that's fearless this fearless with jason will i right i'm on the right show because i think you got the wrong rate i think you got the wrong rate we talking about pot come on two poxico gangster rapper two poxo video beating up a man in the lobby at the mta but oh taking some tail is a bridge too far for two pop that's allegedly okay let's remove let's remove the rape charges that he went to prison for two and a half years for he then partners up with shugnight a known gang kingpin a known killer he beats up a man another gang member in the lobby of the mgm i mean what i see is he seems a 25 perfect character yes 25 character yes pop was all literally pop was perfect pop was literally almost perfect man you got to give pop credit you mean you're you're you're discrediting who he is because he went to the biggest label so he could have the biggest voice to reach the people that's what i see that's what i see i don't know what you say sis pop how old are you poppy i'm 27 so babe you weren't even alive during two pox hey day correct correct well i was born when he was dying and have you ever listened to hit him up yes i had the greatest have you ever listened to hit him up yeah tell me how you do hit him up and have a perfect character you talk he got a shot at i would make hit him up if somebody shot at me too i think you would too wouldn't you no i would you wouldn't i would give him my needs and pray to god thank you for saving me and please don't let me ever do then get put in this position again i can respect that i can respect that so so even so yeah you still got a low you still got um what did you have pocket first character i think oh well do we have do we have my two-part score i can look it up i guess oh we don't have my two i can look it up here in the app you got poppy i'm gonna let you go i will tell you uh my score as we wave goodbye to you i can't that's still the worst score it makes me suspect of any of your other scores in the app my god people think all kinds of crazy things and two-part as well i got him at a 60 no i got i got hit him up at a 60 i got two-part at a 65 yeah two-part at a 65 i give his career 24 he he's you know and would have you know in my view there's an argument he's the greatest rapper of all time uh you know i couldn't go perfect just because he's a gangster rapper character i gave him a one he did make dear mama uh authenticity i only gave him a 15 in authenticity because again two-part i really don't he adopted that gangster stuff that ain't really who he is uh brand he's got a strong brand he got 27 year old kids out here thinking two-pocks a hundred thinking there's no way that a guy that made all that nasty vile uh degenerate music oh there's no way there's no way he's sexy or so this is what i love about this app though it does start conversations and it does like an old man like me can talk to someone half my age and have a discussion a conversation with him and try to talk some sense into these young people two-pock a hundred uh and i think we're ready for our final approval rating guess Hadley said he saved the best for last although i'm not so sure i don't i believe the young lady's name is Lauren and she has uh rated me or dropped my rating quite a bit my personal to Jason Whitlock rating i believe Lauren gave me a two in character and uh Lauren i would like an explanation why listen Jason we love your show and we tune in to listen to you about your faith your uh take on things and we especially love shamika because she actually represents real women of the world now your character if we were just here for your uh eye candy and your intelligence you have that cover we've got Roy Swide segments we've got Delano heck even Rowan coach JB and sprinkle in some of that uh Steve Kim and come on bring back Larry Johnson with a shirt off if we're just talking about eye can't but the arrogance about you know the hair color and the confidence that us women just tune in for your looks we had we had to drop the character to a two hey and you got it and so are you actually suggesting that Roy Swide and Larry Johnson and Delano look better than me is that what you're suggesting hey i said like what i said and i meant it so we tune in to your show because we love your take on your you know politics and sports we get all of that but the eye candy leave it to the other guys uh by lorn by uh Hadley I'm blaming you for that that was a setup there's no way that's an authentic member of our audience I want to kneel or Connie or someone that I see in the chat on a regular basis on this show next week I don't want any of these ringers or I'm sure that's some kind of friend of Royce's or friend of who did she say Royce and she referenced Steve Kim but i'm not i'm not buying that that's a real member of our audience probably never seen the show y'all probably gave her talking points uh anyway uh you know what Steve Kim's next let's go do did you know that when a news site puts google ads on its articles they're also giving google the ability to suppress any article they don't like and make it virtually impossible for you to find it's true virtually every news site in the country uses google ad exchange which gives the big tech giant incredible power to control what you see at blaze media we've had enough we're doing something about it the blaze.com has been revamped to get rid of every last ad that makes us the only conservative news site that's truly independent from big tech have a look for yourself and learn what you can do to help join the fight against big tech censorship visit the blaze.com today all right welcome back i have to admit that last segment kind of bruised my ego uh oh i did Steve Kim Steve Kim i found one we hadly found the one person in america who thinks you're better looking at me i i don't know what he paid her i don't know what bryb was offered but i was just insulted on this show and so now i got it to go to you and i want to talk about angel ree steve angel reese and lsu they have accepted uh their invitation to the white house ceremony i know you can't wait for this story to be over but they just keep extending the life of the story and i'm starting to be fatigued by it i don't care if lsu goes to the white house i always knew they were going to accept the invitation there's not some 19 20 year old girl that no one had ever heard of angel reese that now is a shot caller about what lsu is going to do and who's going to go to the white house or whatever um anyway your thoughts on angel reese she's and the lsu team agreeing to go to the white house well i i don't understand this um lsu was always going to get the invite it was one individual that says i'm not going to take it i actually think she should have been given the option not to go if you feel that strongly about it now i want to make this clear gill bines invite to both teams was really dumb and stupid um angel reese's answer was dumb or in stupider but at the but when it's all said and done she still has the right to say i want to sit out but this is another reason why i i don't take athletes as activists seriously they have no guts they actually don't mean a thing that they say the fact that she capitulated and just accepted the invite says everything i need to know about whatever she says in the future now this is going to surprise you if she would have stuck my words and no no no no no i'm waiting for a berry and michelle um i'm going over to the vineyards right now i want to wait for them and what a step i know i would have respected that but this is another example of why when athletes take any type of stance don't believe them don't take them seriously pet them on the head roll out the balls let them play but do not take them seriously ever i agree with everything you just said 100 i'll just add in she's so addicted to attention of course she's going to go to the white house there will be cameras and microphones there like like she really she she never had any intention she's just in love with the attention she's a young girl they love attention she's six foot three or whatever and so she probably hasn't gotten the kind of attention she's always wanted and she's getting it now people are hanging on her every word people are treating her like she's a big deal uh she's buy you barbie and you know is going to parlay this into being the hot six foot three basketball player and again that's going to be a stretch but you know anytime you can turn lizzo into a sex symbol you can probably do the same you can certainly do the same with a basketball player but she's just for lack of a better description i hate to be politically incorrect but she's just an attention whore and there's going to be attention at the white house where of course she's going i mean i think that's to be expected look but when you win the nvp or whatever that tournament award is look she's a nice looking young lady okay and so she's she's now the queen of college basketball outside of Iowa right so now she's going to get this attention and i don't know if it's going to be 15 minutes of fame or not but uh you know as far as i'm concerned now it's going to be 15 minutes she's not a very skilled player Steve she's just tall this is the last the tournament i'm gonna move you hold on wait a minute she was okay now i'm going to become female basketball dick by tal this is going to second me here but wasn't she the second ranked player out of high school i read on one of those graphics she played pretty well she was not as good as that girl at Iowa i see tall yeah uh Jason news flash most division one basketball players men and women get this are tall that's why there's not a lot of Asians we're in the chemistry lab or 5-7 we can't run or jump some of us can shoot but we have no athleticism so we know our lot in life but to say that she can't play Jason come on i said she's not skilled that's the same thing she is she ain't Cheryl Miller she's not Cheryl Miller she's not Lisa Leslie she's not Cheryl Swoop look at me with my basketball female but okay but for this particular year she's the probably the most valuable player on the best team and she did that little thing so that means something something and by the way she needs to be thanking god that Iowa beats South Carolina because if they hadn't no one would know who angel Reese is and by the way your agitation blame you because we should have ended all of this talk on Wednesday but here we are on Friday talking about angel Reese i don't set the i don't set the format you do Whitlock but anyway let's go keep it moving uh let's stay in the female sports athletic lane and this is a bit more serious really again do we have the video of rally games and pozo yeah uh put up some video of transgender activists going after rally games university of kentucky swimmer who's been pretty outspoken she doesn't want to compete against men pretending to be uh boy i mean pretending to be girls she's been going out around the country speaking and i'm not i can't recall off the top of my head what school she was speaking at last night but they had to put her bunker her in barricade her in take a look at this video i'm coming i'm good i'm good i'm goodIs Is ...trans women, R women, R women, R women. It's one women, trans women, R women, R women, trans women, R women, trans women, R women, trans women, R women, trans women. Yeah so, I mean, she had to be escorted off into safety. And I mean, she's taking real risk here with her position standing up against Leah Thomas and competing against men in women's sports. I'm fascinated by this whole thing, the protesters. Why are they so passionate about it when they know it is general biology? But again, I'm beginning to think we need to let back water hoses and billy clubs. I mean, good grief. I long for the good old days of public control. And that is an angry mob. And I want to give Riley, young Riley, there are a lot of credit because I think it takes incredible amount of fortitude and guts. But this question has to be asked of those who wag the finger on a daily basis, on a regular basis, the Jamel Hills, the Joy Taylor's of the world now, that tell us that women's sports are important, that we need to cover them, that we need to spotlight them, and that we need to go out there and give equal treatment and that it's important. They themselves do not say a word about this. And it's very simple. You know why? It's not in their script. They're not allowed to. It's not part of the approved messaging. But you cannot tell me on one hand that women's sports needs to be covered, that it's important, that it's everybody's good. When you allow this type of behavior to take place, I'm looking at some of the footage, Jason, of combat sports. Specifically the MMA, where there are transgender males who are literally crushing people's skulls. Now, first of all, it's already dangerous. Anytime you get hit by anybody, it never tickles. Trust me. But when you are now going into bone density, lean muscle mass and overall strength, and the images that you're seeing of people just getting laid out, and you know it's not right, and I hope to God boxing never crosses. They already have one transgender boxer. I really hope that God, I'm not in a position where you have to be ringsited and watch this type of really unbalanced competition. You make an excellent point, and I'm glad you went there because that was part of my thought process that I had forgotten. I've seen the video of this. I think this person, this man pretending to be a woman has crushed two skulls, I think, an MMA competition. This is ridiculous and that we're tolerating this. And to see this young lady, the rally, games out here on the front lines and facing the kind of animus, a woman speaking out to protect other women from unfair competition. And you don't see other women, Sarah Spain, Mina Kimes, Jamel Hill, all the rest running to support this woman. It's crazy and you don't see Steven A. Smith. Steven A. Smith will jump on a grenade, literally jump on a grenade so that a little black girl at Duke doesn't hear some harmful words at a volleyball match. But rally games can face this type of harassment and threats because she wants to protect women's sports. That's, it's a joke and it points to the hypocrisy, the stupidity and the cowardice of, of all of us and particularly them and the hypocrisy of all of them on a lighter note. You got any advice for Cam Newton? Cam Newton puts out a list or goes on camera talking about, here's the quarterback's I'm willing to back up. You're willing. Okay. What is this guy thinking? This is, what is he thinking? He's out of the league the entire year and there's only a certain group of teams that he will grant the privilege of being a backup quarterback to and he's wondering why he's not in the league. He still exists in a state of delusion. He still thinks he's the same guy that came out of Auburn as the number one pick. You ain't got it like that, Cam. You can't dictate anything at this point. You got to be willing to, the guy should damn there be willing to play in the XFL. Let alone, hey, here's a list of teams I'll play for and quarterbacks I'll back up. That's a joke. Well, yeah, I mean, Jason, unless that list had 32 teams, all 32 teams, it just comes off as entitled. And there's only one thing that he really needs right now. And that's a hot tub time machine to 2015. Because since that MVP year, it's been a slow, steady, and then a precipitous decline. And the feeling that I have is that once that experiment or that run, the second run in Carolina came to an end where he just really was not effective at all. And it looks like he had diminished offensive capabilities or athletic capabilities. You got the sense, geez, Cam, it's over. You got a really nice career. You made a lot of money. But the lack of self awareness, as if to say, I've got suitors and I've got choices. You know, again, I'm going to draw back to Kevin Samuel's analogy. It's like that lady that put on 30 pounds after four kids after the divorce. You know, lady, when you're at Applebee's at 11 o'clock at night, people don't, you don't really get to choose. Guys get to choose you on last call. Give me a break. So that's what it is. That's what Cam Newton is right now. And I feel bad for him because I don't think anyone in his inner circle said, Cam, this is where you stand right now. Really, because I don't take inner circle out of it though, Steve. I'm concerned about the outer circle, the media. The media is the one that feeds the delusion and they do it to all the black quarterbacks. You're untouchable. You're the greatest thing ever. They're afraid to write it because they don't want some random guy on Twitter saying you're racist or this is the one that you keep that same energy and you are. What about? What about? What about bread flour? It brings to mind that old line from Thomas soul. When you've had special treatment in your whole life, equal treatment seems oppressive and right now. Yeah, Thomas Thomas was good. Mr. Soul, God bless him. We were lucky to have him still, but that's to me, look, Cam was an exquisite athlete. I will always say it. His performance as a college player in 2010 from an individual standpoint as good as I've ever seen. 2015 was a magical year. He's had a good career, but the last five years, there's nothing in his resume that says, yeah, that's a steady veteran backup that I want mentoring a young QB. He doesn't fit that profile. Yeah, I'm going to mentor someone into the same kind of delusional state that I have that has cost me my NFL career. I love the Thomas soul quote you just yay because that does just explain a lot. When you exist in a bubble of being your butt kiss and then all of a sudden you get treated like everyone else, it does feel like oppression. That's a wonderful. That's a wonderful, wonderful quote. All right. Speaking kind of along the same topic, although a different twist on the Steve King, the former general manager of the Arizona Cardinals had some very honest things to say about Kyler Murray that and when these things came out, when they tried to put a clause in Kyler Murray's contract about study, film study and homework and things like that, oh, that's racist. And it was actually just the Arizona Cardinals trying to help this guy out because he's deficient in that area. I'm shocked that Steve kind, not Kim, would make these statements on the record, but he did. Let's take a listen or what? You know, I think he still needs to grow and it's not a, again, it's not slanting towards his character. He is not a bad guy. He's a really good kid, has a good smile and has a nice way about him. I think it's like anything. Guys have to continue to learn what it's going to take to be great. You know, does he know what Peyton Manning and Tom Brady knows what it takes? It takes to be great? No. Does he work? He does work. I think it's just that side of the game, the film study, the attention to detail part that he can continue to approve upon and I think he will. They try to put a clause in his contract to force him. Some people need that type motivation. They got called racist. I got, how shocked are you that he would say this on the record? Because he's likely going to get Ryan Clark and they may even let Kendrick Perkins talk about this and, you know, call him all kinds of racist names. Yeah, yeah. Never mind you want a man dominating different sports, but this here is fair game, right? Look, Steve Kim has got to give Steve kind some credit, but again, he's no longer employed. What does he have to lose? I really believe that not only was Kyle Amore a bit of a coach killer, he is a GM killer because there were a lot of casualties due to his play, but that's the thing. Look, we said this about a year ago that you have to put that clause into begin with and you are investing hundreds of millions of dollars into your franchise quarterback, Jason. If that's the issue, that should not be your franchise quarterback. Here's what I thought was interesting. The Hard Knocks series, which I am just a fanatic of. I've watched every version of it on every network in season, out season, all the seasons on HBO, the one season they were on NFL network with the Jaguars. So this past year, they did something on the Cardinals, right? And they did it from like week eight on. And that's when he got injured. And again, I know it's just reality TV. And so this is just a very limited viewpoint. I noticed immediately and I said this to coach Brown, I got the sense that the coaching staff starting with Kingsbury and some of the players, they liked having Colt McCoy back there, not from a talent perspective, because he's not better. But I'm talking in terms of the way he prepared, the way he dealt with teammates, the way he got everyone on the same page, how conscientious he was, because Colt looks like he's going to be a future coach. It just seemed to me that when Kyler was gone, they missed his talent in his production for wherever it was. They didn't miss anything else. I thought that was very evident in watching those episodes on HBO. So none of this surprises me. Steve, have a great weekend. Great job as always. We'll talk to you next week. All right, you can email me and us fearlessbladeshow at gmail.com. I want your emails. Give me your feedback on these people that are trying to disagree with me. Perhaps you want to be one. Download the approval rating app. Email me. Maybe you got some take you want to disagree with me on. We want to make the audience a part of the show. We appreciate you. Your fearless soldiers. I'll even put up with some of your silliness, like someone rating Tupac, a perfect hundred and same as characters flawless. And so based on John Hadley's advice, when we come back, I'm going to turn a bit more serious. I want to unpack my fire starter. And then we're going to talk to Robbie Starbuck. Welcome back. All right, it's time to start the fire. I think Hadley's good with me starting it here. So we'll get to it a little bit more serious ending to the show and some of the previous discussions we've been having. The political theater, transpiring inside the Tennessee House of Representatives, is the reality show version of the HBO documentary series Paradise Lost. In three separate documentaries starting in 1996, HBO desperately tried to exonerate three Satan worshipping West Memphis Arkansas teenagers of the murder of three eight year old boys. The Doc's turn convicted murderers, Damian Eccles, Jason Baldwin, and Jesse Miss Kelly into cult heroes nicknamed the Memphis three. Hollywood celebrities fell in love with Eccles, the occult ringleader of the group. Pearl Jam lead singer Eddie Vetter and actor Johnny Depp enthusiastically fought for the release of the Memphis three. The public pressure worked after 18 years behind bars. The Arkansas courts negotiated an Alfred plea in 2011 with Eccles Baldwin and Miss Kelly releasing them from prison with time served. Eccles had been on death row. Years ago, I was completely fascinated by the case. I watched all three HBO documentaries. Each doc recklessly pointed a finger at a new suspect. I read a handful of books about the case. At one point, I even tracked down and talked with a lawyer involved in the trial work. At times, I was convinced the police had rushed to judgment. Some of the DNA evidence kind of swayed me for a while. But eventually, I realized Eccles was a devil worshipper who led his two friends to participate in a ritual killing of three children. I thought of Paradise Lost yesterday when three Tennessee politicians stepped on the dead bodies of three nine year olds to elevate themselves as political cult heroes. Justin Jones, Justin Pearson and Gloria Johnson, three members of the Tennessee House, have made themselves the face and victims of the Nashville Covenant School Massacre. Late last week, Jones, Pearson and Johnson organized an anti-second amendment protest at the house that disrupted work on the floor. The megaphones, the Tennessee three, flanked or two of them, Jones and Pearson, flanked by Johnson, took over the house well while protesters shouted from the gallery and outside the house doors. Was a miniature, harmless version of January 6. In these hyper-partisan times, no one can be all that surprised that the provocative actions of three Democrats sparked a strong rebuke by Republicans. Yesterday, Republicans voted to expel Jones and Pearson and came up one vote short of expelling Johnson. It's all symbolic. Jones and Pearson are expected to be reinstated within a few days. But that hasn't stopped corporate media and political actors from framing Thursday's expulsion as the latest example of Mississippi burning. Jones and Pearson are black, Johnson is white. Listen to what Justin Jones had to say. The world is watching Tennessee. The world is watching Tennessee. Because what is happening here today is a force of democracy. What is happening here today is a situation in which the jury has already publicly announced the verdict. Just yesterday, the House Speaker took to national news to condemn us and call for expulsion before any evidence was presented, before any trial happened. And so what we see today is just a spectacle. What we see today is a lynch mob assembled to not lynch me but our democratic process. It will not stand because no lie, it will not stand. Jones later told MSNBC's Joy Reid that he was voted out for being an uppity Negro. When Pearson spoke from the House floor, he changed his voice tone and cadence to mimic Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Take a listen for yourself. Yes, I tell you, it was a sad day on Saturday. All hope seemed to be lost. Representatives with Rome out of the State House democracy seemed to be at its end. Seemed like the NRA and gun lobbyists might win. But all that was good news for us. I don't know how long this Saturday in the state of Tennessee might last. But oh, we have good news, folks. We've got good news that Sunday always comes. Resurrection is a promise. And it is a prophecy. It's a prophecy that came out of the cotton fields. It's a prophecy that came out of the lynching tree. It's a prophecy that still lives in each and every one of us in order to make the state of Tennessee the place that it ought to be. So I've still got home because I know we are still here and we will never quit. I don't want to. This is like a joke, man. From the Afro to the boys, we's guns over combs. I mean, it's just all cosplay intended to distract from focusing on what caused a transgender woman to snap and kill Christians. National police, they have not released. Audrey Hills manifesto yesterday in Colorado law enforcement arrested a transgender person who was allegedly potting a mass shooting at schools and churches. The suspect had written a manifesto expressing communist beliefs. There might be a pattern here, but we're not going to find out corporate and social media and educators seem to be promoting gender dysphoria among young people and radicalizing those young people to view Christians and Christianity as their mortal enemy. The message seems clear if Christians would just accept a wide spectrum of genders. That would be a better, more inclusive place. So-called transgender people are justified in turning violent towards Christians. But we're not going to have that discussion. Instead, they want us to talk about racism and the need to throw out the Second Amendment. The people pulling the strings realize they don't want to have the transgender discussion in public. That was his documentary What Is A Woman? Expose the dangers of defending transgenderism in public. Left us look insane. The way to stay on the offensive is to mass the real agenda with race. Bring in the useful idiots, the so-called Tennessee III. Justin Jones and Justin Pearson are the stars of this version of Paradise Lost. Mayor Damien Eccles, the devil worshipping media darling who overshadowed Steve Branch, Michael Moore and Christopher Byers, the three eight-year-olds killed in West Memphis, Arkansas 30 years ago. Does anybody know the names of the three nine-year-olds killed at Covenant School? Evelyn Dickhouse, William Kinney, Halle Scruggs? Is it a coincidence that leftists always seem to use dead children to advance their agenda? The Memphis III were used to shake confidence in our criminal justice system. Let me repeat what I said earlier. HBO paid three different paid for, three different documentaries trying to prove the West Memphis III were innocent. Each doc, irresponsibly, accused someone else of the crime. 30 years later, we now have a group of citizens who believe it's justifiable to turn violent anytime the courts render a criminal verdict the mainstream media say is wrong in races. School shootings are being used to undermine the Second Amendment. We can protect kids and schools without disarming the American public. If we spent the money we funneled to Ukraine on school safety, we could eliminate mass shootings at schools. Children are being sacrificed to empower the government and undermine the rights of citizens. We've lost the American paradise. That's my fire starter. I'm going to bring in Robbie Starbuck who was with us last week when the events, when the baby miniature insurrection went on at the Tennessee House. Robbie in real time, as those events were playing out, brought up the possibility that these guys would be expelled. They've been expelled as he predicted they might be. And Robbie, I just want to bring you in to get some perspective on what is the significance of them being expelled when we kind of know they're going to get their positions back in a few days or a week or two. Is it still significant that they were expelled? Well, it's very significant, Jason. And by the way, that was a brilliant monologue. I wanted to applaud. And I was laughing when you were laughing too. You were just fantastic there. But I can make another prediction real quick. You know, yes, we expect them to be renamed back to their seats. However, they would need to be reseeded in order to become reps again. I would predict they will not be seated and that they will be forced to go to the next election season and win an election if they want to be seated because they've been expelled. And I think in spirit, they are not going to be the numbers necessary to get them seated. And so that's my next prediction. I think we'll play out very well similarly to the first one. However, the significance... Hope and Robbie, hope for one second. Hope for one second. Just because I'm somewhat of a political novice, I am a political novice. Unpack for me how they can be reinstated but not reseeded. How does that... How can that happen? So let's use Justin Jones as an example, okay? Who by the way, somehow we trick the Democrats into making him the face of the Tennessee Democratic Party, a far left Marxist who's been arrested three times including for assault. Let's use him as an example, okay? So he is going to be renamed by Metro Council, okay? Metro Council has the ability to name who's going to take over for him. They plan to name him by all accounts. That's everything that we've heard as they're going to rename him. And so when they do, the House has to seat anybody who comes in through a special election or any sort of special purpose or through a normal election. You have to be seated, you get sworn in. So he has to re-undergo the same process he did when he was first elected. However, they have a choice to not seat somebody. It's something that actually has to be agreed upon. So I don't think we'll seat him and he'll have to go fight in a new election. All right. Now, go ahead with the additional points you wanted to make. Yeah, what I was going to say is the significance of this all happening is that, you know, for far too long, the Democrats have gotten comfortable with the idea that nobody's ever going to hold them accountable. And this is why this moment means a lot to conservatives that we're actually holding. Some of these far left extremists accountable because we're making them play by their own rules. And there's been some people who go, well, you know, there could be this negative outcome, and that negative outcome. The truth is that attitude is what got us here to this point where we have far left extremists who feel comfortable taking over a legislature with bull horns and whipping up their activists act like lunatics inside of the state house when we're trying to get worked on to protect kids. And instead, and you know, this is the thing I've seen no media cover. Did you know right before they pulled their stunt where they pulled their bull horns out and acted like lunatics? Well, three of them voted against a bill that would provide armed security to every school. Okay, including private schools, the other Democrats in their party voted for the bill alongside the rest of the Republicans. There were maybe two or three other Democrats alongside them who did not vote for it. So these three performatively pretended they cared to protect kids. Yet right before they're stunned, they voted against that bill. Okay, so these are people like you said doing this over the dead bodies of children to go and get themselves elevated onto a platform and to make it about themselves. So I think there's enough people in the state house who were disgusted by it to ensure that they don't get seated again. Did the Republicans make a tactical error not expelling Gloria Johnson, making sure they had to vote to get her out and giving the other side the option, the tactic, the strategy of saying, oh, this is racist. They kicked the two black guys out. They didn't kick the white woman out. Is that a, did they make a mistake or do you understand why some people were a tiny bit uncomfortable with expelling Gloria Johnson? Well, they did make a tactical mistake because they should have expelled all three, which is what I had been advocating for. Gloria was a part of it, just like them. I do understand some reps saw some nuance between her actions and theirs because she wasn't the one on the bullhorn. She wasn't, you know, smacking the podium and she wasn't whipping people up quite the same way, but she was up there. She was part of disrupting it. She had done it in concert with those two gentlemen who I struggle to call gentleman, but you know, out of some sort of weird sense of normal, see, I will, you know, I think she should have been expelled. However, there's that little bit of nuance there that resulted in her not being expelled. I think that we've got to be smart about this stuff though. It was just entirely predictable. She was going to make it about racism and she turned right around and said, the only reason I'm not is because I'm white. It just, you know, sometimes we step on our own tail and this is a case of that where some people got a little too smart. And I think that we've got to be actually smart and think about how the left is going to use these things. And she by all accounts broke the rules. That's what we're expelling them for. It's not did they break the rules by this much or this much. It's not by levels. She broke the rules. They should have expelled her. What do you think of the political future for Justin Pearson and Justin Jones? They certainly are national stars on CNN and MSNBC. What's their future here in the state of Tennessee in your view? Justin Pearson I actually think could stick around for a long time because he's in Memphis and Steve Cohen can only hold that congressional seat for so long. I could see Justin Pearson it's our one Democrat seat in the state. I could see Pearson taking that seat over at some point. And Pearson is by all accounts a little more reasonable than Justin Jones. In terms of what I've heard from legislators, he's been a little more reasonable in the past. However, I think that his antics this week have probably gotten rid of a lot of sort of good will that maybe he had built up over time. And I think in terms of radicalism, his ideas are just as radical as Justin Jones. He maybe just hasn't been as in their faces just in Jones has been because what people have to understand is Justin before he was elected was a full bore activist and organizer who was constantly following people at the Capitol. He followed me for an hour once just hounding me asking questions and acting like a lunatic. And when I say the line of questioning was just extremely bizarre, I mean extremely bizarre. And that's kind of what his MO has been for a long time. So Justin Jones I think is more likely to go to some sort of national org as a spokesman to rile people up or something like that and be a national organizer or something along those lines. But in terms of Tennessee politics, he doesn't have a clear seat to run for on a national level. And in terms of national politics for Tennessee, you're not going to see a far left socialist Democrat elected to a statewide seat or anything like that. It would have to be for some sort of really dark blue congressional seat. And the only one we have is down in Memphis and Justin is Jones is here in Nashville. So I don't think he has much of a future future in Tennessee politics outside of the State House. I think he could get reelected next time we go around here and maybe he sticks around at the State House. However, I think he has larger aspirations and may make significantly more money going to a national org as an organizer or spokesperson of some sort. So I could see him doing that. But that's that's kind of what I see for those two guys. What do you think of my contention that much of this is a distraction from talking about the real issues? What happened to those three kids? What happened to those three adults at Covenant school? What were the motivations of the shooter? Is there some sort of radicalizing of transgender people that we're doing here in America that is is just when I look. I don't know if you have you seen the video the rally gains the swimmer from the University of Kentucky just trying to speak at a school and she had to get barricaded in. And it's like we justified a level of violence from the transgender crowd and the LGBT crowd that we need to be having that discussion rather than the president Biden and others standing up talking about both keepers and proud boys and and and January six people. It seems like the LGBT Black Lives Matter this this activist class has been told you got the green light to be as disrespectful and as unlawful as you want to be. And so I see part of what the two Justins and the Tennessee three are doing they're distracting us away from a conversation we should be having about the people that are really domestic terrorists here in America. I like to use the term green light because colliculally I think you know that that's used by gangs and the Democratic party of today is operating like a gang and they have given the green light to these far left activists and the LGBT mafia that's out there and that's really all you can call them because you see what's going on. Riley Gaines was just essentially kidnapped in San Francisco at a university they were demanding money to allow her safe passage out. There's no other way to describe that but some form of kidnapping it is a crime what they did okay and she was hit by a man man dressed up as a woman doesn't make him less of a man in terms of the law okay he is biologically a male it makes him less of a man maybe you know in some spiritual sense but not in the physical sense that he could still pack up on she hit her twice okay. What we're seeing is criminals domestic terrorism you see what happened in Colorado and you definitely see how they're trying to change the subject here in Tennessee away from the trans mass killer but we see a pattern of behavior and it's escalating all over the country this is only going to get worse I don't know if you saw this but President Biden in the White House they actually put a statement out where they said that they opposed all of these bills that protect children by not giving them sex changes before they're 18 and said not only do they oppose these but that trans people will fight back against that they use that term fight back against this okay. A week after a trans mass murderer shot up a Christian school and killed three little kids and three adults and just within days of a trans potential mass killer being arrested who was plotting a mass shooting at Christian churches and schools okay. They haven't said a word about Christians since the shooting President Biden did not make one tweet about Christians nothing but he has tweeted a whole lot about trans people since that shooting and in every single one of those tweets it's been about how they're really the victims and these evil Republicans are the real villains here and I'm tired of it I'm sick of it and the truth is the silent majority is what got us here people need to wake up we cannot be a silent majority we have got to speak up in unison and we've got to stand up against this transgender ideology because it means business and it means they want to destroy the foundations of our country so people have got to speak up. I hate asking a question like this because I have no idea if you have any insight into this but I'm just checking my instincts and wondering if other people are seeing or suspecting or feeling the same thing as me but I have for solid three or four years and certainly since 2020 in the summer of St. George Floyd have felt like a lot of the Antifa and I'm sorry for asking a question I have no idea if you have given this a second thought. A lot of Antifa I believe is the transgender crowd that when I see those activists in Portland and Seattle and other places when I see Antifa a lot of play I think it's gender confused not all but there's a certain violent percentage of them I think are people with gender or sexuality issues that have made them angry and really easy to radicalize and that's why I just like we the way the government and our investigative agencies that are supposed to be keeping us secure the way they've just had a hands-off policy with Antifa is I think how we got here that they can be violent no consequences. Shaman can go into the capital wearing the wrong helmet and he gets thrown underneath the prison they can main people harm people shoot up take over areas of Seattle in Portland and it's all forgiven and it's all like just well we get why you're angry. I think there's a symmetry or synergy between the trans community and Antifa. Yeah you know I would say your theory lines up pretty closely to mine so this is going to sound like a weird question I'm throwing back at you but it's going to make sense in a minute. Have you ever seen in the Batman comics or the movies Arkham Asylum? No. Ok so Arkham Asylum is the asylum that the Joker uses is a recruiting place he releases all the crazy people from Arkham Asylum and those are his henchmen I've said for a long time they are recruiting the mentally ill that's what Antifa is doing all you need to do is go to Andy Noes account ok Andy no post the photos ok of these people I did. That's where I get it that's where my theory comes from exactly. And you can see very clearly the uniform thing you're going to find these are mentally ill people they are not well they are not well at all they're very gender confused you can see in many of them it's men trying to be women women trying to be men there's a lot of confusion going on there but you can see also in their eyes I always say the eyes are window into the soul and you can see it with some of the democrat politicians with their eyes pop out of their head you can see this certain sense of lunacy and you can see it in all these photos and so that's been my long running you know sort of idea around Antifa is this is a group of people recruiting mentally ill people and that's what we're going to continue to see as long as the democrats don't do anything about it unfortunately we've reached the point where it is escalated to murder and I think that that's going to continue until we see very real consequences for it and this is the truth about crime you know I watched this sheriff down in Florida today talk about consequences if you don't have real consequences people are not afraid of you okay and it's been that way forever that's all of human history it's not a recent thing and if we don't have real consequences for a community of people that is targeting Christians targeting conservatives they will escalate and so it's time for consequences I want to follow up on your point because you made me think about something that where this really came home to me and it's connected to the transgender and all the just and I don't care if I sound QAnon but this whole sexual perversion thing that seems to be going on and there's seems to be an alliance among all these people with all these different sexual issues or gender issues but the guy cow written house shot the pedophile and I can't remember if he killed him or whatever but two time convicted of pedophilia and I'm just like so he gets out of prison and the first thing he wants to do is go to a black lives matter rally in Kenosha Wisconsin this just doesn't make sense why are all these ex-cons with all this sexual baggage in history and I'm just like they have studied they have a profile of the perfect people to radicalize they're not qualified I can remember I was living out in LA Robbie and you're the perfect where you're from LA I'm walking in Century City I'm walking home from work I used to take these two hour walks home from work but I lived 15 minutes but I turned into two hour and I can remember walking past a light pole or whatever and it had a promotion or someone had plastered a poster on a banner that was like you want to be paid for your social activism you want they were 15 bucks an hour and we can turn you into an activist and I was like who would take this and apply for I go a crazy person or someone with no options someone with such a criminal history they can't get any other job and so they can just get paid to sit on social media and spam people they can get paid to go at rallies to go to rally protest rallies and stuff and do harm to people and be on the front lines and when I see these people that Andy know pictures when I look at the video I'm just like I got a job my friends got jobs we got time for this who has time for this the unemployed the people with serious criminal histories that can't get any other place get jobs any place else and pedophiles the drags of society and we won't have this discussion and it's so obvious and staring us in the face I'm so glad I asked you this question because now I don't feel crazy because other people are seeing the same thing I'm seeing you just nailed it and not only that I can tell you a personal anecdote that matches your experience very similarly so I was in St. Louis last year with Candace Owens and Zubi and went out we were doing a speech in St. Louis which was great we had over a thousand young latino and black kids who want to be conservative and it was a beautiful thing however we went out to lunch okay and just outside of this lunch place I see on a on a light pole they've got it pasted on there this thing for communist action paying people to be protesters okay and it had little things like like for if they're selling a dog or so you know there's little tear-offs like they're selling a dog walker or something like that what I saw yes and I was like this is incredible I posted it on Twitter I also took it all down off the light poles and threw them away but you know I was like if that's a crime then go ahead and lock me up because somebody was like you might not be allowed to do that I was like I don't care I don't think Missouri is going to come after me too hard for getting rid of the communist posters but you know as a child of somebody who's who's family had to come and flee communism I was personally incensed by this but you hit it perfectly they are paying people and who's going to take money for that type of behavior criminals and so that shouldn't be a surprise that the Democratic Party is closely lined with criminals and I just think back to what my b-sub-way low my great grandpa used to tell me used to tell me you are who you hang around okay Democratic Party hangs out criminals that is who they are. Robbie thank you so much I really appreciate the conversation I know you're you're well known but I feel like I've discovered a piece of gold here right here in Tennessee and so I appreciate you coming back on the show and we will circle back to you're a smart man and you you confirm my my lunatic conspiracy theories I'm not a lunatic in the conspiracy theories I'm just someone that's picking up on the obvious signs thank you so much all right that's Robbie Starbuck and that's today's show what you know what make sure I get my likes my 10,000 like but also once you guys in the comments to tell me what you think about you know Hadley's adjustments to the show we've got more serious towards the end we'll light her up top what would you think do you like me just coming out the gates full blast fire started going we might need to build my tour freedom came like a fire strike like a ladder making all this moves for freedom I won't feed them no negotiation my system or relation we all just want to have freedom sitting on the corner never been gonna break my back for freedom bless we are living get back we are receiving all the seed when we are on the beat for you we want freedom I just want I want to be I just want I want to be I just want I want to be I just want I I"
