The best part of the show, Jill takes listener phone calls every week to help unravel real-world financial issues. Again, this is sounding familiar. I have a feeling if you like the show, you might like that show. So search for Better Off wherever you listen to your podcast. That's Better Off with Jill Schlesinger. Hi, I'm Annamarie Cox. Welcome to With Friends Like These. This is a show about messy coalitions, awkward conversations, and the limits of difference and allyship. And this week, one of our guests is someone I wanted to have on for a long time because he embodies what some people probably would consider a contradiction in terms. He is a democratic socialist veteran. His name is Nate Bethay. He's the host of What A Hell Of A Way To Die, which focuses on military and veterans issues from a leftist perspective. And we're going to talk fetishization of the military. And I think his opinions will be of interest to people who are following both the Kelly controversy and sort of in general the way that we, on the left and we in the media, treat the military and veterans. But first up, a name you are probably familiar with, John Lovett. He is going to join me to talk through a question slash comment slash idea that a listener sent in having to do with the place of gay men in the Me Too conversation. So welcome to the show. Welcome back to the show. It's great to be back, Anna. Well, you are you were especially requested by our listener who sent in sort of a comment slash thought slash question. And we'll play it right now. Cool. Hi, I'm Darren. I'm 24 from Lincoln, Nebraska. And my question comes from Lovett's brief discussion on Lovett, leave it in his past episode, where he described observing straightness from the outside and kind of being able to move in between groups of straight males and females very fluidly. So I think my question is just about explaining these kind of straight dynamics because I've not really understood things like the open secret that this hashtag me to is kind of bringing up. And I would just like to be able to better have these conversations being in like the gay position that I am. Thank you. In the Me Too conversation, what do you think the role of like gay, you know, cis men might be in these spaces? I think on the one hand, because gay guys are not, don't have a sexual relationship with straight women that they can see when attraction and the peculiar dynamics of sexual relationships between men and women lead straight guys to have blind spots about how they talk about women, about how they objectify women. And I think you can push back on that. I don't think it's like the job of a gay guy and a group of straight guys to like to sort of like to kind of, I don't know. You're not the police. I mean, I don't think that you're saying that. Right. But like, you know, I remember there was like, I had it like years ago. I remember there was like a bunch of guys like they were, they were talking about one of them was talking about a girl that he had been dating and it didn't end well. And you know, he said like, oh, she's crazy. And I just, I mean, and I remember saying something like something along the lines of like, yeah, it's so weird. You pretended to have really strong feelings for her and then dated for a while and then acted like it was nothing and that you didn't care anymore and you just wanted to go away and she got mad, you know, like, that's it's so weird that she had that reaction to you being a dick. You know, that kind of thing, like the kind of like kind of blind spots that you see, you know, I had a conversation with another friend of mine who's a writer out here and we were talking about me too. And he was saying how he commiserated that he under that that commiserated is the wrong word, but basically he didn't even he didn't say it in a way that like he felt bad, but he was saying like he is he said, I've been Billy Bush. And I was like, what do you mean? He goes like, well, I've been in a meeting with somebody who I was going to possibly work for, you know, a powerful person who like that was going to either, you know, hire him for a writing gig or maybe pick up, you know, take a pitch out to pitch a pilot, right? It's somebody who has the ability to like really help his career. And you know, they're talking about the idea, they're talking about the concept and all of a sudden the the topic turns to actresses and women. And all of a sudden it's like, you know, like rating and stories and, you know, crass, vulgar shit in a meeting. And he was saying very honestly, he's like, what do you think I'm going to do in that meeting? You think I'm going to be like, excuse me, can we please be respectful? He's like, no, I play along because that's what you do. Like, that's how you be one of the guys in that moment and kind of, you know, build camaraderie because this is somebody who's going to, you know, maybe support your work and help you get a show on the air. And I thought that like sort of spoke to that dynamic that exists behind closed doors. And then on the other hand, I think there's a lot of harassment, misogyny and sort of bad power dynamics that have absolutely nothing to do with sex, you know, that that gay guys are just can be just as vulnerable to the, um, to sexism in the way they, in the way women are treated in the office. I mean, this is specifically to gay men, not not gay women, but like that not being someone who's going to sexually harass somebody, not someone who's going to, you know, use their power to try to get a woman to go home with them doesn't mean you're immune to sexism. Sexism only listening to a guy's idea, you know, not viewing the way that that sort of acceding to the systemic sexism and misogyny in workplaces that that that often holds women back. So I think being aware of the fact that you're vulnerable to that, even though you feel a little bit like you're outside of parts of this conversation, that makes sense? Yeah. Yeah. I know that totally makes sense. And I think it's an important thing to note in this conversation that, you know, just because you're gay doesn't mean that you're not, if you're a man, doesn't mean that you're not part of the system of patriarchy. Yeah. And I think that gay men in particular might benefit from reading like Helen Rosner's piece that we talked about last week, which is that what can you do besides literally not sexually harassing women to help women? Well, all of her suggestions had nothing to do with sex. Right. You know, there were things like what you sort of referenced a little bit ago, who were you listening to in meetings, right? Yeah. If you're in an all-male space, and this is something maybe gay men are particularly sensitive to, if you're in an all-male space, ask yourself why it's an all-male space for gay guys, there might be some very good reasons for that. But in a business setting, perhaps, you might want to ask yourself, you know, why is it just men sitting around this table, you know, and things like supporting freedom of choice, things like elevating women's ideas. Do you think that there's something to the fact that I host a podcast with John and Tommy once a week by my two hands and bros? Yeah, the bro-bamas. I appreciate that you guys reach out to have more voices around the table. Yeah. But on the other hand, like, you can't help who you are, right? Like, you guys are the people with the experience you have and the talents that you have, so you have the show that you have. You know, it's funny too. Like, my first, like, I had, like, some shorter professional experiences, you know, whether I was at temp, I was like a junior press aide, I was an intern on a campaign, but like, my first sort of really long-term job was as a speechwriter for Hillary, and that was an office led by women, right? It was led by Hillary Clinton, by Tamara Ozzato, who was the chief of staff, by, you know, a woman as the legislative director, a woman communications director, sort of, it was a women-led organization, which was like my first experience, my first real, the first real kind of, I don't know, job where I like, kind of was around for a long time. And I don't know, it really stuck with me that the qualities in other places where the majority of leadership positions are men. Like you kind of see that, oh, it's that the qualities being elevated are simply qualities decided by men to be the qualities of leadership, you know, that, anyway, I don't know. I don't know. No, that's actually, that's true. That's actually social science research to back this up, that in organizations that are primarily led by men, even if they're women in positions of power, the values that they hold and the kinds of people that they promote tend to be people that fit into that more masculine paradigm. And there is this, there is actually kind of a tipping point though, that if you get enough women in positions of power, the qualities that people are looking for and the genders that they elevate do change. You know, but it's, but it's, you know, it is a system that not, you know, it takes a tipping point of people to being aware of it and working against it for anything to change. Like, that's why tokenism doesn't work. And it is interesting because it's like, it's hard to articulate because you almost feel as though, is it wrong to say that like, wait a second, like there is, there is maleness being elevated here because it, and that, but that, that women in positions of authority bring a different kind of leadership, like it's almost like it feels like you're kind of, I don't know, like how are that saying like, wait, this is different, that there is a substantive difference between whatever, like kind of archetypal maleness in leadership and archetypal femaleness, whatever you would call that, that that is a difference. Like that, that, that almost like kind of saying so feels like you're a seeding to something. Does that make sense? Yeah. Well, it feels like well, you're admitting something which is uncomfortable. Right. But it's just, I love that you brought up the example of working in Hillary's office. And you know, we're seeing now some coverage of a, someone who is very influential in Hillary Clinton coverage, turning out to be kind of a jerk. And people are pointing out that Mark Helperin's coverage of Hillary looks different now, right? Yeah. And I think that's also a question we need to ask of men in general. Like I often wonder if you, because right now, I mean, most of the networks are doing a pretty good job, I think of having women present in conversations, but not all the time. You can still turn on the TV and see nothing but male faces in your Brady bunch box, right? Yeah. I do wonder what would be different if we had a truly equal representation in the media, how Hillary coverage would have been different. I don't know if it would have been that different, but it probably would have had some differences. And also what would the coverage of Trump have been like, if they're mostly or equal number of women covering him? Right. And it does seem as though the answer like where you land is like, is obvious, which is you want, you want both of those perspectives, recognize and you want the people around the table making decisions and the people on air to be representative, not just as a token of diversity, but because it actually does in live in the conversation and bring both kinds of leadership that you need, you know? Yeah. And also, I mean, yeah, like I was talking, this is a conversation I had with Van last week too, the thing about diversity is it's not just about making sure it looks good. It's about bringing perspectives to the table that might make your product better. Yeah. Right. Like you might just have better coverage. Like if more black people have been involved in mainstream coverage of Trump, I think it would have been they would have seen things. In fact, I mean, you've probably had these same conversations. My friends who are people of color saw Trump's rise much quicker than I did, saw his appeal much quicker than I did. Yeah. So if you bring in people of different sexual orientations and also people of different abilities, and I would say that people with disabilities are way, way, way, way underrepresented in most of our national conversations, probably, I mean, I don't want to say more than any other group, but you, when's the last time you saw someone with a disability on a cable news show? Who wasn't talking about disabilities specifically? Well, look, I mean, it's actually, you know, it's going on right now, right? Betsy DeVos is steadily undermining protections for people with disabilities at the Department of Education. And it's covered, if at all, kind of as an aside, right? But of course, like who's making these decisions about what to cover, who's going to be on the air describing the story. It's almost certainly it's very few people living with a disability. Right. So, I mean, again, so I just want to come back to like reminding people like this isn't just about show, this is about making a better product and being able to make better decisions. It's not just people talk about, I guess I get sensitive to accusations of virtue signaling or whatever, but like there's real like concrete reasons why it's important to listen to more than one kind of person. And also look where we look where we got with our culture listening to basically use white men, you know, I mean, right? And it, well, it's funny too. It's like almost like there's so many organizations that because they wanted to look good and they wanted to virtue signal and they were afraid of bad press diversified, you know, not, you know, but recognizing the value of diversity, but at the same time doing it out of pressure, right? Like make, you know, worrying over it because the immediate concern was about not looking to white or not looking to male. But the end result has been a much better product because, you know, and like, you know, I think of like also like new media organizations like, like, you know, people make fun of BuzzFeed all the time. But like on the news side, BuzzFeed has since since sort of Ben Smith started kind of building this news organization elevated so many women and people of color who have made their coverage so much more expansive and inclusive and smart and and discovered like discover people who a generation of go go would have never had that kind of position and would never have been recognized in that way. Yeah. So I think we're I we've landed in a good place out of a kind of a strange beginning. Yeah. But I want to thank you for coming up. I always love you having you on. It's good to talk. Thank you for having me. This was good. So I was telling you about frame bridge. I used frame bridge services to finally frame. I've been married for two years now. And one of the wedding presents I got, which you have encouraged me to think of just as a genuine thought from Obama himself was a lovely note of congratulations from President Obama and Michelle. That's cool. And yeah, it is really cool. Even my husband who was still kind of a Republican at the time, like thought it was cool. And I think he's going to be the one to hang this beautiful framed note in his office, which I sent to frame bridge. So I think a lot of people understand that frame bridge works really well with like Instagram photos and photos you've already uploaded. But I used the service to send in, you know, my existing real world stuff. And it was great. You know, they sent me a prepaid package and I sent it to them. And then I got some emails from a designer who gave me options about what kinds of frames and mats I might want to use. That's cool. And then when we finished up, he sent me a note that said, by the way, I think this is just a really cool thing, you know, that you have this. I mean, it's it must be very special to you. And I said, yes, that is nice. On I have a question. What do you think that like it's not even a question? You couldn't hang the same thing if it was from the current president. You just couldn't even hang it in your house. Oh, God. No, isn't that crazy? It's so sad. Like you just can't it's like everything that everything that's going to come out of here out of this thing is going to be like all the things that were kind of something that was cool because it was like, like, when I was a kid, you were a letter to the president because like they were teaching about civics. And like, I don't want I wouldn't want my kids to write a letter to this president. I wouldn't want them to. I wouldn't want them to. No, I'm sorry. We're going to teach you about you're going to have to civics by imagination. Um, I'm really curious. I want I don't do what kind of a truth squatting on every single letter that they read from the podium that supposedly from a child. I really want to know how all of those get there. But anyway, frame bridge, my note from Obama, which is lovely and frame bridge to care of it and they will frame your stuff. Again, they will do your electronic photos. I think things that you can send them from your Instagram feed or you can do it in the real world process. And it is a lot cheaper, just tons cheaper, hundreds of dollars to frame it at a store, prices at frame bridge start at $39 and all shipping is free. And then you know what? I have a promo code, John. Oh, good. Yes, it is. It is friends and you will get 15% off your first order at framebridge.com with promo code friends. Framebridge.com promo code friends. Go there. Use it. And up next, Nate Bethay. He is a writer and the co-host of What a Hell of a Way to Die, a podcast focusing on military and veterans issues from a leftist perspective. And he has a resume that we actually have to talk about and I'll let him do that. How are you, Nate? Doing well. How are you? I'm good. I'm really happy to have you on the show. I've want to have you on for a while because I'm a fan of your podcast. So here's a funny thing that I'm going to do. And maybe we'll talk about why I have to do it and why it's funny and why it's a reason I'm having you on. Which is that I come up from a military family myself. OK. My father is a veteran. All my uncles are veterans, both my grandparents, grandfathers or veterans. This is basically the same. Yeah. So first, I'm first generation non-military. Yep. And I lay that all out there because we live at a moment where you're not allowed to criticize the military. Unless you can have some bona fide connection to it. I feel it. Yeah. And that definitely sounds right. So I'm playing into that by laying out my bona fides. Well, I mean, honestly, there's an extent to which I sort of have to do the same thing. You know, I've been in the military and I spent seven years in the army, but I have to sort of make that note in some capacity. Left I be mistaken as someone who apparently has no right to criticize, even though that's kind of an absurd proposition. Yeah. Do you want to start with that? I mean, should we start with just talking about General Kelly and the fairly terrifying implications of what he said and what the White House is said about him? Yeah, that'd be good. Yeah. I will say that people may snicker or scratch their heads at the idea that you are a host of a leftist military podcast and that you are associated with Democrat, socialist of America. I will say that my dad's a big lefty, you know, so the idea that you can be in the military and be a progressive does not freak me out. Personal. No, we had a conversation about this actually on our last episode because there had been something circulating about, you know, a social forces veteran saying that you're going to speak for all. Veterans and say, stop trotting out supply sergeant and support personnel. The true fighters, the true gunslingers are all Republicans and we all hate you basically. And I that's just so absurd because quite honestly, there are plenty of people even in where I've in units I've served in who are there getting closer and closer to the, you know, actually being in combat arms. You know, I was an infantry officer and I served with people that were in units like Ranger, Regimen, or in special forces. And quite honestly, there's plenty of people that are progressive or left cleaning or even full on lefty. It's just that I think they understand their operational environment well enough that it's difficult to be overt with a political orientation like that in the military, whereas there's not so much of a prohibition. It's being overtly right wing. Right. Exactly. And also, I think most folks in the military somewhat understandably seem to be from my experience relatively. I'm not going to say use the word apolitical, but neutral. I actually use the word apolitical recently to describe it that quite honestly, yes, you're correct. They, there are a number of people who are outspoken that I think in terms of, in my experience, at least most people don't really have an opinion either way, aren't particularly engaged in the political process. And that's probably representative of a large swath of Americans. It's just that, unfortunately, the people who are outspoken in the military oftentimes very much on the right or they are trotted out to be used by right leaning people, you know, in the, in the, in the, in the way that they are, in the way that they have. In politics in America, as we're seeing more and more in these past couple of weeks. Like when I've talked to my dad about it, he said that when you're actually, you know, serving, he's definitely gotten more political after he got out of the military. It's, it's, it makes more sense for, for you as an individual to kind of disengage from it because you're just, I mean, as we say, following orders. Like it's, it's good not to have an opinion of the orders. Yeah. Sometimes you're, you're, you're putting yourself in harm's way. If you want to go out with an opinion about the orders, because, I mean, ultimately so much of it can't be changed. You're not really in a position. You can try to fight it if you really disagree with it, but oftentimes that's a losing battle. And so you have to kind of, um, confine yourself to that, which you can affect and that, which is right in front of you. And as a result, I mean, I found that it's strange to me more that because of social media and because of me being out now, I'm coming to realize how much I don't have in common with many of the people that I served with as far as like their opinions go, but as far as like us being in a unit together that never came up because we were more concerned with what mission we were going on. And like, is our truck broken? Are, do we have the assets we need, that kind of a thing? It just wasn't, it wasn't in your immediate sort of set of needs or concerns. And also what you can affect is the most important thing, right? So like your individual sense of following, you know, military uniform, code, military justice, following orders, when that is appropriate to follow orders. Like that's much more important than your opinion of the mission as a whole. Yeah, absolutely. And, and, and I mean, one of the things that's always been interesting to me is that most people, at least most junior enlisted, most junior NCOs that I would work with, um, to some extent, junior officers, though, they were maybe a little bit more circumspect about it would very, very much say like, I care about our unit. I care about what's happening. I care about us being successful in the sense of us getting home, us accomplishing what we've set out to accomplish, but in the grand scheme of things, the actual larger conflict, the larger war, the larger operation is probably, if it's not going to be a problem. It's, or it's bad. It's a bad idea. It's doomed to failure, et cetera. That's not to say people were defeatist. They just weren't really invested in the grand scheme. They just were invested in what was in front of them, which again, like, I think it makes sense for psychologically and maybe even as a program to feel that way. But also something that my dad really instilled with me is the idea that once you're not serving the people in the military count on you, the general public to be the ones that hold government. Accountable for how the military is used. Yeah, I would. I've never heard said that way, but yeah, that's very true in the sense that I can, I can go out there and effectively jump multiple echelons of the chain of command and basically bother somebody with some issue politically. Like I can speak to elected representatives. I can can say a policy is foolish if I think so. And a guy serving it, my prior self as a junior officer, as I got out of the captain through a little more than three years ago, could not even do that to his battalion commander, much less the president or the politicians involved. So you do suddenly have this freedom to engage something, whereas people in the military are literally taking their careers and their livelihoods in their own hands if they speak out along those ones because they're expressly forbidden from doing so. Right. So maybe now let's finally segue to general Kelly. Speaking of holding people accountable. The White House seems to want to have it both ways with Kelly, right? In that sort of he's supposed to be held to somehow above politics because he's had this stellar service. But at the same time, they want to borrow that valor to give credibility to Trump. Yeah. And also, I think that that specifically with regard to Trump's recent problems with with this issue with the soldiers killed in Niger and the subsequent fallout of it. They're leaning pretty hard on Kelly to both brandish his military credentials and also to to effectively shut down. Criticism. I think that what you saw in Kelly's press briefing in which he basically wouldn't call on people unless they knew they personally knew the family of someone who had died. You know, in combat, it was basically trying to shame journalists and shame civilians and say, how dare you question any of this? You don't know what it's like. And obviously, Kelly to the fact that his son died in Afghanistan. He has that personal connection to it that makes people very hesitant to say anything, even though you sort of. You got to get caught in the moment and then you walk out the room after you're like, that's kind of nuts. That's not how a civilian control of the military democracy is supposed to work. Right. And I would say they've attempted to like weaponize his grief, which is. Yeah, absolutely. I would say so too. And I just grotesque, honestly. I mean, it's even if he's agreed to it, just as a human being, I find it ugly. No, I do too. And I also think that. So I've seen a lot of situations in which, for example, the parents or relatives of people that I know that died in combat have been very outspoken, or at least outspoken to some extent about the missions or the larger campaigns in which their loved ones died. And I think that even when those people are kind of treading into territory where they're making accusations, people tend to treat them very lightly in the sense that they don't want to. They don't want to shout them down. They don't want to shut them down. They don't want to make them basically confront them in a way that's going to hurt them more. And we just just say that I've seen people basically kind of tread lightly and even ignore some pretty out their accusations because they know these people in real life and they don't want to hurt them. And so what's surprising to me is that all of a sudden when it's when the family that is aggrieved is African American, all of a sudden they're willing to just treat these people like dirt, treat these people like. They have no right to even feel grief in the first place. They have no right to even feel anything besides respect to the president dained to call them. And that I think is really, really disturbing because I literally used to do a podcast with a guy who was a military judge advocate general, actually in the Marine Corps. And he had a woman that was, he was friends with who, I mean, I feel bad, but her son was implicated in that scandal where the Marines had urinated on corpses of insurgents in Afghanistan. And her son had been kicked out of the Marine Corps, I believe, or at least in some way had his career curtailed and had later died of drug overdose. And she basically said, Hillary Clinton demanded they prosecute these Marines. So Hillary Clinton killed my son. And this jag would be like, look, she'll say this stuff on my Facebook page, but like I really tried to treat her with kid gloves because it's just, it's so intense, you know, like I don't want to harm her further. So to see that kind of thing, that level of respect and then to see that exact same reaction turn around and people be like, no, these people are ungrateful. It's really disturbing to me. Magazines weave together great writing and beautiful photography to tell stories better. That's just a sort of a general promotion of the media form of magazine. I love it. The medium of the magazine. They need it, you know? Magazines need help. Magazines need a champion. They do. I don't know about you, but I do. I don't know about you, but I do love magazines. Who doesn't love a magazine? Right. And it always, even though I really came up in digital media, it always means more to me when I, when my work appears in a magazine. Huh. But texture kind of, you know, bridges that gap. Like, because texture is the experience of reading a magazine, but, you know, on your tablet, which is so much easier. And you can also just like read one off issues without paying the absurd cover price for a lot of these magazines. But it's a good way to pay for it. Good journalism is expensive and you should pay for it. A good way to pay for it. Is with texture. Would be texture. Yeah. Because you get hundreds of magazines and I have the list and it's everything from in style and maximum to the Atlantic and national geographic Bloomberg business week shape, which is, I don't know about you guys, but I find some of the personal fitness magazines. You don't, you don't need to buy every copy. Right? Like it's, the advice tends to stay sort of the same. So it's kind of cool to be have a conditional. I don't even think that, uh, there's a, that we all are kind of pretending that the reason we're not in the shape we want to be, and we haven't lost the way we want to lose, because we lack information. I feel like, I feel like that's a giant way of saying, oh, I just need to read more and then I'll have discipline. Yeah. Come on. You've been this texture. You know, you can just dip in and out of your fitness. Before you do dips. That's right. Right. Uh, so it's 200 premium magazines for $9.99 a month and you will not believe this, John, but I have a promo code. Oh, good. Yes. Uh, you will get a free trial of texture if you use promo code friends texture.com slash friends. Do it. Uh, and also they were reminding us holidays are coming up and there are great gift options for texture. We're saying Merry Christmas. It's no longer illegal. Merry Christmas. Here's some really cool magazines. Few things spring to mind. One is I'm old enough to remember how actually gently George Bush treated Cindy Sheehan. Um, who podcast listeners may not remember who that is. Google it. She was a gold star mom who protested the Iraq war. Like she was in front of his, um, you know, Texas ranch. She camped out there for days and days and days. But he refused to say anything bad about her. I mean, his, his acolytes definitely were wrong. His acolytes were all over it. But I mean, but he did the thing that we were supposed to be kind of a baseline presidential behavior. Yeah. The thing that apparently proved so difficult. Right. And then in the race, uh, part of this is incredibly important. I encourage people to go listen to Jamil Bowie's last episode of, um, the Trump cast where he talked to a fellow African American, um, journalist who's also a military. Uh, historian, I believe, and they talked about an veteran. And they talked about how the language that, that Trump and his acolytes are using is attempting to put patriotism and being black or being a person of color in opposition. And that you only can be one or the other. And, and I agree with that assessment. And I would also say that the thing that really stuns me about seeing that trot it out is that that's not really representative of the military that we know. No, no. One of the many things I hope, I'd hope to get to with you is this military times poll about white supremacy that I don't know how this isn't like on cable news 24 seven, because it's mind blowing and shocking and sad. But, um, 42% of non white troops said they've personally experienced an example of white nationalism while serving while the military that that does not surprise me. And I think that, um, I think that it really depends on that in some units. I think people are more brazen about it. I think that, um, you know, I, I served in an infantry unit and airborne entry unit in Alaska and, um, the infantry and general combat arms tends to be. Primarily, I mean, heavily white, to some extent, Hispanic, but primarily white, but also depends on where you go and places in like Fort Bragg, North Carolina. You find that there are actually more people of color in the units, but, um, by and large, those combat arms units tend to be pretty white. And I mean, I had soldiers, I had one soldier who's an NCO. He had been in the 82nd before and we were in the gym one time and he had these strange tattoos that looked like black bars on his arms. And he was like, yeah, I had to get my, uh, I had to get my Nazi tattoos covered up before they let me enlist. Oh my God. And I mean, I never heard anything from him that led me to believe that he still harbored that. I don't know. I guess in a sense, you know, I was 24. I didn't really feel like asking, but in retrospect, I was like, that's, that's kind of crazy, but also, I mean, in those days, um, there were a lot of standards that were relaxed as far as allowing people to enlist. And, um, you'd encounter people like that where I would, I would like to hope that in years past, they wouldn't have been allowed to, but then again, or they wouldn't have been allowed to enlist. But then again, a guy that I follow in friends with in real life, his name is Dan Kim. He's a writer and he's worked in the restaurant industry, but he's also a Korean American army vet. He's a vet of the war in Somalia. Um, he basically, she said this is nothing new and he served in the early nineties and he's like, you wouldn't even believe the kind of stuff that non white soldiers put up with that. We just knew, we knew there were places you couldn't go. We knew there were units. There were people that like, you wouldn't get a fair shake. And there were places even on post where chances were good if you went in and you weren't white, you'd get beaten up. Yeah. And this military times survey, obviously bears that out. There's the 42% of non white troops. You say they've personally experienced examples of white nationalism. And then there's the nearly one in four who say they've seen it. Um, and that this survey, at least those responding rated white nationalism. Is a bigger threat to national security than Syria, Iraq, or Afghanistan. So there's this interesting tension, right? Um, because I feel like the military does also have some of our best. Uh, and, and some of the most justice minded people, um, among us, right? Like, I think the military does a pretty good job and I look to my dad as an example of this. Of sort of in an apolitical framework, although I guess everything's political, like wanting to judge people by a certain extent. Or wanting to judge people by, you know, content of their character, right? Yeah. And I think also that, um, it's a lot harder. I mean, it's not by by noon. It's impossible, but it's a lot harder for people in the military to look at a directive towards, um, being apolitical or being, uh, refusing to make decisions based on race or creed and just like wink, wink, nudge, nudging and ignoring it the way that it happens in the civilian world. Exactly. The military is harder for people to get away with that. And so as a result, like you actually see integration in ways that you don't in the civilian world. Right. I mean, I said this on Twitter, I had more black and Hispanic bosses in my first unit in the army in my first three years out of the seven. I was in uniform than I ever had prior to or since my military career. And I'm from the Midwest and I live in New York, but I mean, I feel like that's probably typical of a lot of white people that serve in the army. Like that's the most integrated job they'll ever be in. That's definitely true. And the military does a really good job at integrating all kinds of people, right? They integrated racially and did it by Fiat because they had the kick, they can. It's the military. You know, don't ask, don't tell went over real smooth. And this and transgender actually was looking like it was going to be just fine. You know, before we got politicized. But yeah, I mean, I think the funny thing was the revocation of don't tell them, you know, the allowing. LG B as they use that acronym, LG B emitting the T specifically because the policy hadn't changed yet. But I remember when that happened in 2011 and people, people on the right were predicting this apocalypse, of course. And it was literally a non event because everybody knew who was gay in their unit. Everybody they just, they'll see weren't allowed to live an open life. They would they had to be paranoid, basically. They had to be left left their command suddenly be in a position to be like, well, they're forcing our hands. We know now. So we have to kick you out. I mean, I saw that happen. I saw people get kicked out of my first unit and it was really shocking to me. And so when that happened, it was kind of a sigh of relief. Yeah. It was really a, it was a non event, whereas on the, on the outside world, all of a sudden it was made into this massively political social engineering thing when gay people have been military since military has existed. And also the military is social engineering. I hate to break that people, but like it's not a natural habitat, right? Like it is an engineered environment. That's what makes it the military. The notion that that 45 year old men who have been in the military since they were 18 and when they enlisted had to call me sir when I was 23 because I was second lieutenant, even if they were like Sergeant's major. That's insane. That's so beyond that there's no logic to that. But that's, that's how the military rank structure works. Yeah. So in the same vein, it's like none of none of it, none of it just occurs in nature. Like it's completely engineered. You're right. And I want to hit one more thing from the military times poll, which is something that an Air Force general actually called out is being one of the most shocking things to him, which is that Trump's approval rating is 48 among enlisted personnel and 30 among officers. To put that in perspective, Obama's approval rate among officers was 48%. Yep. He was not popular with enlisted. It's true. No. But it was not as, the split was not as crazy. And the Air Force colonel, I want to read his what he said, I never thought that you would have this kind of disparity in numbers like that. When you have a hierarchy like we have, part of it is there needs to be respect for the chain of command. Yeah. Well, I also think that I wonder how much of that is based on, I mean, there have been things that if you are an army officer, if you are a military officer, some of the things that have happened in terms of, you know, the military officer. And that happened in terms of decorum and norms have been pretty shocking. And I mean, people that I would have considered relatively apolitical or even, even right leaning, people that are still in have spoken to me offline and been like, this is kind of crazy what's going on right now. So I think that once again, there may be a split there because some people only in passing follow any of the news. I don't know, but I do know that you like that that stark split you just described. I mean, you may get to this too is also you see that across different branches of service. The Marines apparently love Trump, whereas the Air Force and the Navy, I think was overwhelmingly negative. Yeah, the Marines love him. I actually should correct myself. It's 43% approval rating among officers for Obama, which is still pretty high. And actually, it listed approval rating of Obama was 34%, which is, yes, lower than Trump, but that's only a nine point spread. Yeah. And now it's double that. Yeah. And I think that, I mean, I'll give you an example, a couple of examples of things that really shocked friends of mine that are still in uniform. I remember getting some texts and phone calls after the speech at the CIA headquarters in front of the monument to their volunteer agents. That rubbed people a lot of people the wrong way. Things like that, where folks who might have been willing to give him the benefit of the doubt suddenly turned around and thought like, okay, maybe this is actually real. Maybe this is really going to be this beyond the pale. So who knows? I mean, I'd like to hope that more people pay attention to the actual policy and not the sort of like the optics involved, the sort of like the myth-making that goes on, how his political campaign has sold him to people in the military, as the person who's going to fix your problems. I don't know, though, because I mean, I wouldn't, I remember some of the commentary you'd hear about President Obama when I was in, and there were times when you had to pull people aside and be like, dude, that's the commander in chief. Like, you really can't be talking that way. Yeah, and I guess here's an interesting kind of problematize this a little bit because, you know, I have an instinct to take the words of, or take the opinions of people serving the military. My instinct as an American is to take them more seriously, but we're just talking about how we shouldn't necessarily, they should necessarily be political. I would like to say two things about that. One is that I feel like the approval rating among military folks of our commander in chief. What I hope that that reflects is trust. Yeah, likewise. Yeah. I mean, all things considered, I'd like to hope that they have faith in their chain of command. Yeah, and that's what is so scary. That's what that Air Force colonel was saying, right? That's frightening, is that if only 30% of officers approve of his behavior, that could be bad. Yeah, I mean, because ultimately you're getting to the situation in which the military is subordinate to the civilian government. And what people think that, I mean, in the same vein that there were people, let's say amongst the centrist who, in a way, felt a bit of relief when General Kelly became the Trump's chief of staff, or even when Jim Mattis accepted the role of the Secretary of Defense because they thought, okay, well, at least these people, they're used to being a political being professionals. Maybe they'll bring order to this. And it's like, well, maybe so, but at the same time, maybe you also are going to see the military just starting to disregard civilian guidance, which is a very bad road to go down. Right. I mean, that is what is the most frightening about where we are in this current moment. And I want to talk about this idea that we hold up veterans and members of the military as the assumption that they're more honorable, the assumption that they will follow the rules. Now, to a certain extent, obviously, there's something to that. But I also feel like, like one thing that Kelly did that I actually, I actually, at first, appreciated it when he asked people to hold up their hands to whether or not they knew a gold star family, because I thought the point he was making is one that I like to make myself, and I think is worth making all the time, which is that not many Americans know someone in the military period. Yeah, that is very true, yes. And I think that's a shame. For many reasons. First of all, because it's good to have a wide variety of people in your world and also to know what serving is really like. And then because the closer it also gives you perspective on the not greatness of the military. Yeah. And I think it makes you dispose of the notion that things would be better if they were run like the military or that everyone in the military is some exemplar of whatever virtue you want to ascribe to them. I mean, anybody who's been in the military for say more than a couple of months has probably met someone who's been kicked out for wrongdoing or for generally immoral conduct or unacceptable conduct. I mean, I know I've seen people go to jail for things they did in the military. It's a job like anything else. You wouldn't, I mean, I hate to say this and maybe I'm in a position to say it because I served, but we used to joke that amongst friends that being in the army was like, it was like the post office with guns. And ultimately what I'm saying in that is that people who do public service are doing something oftentimes for less reimbursed or less compensation than they would if they were in the private sector. There's dignity, there's respectability in that. But like you wouldn't look at somebody who just because they had a public sector job and say that person is indicative of literally every virtue. They're the best people ever regardless of what they actually do as people. And so it seems kind of absurd to do the same thing with people in the military. I mean, people in the military are, they come from America where they're from. They're raised in the same country. They're oftentimes they're immigrants too, but like they're from their people. They're not, they aren't carved from stone and brought forth to exemplify all of the things that we want to aspire to. That's just kind of insane. Everlane, would you buy a t-shirt for $50 even if you knew it only costs $7 to make? Oh, I wouldn't. No. With Everlane, you never need to overpay for quality clothes. Their thing is transparency for premium products. Cool. Not everything is made in the same place and they let you know where it's made. They have pictures of the factories that they use so you know what the conditions are. And they price things, they're transparent about how they price things. And they make what they call premium essentials. They're kind of the building blocks of a great wardrobe. They recently started selling jeans. I have several things from them. Cool. Including like this really nice cashmere sweater. And then also, their shoes are great. I get compliments on the shoes from Everlane every time I wear them. And because Everlane sells directly to you, that's right, they have no real life stores. Their prices are 30 to 50% lower than traditional retailers. Ana, would you say that they're cutting out the middleman? They are. They are cutting out the middleman. And they look better and they cost less and they last longer. And that is quite true. And again, I think what I like best about them is it's sort of what I at least used to think of as being somewhat preppy, but really it's just the basic building blocks of a, you know, kind of cool wardrobe. It's the staples that you go to again and again, jeans, crew neck sweaters. These shoes that I really love, they're called the day heel, which is kind of just a low wedge heel with a, they're just super comfortable leather shoes. I also have a promo code for this one. Cool. It's friends. The promo code is friends. Yeah, Everlane's timeless essentials are just what you're looking for, no frills, just quality. That's Everlane.com slash friends. Everlane.com slash friends. Everlane.com slash friends. I think it speaks to Americans own, oh God, how do I say this? Reluctance to put themselves in harm's way that we so fetishize people who do, right? And I think that there's this interesting tension that I don't necessarily think we need to solve as a culture, but that we need to know exists, which is to pay special respect to people who volunteer to get shot at because our president says you've got to do that. That is different than the post office. Yeah. And that is something beyond, right? That is no other real, except we have police officers, other law enforcement officers. But so to volunteer to do that, even if you're a supply sergeant, you are in a position where you might get shot at, right? So you want to pay a special amount of respect and deference to that. But at the same time, know that within, underneath this umbrella of service and in general respect for the military, there are individual people who deserve to be held up to scrutiny for their actions. Absolutely. And I think that the notion that somebody doesn't have to prove themselves as an expert, as someone who's competent, because they served the military, I feel like that's a very generous way of looking at it, but that's not how it works when you're in the military. Once you're in that uniform, I had this thought years ago, probably right before I got out, that people in the Army, at least, because we love uniform flair. We wear badges and tabs for everything. When I walk into a room as an Army captain, the first thing people see is the rank, and then they see whatever badges and tabs I have. But to a civilian, they just see the uniform. And that's the thing, it's like this binary that if you're not in the military, everyone in the military is whatever their branch, whatever their rank, whatever their role, their job, et cetera, that they're just in that category. And it's this sort of unknowably difficult thing. And maybe I'm oversimplifying. Whereas once you're in, there's good soldiers and bad soldiers. There's people who do really dangerous jobs and less dangerous jobs, and there's gradations to it. And just being at X rank or just being in the uniform doesn't really mean anything until you do your job. I just had a conversation with John Lovett where we got around to, was talking about how having a diverse set of voices at the table isn't just about looking good. It's not just virtue signaling. It's not just being usually can turn out a better product of whatever it is you're doing if you have lots of different experiences to draw from, right? Like in journalism especially, having people of color at the table means you don't miss certain stories. Having disabled people at the table means you don't miss certain stories. And a lot of journalists can be kind of blind to the fact that their one experience leads them to make mistakes. And I feel like military is almost in that category of diverse set of voices you want to be listening to or at least know about. I mean, there's been a number of cases even recently where, I mean, even when it comes down to something like, it's unfortunate that people's military experience winds up being drawn upon when there's like a mass shooting and they want to talk about like the basically military grade weapons that people are able to own. But you'll see a lot of mistakes where you think to yourself like, if they had veterans on staff, they had people who knew this stuff, they wouldn't be, you know, making having to make these corrections. And it's exactly what you're describing that like, it's not just, it's an inclusivity thing, but it's also in terms of just general professionalism. It's kind of covering you from making mistakes of oversimplification or of omission. Right. And making factual mistakes here. Like we're getting away from this idea that they should be automatically valorized. But yes, you should definitely draw upon the expertise, right? And the experience of these people because you will get better information. That's something actually the military knows pretty well. The military is pretty good at getting information. Yeah. And I mean, I guess in a sense, being, if you're a veteran and you're, you're left leaning or further to left, you're going to find that there are many people who are quick to kind of jump down your throat about how you must be stolen valor. You must have been a terrible soldier because basically you don't fit the sort of the mold of, you know, hard-edged person who's unafraid to say basically say racist and judgmental things about literally everyone. Like this notion that we all have to be basically hateful caricatures. It's kind of unfortunate because, I mean, it just, that notion that everyone is this very kind of stereotypically right-wing, conservative, religious, judgmental, close-minded, et cetera, that caricature of the military, like that exists. It's a stereotype that exists for a reason, but it's not everybody and it really has no correspondence with what I experienced in the sense that like, there was such a wide variety of people. I mean, it is actually one of the most diverse workplaces. It's the highest employer, the largest employer of trans people, sorry, was the largest employer of trans people in the world, or another world country, which makes sense if you think about it because it's a place. Yeah. And ultimately, it's a, it's, in a lot of cases, I mean, I think about soldiers of mine who, went on to careers in the military, or like I have one soldier who he works as an electrical engineer now. He went to school on the GI Bill. He actually was wounded in combat and proceeded to purple heart, but I mean, he's from a small town in Florida and graduated from high school, and his options were basically work in service jobs, like working in Village Pantry or, you know, at Target. And I mean, I know I'm not making this up. I mean, this is, we talked about his life story before, but he got out. He went to the military. He spent four years in, got out, went to school, and now he's an engineer. And it was, it was a gateway for him into a different, basically into a different level of opportunity that probably based on where he was from, would have been much more difficult, which is not to say impossible at all, but it would have been much more difficult. And so in a way, like the military draws in people from a variety of backgrounds for a variety of reasons. The one thing I guess I might want to revisit just because I thought it was a great point that you made when you were talking about this crazy, viral, you know, mini essay, or I guess it was almost like a FAQ that this guy wrote about, hey, liberals, listen to me about the military. That he said something about how like, you know, the Special Forces people are the shit, right? Like they're the ones who really, they're the ones who are real Republicans and don't listen to the, you've referenced this before. Like this, the people who are non combat, like maybe they're not at conservative, but the people who matter are. And of course, yeah. That the people who matter are the people that supply the people in the front. We actually, Frances and I on the show made that exact comment, like, don't get me wrong. I mean, it's really good to have direct action guys. And I mean, oftentimes they are the main effort, but they're not getting where they're going without the things they need. And ultimately, like he said, like if I get, if I need, if I need a door kicked in, yes, I call up those guys, but like if my pay is messed up, I don't call Green Barre's to fix my messed up pay. I call the finance office, you know, it takes all kinds of people. Right. And also, I think that this is maybe a string, maybe this is a place kind of into conversation, which is that I have talked to other liberal types who have a problem with the whole stand in the airport and applaud the service member or give up the service. Sounds like maybe you don't like that either. I have a, I have an opinion that maybe contrary to yours. So I had it happen to me a number of times. Primarily when I was coming back from deployment, I put Afghanistan in 2009 and in October of 2009, actually I came to New York to visit a friend on two weeks of leave from Afghanistan. And basically when you're traveling, you are in uniform until you get to your, you're supposed to until you get your final destination. And I mean, I appreciated it, but it was, there was one time when it did feel genuine. There are other times when it just felt like people kind of doing it because they, they felt as though either they were obviously true or like a true. And I mean, I appreciated it, but like I'd much more rather if somebody did that, if they would talk to me and then like have a conversation as opposed to just like coming up, shake my hand and walking away. Right. I'll tell you this much. It's, it's a thing that people are aware of and it's difficult because it's not, I don't know, it's not like a overtly bad thing, but it's a thing that like sometimes it makes people uncomfortable and when you get to it, it makes people uncomfortable. And I've had bosses, guys who spent, you know, most of their adult lives in the military who make it a point to basically always bring to the enclose anytime they go on some sort of temporary duty assignment or anywhere they might be in public because they are made uncomfortable by that. And it's not to say that people shouldn't, if they feel like it, but I just think that no one should feel obligated to do it. That's the thing. No one should feel as though like the grudgingly like, oh, it's time to stand for, for whatever like I'm ultimately people in the military are still, they're still human. They're not really the regular Americans like anybody else. So my opinion on this is, I guess it actually lines up pretty well with what you had to say there, which is, I think it is much more meaningful to actually talk to the person. And I do think it's legitimate to say thank you for your service, no matter where they are because of this idea that it's the supply people, you know, it's the people who make the wheels turn who are just as important. I think it's cool to ask someone what they do. And to thank them for that specifically, you know, and also because we're an all volunteer army, like you being in the uniform means that I don't have to be. I mean, you might not say that exactly. Well, I mean, also I would say too that, I mean, so I had a surgeon major who addressed our whole unit one time and it was really taken aback by the speech because he basically said, I get it. People have grown to comfortable with this notion that everywhere you go, you deserve handshakes and first class upgrades. He's like, but you are volunteers in the sense that you volunteered to enlist, but volunteers don't have to get paid and you do. So you should be the ones being more courteous. You should be the ones who actually are making a better name for yourselves and not expecting people to do your favors. And it was not a really well received thing. I mean, people weren't going to disrespect the guy. He was the command surgeon major of the Italian. But I was actually more in line with that statement. I think in the notion that people should, by default, have to like, you know, make some gesture of feel to me because ultimately I don't want people to see a uniform and suddenly be like, I'm made uncomfortable because this is a statement of this person's superiority or valor or something along those lines. That's why I think it's cool to actually, if you're going to do that, if you're interested in that, and I would encourage people to do that to actually have a conversation. If they're into it, like some people, you know, whatever, I don't always like to talk to people on next to. But to make it a more meaningful gesture, don't just give up your seat, don't just applaud, actually show interest in this person as human being. Yeah, and I think also that just to remember that people in the military also are maybe harried and tired and getting to where they're going and stressed out and that kind of a thing. And that sometimes for better or worse, just a nod and knowing the person acknowledges you, but they aren't going to like take up your time if you're busy. I really appreciated that sometimes, and I know it sounds strange because it's not like I don't want people to talk to me, but more like when you know that people are going to be like, hey, what's up? And then let you go about your business, that actually can be really nice too. Yeah, I totally see that as someone who doesn't like to talk to people. I picked a weird profession, by the way, for that bias. No, likewise. Anyway, thank you so much, Nate. People should listen to your podcast, which is called Hell of a Way to Die. And perhaps we will have you back. It seems like for better or for worse and probably for worse. Our national conversation about the role of military in this particular administration, it's going to be an ongoing conversation. It's the apparently going to continue, but thank you so much, Anna, for having me. I really appreciate it. And that is it for the show this week.
