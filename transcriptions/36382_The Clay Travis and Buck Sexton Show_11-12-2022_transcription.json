Brought to you by Coors Light, Mountain Cold Refreshment Made to Chill. I'm getting vaccinated with Prevnar 20, a Pfizer vaccine. So am I, because I'm at risk for pneumococcal pneumonia. If you're 19 or older with chronic conditions like asthma, diabetes, COPD or heart disease or are 65 or older, you are at increased risk for pneumococcal pneumonia. Ask your doctor or pharmacist about Prevnar 20, pneumococcal 20-valent conjugate vaccine. It can help protect you against pneumococcal pneumonia in just one dose. Even if you've already been vaccinated with other pneumonia vaccines, Prevnar 20 may help provide added protection. Prevnar 20 is approved for adults to help prevent infections from 20 strains of the bacteria that cause pneumococcal pneumonia. Continued approval may depend on a supportive study. Don't get Prevnar 20 if you've had a severe allergic reaction to the vaccine or its ingredients. With weakened immune systems may have a lower response to the vaccine. Side effects include pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue, headache, muscle and joint pain. For full prescribing information, please call 1-855-213-2138 or visit Prevnar20.com. I was telling Buck that I'm getting ready to go to Dave and Buster's because my kids want to go play all the games for those of you who are familiar with Dave and Buster's. And did you see Buck we bought? We went to the card shop. My kids were obsessed with the card collecting, baseball, football, all those things. And I ended up spending the most money because I bought myself a big box of 1987 baseball cards that we have started to open still with the old gum. If you remember the old tops baseball cards. Man, you might break your teeth on that at this point. Yeah, 35 year old baseball cards that were starting to open. And it's a lot of fun. But my kids couldn't resist the 7 and 11 year old. Both tried the gum. And they said it tasted like cardboard, but for anybody out there who remembers, it tasted like cardboard 35 years ago when it was new too. So, but they couldn't resist. They had to try the gum. Now we're going to have some late 80s, early 90s throwback moment. Do you remember that, that pink gum they used to sell that was like a roll of tape? Oh, yeah. I had to talk about that for a bubble tape or something. Bubble tape. Man, I remember running to the corner store after school and all the kids, everybody was getting bubble tape, air heads. I think they probably have their heads candy. But the best part about, I think it was tops and score with it. I actually had some baseball. I wanted to do whatever my older brother did at that age. And so he had some baseball cards. I want to see baseball cards. Well, you're in Donras were the three biggest score board score cards exist too. But tops, you're in Donras were the three biggest. I mean, I thought, you know, at age eight or nine that if I just held on to that Don mattingly card, I'd be able to slap my butler around in a number of years with it, you know, but didn't really work out that way. One of those cards though have ended up, we went to the baseball card shop and I love just seeing some of them. Some of them have ended up really, really valuable. But the 87 88 89 90 when card collecting was basically at its apex. They produced way too much for most of those cards to be very valuable. Right. They over they inflated. Yes, there you go. They kind of printed too many cards. Yes. So print too many baseball cards and everybody else has the Don mattingly rookie card that I have. It turns out that card isn't worth as much. Maybe we should send this segment to the Biden administration and try to help them understand. Joe, you might not understand this, but Hunter, the smartest man that you ever knew probably collected baseball cards and his cards are not worth very much money because there were too many of them printed much like what you are doing with our nation's economy right now. What a lesson that is. My kids may actually understand inflation based on this. Look, look how it goes. What is it is like, is there one card? I would assume as a as an outside sports outside of the sports bubble guy that the Babe Ruth card is the most valuable card of all. But is that not the most valuable card historically now it's starting to change because they're doing the new thing, Buck is scarcity in cards. So they will get autographed. They now have like pieces of uniform that they put in there. They have gotten really smart in limiting the production to drive up the value. But historically the Honus Wagner baseball card really, yeah, Honus Wagner card. There were only like 180 of them made or something and he was anti. I can't remember all the details. I used to do it. So he was anti smoking and there was a smoking company that put them out. He demanded that they destroy all of his cards. And so I believe it's the T 306 Honus Wagner card has historically been the most valuable base. You sound like you could open a baseball card memorabilia shop, man. You've got some game. I went to the baseball memorabilia card shop today yesterday with my boys and I actually remember as a kid that one of my dream jobs was to own a baseball card collecting shop. That's how much I was all in and like the ages eight to 12 I was obsessed. I remember for a short while I got really into making historical war dioramas and like the fourth and fifth grade and I used to go and do this for going to civil war history. I can't play your way. You're making your own dioramas, you know, baby steps here, right? I can't give it all away at the beginning. Oh, yeah. So like you still have them. No, no, God. No, this logs in. What was the diorama you made that you were supposed to be in? I may have been an award diorama club in school for a little while. We don't have to talk about it. I can't believe there was a club. There were more kids who did this. I took chess lessons for a little while. Well, that doesn't surprise. Well, that doesn't surprise. But chess is awesome, by the way. Chess is great. Chess. Also, if you've got like a good spirit to drink, it's fantastic. So what was your favorite diorama that you produce? Oh, I was all about World War II. I was I was just I was blowing up Nazis with little bits of paint and taking little pieces of plastic and stuff left and right. I was all about World War II blowing up the Nazis, you know, because why not? Sunday sizzle with Clay Envok. Hey, you got any gum? Yeah, check my backpack. What's this? Oh, that's an eloxone. It can reverse an opioid overdose. I decided to always keep it on me after my friend almost died. It saved his life. Oh, wow. I'm so sorry. That makes me want to have it with me too.

Six months later, Russia invaded Ukraine and now we're witnessing a new war in the Middle East that's escalating quickly. And Air Force Secretary is also signaling that China is preparing for war with the US. The world isn't chaos to put it mildly, but former Wall Street insider and writer Tika Tawari believes the biggest risk to Americans is not a nuclear war. It's the final collapse of the US dollar. That's Mr. Tawari who's just released a controversial video to help you prepare.

A bit of general advice, and it is whenever you see that there is a show with a 90-plus percent audience score and sub 50 on the critics, it's a show you want to see because it means that everyone loves it, but the critics hated for some reason that has nothing to do with whether or not it's entertaining. And an example of this would be, Clay, have you seen the terminal list yet? I've heard it's great. No, I have not. Have you watched it? I have watched every episode of the terminal list. Jack Carr is a friend. I've known Jack for a few years now. So explain this show because I bet there's a lot of our audience that would like it. Explain this show for people like me who know it exists but have no concept of what it's about. So it's a, the main character is played by Chris Pratt. He's a Navy SEAL named James Reese who comes home after some special operations abroad. They're ambushed. I don't want to give much away, but there's a sinister plot that goes to the heart of the military industrial complex. And basically Chris Pratt is running around, taken out bad guys, lots of, the tactical sequences are very well done. They bring in seals and people with similar expertise so that the actual gun battles and everything look really cool. I mean, they do a good job with that as entertainment. But they, they hate it because there's, there's no wokeness. Okay. There's no, there's no social. It's like it's in that way it's like Top Gun Maverick, which has been in theaters for some odd 70s, some odd days and is now the most successful Paramount movie of all time. It passed Titanic. Yeah. That's how successful it is. But I mean, even that movie clay, just to be fair, who's the bad guy? It's like a make believe country in Eastern Europe or something. I mean, you know, they work, look, they're going for the global market. I get it. And apparently we don't make movies anymore. We're fighting other countries. It wasn't whoa, but even in the original Top Gun, we didn't know who the bad guy was. It was, I mean, everyone assumed it was the Soviet Union, right with the red star on the helmets. But yeah, I'm just saying it wasn't woke, but it wasn't like, it wasn't Team America world police either. You know what I mean? It wasn't, it wasn't going too hard with the stars and stripes and the flag. But okay. But so, so Ron Tomatoes, 94% audience score for this. It's a good show. Because one thing that Carrie and I have been struggling with is we're trying to find a show to watch so we can both enjoy together. And it's you watch stuff and you go, am I, is everything just green lit by the editorial team and MSNBC now? I mean, it's all so, it's such trash. It's so, and 10 years ago, I feel like Netflix and HBO, there was this golden age where they were just making amazing program. They're just making great series, you know, whether Breaking Bad and Game of Thrones and, and Narcos and, you know, they're making all these great shows. Now, of course, the corporations that are behind all this, we want to be progressive and social justice and their show suck, which is not surprising. But I will say in fairness, we did find one show that I, one movie, I should say that I would recommend to everybody. I made Carrie watch this movie, the outfit a couple weeks ago. That wasn't really worth. It was okay. It was like a B minus wasn't woke, but just wasn't really that good. It was okay. But we watched this 13 lives. Have you seen this? Are you familiar with this one? It's about the Thai youth boys. Oh, yeah. Yeah. I was fascinated by that story for everybody out there. This was the, the soccer team that got caught in the cave and a flooded and they weren't able to get out. How is the Ron Howard made this one, right? The movie is excellent. Yeah. They were highly watchable, really moves along and the way they film this, they originally, as I read a little bit about it, I was curious, they were actually trying to film a lot of it in the caves, but they weren't able to do that for reasons I don't even know now. So they moved that I think to Queensland in North Australia because obviously the actual cave is in Thailand, but it's amazing. I will say this. There are few things in the world that I would find more terrifying than having to spend six hours underwater, five and a half, six hours underwater in a cave with fast moving currents where at some points the cave is about shoulder width. So you've got, I couldn't even do it. Darkness, claustrophobia, the imminent prospect of death when you, if you run out of oxygen or if you just, you know, hit your head and I mean, there's any number. It is really well done. I've told, I've been trying to tell folks about it. I remember that story. The story is even more in any ways unbelievable and in the, in the end inspiring that I remembered it from the news reports. It's crazy what they did to get them. I mean, not crazy. I mean, they should have done any, but I mean, what they managed to pull off with those kids to get them. I don't want to give it all away. Is it? Well, I think everybody knows the kids. Yeah, it's a true story. That's right. That's a true story. Yeah, that story was captivating to follow and such an ennobling story because every day you thought, Oh, they're going to find the kids and they're not going to be alive. That was sort of the subtext of this is a flooded cave. There's no way these kids are going to have survived for this long. And when they finally found them, then it's, Oh my goodness, how in the world are we ever going to get them out of here? And they managed to do it. Speaking of the terminal list, I was, there's an article up at Outkick, one of our good writers that we hired recently, David Hookstead. If you haven't already, we had an incredible month, but Outkick is kind of like mono from heaven. If you're a sports fan or just a fan of pop culture and you think everything has gone woke, they've got, we got a good article about it that went up today about the terminal list. 1.6 billion minutes of viewership on Netflix. The only show was the most recent show, Stranger Things season four is the only show that's beaten it in terms of popularity. So I'll just point this out. Culture is important in terms of what it's saying about what society is interested in right now. Yellowstone is by far the most popular show on television other than sports. It doesn't get nominated for any Emmys wildly popular terminal list, evidently on Netflix insanely popular Top Gun Maverick. What do all three of those movies and or shows have in common? Relatively limited woke material and or USA USA USA, right? That is what they are overall selling is United States excellence. I mean, and I think there's a huge demand for that. You can tell very quickly in a lot of these shows. I mean, to this point, Clay, I could even take a, I think there's a step. Even before that, what you're talking about is the manifestation of or the way that the show actually tells the story, right? Is that it folks into those things? I think it really also comes down to when they're sitting in the writers room is the most important thing that they want to entertain and engage the audience or is it that they want to get a pat on the back for the agenda and the messaging behind this? Because I think you see a lot of shows where they start with a premise, which is, oh, let's make this about, you know, let's make this about some left wing woke agenda item instead of, is this going to be a good story? Is this going to bring people in? And you know, you brought up what was the huge show that everyone's, oh my gosh, why is this such a success? Similar numbers, I think, to Yellowstone from years ago was The Walking Dead, right? It was and the Walking Dead is a show where you take a graphic novel and you're just trying to make the most engaging entertainment possible. There's some broader lessons about parenting and survival and other things in there, right? But overall, you're not getting a political lecture with the walking dead. You're just watching something that's meant to entertain you. Whenever they do that, their success. When they're giving you a lecture about woke politics, people increasingly are saying, I just don't want to watch this. Yep. And I'll give you, I know we got people who listen in Hollywood, we got a big audience in LA. I'll continue to give this out. If you want to look like a genius and you want to have the number one streaming show or the number one television show, the number one show in America, turn on Daunted Courage by Stephen Ambrose, a thought phenomenal book about the Lewis and Clark expedition, turn it into a mini series into a, I believe it would be a television event, the likes of which we have not seen in 20 years, right? In terms of a historical connection to America, pro-American, now you can say Game of Thrones was a television event. I love that show. Yeah, it's a fantastical show about, you know, about dragons and medieval times effectively. I'm talking about something that is rooted in American history, that is unabashedly patriotic, that tells a triumphal story of an overwhelming difficulty and success. I'm sorry, Clay, to get this made though. Maryweather Lewis is going to have to be a gender fluid pansexual and William, William Clark is going to have to go around begging forgiveness from the native peoples for the future disrespect and, and, and betrayal of the, of the colonists. I mean, otherwise we can't make that show. Politics is downstream of culture, which is a great quote from Andrew Breitbart. And I do think it's true. If you're out there and you're looking at what the political message is coming through the cultural success stories out there, whether it's terminal list, whether it's Yellowstone, whether it is, certainly as you break it down, how much demand there has been for Top Gun Maverick, the most successful movie of all time from Tom Cruise's history. It's because people want pro America anti woke programming and there isn't enough of it. Did you see, I know you're on vacation and you're having a great time with the fam, which was very important. You've come back rested in the fight, but did you happen to catch? Cause I, I see you sneaking on to Twitter a little bit when you're on vacation. I was always like, I still have to manage out kick. Yeah. I didn't do TV. I didn't do radio, but I'm still managing our stories at out. So you probably saw that they had a $90 million right off where they completed film. Back girl. Back girl. I mean, how now the thing is I want to see that movie. I do badly because they wrote down when they took over, they $300 million CNN plus, they said this is an unmitigated disaster. It's done. And now $90 million bat girl. And you know how popular superhero movies are. You could basically get $100 million, I would think just by advertising a lot to get people to come watch. A writer or a producer making a superhero movie and you lose basically $100 million on it. You really should learn to code. Like you should find another profession. You should be done equivalent to, it's a great point. You're making a superhero movie. The studios are all behind it. You almost cannot fail because there's such demand for superhero movies and they watched your superhero movie and they said it was so bad. We're just going to take a $90 million right off. They didn't even put it on the streaming service. It's one thing if they say, Hey, this is not worthy of going to the movie theaters. They said it's so bad that they don't even want their brand associated with it in other fields. I'm not even sure I can think of an equivalent. I could just, I could just see this though. Like like a bat girl movie where bat girl swoops in on the bank robbers and they're like, Hey, look at this. Look at this broad wearing a, wearing a costume. She's like, Excuse me, sir. Broad. Are you assuming my pronouns? Like you could actually do a great send up of this thing. I mean, you could do a great, uh, there's a little bit of send up of the, of the overall woke culture that goes on in Deadpool, which has been very popular as, as a movie. But buck, think about all the people that are cast in this movie. They're saying, Hey, this is going to be career altering for you. You can't go wrong. You get into a superhero movie. You're the next Robert Downey Jr. I can completely do the pitch that they would have been getting in their Hollywood talent agencies. And then they get a call and they say, yeah, this movie is so bad that even though we spent $90 million, we're basically just going to burn it. I guarantee it. We could write a better screenplay than whenever that was, which in the two of us in 48 hours, honestly, that's, that's why I want to see that. I feel confident. I would like to see it too. Day drop with clay and buck. Let's play a little word game here, Mr. Clay, shall we? I think you had mentioned recently what the, the word of the year was according to what was a Miriam Webster. I think that's right. Yeah. So this is now a good way for these various, they used to be dictionary books. Now they're websites basically the Oxford English dictionary and online has picked its word of the year for 2022. And I will tell you, I did not know what this was. So I am learning something new. I think a lot of our audience will be learning something new as well. The terms that it now it's also sometimes a term more than a word. The terms or words that it beat out were number two and number three. This is all based on public polling, by the way, hashtag I stand with, which, which is I don't even know that's like, I don't get why that's even in the running here. But there must have been something that I missed and I don't know. But then everybody understands that though. That's not very complicated. That's not complicated. And also that that's not particularly in the zeitgeist. Another fun word, another fun word. Metaverse was number two in this one, which we've all, we kind of, you know, you think of like Zuckerberg being a nerd with a headset on virtual reality or something. Do you buy into this metaverse stuff? I don't know. No, no, no. I don't think anyone does. Look at Facebook. Yeah, Facebook stock is tanked, but I just don't buy in that this metaverse is that big of a thing. Sometimes I see things like HD television, for instance. First time I saw HD television, I was like, everybody's got to have this put on 3D television. I was like, I never want to have. So Carrie got for our home here. She got a new TV that is it can turn into artwork on the wall. This is amazing. Like it turns into a painting and it actually kind of looks like you get a frame for it now, but then it's a super high quality televisions. I remember in college having to get three of my friends to help me log. Yeah. One of those TVs, remember TVs used to be like three feet deep. Yeah. I mean, never mind how big the screen was. And you'd go to some like, you know, Bob's TV store or whatever. And you'd need like a couple of your frat bro buddies from the football team that come over and help you that thing weighed like 200 pounds and you carried up the stairs in your dorm room. And it was super most expensive thing I ever bought in college was my TV. I think I think, you know, it was probably, I mean, can't remember now, maybe you spent 500 bucks on it. Yeah, I think that's about right. Yeah. Something like that. So that was my biggest purchase. And the thing was huge. I mean, you could use it as a weapon in a pinch if you could just sort of roll it down the stairs at somebody. Now you get these flat screen TVs are 70 inches and it's like, oh yeah, doorstop. I mean, I, you know, doorbuster on Black Friday. It's like a hundred bucks. A TV that looks like it's from Star Trek. Anyway, it's been amazing. The change in television quality over the years and it just shows you when the market is allowed to do what it does. It can do. Capital ones and works. Yeah. The word of the year though, is goblin mode. Had you ever heard of goblin mode before? This is the word of the year according to the Oxford English Dictionary. The only thing I can think of is that it is a, you know, video game phrase, right? Is that right? It's a term that refers to a type of behavior, which is unapologetically self-indulgent, lazy, slovenly, or greedy. It goes back to beast mode, which is from the 1988 Sega video game, altered beast, which I got to say, I love that game, that game back in the arcade. Remember when arcades were a thing? You'd go to the arcade and pump coins and all-tradbeast. Instead, there is, yeah, there's some connection to video gaming. I'm not even really sure what it is, but goblin mode is basically, you know, you didn't really have this because you lived in the free state of Tennessee during the pandemic. I mean, there were times, Clay, when I would sort of like wake up in a haze on the couch during lockdown and I was like, oh, like maybe I'm going to take some Cheetos and mix them in with the pad tie that's on my chest, you know, like you just, that's goblin mode. I think. Yeah, we didn't have goblin mode. The word that I have heard, and I don't know if it's a word, have you heard the phrase NPC? It's a video game related for a NPC. No, what is that? Non-playable character. It's like somebody in the background who was moving around like part of the video game. My boys used the phrase. Is that like Joe Biden? Like he's there, but not doing anything. Joe Biden would be an NPC president. Non-playable character, I think, is what it stands for. They use the phrase NPC all the time to describe like things that are going on. Video game world that I would have. I've never heard of that before. Non-playable character. It's a big deal now for the kids, evidently. Sunday hang with Clay and Buck. A fraction of a raindrop. Three grains of salt. Add up to 100 times more potent than morphine.

When President Biden botched the Afghan withdrawal in 2021, it sent a message to the world that America was weak. Six months later, Russia invaded Ukraine. And now we're witnessing a new war in the Middle East that's escalating quickly. And Air Force Secretary is also signaling that China is preparing for war with the US. The world isn't chaos to put it mildly. But former Wall Street insider and writer Tika Tawari believes the biggest risk to Americans is not a nuclear war. It's the final collapse of the US dollar.

There are some areas clay where I can assert a degree of uncredential but absolute expertise. I have the equivalent in my mind at least of a PhD in action movies. I grew up. I had VHS tapes that I watched until they were falling apart of all the Schwarzenegger movies, all the Stallone movies. I was more of a Schwarzenegger guy, I'm going to be honest. But young guns with them, I find Emilio Estvesz's finest. Young guns is one of the greatest movies of the 80s. His finest, a very underrated Western for what it is. Young guns also really good. Both of those are created. Young guns was an excellent franchise. I think there was there a third one I don't remember now, but also all the various martial arts action movies. Van Damme, I celebrated Van Damme's whole catalog. And he's a very interesting character as we see later on in life. I bring all of this up because Jennifer Lawrence, Jennifer Lawrence has come out to say that she was the first. And you know, like, isn't she from, is she from Nashville? What's with all these? Louisville, I believe. Oh, Louisville. Okay. I thought she's a Kentucky. Yeah. So he's a Kentucky close close by. So you have to take you and your folks here. In that region have to take responsibility for all responsibility for SEC state shenanigans. I think that's fair. Yeah. Yeah. She, you know, because she's lovely, but her politics, not so good. She spoke at an interview in variety and she said that she would nobody ever put this is the quote. Nobody ever put a woman in the lead of an action movie because it wouldn't work because we were told girls and boys can both identify with the male lead, but boys cannot identify with a female lead. I'm sorry, but Ripley from Alien and Aliens would like to have a word among other female acts. I'm sorry, Linda Hamilton and Trevor, one and two, you know, if you're going to mouth off and try to get social justice points or whatever, wokeness points, don't don't make it so easy for us. You know what I mean? Come on. It's also disappointing. I would say only in the context of if you are a movie buff to say nothing of a movie star, you would think you would have seen aliens in Terminator because they're two of the most iconic films of that of the seven. I think aliens is one of the one of the 10 best action movies of that of that period. Honestly, I think aliens come out like 81. Oh, you know, alien came out. I think it. I think aliens was later like 85 or 86, but the team can check for us. But yeah, Sigourney Weaver was phenomenal. Both 19. I was thinking even made it maybe late seventies, but both of those are 1980s or late seventies iconic films, right? And to not be familiar with those is embarrassing for Jennifer Lawrence who seems totally normal and also simultaneously. Oh, alien didn't come out until 1986. Okay. So that was like later than I thought. I mean, I'm not a I'm not a Quentin Tarantino fan, for example, like I don't like most of his own. Yes. Uma Thurman in kill bill. Kill bill. I think is actually his most watchable movie for what it is. And and kill bill Uma Thurman is excellent. That Lara Croft, Lara as in Mrs. Travis. Yeah. Lara Croft, the Tomb Raider movies. I mean, there's so many. It's just, but this thing even she's made clay. She's made tens of millions of dollars. And you know, she's one of the genetics lottery. She's quite lovely. And you know, physically. And she's got a wine and complain and make it seem like women have it so hard in films. Really? That's where we're going now? Give me a break. Let me clarify this because we're going to get blown up. Alien came out in 1979. Okay. Aliens came out in 1986, which I believe was the sequel, right? So, so Ripley 1989, the original alien. And I think also aliens, one of the best sequels of all time up there with Terminator 2, the Godfather 2, aliens is an enhancement to the franchise. And fortunately it went substantially downhill from there. I'm still trying to think about all the different women action leads. There've actually been so many of them. It's a willful ignorance. And also I would say this. I don't know who did the interview and who did the story, but this is also an example of just totally, if you're writing about movies, when she said that as the interviewer, there should have been some pushback. And there should have been like, well, you know, Sigourney Weaver, pretty big deal. And you're kind of stepping on Linda Hamilton and what she did in Terminator. Those are big female led action movies. I mean, for some, some folks may even remember from the Conan, the Barbarian era, Red Sonya, which I think was a B movie, but she's swinging a sword around and stuff. Hey, I was a big he-man guy. They did bring out Shira to try to appeal to all and they made a movie about it too, I think. Wasn't there, was it the Bionic man or the Bionic woman or was there both? I think they did both. I think they did both too. So this, this is, you know, it's ridiculous. But every clay, it's not enough to be rich and famous. You have to also be beloved for your political stances these days, which is just a shame. Do your kids, by the way, do they, do boys, do they like the Hunger Games? Is that a thing still that people read? We haven't watched any of the Hunger Games. I think those are to be fair, like kind of R-rated, aren't they? I mean, they're pretty fun. I think so. I'm having the Hunger Games right now. I'm going to be hungry. I'm going to get a sandwich. It's not a bad move. It's a pretty good movie, by the way, The Hunger Games. It's disappointing because I like Jennifer Lawrence in that film. Sunday with Clay and Buck. December 7, 1941. A date which will live in infamy. The United States of America was suddenly and deliberately attacked by naval and air forces of the Empire of Japan. So that was FDR as today is Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day. 81 years ago, the attack on Pearl Harbor happened, was conducted against this nation. It brought about an unprecedented scale of military mobilization here at home. My own grandfather on my maternal side served on the USS Batan, which was an aircraft carrier in the early days of aircraft carriers. And he didn't talk about life in the Pacific theater very often at all. Occasionally he would relay stories. He went on. He was involved in construction and real estate later on in life. And actually did a lot of charity work. There's a foundation name for him, the Lawrence F. Hickey Foundation, that helps underprivileged children. So he did a lot of that. He didn't speak very often about his time in the Pacific theater. But toward the very end, and I remember I came back from Afghanistan in my capacity as a CIA forward deployed CIA analyst. And I had gotten up with a lot of things you'd bring back carpets. That was very obviously very common. I brought back some other souvenirs, you know, these curved tribal knives, things like that. But I brought him a blanket. So I just remember sitting and listening to him. And this was his last his last years before he passed. And he would have this blanket across his knees, which I had gotten for him in Afghanistan. And occasionally out of nowhere, he would just start to say, you know, the the kamikaze is just kept coming. And I didn't sleep for a week. And I think he was at, I think his aircraft carrier have to go back and check was at Lady Gulf. I think it was at battle of, I think I have I can't remember off the top of my head, but he was in some there were some major engagements that Kerry was involved in. And his carrier was, I know, hit by kamikaze is a few times, a couple of times, I think, at least. And he would talk about it. It's just it's something where today you think about how would we react as a country to something like that? If that were to occur right now, I mean, you could say, well, nine 11, that's the closest thing we've had to it. But nine 11 was I mean, the nine 11, we had a lot of people that joined up to serve after that. We had our volunteer military in place when nine 11 happened. We didn't have a draft, right? We had a volunteer military, the finest fighting force in the history of the world that was called to arms after nine 11. And I do wonder today, if you did have a situation where there was a general call up, how would that how would that go? What would that look like? We know that the the media, for example, spends a lot of time comparing the riot on January 6 where there were people taking selfies and some of them being escorted in cordial and polite fashion by members of Capitol Hill police. Some of them, some of them obviously were breaking things and being violent, but others were just almost doing a self guided tour of the Capitol trespassing. Yes. So they compare that to Pearl Harbor in the media. They'll say it was like, and actually they'll say it's worse than Pearl Harbor. There is really a psychosis and a disconnect from reality that comes up now from the left from the Democrats in this country. And I just don't think they're read. I don't think that they can psychologically handle if we were ever to get into a big fight again. I think the blame America first chorus would be very loud from the left. I think we would run into a whole lot of problems. And I'll leave you with this. This is from Donald Stratton's book, All the Gallant Men. He wrote, which is about his service in World War II. We were ordinary men. What was extraordinary was the country we loved. We loved who she was, what she stood for. We loved her for what she meant to us and for what she had given to us, even in those meager times he served on the USS Arizona. Show, my friends. It's a time of actual remembrance today and it's worth taking the moment to reflect on it. Hey, you got any gum? Yeah, check my backpack. What's this? Oh, that's Naloxone. It can reverse an opioid overdose. I decided to always keep it on me after my friend almost died. It saved his life. Oh, wow. I'm so sorry. That makes me want to have it with me too.
