It's not looking like this is going to head into a healthy direction. I thought it was interesting. Kevin O'Leary of Shark Tank, we played some sound bites from him yesterday. I know he was on a Shawn show last night and Kevin O'Leary had billions of dollars of companies he's involved with in Silicon Valley Bank. But to his credit, he's like, look, yeah, I got money there. I got money all over the place. A lot of people have been hit by this. When you're talking about $200 billion of deposits, that covers a broad swath of territory. I mentioned to you the massive Swiss bank Credit Suisse, which is pleading now with the Swiss Central Bank for support. Shares of Credit Suisse have gone down 30%. Also Moody's and the S&P jumping in with different cuts to the status downgrades, I should say, to the status of bonds of some of these banks. First Republic Bank, for example, now at junk status. And the big four banks are in a difficult spot for right now. Not a perilous spot, but they're stocks a little bit down today. I don't want to overstate anything here, but the stocks are... People are worried, obviously. People are concerned. And I think what you're really going to have to look for is the rate hike going up, the fed hiking rates, the next time around. If they do that, I think you got to assume we're heading into a recession, probably. If they don't do that, well, then we're just going to keep having inflation continue to eat away your savings and make everything more expensive. And there is no good option here. And that actually makes sense. And I think that's the part of this that's so hard. This is the cause and effect portion of our monetary policy and our national financial reality that if you spend too much money, you will create inflation. And then if you spend too much money and try to bring inflation down by bringing interest rates up, you will have a reduction in the money supply and economic activity and a likely recession. They keep saying, well, if we do it the right way, if we just do it just enough, it's going to be perfect. There are a lot of assumptions built into that. And I think given that we just saw a bank run and some bank failures that seemingly came out of nowhere, they didn't, of course, they were growing for a long time, but we certainly weren't hearing about it. You got to be prepared for what do they say, expect the unexpected in the financial world or Rumsfeldian unknown unknowns. Rumsfeld was quite a character back in his day. Very smart, very impressive guy. Rach Ward didn't turn out the way it was supposed to, but Rumsfeld was an interesting fellow. Now, I'd mentioned to you switching gears here. I just want to keep, I'm keeping an eye on the financial realities and I'm also reaching out. I mean, I've got, we see we got a couple of we got a couple of MBAs in my family. We got a banker in my family. I mean, I got a lot of people that I can tap for their knowledge of how these systems work. And then all what I was graduating from college, the two jobs that everybody went into, at least out of my school, I went to Amherst up in Massachusetts, which yes, is one of these places that is woke and has completely lost its mind. If it ever had a mind to lose, even when I was there, but Amherst and many other schools, everybody went into investment banking or management consulting. That was, I went into the CIA, different path, but investment banking management consulting, those are the two things that people wanted to do. And I do think that a lot of that world has changed dramatically in the past 20 years such that, well, anyway, I try to encourage people to do things that they at least would like to do. You want to find that sweet spot for anyone who's listening who's still figuring out what their career might be. Or if you got kids who are going to be thinking about this soon, you want to find something that you are both interested in, not that you it's a job, right? It's not it's not you're not going to pay to get a back rub. There's going to be work, there's going to be frustration, there's going to be time, there's going to be a lot of stuff you have to give to it. But something you are interested in and that you can be compensated enough for your lifestyle choice. That's what I try to tell people. So you have to be, you have to be willing to do it a lot and grow your skill set within it, which requires interest. Otherwise, you're just going to burn out and lose your mind and be miserable. Nobody wants that. But you also want to make sure you know, you know, what what the upside of it could be financially. Now, that does not everybody has to be a banker and messenger, try to be a millionaire, obviously, people are finding out maybe we have too many of those anyway. But you know, if you're if you're going to be a, you're going to be a guidance counselor, you're not going to make a million dollars a year, which is fine. But you just got to know these things when you go into it, right? You've got to understand what role you're taking. Anyway, speaking of colleges, Wellesley College, Wellesley College, Hillary Clinton's Alma Mater. I'm trying to think who else who else? There's all these schools have famous people when didn't matter. Did Mattle in all bright go to Wellesley? I want to say that's maybe I'm just making that up. I'm just going by memory here, folks, three hours of live radio. You got to come up with a lot of stuff on the fly. But Wellesley College is in the midst of a very interesting debate. It's a women's college, right? Very straightforward. You can only go there if you're a woman. I went to college down the street from down the street, roughly speaking, a few, maybe, you know, seven miles and 12 miles respectively or something away from Smith and Holyoke colleges, which are also women's colleges. I believe they're called the seven sister schools, but that that maybe I may be mixing some of them up. So Wellesley has a problem on its hands because women who make up the student body. Oh, by the way, I'm right. Yeah, Madeline Albright. Team, did you already know that I that I nailed that one? I don't know why I second guess myself. When it comes to random trivia on the fly, I'm pretty solid. So Wellesley College has had a referendum. It is non-binding. But students have called for the women's college to be open to all non-binary and transgender applicants, including trans men. So you are now going to have, assuming the university or the college in this case, allows this, you're going to have biological males attending a women's college. Now, I, I do wonder what the real, um, what the rules and regulations for this are going to be. Like, how, how would they even judges? They say it's if you have been there's some verbiage in here that says if you live your life as a woman, then you qualify, basically. Oh, sorry. Consistently identify as a woman is the, the term of art, I think they have used here. But the, the president, Paul Johnson is getting some pushback. She says that Wellesley was found that on the then radical idea that educating women of all socioeconomic backgrounds leads to progress for everyone as a college and community, we continue to challenge the norms and power structures that too often leave women and others of marginalized identities behind the students entirely disagree. They are all freaking out. And they are saying that we need to include trans men, right? Trans men, trans, or no, trans women. Sorry. Trans women men who are now identifying as women. You know, I got to tell you, uh, if I were a woman and I am not, and I do not identify as one, if I were a woman, I would find this all so offensive, honestly. And I guess at some level for men, the notion that a man, that a trans man would be able to sit down across from me and give me a lecture on manhood that I would listen to, that I would, I would want to hear her lived experience about being a man for, I don't know, six months, three months, whatever it is, as women have been subjected to, as you've seen recently, I mean, there's this video that's circulating everywhere of Drew Barrymore, who has a daytime TV show, which I, I didn't know it was possible to have a lower IQ show than the view, but there is a Drew Barrymore daytime TV show. And, and she's kneeling and hugging the trans woman who went to the White House and Biden sat down with and, and the trans woman who was, um, lecturing women on womanhood, basically, you're saying, you know, this is, let me tell you all about my womanhood as a guy. It just, this, every guy, every guy that I know without exception would just think it was absurd to the point of they wouldn't, it wouldn't even connect, they wouldn't even pay attention if a transgender man, a biological female sat down, you know, cut her hair short, wore a, wore like a, you know, a plaid shirt, you know, it's a little big and started telling the guys about what it is to be meant. Look, if people want to dress however they want, cut their hair of the, well, that's all fine. No problem with that. Of course. But the notion that we're supposed to see the superficialities of style choice as somehow indicative of the innate and immutable characteristic of one's gender, what sex you are is crazy. You can sit any woman in the world down across from a man and doesn't matter what she identifies as the guy is going to sit there and be like, I'm not, I'm not listening to, well, a normal man of, you know, reasonable mind and testosterone levels would sit there and say, I'm not going to listen to this. But women are being told now that it's almost as though they have something to learn from the trans women who have been women for like a few minutes or a few months or whatever. I just find it, I find it on behalf of women, I want to be offended. I guess I can't do that because I'm not a woman, but I would find it just so, oh, so someone speaks in a high, sort of a high voice, grows their hair long, maybe has breast implants put in, puts a lot of makeup on their face. And now they understand what it is to be a woman. That's because they say so. This is where we are. I would be fascinated to be in these Wellesley classrooms where these trans male students are being, or I think they're already being admitted, I can't even keep up. I think if you're like non cisgender, it's, the stuff is difficult. I know you speak in circles about it because it runs in circles. The whole thing is absurd. But yes, we are at the stage now where women's colleges are admitting men under the idea that they're actually women. And this is what is happening. Whether it's official at Wellesley yet or not, or whether it's just cisgender, nonbinary or actually trans or whatever, that is where we are. I bring this up. Well, for a lot of reasons, but it reminds me what we're talking about the last hour with Vermont and the school system and competing against men. And I would just say, you know, women having to compete against men, they keep telling you that this isn't the plan. And it absolutely is they're lying to you. This is their agenda that we are reacting to. They're the ones that have picked this fight. So we are the ones that are going to have to win it. Speaking of testosterone, did you know that testosterone levels and the average male in this country have dropped about 50% in the last 50 years? That is not a good trend. But there's something you can do about it without taking prescription medication.

I want to open up lines to current or former military listening to this right now because the Pentagon is briefing as we're speaking to you on the Russian jet hitting and bringing down that US Reaper drone and it has turned into General Mark Millie, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and Lloyd Austin, Secretary of Defense, just just talking about the blank check for Ukraine. I mean, we got to get them more more stuff faster, more stuff faster. That is all I ever hear from DC, the Pentagon, the brass, the White House. They're never in the beginning. There was, and this was the same by demonstration. The beginning there was, Hey, I don't know. We shouldn't, you know, we shouldn't give them planes, no fly zone. That can get messy. We, but that was the only place that I could see so far. There has been a line drawn other than we're not going to just have US, US military actively killing Russian forces. Oh, open conflict declaration of war with Russia. Yeah. Okay. Everyone so far has agreed that we shouldn't do that. But should we do this? I just feel like we had 20 years of war in the Middle East and South Asia. And we've had millions of veterans go through those conflicts. I think I think it's something like 3 million Americans, 2 to 3 million Americans are in that range. I believe went down range in Iraq, Afghanistan and other GWOT hotspots, global war on terror hotspots. And we couldn't, you know, Donald Trump somehow kept us from starting or getting involved in any new wars for four years. Now we're here and we're getting drawn deeper and deeper into the biggest conflict in Europe since World War II. A modern, a modern war with militaries that are losing large numbers of soldiers and there seems to be no end in sight. And right now in general, Millie is saying that Russian troops are demoralized and on train. Okay, you know, and I'm not, I'm not saying that's untrue. You know, he has a lot more access and stuff than I. It used to be more interesting when I talk about Afghanistan. I saw everything that the generals saw, etc. I mean, I was it's a whole story about that. I could maybe tell another time, but I for a period of time, I was seeing all the country level assessments, everything at the top secret level and all this stuff. And I got to tell you, I would just want to ask General Millie right now, okay, so are we saying that Russia is going to lose? Because you're leading us to believe that Russia is about to lose this thing. It's just a matter of when and it's months away, not years away. If it is years away, be honest with the American people about that. That's what I would want someone to push them on.

We are being told right now by Lloyd Austin, the secretary of defense. He just said it moments ago is about the rules based international order. Oh, okay. I can tell you what I want to go and fight in Ukraine to protect the rules based international order. I don't think so. What do we do about China just breaking its agreements with Hong Kong and violating the rules based international order by effectively consuming whatever freedoms Hong Kong had and ending them. We knew very much. There are a lot of things where we don't do very much because it's a big world out there. And the Pentagon is still going through this briefing and it's here. Here's what we know. We had a SU 27 Russian fighter jet that collided with an MQ nine Reaper drone, a US drone surveillance drone in international water over the Black Sea. And the Russians are saying it's our fault. We're saying it's their fault. There's also reporting that there was a fuel dump. So planes obviously can drop fuel mid air if they want to get lighter or whatever the pilots in the audience can fill in more on that. And they say that they dumped fuel on the drone and that brought it down. And the drone is down in the Black Sea and we are trying to recover it right now because of the technology involved and obviously the US investment. These drones cost many, many millions of dollars. So there was this was an act of aggression. The Russians had to know that this was ours. And they decided to they decided to mess with our with our drone. The SU 27 was able to land. And the Russian defense ministry, by the way, saying that the US drone was flying near the Russian border and treated in an area that the Russians decurred off limits, scrambled fighters to intercept the drone, claiming that it's not look, you know, this is where we get to the back and forth. Obviously, I'm as team America as anybody's ever going to get. And I'll say that and I'll fight it to fight on that issue until my my dying breath. But you know, not everything the government tells us is entirely true. So I do want to look and see what the possibilities are here. You know, I don't know who blew up the Russian pipeline. It wasn't the Russians, folks. It wasn't the Russians that much we know that was a while ago. Remember that one? Unless the Russians like to make themselves more poor for some reason when they have basically their entire economy hinging on whether they can get enough fossil fuel to market. So I'm just looking at this and I'm trying to come up with where this is all supposed to go. I mean, what are we really going to do? You know, Lindsay Graham's out there saying that there should be accountability. Okay, what does that look like? We've sanctioned Russia globally. We are giving the Russians opponents, the Ukrainians, all can be basically whatever we can give them that will help them right now short of a no fly zone aircraft and, you know, I don't know, probably some other advanced systems, but we're giving them a lot of stuff, a lot of military material and they're killing a lot of Russians with it. A lot of Russians are dying from missiles, artillery rounds, bullets, etc. That we are providing Ukraine with. So this notion that over the drone incident, there's going to be accountability. I just see I'm like, Hmm, I don't like empty rhetoric from people that are supposed to be above it and thinking more strategically. What does if accountability means calling the ambassador and being very upset? Okay, sure, we can do that. I'm sure we've done that. But is this supposed to be an indicator of something else? Another shift in policy? That's where I get concerned. We've got a lot, we got a lot of military that listens to this show, obviously, a lot of current and former military. I want to bring in some of your voices on this one. Tim in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, retired Air Force pilot, Tim, what do you what do you see going on here? No, I'm not a retired Air Force pilot. I'm retired Air Force retired Air Force. Sorry, go ahead, sir. Yeah, I think we'll be on manipulated and our usual response and people know if there's a crisis somewhere, we want to jump in and help in some fashion or another. But I think we're being manipulated. I think we're bleeding down our resources. We never get paid back for what we do. There's no there's no recompense for it. I think the problem is that the movers and shakers on an international level are thinking strategically and we continue to react technically. It's like playing check at somebody else playing chess. That's what I think. I appreciate calling in Tim. Thank you. And thank you for your service. Terrence is a former fighter pilot down in Santa Rosa Beach, Florida, the Sunshine State. What's going on, Terrence? Hey, good to talk to you. I do have to say the first time I talked or listened to you, you were talking about the Paris, uh, uh, uh, uh, climate, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, a chord. Yeah, sure. Yeah. That that night and I said, Hey, this guy's not, uh, this guy's pretty smart because you were saying everything I wanted to say that night. Anyway, um, dude, bringing down the drone, I guess it didn't shoot it down. We don't know that. Uh, the fuel dump thing, I didn't know they had dump on them. We have dump on our efforts, but we didn't have dump on our F 16. So, uh, how do they brought it down is, uh, to be found out later if we ever find the thing in the, uh, in the, uh, see, can I just ask you about what, what, so you said there were you flew an air, airframe that did have fuel dump. What, what's the, what, why do you use fuel dump? What's that for? Is it just if you got to get lighter? I mean, what's the circumstance you'd want to do that? F4 have fuel dump. And, uh, uh, what would you do is immediately after takeoff, you get dumped your internal or your wing fuel, not your internal fuel. And you would dump that to get lighter to land in the case of emergency. Same thing with airlines. That flew, um, Boeing seven, six, sevens, Boeing triple sevens, and they, uh, they had dump on it for the same reason. You know, you're on fire immediately after takeoff, you started getting rid of the fuel. So, I got to assume, right? The, the, the Russian SU 27, uh, involved here. Far, I'm, I'm guessing it's, you know, they're saying it was the aggressor here. It's highly maneuverable. The Russian pilot must have known that this was a drone, got close to it. So they brought it down. Is there a way they could bring it down? Uh, I mean, I guess the best way to ask it. How do you think they brought it down? Because initially they said there was a collision. I mean, could, could the plane have clipped the wing? I have to say that the fuel dump thing is, is bogus because it evaporates, uh, so rapidly a vaporized as soon as you dump. And there would be no way that how would you measure how far to get in front of the thing and then start dumping in front of it, uh, unless you had somebody on the wing telling you how to back up into this drone, which would be something unless you did a lot of times wouldn't be real safe. So that drone was brought down some other way than being fueled dumped in front of it. Uh, so is it fair to say though that in, in a fighter plane airframe like the Russian SU 27, any kind of intentional like, you know, back in the day of ship warfare, if you could get, uh, back in the, they have galley warfare, for example, or tri-reams, if you could get your bow lined up against the, uh, against the starboard or, or stern of the other person, right? Um, if you get your, your front, you could slice right through them and your boat would be fine. There's a be, but a plane, you're not going to clip the wing of a, of a drone intentionally, right? Cause you'd risk your own plane. Yeah. Right. Well, you have, there are, there were tipping, uh, things that the British used to do with the, uh, the buzz bombs, they tip them, they come up and put their wing underneath of it and tip it over. Huh. Okay. The buzz bomb flip over. Oh yeah. And then we, I flat, I flew air defense in Taiwan, um, back in the, uh, the early seventies, mid seventies, and, uh, we actually had a ramming procedure. It wasn't that anything that I was wanting to do. Uh, but, uh, yeah, I could imagine. Why the ram, I mean, so it's a, that, that tipping procedure, something they must have done something here. Cause it doesn't sound like they, uh, they fired. I mean, I think we would know if they fired a missile, right? So it sounds like they, there was some other mechanical way they brought it down. Thank you for calling in. Uh, it's fun to get a fighter. So you get a fighter pilot who calls in right away. Actually had a, we had a fighter pilot over here yesterday. Carrie's dad who was an F 15, F 18, pardon me, naval aviator F 18. I got to get this stuff right. Uh, F 18 pilot. So that was, uh, maybe I'll ask him next time I see him, he might be over, uh, uh, by the end of the week. So I'm gonna ask him, how could you, how could you take out a Reaper drone when you're in a fighter plane without shooting it? What would be the way you would do that? Home movies might be a thing in the past, at least in the traditional sense of someone in the family lugging around a video camera to every event. Nowadays we rely on our phones to record everything.

On the radio show, you got to be a podcast subscriber for that one. Plus the Sunday hangs. We put those in there too. You might learn about the denarius if you didn't already today joining us after I talked about that. Other fun things in the Sunday hang as well. We have we have an actual drone pilot, Bruce in New Mexico. Bruce, talk to us. Hey y'all. Yeah, it was the MQ one in Q nine. It's me at the Pentagon. It's me being somebody better expert for four years what can i tell you about the how could they have brought this thing i mean your i hope you heard the conversation with the uh... at four pilot how could they have brought this thing down well it's there they're very fragile to tell you the truth and they're that that that way specifically to be light and be able to go airborne the imp to nine uh... i don't know which version they have that you know i thought we were for hours uh... if they're not carrying any ordinance on it uh... and just a bunch of gas normally we did it in two nights round eighteen hours in q two hours about twenty two twenty one hours but they're light they're fragile and you could clip a wing and do some damage uh... you could get in front of it and and cause enough uh... turbulence to actually break lock with the satellites and send it into a s really it's possible and if if they if he was if they were stupid and they clip the prop with their radar dome which they may have done uh... it would have shattered the uh... uh... fiberglass prop do you think by the way that i'm in a asking now for the uh... the man side of the aerial equation in and the expertise you can give us on this one uh... do you think that the pentagon is planning to do massive training and then uh... or you know a training program and then deployment of american planes not man by us obviously by Ukrainian pilots but is that going to get introduced into this theater warfare do you think in the future you know that's that's a really good question if i think it would be rather silly uh... if if we want to give them the hardware and let them do it okay fine uh... the other thing i wanted to say was a lindsey Graham needs to check himself before he wrecks all of us that was a piece of fiberglass that we send up and one of the reasons we like it so much is because there's not a little pink but sitting in the seat of that yeah it's a different i mean it we all can recognize is a different thing to shoot yet expensive but uncle sams got pretty deep pockets to bring a drone down is a very different thing than shooting a pilot of the sky and having his family given a folded flag right i mean we all russian american anybody would understand that so i i i don't know why people listen to when the grandma and the stuff i mean he's a senator and he's been in the game a long time thank you for calling in bruce and in mccs got appreciate it we had a look at it is what i was love i can sit here with this audience is amazing i can crowd source particularly on firearms history anything military related i can crowd source the most specific question imaginable and i'll get an answer i could ask somebody hey if the third widget from the left on the rotor of it of a black hawk helicopter has come a little bit loose what can i use in my toolbox i will have like a night stalker uh... mechanic calling in within within five minutes telling me exactly how to fix it's amazing we can bring the bear on the show uh... anyway uh... we've got call i mean we got some emails into a one to get to uh... let's see this one this is in some andy uh... it goes to the trump disentice throwdown which is it's underway folks it's happening now right we didn't want to get ahead of ourselves but you know there's there's friendly fire getting thrown around here that's that's what's going on i claim buck and we better i suppose if the donald made nice enacted a bit more civil toward disentice but don't hold your breath president trump for all his brilliance and common sense though he showed terrible judgment with some of his picks the people he picked we're living through a very crass and vulgar age in america and who is the craftful garyon with the common touch of course the man of the hour sent by the lord some say i personally am sitting on the fifty-yard line on this though i have voted for him twice and will again a third time though somewhat leery he leaves for sigh on the atlantic to give a rally to the trailer park in alabama to people that are holding on to being middle class is this what politics is so you know he says don does right in the war in ukraine uh... etc etc thank you best andy uh... you know people are gonna get it this is gonna be a very passionate debate and people feel very strongly about i people reaching out to me on both sides and it's interesting because every the the people that i know who want to sent is to win this primary are all overwhelmingly saying things like i voted for trump twice i respect him so much i like him so much the trump people who now when i say trump people i'll vote for trump obviously if he's a nominee any republicans should vote for trump if he's a nominee we're just talking about primaries right now but people who've already said they're all in on trump they don't say to sanitizes a clown i don't like um he's a no no they say he's a very good governor his time will come so it's really interesting because you're going to see this huge fight both sides respect the uh... primary combatant that is the choice of the other side i feel like that's that's uncommon i'm really seeing this a lot you know people that are the most arctic trump primary voters to be obviously it hasn't happened yet they all tell me they think the scientists has done an amazing job in florida and he's you know he's deserves a lot of credit and his day will come that's what that's what i'm hearing i mean not from absolutely everybody but ninety five percent and all the dissent is people are saying trump is amazing he built this movement but we think because of his age yada yada to be very interesting to see where this all plays out and where it goes and we're excited to be a part of that
