How are you? Oh, I cried like a little girl at a star is born. Oh It's sad. I have a great if we have time today. I have a great story about Going to the movies with a row of 40 year old women all drinking wine No next time that happened and Andrew Heaton. Oh, you've just heard his back comedian Andrew. Thank you Thank you for having me. I love when you're here. Thank you. We always like to give you a thank you studio audience We love when you're here because we get to roll around on the floor laughing Fantastic excellent. All right. I really got to bring my a game today. Yeah All right, Glenn was a top story top story today I think has to be just this is the insanity of the mayor of Portland. I don't know what there though What's happening in Portland? Yeah, I'm building a monorail Yeah Elizabeth Warren has proved something about her name of American heritage. I'm not sure exactly what it is But we're gonna delve into that okay pass you know you can't pass That's not how this works, okay, well, I've actually got a media response to one of the things we're gonna deal with with Antifa Okay, okay, perfect. All right, so Glenn actually, you know what before we get into that what we want to thank our sponsor Can we do that? So oh my gosh especially because it's brick house. Yes. Oh, can I pass? Yeah, yeah, I like brick house a lot Don Dusque from Don Donta. Yes very solid life saver Yeah, I mean these are long days sometimes and Glenn's very boring and meetings You need energy to kind of stay awake stay focused you know Andrew on the road is a comedian you probably use cocaine But here we try to we try not you know I just get I just try and get in 12 hours of sleep every day Do that we don't do coke are you the typical man who does not like your vegetables? I'm working on and I'm up to like a stock of broccoli a day. Oh wow Good I can well first of all don't take this this is not this is not edible. It's not for eating Okay, but we'll have to try we'll have to make you some field of greens, which is another brick house. Oh, okay Last time yeah, yes. Yeah, so you can get me yes One scoop is one full serving of fruits and vegetables and it tastes good. He can vouch for it. Glenn can have scurvy. Yeah Catch free Scurvy free with yeah There you go. Oh my gosh. I can't wait for the orders to start pouring in for that because of that endorsement Yeah, go to brick house blaze calm use promo code greens for 15% off your first order or you can text greens to 41411 because we live in the first world and you can just text things now you never know when scurvy can hit it could It in any time. Okay, so here is well here is you know the the first time I encountered the mayor of Portland was when antifa surrounded the FBI building okay in Portland and And the FBI you don't think of the FBI having to call for help But the FBI is like maybe we should call 9-1-1 and so they they call up 9-1-1 and the police say Okay, before we come to help we have to check with the mayor. No, that's I Mean I'm glad it wasn't like something like they needed them right away like we're all having heart attacks So they call up the mayor the mayor goes on TV and says if the FBI thinks that We're gonna send the police to help them. They're in the wrong town Now I'm guessing that the FBI was like yeah, I think we might be We were in America And so they had to get federal assistance to come in and get all of the federal Bureau of Investigation workers out of the federal building That's insanity insanity Then last week, you know people are just directing traffic. No, you got to go that way I don't want to go that way beat up or they I shouldn't say this they they attacked the car of an old guy like 71 years old Broke out his window yelling at him telling me he had to go a certain way the police were right there watching it But I guess if you wear black, I guess you're okay to direct traffic in Portland then this weekend What is the proud is a proud boys? Yeah, yeah, proud boys, which is Gavin McGinnis's group, which I'm not sure if they're a comedy troupe or Because I don't I'm not sure Gavin really an improv Yes, I'm not sure about Gavin so They show up and it's a march for what is it law and order Law and order march and I don't know if it was the TV show or actual law and order in the city But they start to march and fuck comes, you know They've brought sticks and stones and things that break your bones and they went after each other Both sides were arrested, but that's that's a first that the police have been involved. I think in Portland And I mean, I don't know what is happening. What is happening? How where is this mayor? Why is this mayor's not standing for the good people of Portland Yeah, and I mean it makes you wonder does he not worry that he will no longer be mayor if he does not Stand for the people of Portland. I could have homes. I mean there's there it's it's there They're doing the San Francisco treat. They're pooping on the streets They're beating people up. They're harassing people I'm not sure if they're all voters or not but if If Portland is choosing to stand with anarchy, I mean I don't understand how you can have a city's economy is based entirely on microbrewing and art I like I think that's awesome Like that would and I like the the weather's really nice. I imagine you guys have talked about in Tifa previously on the show It's probably come up. I used to be an 18 year old boy and I hope to be again What I can tell you like like young men like there's there's a large portion of it that just want to fight people And and it's all the better if you've got like a righteous reason to fight people And so I don't like the idea of disguised people determining on their own who's a Nazi they can hit the head with a brick Gab I mean Gavin's a provocateur But the way to deal with it is to yell at him and you know do whatever they're doing short of violence. And so yeah I mean I Don't know what to do if the city won't stand up. This is this is Gavin's point is The police aren't doing anything the city's not doing anything No one is standing up against these guys and they are taking over the city I mean you have to remember if you know, you know history 1928 to 1932 33 until the night of long knives the this is the way the brown shirts handled Situations in in Germany They just would take a street and if you didn't give the Nazi salute They would beat you to with an inch of your life right on the street in the crowd. So everybody saw it That's how everybody gave the Hitler salute. They're only 30 30% of the population of Germany were were Nazis How did you get everybody to do it because they were afraid of the brown shirts and Hitler used them to create chaos Until he seized power and then he finally became the fuhrer because of the night of long knives He killed all of those guys. He let everybody be terrified of the brown shirts and then at the last minute he killed all of them in one night and Then he got on the radio and he said I know I've broken the Constitution and I've done something illegal, but These people were out of control and I had to do something and I I will go to jail if that's what the good people of Germany want Instead they made him for her Yeah, it's interesting to watch this. It's just strategically for a minute I mean I mean I think on these issues between Antifa and Gavin McInnes I'm gonna side with Gavin McInnes on most of these issues whatever they are I just thought the approach you know we've talked about so many times there's this opportunity I think to go to the American people and say here the AB test you've got Antifa who are in the streets They're pushing people around they're not letting people turn in their cars where they want to they're throwing rocks through windows They're throwing you know Molotov cocktails and businesses like I don't I don't want necessarily a group that matches that I don't want someone on the other side of that I want someone doing the exact opposite of that and I think the American people given the choice between that violent Antifa Nonsense and a more sensible you know rational approach are gonna choose the rational approach And I think that when we get in the middle of that even when I think because they they will argue they're defending themselves right They're putting themselves in these positions, but they're they're defending themselves And I think that's obviously you have the right to do that But I think you know you look at who was tweeting about the proud voices weekend all these big reporters from the New York Times and the Washington Post They're all saying like look at the violence caused by this group and they're trying to make the same arguments We've been making about Antifa about this group and saying oh it's equal both sides are crazy. Well, that's not true So the so the this is where Martin Luther King and Malcolm X split Martin Luther King said when you have good versus evil and they're side-by-side the American people always pick good and That's why I mean we've talked to Elvida who who went to jail for overnight and her dad left her there and And because she was just helping a friend up another girl who had been hit in the head She broke ranks and was just trying to help her she was arrested because of the girl and the scuffle there she was just brought into it and Her her father said what part of nonviolence and don't break ranks. Don't you understand? And she's like dad. I was helping he said we don't break ranks We let them hit us we let them club us we let them beat us We don't break ranks and that is what won the civil rights movement This is Martin this is not Martin Luther King. This is Malcolm X and it won't work It won't work because people won't want to be a part of either Antifa or the Proud Boys and I do think I mean to that point, you know We've seen after all of the you know Supreme Court circus was done The polling showed that Americans are rejecting this left this far left idea that you know We can take over everything with no due process and no rights and everything like that So it seems odd that Portland would be going this direction I may not may I play a clip of how I think it's better a better way to handle groups that you strongly disagree with this So this is gonna be a this is a KKK march I don't remember where when it happened, but you'll see exactly how it was undermined And I think it's a much better way of doing things in violence Following the KKK They're not scary to me at all in this context. They look like a bunch of losers Which is what they are and and like that that tuba I think does so much more in terms of Elevating you the tubist because you're not you're not hurting anybody But at the same time we're also undermining them so I think if there's come after you you're not quick on your feet No, that's another thing I intend to pick up in addition to broccoli is You know I'm gonna get good of vegetables than tuba's yeah I'm gonna say it would be interesting We could like do a news and why it matters in Portland and have to but if we had somebody if you could play the Oscar Meyer Wiener song on tuba that is I think that's good. I didn't recognize that particular song to do I think I think it was just it did make them sound very Kind of something Tuba's not the most versatile instrument. It kind of just does that and it's usually not used is usually not used as a solo instrument Agree, all right. I do want to get into Elizabeth Warren, but let's go ahead and take a break before we get into that Every Glenn back is coming live to talk about the right path forward and to make fun of the people standing in the way He might not be able to save the country But at least we can all go down laughing Glenn back live be addicted to outrage tour on tour this fall Oh We talked about Pocahontas Pocahontas. Wow. Yes, I did I went there. We want to thank our sponsor Yes, oh the P word keyword. Yeah Pocahontas. I hope we got that censored for television Want to thank our sponsor I target pro Andrew, I don't know if you've ever been here when we've talked about I target my the target audience for all You're just you're new.

I have shot a gun because I'm from Oklahoma and it's the wall So you're not a so wait so you're not a gun guy or you just don't you just have a shot? Either or I haven't shot in a while. Okay, so I target pro is it it's basically a laser bullet He's not gonna like from Star Trek listen laser bullet. So is it what I think it is. Yeah, it is We've got laser bullets listen if you can I take the hijack this train wreck for those who are actually shooters And actually actually use a gun Dry firing is really really super important But it's hard to do because you don't know exactly what you're shooting at this you put a it's a like a little teeny bullet But it's actually a laser pointer, but you cannot see the laser bullet every time you Pull the slide back and shoot there you go you shoot at a target and Your phone registers where you hit the target? But it's not showing you a laser that you're aiming at you have to use your own sights It's the greatest way to To dry fire and to actually ammo and going to the range.

Yes, as you know, there's been some level of controversy over her heritage Her background. She's claimed to be a Native American several times including in her wonderful Entry into the book pow wow chow Which is an incredible recipe for what was it oatmeal? Do we have the actually we do have the recipe it is interesting there you go there Elizabeth Warren Cherokee Why is it the Cherokee entering a submission from Mexican oatmeal soup you're about to learn why I think I think We actually have an answer to that one in this segment which is interesting. So This is going to be shocking I think to most people but Elizabeth Warren may be running for president She may be considering this idea So she's come out she realizes this has been kind of chasing her around is there's no real evidence of her having any Native American heritage Though she's claimed it several times. Well, I thought that that was all the evidence that we as women needed right? Yes, just say something was automatically believed right so She's trying to get out ahead of this because we know we're a few weeks away from this election once this election comes There's going to be just a stampede towards running for 2020 as the Democrats They expect maybe as many as 25 different Democrats to be running for president This is gonna be we thought like 2016 was insane. This is gonna be insane. Michael Avenatti is definitely winning We all know that right love that so I really An ovenie that will confirm we're living in a sitcom. Yes That's the case for entertainment purposes potentially the best possible outcome But so Elizabeth Warren is gonna try to get ahead of this issue because she knows is going to kind of you know Follow her around and has been for many years so she released a video and this video is supposed to kind of Find you get the truth about her actual heritage. She did a DNA study. She's talking about her relatives from Oklahoma Okay, we have a clip of this video. We don't have a clip of the video. Yeah, no We have a clip of her a while back discussing her parents. Okay. Well, let's watch watch that You can get a sense of her sell on this Actually, you have it wrong about what it is. I believe you let's start there Okay, my mom and dad We're very much in love with each other and they wanted to get married and my father's parents said absolutely not you can't marry her because she's part Cherokee and she's part Delaware and And After fighting it as long as they could my parents went off they eloped It sounds a nice storage, but she's part Cherokee and and so look I don't Delaware in part Delaware Like I don't care what your background is like I don't see why that's important only in an identity politics world is that important? I really don't care, but it's interesting that if you're going to live that world you shouldn't be lying about it So she's decided to come out with a DNA test the results came out and she was basically bragging about it saying see I was right I was I am part Cherokee what they found is she was initially reported. She was one thirty second Native American that was the initial report when you looked a little bit deeper It said somewhere between one thirty second and one five hundred and twelve I mean a Native American a little bit of a then the Boston Globe came out. It said oops We made a math error. It's actually between one sixty fourth and one one thousand and twenty fourth Okay, anywhere in there Now what's fascinating about this is when you actually and I'm sure like three people in the universe actually read the full Boston Globe Article but you found some really interesting things what they believe is it's like a great great great great grandmother Was was Native American However, she herself said she wasn't this is the clip from the Boston Globe Smith was her name was born in the late 1700s She identified as white in historical documents though at the time Indians face discrimination and Smith would have had strong incentives to call herself white if possible I think that's so it is true and it is a plausible Possibility however, it does not actually prove anything Especially when she was herself identifying that way and have we not learned that whatever you identify as is what you are If this is that the progressives have been telling us for years that if you say you're a woman You are a woman if you say you were a man you were a man if you say you are black you are black Apparently not the case with this poor great great great great grand grand person But here's it is the great great great great great great great grandmother was Native American that puts her at 1 30 second This is before they updated by the way, but the report says is just one 1024th a Native American and ancestor is ten generations back So what would you do you'd have to test of course the DNA of Native Americans and match it up Here keys and Delaware However, they decided to try to do that there are issues with this process detecting DNA for Native Americans a particular tricky because there's an absence of Native American DNA available for Comparison to make up for the dearth of Native American DNA Bustamante is a DNA expert that did this use samples from Mexico Peru and Columbia to stand in for Native American So what they've actually So they have not at all even the report itself didn't even say she was any percentage Native American because I guess There's some you know skepticism Understandable of Native Americans dealing with the DNA and government types of issues So they have not provided any DNA so she might be Peruvian So she might be Peruvian Colombian or Mexican this did not show anything to do with Native Americans Obviously the groups were you know, you know, they talk about it in the story about how groups came to North America and then and migrated further south so it could again It could be it could be that her great-great-grandmother was was had an incentive It did it another way it could have been a bunch of things But I mean when this is your level of proof she she launched this in like a big media spectacle to try to get people to believe Hey, you can elect me for president because I didn't lie about this It did latch on to it, right? Well, they did and they did it it took a while if you for reading the story get to these details I thought it was kind of fascinating though. It's not at all what they're saying it is Could you imagine if let's say to Nash to Susa was gonna do, you know, I don't know the powwow child the movie Right, okay, which is like I couldn't get any Native Americans. I just got some people from Peru I do like I'm gonna swing for her a little bit in that I'm signed from Edmund which is two towns over from where she grew up All of my friends save one are part Cherokee Choctaw or Seminole that I grew up with and it's very very common in Oklahoma to Have Cherokee ancestors and to not really be able to figure out that going back because a bunch of people were marched at at gunpoint And so I like I don't really fault her for that. I am I don't think when you go back in her history looking at You know being the Native American person on the staff and that kind of thing I don't know that the if she was applying for Some sort of minority status that financially benefited her I don't think it's really designed for people that are you know a hundredth or whatever But I'm happy to handle the Cherokee thing if she wants that I think you know I don't really care. I mean I really don't care. Well, I think it should be true I mean if you're gonna if you're gonna claim it I think it should be true or at least the critics the best of your Understanding right I mean it's possible like I mean look my parents told me what my background was I have no freaking idea If it's true I mean but I also don't go around putting in on forums that I don't go around you're not running as like well I'm officially a minority now exactly which is part of this kind of it tends to be part of the progressive narrative like there's this spectrum of Everybody interprets different situations the progressives tend to look at a presser victim And you don't want to be the oppressor so you want a victim So if there's a way you can project that then you're you're a female you're a victim, but you're white So you're less of a victim, but if you're a white woman who's part Cherokee and Delaware You you have the Intersectionality that is required this is a issue with judgment I think with the progressives in general and that like when you look at the history compared between oppressors and victims It's much better to be the oppressor you should totally be going for being the oppressor You should I mean that's a much better life people don't realize this but the oppressor is the way to go I mean I know as a white male I know this is awesome. So I you know an indigenous people stay I just tweeted just a little fact out Because people were you know was a killer and And so I just tweeted because I'm from the Pacific Northwest and I know the you know a little bit of the the Native American story in the Pacific Islanders in the Pacific Northwest Indians 50% of the Pacific Northwest Indians 50% of the population were slaves 50% So I just wanted to clean out on indigenous people's day. Hey that racism and slavery that that's a human trait That's not a white traitor an Italian traitor an Indian trait. It's a human trait. Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh I was again the the oppressor. I thought I thought I was gonna get smallpox blankets Up next enjoy bonus overtime content from the news and why matters Available exclusively for podcast listeners and blaze premium subscribers become a premium subscriber at the blaze.com subscribe So you're a libertarian sure I lean I'm an independent I lean libertarian lean libertarian What happened with Gary Johnson and bill well, I mean that was just seemed like a big Do you want to know like the secret stuff that the libertarians know Seemed like the perfect time and again I think we're entering that perfect zone where everyone is sick of the Republicans and the Democrats and all you have to be very good reason Yeah is normal just be Normal don't come out on which which is the new radical is being normal. It really is yeah So what happened to the normal thing? I think I think to think what so but I mean Gary Johnson and bill Both are basically sane Republicans from the 90s many of whom have cleaved away from the party So they're not they're not even that I mean they they would have been you know reasonably mainstream Republicans I mean he had a good record as governor in New Mexico I mean and he you know he may win that Senate seat. No this time as well I hope so but the but the problem is is that you remember my problem with him was he was not for You know freedom of speech. I think second amendment stuff He was like he had weird things like no well the government's got to get involved there and you're like well what? well, I mean that I think the libertarian party tends to be a mix of Sort of rigid doctrine or oftentimes anarchist or anarcho-capitalist And that's I think part of the reason that the libertarian party isn't able to advance very further I I who have often done a lot of stuff for a reason would not be sufficiently libertarian for the libertarian party Yeah, even though I'm oftentimes hailed as like you know like a meaty guy Gary Johnson's part of that kind of I think you know rather than going for Ed Who's the guy that ran like fourth party out of Utah Ed McMuffin? Rather than doing that which was a little bit more conservative he swung more libertarian I don't I don't think that it was ideology that got him down I think I think Gary just wasn't a terrific candidate and I like Gary I think Gary's a really good guy. I think it would have been stronger if Bill welded than on the head of the ticket But he's a much better communicator than Gary is for sure I mean I don't I'm not like overly like you know We weren't exactly in love with him either But still like you got the sense with Gary Johnson is one of those guys that just even if he really knows an issue feels unsure about it Yeah I just feel like he's like he's trying to grasp for like the very basics of this one I don't think that's true. I mean he has a real record of Successful run as a governor. I mean who's the who's the up-and-coming guy? I don't know. I have no idea who's gonna take it. I like it could be I Mean the other the two guys beneath Gary Johnson in this this last election of the libertarian party were Boston Peterson Austin Peterson who was recently making a Senate bid and lost that I don't know if he's gonna run again the New York governor guy too, right? I think I like very sharp and there was also McAfee who mayor Yeah Like there are like there are these weird things that you can slip into the liberal I have no idea how the libertarian party go. I would like it if they pick billwell I like billwell. I don't think they will I think they're so if you develop software you can murder anybody you want That is the role in beliefs Hillary Clinton had some interesting things to say about her husband's affair Yeah, you know, I figure this is the show to come out and defend Hillary Clinton a little bit Yes, you know what I think it is. Let's let's make that stance here Do we have the actual clip of the interview? Let's watch this this part of it has been like a real attack point for conservatives to kind of Call out the hypocrisy which certainly exists here, but let's watch it and discuss a little bit and in retrospect Do you think bill should have resigned president Clinton should have resigned in the 90s in the wake of the Monica Lewinsky Absolutely not so it wasn't an abusive power. No You do not believe he should have resigned. No How do you contend with members of your own party now saying he should have that's that's their right to their opinion But they were not in the middle of it So she goes on to say the reason why it's not an abusive power is because Monica Lewinsky's an adult And she's making her own decisions And I think most people are like well look your your the me-two thing is supposed to be you believe the woman and all these cases where you've seen Rich powerful men do terrible things to women and you know, but she didn't say the five terrible things And that's that's my point. Yeah, it's like you know I think empowering women right is to say that women have agency at 23 years old to make their own decisions And the fact that you know Bill Clinton Yes, he was a powerful guy and was it abuse of power from Bill Clinton's perspective I mean yeah Probably like he was in he was the most powerful man in the world and he was married and he was doing things He certainly shouldn't have been doing but from her perspective. I think also morally not a good choice However, like she's an adult. She's 22 23 years old You know we act as if women are Are banned from saying you know what I would not like to have a sexual relationship with that person Or you know, someone comes to him and is a powerful individual and says, you know, they want to hook up Well, you know, we should be empowering women to say no to that right like it's not something She herself said she really wanted to do it at the time And then did him after and she has the right to do that. This is not the wrong one-eater Broadway case That was right. That was right. That's totally something different. Totally different Yeah, she feel like there is an argument to be made though that when you're if you're working for someone or on underneath someone Right, not literally but sometimes literally But well, but when you're working, you know and you fear that if you turn them down or something That's not this case. That's not what happened. She was a willing participant I mean she talked about falling in love with him Well, right No, no, no, but I'm just saying just because I want to get your take on because you said because she was Yeah, if you're 23 years old she's an adult She was like she wasn't raped if she fell no if she felt pressured to do something if she's like I don't like a heebas then We can get into an assidure because this is why businesses make rules about these things right they say he should have gone to the White House HR department I know big deal this is why they make rules right like you can make a rule as a company that says executives can't date Underlings right like you can you can do that in businesses do do that often But the issue here is when you get into the idea of like well if if she might feel like like the That he is going to do something to her and therefore she a does it Which is a really weird argument to say that you would put your personal sexuality like below some potential job Advancement but beyond that you're punishing him for a future crime. He hasn't done this if he punishes her For for not putting up with his sexual nonsense then that's just a crime right like you can't do that You can't go and and and and ruin someone's career because they won't give you sexual favors. That's not allowed You can't punish him before he actually does that you have to do it after he does it And you know we act as if there is no world in which a younger person I mean we have I mean there's a million examples of this, you know But I mean Billy Joe but Donald Trump and Melania Trump are much different age right sure if she could have at some point made the argument Well, I shouldn't you know I she maybe thought Donald Trump who runs beauty contests right could have affected her career in some negative way But she should still be allowed as a person to make the choice that she wants to do it if she wants to do it And I think like we get into this idea of like There's a standard that I think is kind of ridiculous with some of the stuff that we've seen in me too much of it Being very good But some of the stuff where we've seen in me too where we actually wind up taking agency away from women We don't allow them to make choices even if they're dumb choices Both men and women should be allowed to make really stupid choices if that's what they want to make Do you remember do you remember what I said when because we were working together? when this happened and I remember When the day she the day Clinton said alright, I did have sex Do you remember what my suggestion was for Hillary? Can I walk out? Yeah, yeah, I said she'd be the most powerful woman ever if she Walked out had her luggage she did a press conference right in front of the White House. It would have been amazing amazing And said I want you to listen carefully This man is the president of the United States and he is still my president I agree with his policies and I back his policies But no woman should ever be treated like that I lied because I was misinformed I lied and I said vast right-wing Conspiracy and some of that is true people were out to get him but This is an issue that I thought we had already dealt with and we'll be dealing with it ourselves Whether we get back together or not is our business none of the people's business Yeah, but I want you to know I support him as the president, but tonight. I'm going to a hotel She would have won in 2000. Yeah, you would have won in 2000 You know talking about the Me Too movement just to offer a little bit of female perspective Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. I know that there was a lot of There were a lot of critics of the women who were not sexually abused You know obviously consented to this and said come on. They didn't abuse their power you consented to it Which is the conversation we're having right now. However, I do think that there's something to be said for you know The single mom secretary or you know someone who they they are like I have to have this job to feed my kids I cannot you know worry about him finding a reason to fire me or make my life a living hell And so I'm either choosing feeding my kids or standing up to this man And I do think that there were some of those that did exist within that movement They're that's that's an important distinction to point out of course and there these are you know these situations are Impossible at times to deal with we don't know all the ins and outs of it I just think that we have to look we have to look back at either You're just gonna cuz I mean I think the standard there that the only thing that solves that is you just don't you're not I mean we make an age range and you just can't date outside of it right like we can't there's no way to Be able to stop that in Germany. I think they actually if I'm not mistaken They actually have legislation that you can't date an ins subordinate within a company Right as considered you know which which would go well beyond my yeah For clivities to have an actual law governing right but I mean it goes even further with me too many of these accusations We're not people that work for the same company They were people who were in the same industry like I mean Louis C. K For example was that he does not he was not overseeing any of the women that accused him of anything He'd they just said he was a very influential comedian and could have influence on their future careers and we had a How you judge I don't know how you judge that we have to be able to you know We have another one that came out today that we found out today that she was a woman who claimed she had been raped right Yeah, there's been a several of these the last few weeks You know woman said that she was groped by a black child and the footage exonerated the same thing with a police officer Oh, we do have that yeah, if you want to get it there's been several these cases recently There's one in the west coast and college as well There's one with police officers who said that they sexually assaulted and the body cam evidence Vindicated him look women are awful and so are men. They're all awful There's all these awful examples of people who do awful things on both sides That's why you have to have a system of due process to make sure you can find these things out I mean it's all we can do we all we can do is empower people women in particular in this particular example to go out and feel Comfortable that they'll be supported if they're accusing someone of something that actually occurred. So here's a great thing The body cam has saved people and actually the body cam also Or the dash cam actually put a police officer in Chicago behind bars that should have been behind bars That's really good. The problem is deep fakes We were talking about this today that there is who was it was saying that there's an avalanche Ben sass Ben sass in his new book says that he is talking to You know the people in high tech and in our secret service and CIA And he says there is about about to be an avalanche of deep fakes. That's going to change not not just porn But actual yes That's a big deal It's true. I mean can you imagine if you're talking about wars could start over fake videos It's already seen some of that in India There was a big issue with that fairly recently and one last thing on this before we totally changed gears Speaking of wars Saudi Arabia Did you hear about the latest on Saudi Arabia? They just remember someone else? I heard that Pompeo was going to go there and that the king had said that he he flat out denied it and Trump was He Unfortunately, it looks before airtime sources came out and said the kingdom is about to admit that it was a Interrogation gone horribly wrong. Oh, that's fine. Yeah. I mean as long as it was an honest mistake Yeah, so and and the people involved will be punished severe. They went rogue. They went rogue. Wow Okay, so you were talking about empowering women. What about empowering men who are pretending to be women I That's definitely happened. I don't know what I don't know exactly what you're talking about, but that's your right. Okay So there was a transgender woman. So a man who is identifying as a woman today anyway, don't name shame And apparently this transgender woman Won the world championship in the women's sprint 35 to 39 age bracket. Oh great. Yeah, so of course one against a other two other women and Was touting it and and people were critical, you know obviously because there are such thing as scientific facts that prove that men are stronger than women and Dr. Rachel McKinnon said lots of transphobic bigots are responding to my world championship when saying Next up the Paralympics. Hey women you realize that all of these people are comparing you to disabled people right women equals disabled men They think wow offensive. That's Yes, what is what is what is UCI because for me like I like I'm my position is I'm happy to call anybody Whatever they want to be called within reason and I don't know the science on it But what is within reason if you said I want you to call like instead of calling me Cherokee or whatever You I need you to refer to that as a master race. I'd be like I'm not gonna do that American but I won't you know me your highness Maybe Well, I'm in races of social constructs. I'm fine with it If you if you want like I'm you know if if yeah if you want to identify with a particular group Which is kind of why I'm curious as to what what what group this is organizing this because If this person wants to identify as a woman I'm like I hope they're very happy and I wish them all the best I do you think it's fair that this person competes with women In sporting events see that that's why I want to know what group it is because if this is like the Olympics where it's you know It was quasi governmental and all these different things I feel like that's an issue if this is um if this is like a like an intercollegiate group or something I don't know I would just want to hear from the the women competing in it what they thought if they're fine with it then I'm fine with it I mean we've seen these cases with even on you know high school campuses and things of that nature where the other students are like This isn't really fair. We don't really have a chance here in Texas really bad case of that. Yeah Yeah, yeah, really bad case of the women's wrestling. I believe yeah women's wrestling a guy Became a woman taking I think he took he didn't transition right fully it was not fully but he was taking horrible He was taking estrogen or something And but he was undefeated Undefeated I mean the girls immediately a safety risk right and all the girls were like okay this what is this right? Well, I'm like even from my position saying you know you're whatever you want to be as far as I'm concerned They're like you nonetheless have a different muscle structure based on what you were initially identified with that kind of thing Yeah, I mean I think it's it's tough because if It's almost like just like it does get rid of all of it Right like you get rid of all women's sports And then of course the people will complain about that right like we have title 9 built into our system because Women's sports supposed to get the same amount of money and I'll say a matter of attention Maybe they should take testosterone injections. I'm kind of curious. There you go. What happened on that that race everybody is called the Soviet Union Oh, yeah Work out well, yeah very well. Oh, yeah I don't know if anyone caught the 60 minutes interview with President Trump But in it he defended his relationship with Putin of course and with Kim Jong-un He said of Kim Jong-un. I have a good energy with him I have a good chemistry with him look at the horrible threats that were made no more threats What is what is your take on that Glenn good? I mean if it's working. It's working. I mean I don't think okay that he's praising him as long as we're I'm so far down I'm my my my real principles Back there someplace Just like we abandoned principles on things like this long time ago as a nation. I I mean, I don't like the fact that we are praising him But you know, we're in this place that I warned about 2004 with South Korea or North Korea and Iran You cannot let them get nuclear weapons because then there are no good options You either have to placate them or you have to vaporize them and neither of those are good So I think once you have a state with a nuclear weapon You do whatever you can do just to keep them contained You kind of refer to you like you know, it's kind of like he almost said basically in that interview. It's just words Right like I'm in look and I get I can waste a lot of words to try to get a lot of you know People not killed by a nuclear weapon, you know, so I can deal with that You know, there's a consistency issue I think that if you know Barack Obama was doing the exact same thing the conservative audience would not be as receptive to it however, I think you know look if if if we can figure out a way out of this without bloodshed, I mean You'll say whatever you have to we have so many things on our plate right now The last thing we need is somebody with a nuclear weapon every ten minutes going You know what I'm thinking about blowing you up. Yeah, I don't let's He also in this interview I guess the media and I just this is just a fun Trump clip that I wanted to play watch It is like I've really learned is I never knew how dishonest the media was I I really mean it I'm not saying that is a sound bite. I never knew how to say the subject again Well, no, but even the way you asked me a question like about separation. Yeah when I say Obama did it You don't want to talk about it. Let's make a big I'm gonna run your answer, but you did it four times I'm just telling you that you treated me much differently on the subject. I Disagree, but I don't want to have that fight with you. Hey, okay. No, the fight with the okay the meantime. I'm president and you're not Just make out already The same thing there's a lot of sexual tension I tell you that's exactly the way we felt when we went to CNN and then to Fox We really thought people we thought that there was a chance that people would be Honest that reporters would be honest. No, there's they're just not intellectually curious at all There's just no intellectual honesty or curiosity or very little. I do want to I'm gonna swing for Edmund Burke here there are very important institutions and the media is one of them and I think Trump is doing what he can to destabilize and Limit the the media's influence and I'm I am kind of worried about that I'm here because he's when it becomes the enemy of the people that's that's a pillar of American society That's really important. He's kind of kicking at it and we have yeah, and we do highlight that Whenever he says something make some sort of a comment saying, you know, maybe we should take away their credentials or whatever We do point that out. I mean It's encouraging that he hasn't taken any steps so far. It just seems to be talking right Trump is talking I mean, I'm I'm with you. I mean I'm part of the you know journalists For the First Amendment movement, which is mainly people on the left. I will stand for everybody's right I don't care who you are if you if you are if you are Publishing stuff you have a right to publish it No voice should be silenced I'm very uncomfortable with what the president says and I was very uncomfortable with what the last president did to Journalists they both are off the charts bad one says it the other one was doing it Press didn't care when Obama was doing it. They do some did very few but some did But they all care now and I am concerned not only about the mainstream press Which I think is on its last gasp anyway. It's so discredited itself. It doesn't need Donald Trump to do it But I'm also concerned about the new media. I mean there's 800 800 voices were silenced on Facebook just last week 800 who are these people what why were they de-platformed? What are the what are the rules that we're getting you de-platform is there is? Are we being are we being put behind a wall with? Algorithms and kept in a digital ghetto. I think we are there is Real danger to freedom of speech and freedom of the press and we all left and right should stand together and say knock it off So did you watch college football this weekend by chance a little bit? I'm more of an NFL guy But I'm doing a little bit so there was an interesting moment in the Arkansas old miss game and Glenn I actually wanted to get your take I'm I'm hijacking the blaze why by the way This is for hashtag the blaze why which I'm going to tweet out this video later today with this hashtag the blaze Why but Glenn I wanted to get your take on it just for the theatrics of it I wanted to see what you would rate this performance. Let's watch All right, so We've got him getting knocked over and oh Again, right just to tap oh he fall. Oh my gosh wait. Oh gosh. He can't get his balance Isn't that amazing? Well, it's probably that red devil there on the Green Park. It's not a devil Being the the token or least most libertarian here I think there's a part of my brain that just doesn't get teams like I have it I went to a football game with my dad when I was in college and I did it a couple times till you quit asking me to Bring a book and I like I started clapping. They're like, what the hell are you doing? I'm like the guy ran really fast like he's on the other team. I was like, I don't understand Really fast. All their addresses actually they can give a different helmet. So you can tell very easily you'll have to look for that next time What's the one with the brown costumes? There's so bad Cleveland Browns is it the Cleveland Browns? Oh, have you seen their costumes? They're awful. This is a Alright, so today's poll.
