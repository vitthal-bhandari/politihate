    "text": " On this episode of Newt's World, Jesse Kelly has written a new book, The Anti-Communist Manifesto, and he discusses the daily assault Americans are facing on our freedoms from the insidious Communist movement in this country. From weaponizing race, sex, and gender, to hijacking our schools, communism threatens to destroy our cherished American way of life. The Communist has turned every American institution to a battlefield, from local school boards to corporate boardrooms and beyond. Jesse lays out a realistic plan to retake America, institution by institution. He is one of the most entertaining and fearless conservatives in America. I'm really pleased to welcome my guest Jesse Kelly. He is a U.S. Marine veteran, a former Congressional candidate, and host premier networks the Jesse Kelly show and first TVs. I'm right with Jesse Kelly. Jesse welcome and thank you for joining me on Newt's World. Shoot, it's an honor for me to be here. It's an honor to sit and get to gab with Newt Gingrich for a little while. That works for me. Well, that's great. Well, you joined the Marine Corps back in the year 2000 and on 9-11 you were watching the towers fall from inside your barracks and later you deployed to Iraq as an infantry Marine during the second Persian Gulf War and you received an honorable discharge after four years. What was that like to be in the Marines? And of course, as they say, once you're a Marine, you're always a Marine. So tell us about the feeling of being a Marine. I had always grown up with this super admiration of all military service like a lot of young boys do. I was always playing with toy guns. And then when I got old enough, it were real guns and I was always pretending I was John Wayne out in the woods hunting things. I would read military books and Marine Corps books. It was always something I admired. It was never something I really aspired to do to be quite frank. And then I graduated high school. I went to college for one year at Montana State University and I got a 0.0 grade point average my first semester. And I obviously had a good time. But at the end of that year, I thought to myself, I have a lot of growing up I need to do. I didn't necessarily like what I was looking at in the mirror. So I decided, you know what? I didn't ask my parents. I didn't talk to anybody. I walked right down to the Marine Corps recruiting office and walked in and said, I'm signing up. I want to be in the infantry. I was the easiest recruit. That guy ever got. And so I joined boot camp all those things. And then 9-11, I'll never forget that day. Everyone has a story about where they were that day. We were out on PT working out as what civilians have called. We were out working out. We're doing PT. And then we got back and we're out in front of our barracks and we're stretching, just post workout stretching. A bizarre order came down that we'd never had before. Get up to your barracks room and turn on the TV. We'd never heard that before. We're, what? Why? We were upstairs. And I remember it like it was yesterday. There was 10 of us probably at least in this one barracks room. All sweaty, crowded around. We turned on the television and one of the towers had been hit. And we were confused because we had been out. We thought, why are we here watching this? Why did some idiot accidentally fly a plane into the tower? We thought it was an accident. And then we watched live like so many did when the second one came in and then we watched the towers fall. And I wasn't the only one with tears coming down my face. I was ready to go kill people after that. From there, we ended up in Iraq and the rest is history, I guess you should say. What are the lessons you took from Iraq? That our government's garbage, that we have a lot of wonderful people in the Marine Corps and I was honored to serve with them, that we can't fix problems around the world the way we've always thought we can. All forms of government are not made for all kinds of people. Some people are not simply ready for democracy or republic or whatever we want to call it. They're not ready and that our government lies. We're a real big lesson I took from Iraq, not that I'm some anti-war pacifist or anything like that. But we were understandably very proud to be there. We were flying our American flags because this was at the very beginning of the war. We were in Kuwait and George Bush declared war and then boom, into the country we go and we're going up through Iraq. When we were flying our flags, a bunch of very patriotic young Marines and I will never forget when the order came down from the Bush administration, who knows who it came from, probably wasn't Bush himself, but the order came down that we were to take down our American flags and we were not allowed to fly them anymore. And you've never seen a group of Marines be disheartened that quickly. We looked around at each other thinking to ourselves, wait, what? I'm here risking my life, fighting for my country and I'm not allowed to fly the flag because some Iraqi may be offended by it. That was the most revealing moment of my life. That's when I learned a lot about this place. It strikes me that that was sort of the beginning of the sellout of our core values. You leave the core. Do you then go immediately to Arizona? I do. I come from a construction family. Look, I'm poor white trash. I come from a construction family. My grandpa did construction in Ohio. My dad did construction after him in Ohio. They moved us to Montana. My folks did when I was 10 and my old man went right back into construction. I did construction before the Marines just in a ditch with a shovel in my hands. But my folks had started a construction company about the time I joined the Marines. They moved it to Arizona when I was in the Marines and I was going back to work construction. That's just what I was going back to do. So I got out, went right down to Arizona, started going to community college on the GI bill. Wasn't doing that great mentally. I was pretty fresh back from Iraq. I was okay, but a very angry young man. You're going to community college, working construction and just kind of living my life. Because I was traveling so much, I started doing a lot more reading than I had been doing and listened to a lot more talk. Radio and things like that. I started to get political about that time. As you're doing that, you got very political. In 2010, I mean, you ran for an election to Congress and you actually won the Republican primary. Was that your first time to be a candidate? It was my first involvement in politics of any kind ever. I was completely unknown. Nobody knew who I was. I'd never been involved in politics. I wasn't frankly political before that. I saw Barack Obama was running. I knew about that guy's marks his background and I knew his plans for this place and that they were not good and I got really mad about it. I made an impulsive, stupid decision as I often do. I just decided I was going to run for Congress and I ended up running against a well established state senator that the more establishment type Republicans threw in there against me. Ended up winning that primary pretty solidly and then I went up against Gabrielle Giffords. This is right before she got shot. I lost to her by only about 4,000 votes. They had to recount everything, took them about a week to recount it all. So I lost but it was close. I was that close to being in Congress. Thank God that didn't work out. Well, I don't know. We might have needed your courage and your outspokenness. You came back and bounced though and ran again in the 2023 special election. What was that like? I did. I came back. I ran in the special. I won the primary again but I was running against Ron Barber. He had been Giffords chief of staff and he had also gotten shot. A lot of people don't remember this. He got shot when she got shot. Now thankfully his injuries weren't as severe as hers were but he was coming off freshly off of getting shot in an international incident, internationally known incident. So he blew my doors off. I think I lost by four or five points and that was it for me. So you only signed on to do a one hour show on 950K PRC in Houston. But then that gets expanded to a two hour show. Then you have the Jesse Kelly show which is a three hour program on national syndication on 6 to 9pm Eastern. I mean what's it like to do a daily radio show? You know, Newt, I'll be honest with you. I shake my head every day that this is what I do for a living because as I explained, I didn't come up in the media or anything like this. When I was done running for office and done in politics, I was out of work and broke. I ended up looking for a job. I was selling RVs in Texas. I found a job on Craigslist and advertisement. They were looking for RV salesmen. I had never sold RVs or sold anything in my life but I thought I'd probably do that and maybe make a little money. Went and signed up. Went and applied. Became an RV salesman. Got promoted to sales manager and they moved me. I was living in a Dallas area at the time. They moved me down to the Houston area because they opened some megastore and they wanted me to be a sales manager down here. Michael Berry is a big conservative talk show host in the Houston area. He's also naturally syndicated but he's the king of this area. He ends up seeing something I write on social media on Twitter. This is about five, six years ago. He reaches out and he says, hey, you want to come on my show? Be a guest. We were talking about McCain. It was something about my congressional run. So I went on his show. I killed, I guess. He kept me on for a long time and then he called me that night when I was on the way home from work just to get to know me. And we ended up getting to be really good friends and he told me this is about five years ago, hey, I think you could be really special at a media career if you wanted to give it a shot. Well, I kind of scoffed at that. It piqued my interest. Long story short, he ends up getting me a one hour at night show on the local station. As you just mentioned, one hour, seven to eight p.m. at night. So okay, I'm thrilled to be there, but it's not a huge show. Then like you said, it turns into two hours. Then about a year and a half into it, a national syndication company, key networks, signs me up and I'm on in like 10, 15 cities. And then about a year after that, the biggest national syndication company in the world, premier networks, calls me. This is after rush past. They called because the six to nine spot nationwide was open and they said, we've been listening, but I didn't know anyone was listening. And we decided you're the guy. This is about two years ago. So I just kind of fell backwards into all this stuff completely locked out. How much time does it take you every day to prepare? Oh, nude. I don't prepare. That's what smart people like you do. I just kind of sit down and my producers throw a bunch of articles in front of me and it's kind of do most of the show off the top of my head. I do a TV show every day to at nine p.m. Eastern time. So it's actually four hours of media every day. And I say I don't prepare. Maybe that's not totally accurate. I have topics that pique my interest every day. As soon as I'm passionate about something and I know I want to talk about it, I'll send that article over to my producers so they'll have it printed out in front of me. And most of the time I frankly don't read the article. It's just a concept I want to talk about. I talk more about concepts and the why and where we're going than more than specific stories read a headline and react to it, if that makes sense. I know that's more traditional talk radio stuff headline react headline react. I just always kind of thought that was boring and didn't really want to do a show like that. So I joke around a lot and then we talk about concepts on my show. Hi, this is Newt and my new book March the majority, the real story of the Republican revolution. I offer strategies and insights for everyday citizens and for seasoned politicians. It's both a guide for political success and for winning back the majority in 2024. March the majority outlines the 16 year campaign to write the contract with America, explains how we elected the first Republican house majority in 40 years and how we worked with President Bill Clinton to pass major reforms, including four consecutive balance budgets. The majority tells the behind the scenes story of how we got it done. Go to gingwish360.com and order your copy now. Order today at gingwish360.com slash book. Jesse, why did you decide to write the anti-communist manifesto? Well, I am an anti-communist. I don't call myself a conservative or a libertarian or a nationalist. I am an anti-communist first and foremost because unless these people are defeated, none of the rest of the stuff matters. They have to be defeated first. And I talk about anti-communism all the time, how we're not near aggressive enough with these people. We're not taking the threat that they pose to us nearly serious enough, not even close. And I talk about this all the time. And I had been approached a few years ago to write a book, hey, we write a book. And I had always said no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Because the honest truth is I hate writing. I despise it. I don't mind. Obviously love talking on the radio. I love doing TV. And there are some people who are just, they want to sit down and they write. If you told me I had to do a three hour radio show right now, Newt, I don't think my heart rate would jump up at all. It would be, oh, nice. Okay, let's do some radio. But if you, Newt Gingrich told me I needed to sit down and write a thousand words, just a thousand words, I would get that feeling in the pit of my stomach like a lot of people do when they have to give a speech in front of people or something. That's how much I hate writing. But I am extremely passionate about anti-communism. I mean it all the way. I see what is happening in this country. And finally about a year ago, they approached me and they said, hey, I know you don't want to write a book. What if you wrote a book just about anti-communism? Just about opposing these people and taking these people on. And I didn't even hesitate. I hadn't thought of it. But I said to myself, oh my gosh, instantly, yes, I'm in. That is the one I will write. I don't know that I will ever write another one, but that book I will write. And here we are. What did you learn in the process of writing? A couple of things. One, we talk about how they lie all the time. Whatever people choose to call them. I mean, you can call them leftists or liberals or honestly Democrats today, but they really are just communists at heart. That's what they are. It's not just that they lie. It's how often and how honest they are with each other about the need to lie. Now because so much of the book, as you pointed out, I break down different issues that people won't recognize on their surface as being blatant communism today, the LGBTQ stuff and the Black Lives Matter stuff and things like that. But I went into the history of so much of it and then what it looks like in the modern era and then how we combat it with each issue. But the history portion was the most fascinating for me because these people back in the day, it was letters. They would write letters back and forth to each other or pen articles. And it was always the basis of all of it was we can't let them know what we're doing. We have to be careful about this. Hey, we have to make sure we word this right so we don't know what we're doing. It's such a despicable religion. Communism is so destructive. It's so horrible that from the very beginning, from Lenin to now, it's all. It's always been lied about and they know it has to be lied about. I don't have to lie about any of the policies I want. You may disagree with them, but that's fine, but I don't have to lie to you about them. It is the basis of their religion that they must hide what they're doing. And they are so open with each other about that. No, no, no. Yeah, you're not lying enough. Hey, you need to lie more. Hey, we got to keep that quiet. Hey, let's make sure they don't find out. You see this manifested today with every dirtball teacher you see a video of talking about how they're going to try to tell your young son to change his gender behind your back and don't tell your parents. We won't let your parents know what we're doing. It's all about deception at all times and that hit me hard. I knew they were liars. I didn't know how honest they were about it. What made you decide to use the word communism, which is a very strong, very compelling word? One, that's what they are. Two, the value of labels is lost on the right and it is not lost on the communists. Pause for a moment and think about how many Democrats in the United States of America, and there's all kinds of polling data out there. How many Democrats in the United States of America believe that they are opposing Nazis or white supremacists or both or some combination of the two? The percentage is staggering. That's something like 60, 70% believe that there are Nazi white supremacists. They're opposing. I've never met a Nazi or a white supremacist. Am I 41 years on the planet? Do they exist? Oh, yeah, I'm sure they do. It's always five dirtballs in a clan outfit on the courthouse steps in Kentucky surrounded by 500 people who want to kill them. So they've taken something that doesn't even exist at all and convinced their side that that's what they're opposing. And they did it for a very smart reason. They got their people in the right mindset. So these people on the left today, they feel like they are fighting the forces of evil and that they are the force of good because they know they're up against Nazis and Hitler. And meanwhile, on the right, we try to baby step our people into it and try to use the nicest terms humanly possible for these demons. Oh, he's left leaning by his kind of liberal. Why? He's just a Democrat type thing. And therefore our people are not in the right mindset. Mindset leads to action. Our people think they're in the friendly game of cribbage and their people think they're fighting World War II. So who's going to win that? And plus they are communists. This is something again, I write about this in the book. They were very purposeful about this too. Communism has taken a different form in every country it's ever been. And the Soviet Union, it was the urban poor. And then the Soviets, when they were exporting it to China, they were yelling at Mao and his friends saying, Hey, you got to focus on the urban poor and Mao would yell back and say, No, you're an idiot. It's not like that here. We don't have Mao-contented urban poor. We have Mao-contented rural poor. We have to focus on the rural poor here. It looked different in Cambodia. Here this took place about the sixties and seventies. The communists were frustrated with their inability for it to catch on here because they kept going for the workers, whether they be urban or rural. Let's go to the workers. Let's go to the workers. And it never caught on because our workers have a great standard of living in this country. Well, communism is not about workers or any of this stuff. Communism is just the religion of the malcontent. That's it. You're looking for any society's malcontents. You find them. You weaponize them to break the society apart. We didn't have miserable workers here. They decided to shift it and make it cultural. That's why they infiltrated the civil rights movement because we understandably had a lot of black people who weren't that pleased with America at the time. That's why they focused so much on all the end of this LGBTQ stuff. That's why they focus on climate stuff. We have malcontents in these area. Feminists, you find them out contents when you use them like water to break up a rock. You pour it into the cracks in the rock. You freeze it. You break up the strongest rock possible. That's what communism is. So, you talk at length about the communist role in education. Walk us through that. How do you see the degree to which they've taken over the school systems and the universities? What's the most valuable thing they ever took over by a mile? And frankly, everything else we see now that frustrates us, it's all downstream of them taking over the education system. Anyone in warfare understands that supply lines are everything. What's that old saying that amateur study tactics and professional study logistics? Supply lines are everything. Well, there are four million new college graduates every year and three million of them are card carrying communists because the communists realized they needed to take over the education system in the country. That's the first thing they went after. And I go over the history of that too in the book. They took it over. And what they do is they soft sell it at first. Now, they're getting harder about it these days, but they soft sell it at first. You don't have a third grade history teacher up there teaching his kids that America sucks. That's not what he's doing. He's going to present history to them. Okay. So, what is American history? It's American history this year. We're going to teach little Johnny about, well, of course, we're going to have to teach you about the genocide of the Native Americans. That was really horrendous. And then, of course, America is slavery. We'll do a couple months on slavery. We'll do 15 minutes on the Constitution, but a couple months on slavery. And then we move right from that into segregation and up what you look at that the school year is up out of time class. Anyway, that's what America is. So they start early on teaching kids that America sucks, America sucks, America sucks. And by the time these kids graduate from college, these kids are not college kids. The way we look at them now, we kind of roll our eyes and scoff at them, they are weaponized communist foot soldiers. And they have always been, it's always been the young people. Maus Redgard, what the Camarou's used. It was 14 and 15 year olds beating people to death under Pol Potts regime. We look at kids and how they've been weaponized. And we dismiss them because of their age or because they have noodle arms. We should not. They've been trained. The communist goes after them for a reason. Lenin talked about it. Give me four years of your nation's youth and all own everything. It's paraphrasing, but that's pretty much what he said. The kids are where it's at. Why do you think they're in Disney? Why do you think they're in Nickelodeon these days? Why do you think they're telling your daughter to chop her breasts off when she's 14 years old? They want to break your children away from you and break them emotionally because that's how the recruitment process begins. How did conservatives or just everyday normal people? How did they so totally lose control of the universities? It's human nature. I'm hard on the right a lot, Newt, because I don't think they did enough to stop this and we still don't take it seriously enough. At the same time, I am sympathetic because it is human nature to ignore the real threat until it's too late. That's just human beings will deny the reality of something dangerous until it's too late. The communists originally didn't own everything. When you go through the history of it, which I do a lot of that, you see how they were just the street radicals first. They were in a couple of unions, in a couple of teachers unions, a couple of journalists, and eventually they worked their way into the administration of these universities. That's what they do so well. The communists seize the choke points. They seize choke points. This is what I mean. You will see some child drag show somewhere in some blood red area, Oklahoma, some small town in Oklahoma, 99% Republican, and all of a sudden there's a child drag show and everyone's mad about it. No one understands how that happens. Well, I've dug into these things and I'm telling you how it happens every time. The communist understands he's a minority in that little Oklahoma town. He understands that, but he's not worried about majority or percentages. He's worried about power. What he'll do is he'll find the choke points of that town. Yeah, he's a minority, but he's going to go down and become the city manager. He's going to become the public librarian. He's going to find the choke points of power and that's why he will force his will on an area where he's outnumbered. They did the same thing in the universities. That's where they seize the administration and then they only were hiring these card-carrying communists into the administration. Many of them communist terrorists, I might point out. I write about this in the book too. We talk about these weather underground guys killing cops and bombing things. These people that didn't end up spending their lives in prison, they're spending their lives teaching your child at the expense of university you're sending them to. They all got professorships in the end. So we took these communists, many communist terrorists. They got the administration. They started bringing these people into the university system at the same time, purging anyone who doesn't think like that. And the right was just blissfully unaware because we were rolling our eyes because they're just college kids or we use that old line and as much as I love Churchill, I hate this freaking line that, well, if he's under 30 and not a liberal, he has no heart, he's fees over 30 and not a conservative, he has no brain. That's insane. The communists doesn't think like that at all. You don't have to be a liberal when you're under 30. You just have to have been taught properly. But we've kind of dismissed it as well. Once they get a paycheck, they'll come around. They're not coming around. They're now in the corporate boardrooms, rubbing it in your face every single day that it didn't come around. They kept moving their way up through society and now they have all the institutions. You also talk about how we respond to all this. How do you rally the country to take its own country back? One we have to acknowledge the threat and that is something we still have not done. We're slowly waking up, but that's the first and foremost until you know what you're dealing with and acknowledge what you're dealing with, you can't begin. But then we think about this wrongly. I understand why this is the right has a severe, savior complex. We want somebody to come fix it. Somebody get Trump elected again. He'll fix it. Rhonda Santas. So fix it all. Let's just get Rhonda Santas in there. When that's insane, it's too rotted. It's too corrupt. No one person can fix it, but you can protect and preserve your community. We're starting to see this around the country where people are taking back school boards. They're taking back city councils. They're taking back board of supervisors. We are in this for a decades long fight. It will not come from Washington, D.C. It will come locally. Seize your community first, protect your community first, and then we'll expand out from there. That's what they did. They didn't begin in Washington, D.C. They took over every school board in the country. That's why your child, you think you're growing up in blood red America and your child comes home one day with pink hair and thinks he's a woman because you didn't realize they took over the school boards and you're not protected. We need to take them back and we can. There's all kinds of easy wins. There's so much soft underbelly with the communists in this country, but we don't acknowledge it and we don't fight like we can win it. We think about the presidency and that's what will fix it all. When that's ridiculous, you know what? Give them the presidency for a hundred more years. If you give me all the school boards and I'll win in the end. I used to say that Ronald Reagan defeated communism and Moscow but lost to it in the United States. It's very sadly a hundred percent true and people should also understand that the Soviets were very, very smart about this and they were very purposeful about this. It's not the Soviets anymore. Obviously courtesy of Reagan, the Chinese handle a lot of this now and now it's mostly Americans who do it to other Americans. Most of these people don't even know that's what they are. They don't know their communists. They don't have any idea. But the Soviets knew they would not be able to defeat us economically, probably not be able to defeat us militarily, but they saw a real soft underbelly in this country of malcontents and they went after them. They're very purposeful about this. There's several great books out now of KGB files where they describe in detail how they would infect and infiltrate the West. That's just what happened to us and the average American shouldn't feel bad. About that you don't have to be happy but that happens. It's very difficult to fight against something like that, especially if leadership doesn't realize it and pounce on it immediately. We just kind of got infiltrated while we weren't looking. That's the problem. One last area I wanted to talk about. You have a fascinating section on the parallels of destroying monuments between the Soviet takeover of Russia and what's been happening in the US. Can you sort of expand on that? Sure. This is something the communist needs to do. He does it very, very well. I kind of use this example a little bit in my book. But if I showed up at your house tonight, Newt, I'm not going to do that, don't worry. But if I showed up at your house tonight and I wanted to burn your house to the ground, you would not let me. Now, why? What do you care that much? It's just boards and dry walls and things like that. But your home is more than that to you. Your home is, oh, that's where I sit with my wife. That's where the kids open Christmas gifts. This is, oh, look, we used to play with the dog back here. You are moored. You are tied to your home. And that's why it's a home. And therefore you wouldn't let somebody destroy it. But if I can unmore you from that home, then you'll be more apt to let me destroy it. You might help me do it. That's what you're seeing the communists do right now in this country. Lenin and Stalin did it. Mao was tearing up the graves of Confucius and tearing down the Buddhist temples. Everywhere the communist has gone, he has renamed things. He has torn down monuments because he's trying to unmore the people from their nation so they will let him destroy it and remake their nation. Today, you can't find two elected Republicans who will defend having a Confederate statue up of Robert E. Lee because they don't want to be called Ray, sister, feel icky. If you cannot articulate why you shouldn't let them tear down a statue of Robert E. Lee, you're not ready to take these people on. They don't care about Robert E. Lee. They don't care about the Confederacy. They don't care about slavery. They sure as heck don't care about black people. They care about burning your country to ash and they understand the Confederacy as one of those things that's so uncomfortable for people to defend that you won't. So you'll let them get their foot in the door and the next thing you know, they're removing a Teddy Roosevelt statue from New York City, which is exactly what they did. They don't care about the things they tell you to care about. They care about burning everything down, but we don't approach it that way. To this day, you'll get every weenie Republican senator. Well, I mean, I would never was a fan of Robert E. Lee as if he's totally oblivious to what's happening right now. It's not about the Confederacy. It's about destroying all of your history and they've done it effectively. I don't know if you've been recently, but my son just went on a field trip for school. He went to Mount Vernon. You cannot believe how much they have destroyed the legacy of all the founders of this country from Jefferson to Washington. He went to Jefferson's home. Just right everyone wrap your mind around this. He went to Jefferson's home. He saw tons of references to the slaves Jefferson had to slavery, all kinds of things. There was not one thing about the declaration of independence which Jefferson wrote at Jefferson's home. That's what they do. And that's why they start with Robert E. Lee. They're trying to break your history away from you. Don't let them nations have histories, all of them. Good history, bad history, all of them. Keep it. You make a very, very compelling case.
