    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel Glantz and welcome back fellow patriots solid independent conservatives and all around common sense Americans to the conservative review podcast here on this fine Thursday August the 29th yes summer is almost over that dreaded September session of Congress is almost back in play and there is a lot that will be going on next week so you're going to want to tune into conservative review.com to get all your written content this show to get your video and audio content subscribe to our YouTube page as well our Twitter account at RM conservative and at CR for the conservative review Twitter account because we don't even know what it is to be a conservative and that's literally what this show is conservative review and I just want to preface this show we're gonna have a special guest on today before we talk about the most grotesque form of social transformation without representation continuing our show from two days ago about this case of a federal judge 9th Circuit of course in Idaho forcing the state or attempting to force the state not that they have such power tending to force the state to engage in what could only be described as castration operations for those requesting it in prison there's nothing broader going on I first feel there's a need to define what is conservatism what is it we're conserving and I would say very simply what it is we're trying to conserve is our way of life our sovereignty our security our society and our system of government the four S's right there sovereignty security society system and included in that is very simple most of most of us and I would say even a lot of people that don't consider themselves conservatives live conservative lives in the respect that they want government to essentially leave them alone especially nowadays with technology the internet the markets work well when you let them work let me have my job don't over tax and over regulate me I'm not asking for a handout but what I want from you is the core functions of government to keep a safe and secure at a local level local state level dealing with domestic violence and crime at a federal level dealing with external problems the border illegal immigration we don't hate anyone we welcome everyone but we just don't want a fundamental transformation of neighborhoods and communities and cities with cultures that are very foreign to ours in large numbers you know just today there is a sixth arrest in an illegal alien rape case in Montgomery County Maryland where the individual was doing stuff to a 12 year old and he said well that's culturally a joke in El Salvador and I hate to say it but the guy as creepy as he is is not a hundred percent wrong about that you know one of the things I have here in my book stolen sovereignty Theodore Sedgwick he said his follows when they were talking about the first naturalization law and this is about immigration but it's really what we're gonna talk about today is not immigration for once it's more broad it's what is America and he said the citizens of America preferred this country because it is to be preferred and he raised doubts about bringing in so many people from Europe out of the fear that their sensations impregnated with prejudices of education acquired under a monarchial and aristocratic governments may deprive them of that zest for what for pure republicanism pure republicanism they wanted to preserve that that's what we're conserving our traditional values Judeo-Christian ethos of America not that everyone even that needs to be that religious or religious at all but the notion that we're going to fundamentally transform our values our demographics and just an unnatural way again security sovereignty leave our markets free have a sane rational foreign policy where we rigor define and then rigorously defend our interests home and abroad and do it fully and then conserve our military for where it's not needed and don't get involved in areas where it's not needed there's a lot more to say but that's essentially what we're trying to conserve and what we're gonna do the most grotesque form of social transformation and often without representation being done by unelected bodies of government is this so-called transgender agenda you know it started off with the redefinition of marriage words have no meaning institutions have no meaning how suddenly a court could redefine what a marriage is and now we have an endless effort to redefine what a human being is a man's a woman a woman's a man and for people who accuse us of having a war on women because we don't want taxpayer funded abortifacients or birth control that's funded by the taxpayer when you could buy it for free or you know 20 bucks a pop I mean it's not a big deal but that's considered a war on women if you don't treat women like men that's a war on women in their mind today's show is gonna be about the ultimate war on women which is invading who they are you know we said the other day when we talked about the border one of the dictionary definitions of is of invasion is when you you impersonate someone as if you're that person you're not it's actually termed it an invasion the personal invasion is for a man to say he's a woman this is not just illogical and insane it's extremely destructive in many areas of society and Republicans as you well know on a federal and even state level and even in red states are not really pushing back so I want to see if this case in Idaho which should be the reddest of red states where we have a court now saying that a man says I want to be a woman I want to be placed in a female prison and I want my you know what chopped off and for taxpayers to do it are the Idaho Republicans gonna finally draw a line in the sand and stand up this with us today is a very special guest Barbara Ehart is a state representative in the state of Idaho she's in the state house elected from Idaho Falls she served for four years in the city council there and then very importantly to our discussion today that I want to want to broaden up a little bit she worked for 15 years as a basketball coach for women's division one basketball and certainly understands this war on women taking place at the hands of this just radical source funded movement de-civilization agenda to just dehumanize what a woman is and all of its effects certainly on sports as we're gonna talk about so with no further ado it's our pleasure to welcome for the first time to the conservative review Barbara Ehart hey Barbara thanks for joining us today hi Daniel hey thanks thanks so much for having me I appreciate it glad to be here well thanks for listening through my blabbering I really want to turn over the show to you now could you give us just a state of play as to what you and your fellow Republicans the legislature the governor are doing in light of the Ninth Circuit ruling that a man is a woman and you must pay to engage in the most grotesque procedures at the BS of someone who is mentally ill not just mentally ill but he was convicted of child molest right right well as soon as this case had come to light and we had heard that Judge Winle was you know had granted this okay initially as Republican legislators we were all banding and speaking in and wanted to let the governor know that we wanted and wanted hopefully wanted to stand with him and saying no this was not right and our governor took a hard stance also so we we feel at this point we're there to support him I know we have other legislators they had initially organized the petition to let it to get legislators on board to know let him know that he had support from the legislature the I know another legislature legislator has a resolution prepared others or we have attorneys who are continuing to look into the law and hopefully will our attorney General Lawrence Watson will hopefully stand strong and and push this hard as we proceed forward but no this is not something we want it is a grotesque abuse of powers and misrepresentation complete misrepresentation of the Eighth Amendment very sad very sad no sure and certainly one of the things I feel for you guys in a state like Idaho is that you work so hard to try to maintain what we spoke about at the beginning of the show just traditional values we don't want anything from anyone we're not trying to shove our way of life on anyone we just don't want to be fundamentally transformed and then lo and behold you're placed under the auspices of the Ninth Circuit and they do this stuff all the time so the left they either win where they can and where they can't they get the courts to extend their long reach which has been elongated so you know is there any sense among your colleagues that at some point a state needs to stand up at some point a federal judge a federal judge could put a negative on a positive action of a state they want to criminally convict a guy and they vacate the conviction that's judicial power but to place a positive on a negative you must go out and engage in this mutilation operation is there some understanding that hey you know that's a bridge too far well I believe that there is and I cannot tell you how excited and I think that's the word that we are to stand with governor little and we want him to stand strong and I think he's going to stand strong he knows that this is not an Idaho value this is not something that we support you know the interesting things when it comes to courts it certainly happened in Idaho and I know it happens in other states what the other side will oftentimes do when it comes to issues like this and as a group as legislators as we decide whether or not to push something like this forward as a governor makes that decision then the question always comes hey that's gonna cost a lot of taxpayer dollars in order to fight and defend that so then the push is oh hey let's not do it it's gonna happen anyway it's going to be it's going to cost taxpayer dollars and I see it in the states all over the place except like Texas where they have a fantastic attorney general who fights back but they they cower and they use that thread and that stigma of having used taxpayer dollars supposedly being Republican and that that's not how we are fiscally conservative I disagree I believe that right now it's our social issues that are systematically changing who we are what we are and not just who we are what we are but what we've always been this you know I'm a big Stephen Covey fan seven habits for highly successful people one of the things Covey defines and most people don't look at it this way but he defines the difference between a principal and a value and values as he says it can be a group of thieves can share a set of values because they they come and go they're they're kind of fly by night but principles are long-standing tested through time ideals that have proven to work and so Idaho right now needs to stand strong on traditional principles that have proven to work through time I know right now we have legislators who are willing to do it and I really believe Governor Little is prepared to stand and I hope Lawrence Wozden our attorney general is willing to stand also that that's good to hear because again if it's not done in a state like Idaho it will not be done anywhere else I mean that is just a reality I'm just reading this from yesterday it's unbelievable W.B.Z. for in Boston a convicted killer this guy killed killed his wife in 1990 in Massachusetts he's sitting in Massachusetts prisons and this guy calls himself Michelle Kosselick and he's demanding and suing the you know prison commissioner to do the exact same thing for gender affirmation surgery wow boys that or or well in and wants to be transferred to a women's facility and they're taking them to the lower court that's the first circuit which is pretty liberal maybe not quite as liberal as the ninth but you know this stuff is really percolating what concerns me is you know it's not just that taxpayer funding there there's something much bigger going on here it's it's the beginning Genesis it gets back to the foundation of the foundation God created Adam then he didn't create Steve he created Eve he said let us make woman and the idea was that the beauty of a woman is that it's something she has something distinct from a man because if she's not then there is no woman and there is no nothing distinct about womanhood what what they are seeking to do is in multiple different levels eradicate that difference and if you know you can have certain anarchist movements that prop up over time where they're kind of silly but they're not that destructive if I say look I'm a I self-identify as a killer whale and I want to sit in water all day okay whatever but if you have a group of people that are very serious about that there are logistical and then often dangerous problems that arise from that and in this case if you know women are not men just yesterday I saw a story we had at Blaze.com our sister website where a rape and shelter facility for battered women in Vancouver was defaced with trans power paraphernalia because they were upset that they weren't accepting men with a you know what between their legs to walk into that facility which was primarily created as a safe space which they like to talk about from abuse at the hands of males. What is going on here? And that story that kind of story actually is popping up more and more it's there you know this idea that you can force on us that what you want to do however you want to feel this fluid gender this fluid identity it's screwy it will be destructive and is destructive to society and watching this also play out I sit on the house education committee and starting to see this pop up we're not just pop up it's prevalent in most of the states and it's something that we're trying to fight here in Idaho. I too wanted the comments and I know you had known this that had concerned me when we had our Idaho inmate wanting his surgery that then he would be transferred to the female facility and that's not right that's simply not right I don't care if they're in prison or not it is not right to place a man in the path of a woman you I don't I don't even care how many drugs you take you will always have the DNA of a man you will always have the advantages that men have and and it's simply not right and like you I this is one area that I refuse to to just accept him forward. So I want to get back to education because that's that the root of this but just you mentioned the advantage so look I I'd be remiss to have you on the show and not talk about this you coach division one women's basketball for 15 years. This is from two days ago. Let's run calm. Okay. They call this dude June Eastwood. Okay. Steps on to the start line of the clash of the inland Northwest was right next to you. I'm cross country meet on Saturday morning in Cheney Washington she will make history Eastwood a senior at the University of Montana will become the fastest distance runner and they say this very blissfully like you know with a serious face become the fastest distance runner driver compete in the NCAA division one women's race. In fact it won't even be close Eastwood's personal best in the 800 meters is 155 23 that's almost four seconds faster than the collegiate record of 159 10 and then they go on to say his personal best in the 1500s 315 19 Jenny Simpson's collegiate record unchallenged for a decade is almost 10 seconds slower and you know they're kind of like that's kind of cool. What do you have to say about that? Yes I did I spent 15 years coaching division one basketball I also played division one basketball at Idaho State I was at UC Santa Barbara BYU Washington State and then it's a head coach at Cal State Fullerton and I'm telling you what this will be the end of women's sports it is absolutely 100% not fair for boys and men to take the places of girls and women in sports right now I know that the other side is trying to redefine what title nine men but title nine had some real meaning and as you like to say words have meaning many women who went before me and many of them were gay women fought hard to be able to give girls and women's women opportunities in sports people like me continued the fight much discrimination was faced along the way and I won't get into that whole conversation but we put a lot out there in order to continue to create opportunities which when you're talking federal dollars when federal dollars are being spent on boys and men then those same federal dollars should be spent on girls and women and we should if we start spending and using those federal dollars for boys who want to pretend to be women then we will lose the whole point of title nine title nine was about opportunities for girls and women in sports period we all know that but to try to reduce some revisionist history it's sad because the revision the revisionist history is taking place not just right here in sports and trying to make gender fluid it's happening with a very foundation of our country and and we do have to openly and vocally push back and hopefully what I mean I believe more people feel as you feel that this isn't right but I think people are scared you see what happens sometimes when you take a stand Martina Navatrolova who I have admired for years even got to meet she was getting Colorado they're pre-gained pep talk before they played as it worked unfortunately but I was able to meet Martina Martina has been a phenomenal tennis player and an active advocate for the LGBT she came out I think was around March and spoke against this transgenderism and said that it wasn't fair it'd be cheating oh my goodness they all came down on Martina she adjusted her a statement a little to remove the word cheating but she still holds to at least unless she's changed something lately that it isn't right and it's not right and we need more women I think you're gonna see more women speak up who are actually on that side and and say this isn't right it'll be the downfall of women's sports and and again so you have sports and you could appreciate you know there's locker rooms there's showers there's there's closed spaces that are very sensitive and the notion that you could just say oh you know government has no role to play in defining anything I could define what I want well I mean what I find amazing is that we now live in a time where supposedly there's this awakening they call it a me too movement um where uh you know there was a lot of sexual assault kept under wraps and you know basic criminology everyone knows that you know most of them are not reported and very few rape cases are cleared it's only about you know 25% clearance rate according to FBI you know there's a big problem with that so to invite men to go into female bathrooms I just I just and and they're having this problem they're pushing it in the military too um so my concern is I am not seeing even in red states where they're pushing back against this in fact I'm seeing the left mobilized even in red states to push this decivilization agenda could you talk more broadly what you and some others are trying to do in Idaho to at least create some sort of safe space true safe space um for women well I've been exploring some things particularly in the world of sports uh you know I want I don't know how well pictures will show but you know here's one this is Gabrielle Lovewig this is just an example of a woman who did I mean a man who decided to be a woman and play on a women's basketball collegiate team and the size differentiation is enormous not just in height but in width um so again I don't think I think the average person knows that it really will take away from girls and women's in sports I know at the Montana case I also have heard the the there's huge whisperings and pushback but people are afraid to say anything because of uh you know the the mobilization of the left and yet I I plan to I plan to bring legislation to address this uh the other thing that where we really have to be cognizant of this push and that is in our schools as I said this past year I had worked on bringing some opt-in uh sex education opt-in that did not just deal with sex education but it was based on all sexuality this being taught and pushed in the schools and when you look at what's coming with the comprehensive sex education there's already lingering in most other states California of course being the extreme exception is as to where California right now has sex education in almost every course at every turn and the revisionist history is unbelievable but what I was trying to do is make it about consent not content that parents should have to opt in right now we have an opt out and most states have an opt out but our surrounding neighbors Utah Arizona Nevada they're all doing opt in and Utah has a phenomenal program on opting in but what it does Daniel is it basically places responsibility on the adult because right now you think about it with an opt out it's silly that means the teacher gives this opt out form to the child and the child has is responsible to take it home to the parent actually give it to the parent and then bring it back and that's even assuming that they decided they want to deal with their in case a parent wanted to opt him out and they were a little embarrassed that places all of the responsibility on the child the responsibility needs to be on the parents and the opt-in places all the responsibility on the parent between the teacher the educator and the parent and the conversation that goes there and right now with social media and all forms of communication parents can be communicated with in many vastly uh differing ways and they do it right now anyway they're whether it's a field trip good heavenly days i'm forbid that you forget to pay your lunch money you are being contacted 14 times a day until you get it paid so to to say that this is not possible it's extremely possible and we need to let parents know that which is occurring and put this decision-making process in the hands of the parents and so it's something that i'm working on it ran through the house quickly uh cleanly by party vote and it was um held up in the senate education as we got closer to the end of the session they weren't sure if we could get it through so we'll be working with the senators to bring that again wait you weren't sure if you can get it through i'm trying to look up here could you help me out on the orientation of the senate well i think oh gosh i should know this i think 25 to 6 republic is yeah i was going to say i think it's um 28 or 29 to 6 or 7 we have 35 senators okay so i'm just trying to get this straight here so so sex education um you're saying the status quo is that in a state like Idaho you need to push something to opt to for an opt-in to change the mentorship uh sex ed and it's being held up in the senate which see i'm at a loss of words because here in in the washington area on the national scene we're always hearing well republicans we can't do anything because we don't have 60 votes in the senate you know 60 percent margin so this is Idaho um and we're told you can't be a fiscal conservative anywhere so i got that message straight all 50 states medicaid expansion i'd hoe adopted that i i got that message you're not allowed to be a fiscal conservative anymore but i would think like you know you said the social values what is going on there and could you describe what sort of what do you mean by sex ed is taking place in i'd hoe that you want to um reform to me sex ed uh encompasses or it's sex ed and sexuality i use the word sexuality and i did that for a particular reason sex ed in itself uh we Idaho had been using through the health and welfare of program that was only rolled out to about 18 high schools nonetheless it could have been rolled out to more called reducing the risk it was an it was called an abstinence based program well let me just let you know that what's so interesting about this is the abstinence based program as with so many things they redefined that which abstinence meant and that was one of the first things that was so disturbing abstinence uh this abstinence based program meant that what you were to do is to when you engage in sexual activity you're supposed to engage in consistent and safe sexual activity so it was very misleading to a parent if a parent heard oh gosh yes we're we're going to be using an abstinence based program what do you think you're going to do it's going to literally be apps and abstinence program and so that was one of the first disconcerting things that we had found and we were trying to point out and change and i do believe we are getting it changed Daniel uh now though i have still following up as to that which it's going to be well we're replacing things with although i believe we can do things the eye to hallway let me tell you something else in this particular program yes oh i was going to say with this program now again not everybody had to do this but what once it was approved and it was in the system here are some of the things that this program abstinence based reducing the risk reported to teach this is from the teachers manual it normalizes sexual activity among teens and how does it do this this places children and i say children because high school is still children it put them in role playing situations and in these role playing situations they would they would have him doing something such as this and it didn't matter if it was same sex you know opposite they they role played it all and it says something such as you and your boyfriend or girlfriend have been going out for a while from the beginning you touched and kissed a lot and then you begin to touch and kiss more and you begin and you begin to get excited and they start to go over these scenarios that it normalized anal in a oral sex is it explain how this work it certainly explains explicit details of using the process of Idaho this is an this is a national program that we adopted at 18 schools um who decided that actually bypass the uh education committees and it came through it came to me i call it you know uh end-around through the health and welfare department they took it directly to the schools through who runs that i mean don't republicans haven't republicans run that i mean yeah let me just let me just say this we're we're also looking at how how big this uh program is and it needs to be changed there's there's it's so much money so many things there that it's not over the oversight is not what it should be but although much i i have to give governor a little credit he's hired a new director as governor a little came in he's been in there just over six months i think he's doing a phenomenal job he's committed to cleaning these things up i just wanted people to understand that these programs are terrible i have to say one more thing that this program does uh it also undermines and deceives parents part of the curriculum now we don't have all uh planned parenthood you know entrenched here in Idaho but again this is for and this is a national curriculum part of the curriculum takes has the kids go get in groups or you know in couples and first they have to go find a condom at a store and purchase it and or at least nowhere it is then then it takes them uh they have to go to a birth control clinic now so many of these birth control clinics are planned parenthood and they're supposed to go there to see what it's like to see uh how they handle hiv and stds but now think about this they when they're at that this this book specifically says in almost every state teens could be tested for hiv without parent permission however to be sure teens should check with the desk side beforehand to find out what policies are followed they can ask if they need parental control for testing and treatment and rather the clinical share information with teachers now think one more thing Daniel imagine six months later s for much later you you get pregnant and you're scared and you're afraid to have your parents find out where do you think you're going to go this is a self-perpetuating program that feeds the kids right back to the very clinics they've been sent to find out what's there so i'm a little bit naive here i live in a different world i went to religious private school so i don't know much about this but could you just take this back to the basics i'm not understanding the premise of this so at at 11 o'clock they have math and then one o'clock they have physics so what ensconced once a week twice a week in between is here's how you have sex i well typically what happens with these programs so yeah there's definitely more to it probably hard to quite see this program in Idaho came through uh you usually came through the help curriculum and and this was not necessarily taught and i don't think it was taught at all which is another concern to me by the teachers and so we literally have parents go in knowing how common core works they looked at the curriculum that was presented for the health class and said all right this is okay i'm okay with my child learning this then and i spoke directly with a couple of parents for this occurred then a couple weeks later their child's coming home and talking about this curriculum that they're having and they're feeling very uncomfortable as they continue to question the child it turns out that they have a guest instructor coming in from the local district health department and it's the guest instructor who is actually teaching this bringing the information in and as they bring that information in it turns out as we found out they wouldn't let them take the manuals home the the student manual and so a you know they bring pass them out gather them up role play and that was occurring for this particular um program once a week and it was a guest instructor coming in but that is not all i'm worried about but that is when the reducing the risk step what i'm not understanding and i'm glad we're talking about this because because i'm just speaking to myself here i don't think i focused enough on education over the years we've we've really touched on a lot of issues but you know as you mentioned that's the foundation the quote from congressman theodor sedruck in 1790 you know again he's talking about the education system that's really where you confuse the minds of young people at a time when they're more confused than ever in the world is so upside down and you know they're teaching them a man's a woman a woman's a man the morality's like this this is not uh moral this is a moral um what i'm not understanding is this in a state like california you wouldn't by accident let's say in san francisco at some point parents come home and there was an instructor in the public schools bringing in so on from a second amendment patriot militia group demonstrating some of their uh survivalist tactics and and some of their ideology that that would never happen indeed it doesn't happen in any state um how does this get off the ground in it because i live in central mero and where i consider pretty secular and i look towards a place where you live and like wow i wish i live there on that looks like a nice place to live how does this get off the ground and why has there not been a robust pushback until now well as i'm finding out daniel now keep in mind i've only finished my second session here uh but as i'm finding out there it i don't know if you realize i don't know right now is going through an administrative rules process that is very unique excuse me to the nation uh we as legislators have an opportunity to go over administrative rules well during the session it's a whole another story there there have been some pushback because we've liked the rules administrative rules to be treated like bills where both parties both the house and the senate have to greet just like a bill but anyway the administrative rules same at the federal level are treated as law and agencies can create rules now the the way this is supposed to work legislators create law and the administrative rules are supposed to help that law take place but what's happened are these agencies and there are many and they're at all states and at the federal level uh EPA is a great example they just create their own rules and there's no oversight um there it's it's like that with with many and i shouldn't say there's no oversight but you you understand that which i'm saying so in Idaho when we have these agencies that are enormous and you come into session the first thing we do when we get to session is we try to review the administrative rules but i'm telling you daniel there are tons there are thousands and they'll create them this past year you know what they did they created a rule in health and welfare that they basically changed on uh the birth certificate where you can change your gender and this did not come through lawmakers and so now going back we are fighting this but this there was no reason nothing had been passed as in a bill as a law to give them the authority to do this they just did it and so when you say how does this happen how to educate on the education committee with me not only do we have administrative rules but there's another part that's called incorporated by reference and i i sit and ask how would parents even know where to look where to go to find this i can barely find this and after you have all your rules there's this little click on button on or incorporated by reference you click on this button and now there's thousands of more pages that incorporate what the federal government does and we're pushing back daniel but this is not easy so basically where is traditional americans that don't want social transformation they will go where to their legislators in the ballot box the other side says hey i'm going to go to the courts and i'm going to go to the bureaucracies and and i see it on a federal level too we always think in terms of the legislature and they're always plotting and scheming they know this undersecretary and this guy who works in his office in this agency and that's how they promulgate their things hence the term that i borrowed from justice galia social transformation without representation we fought a revolution over taxation without representation which is you know by a factor of of a million um not nearly as severe as as this you know a tax is a tax you could counter man that it's kind of a one-off this is so systemically embedded in our society and um you know my concern is that i feel there's a need to at least set a standard of what conservative governance looks like and tell me bar brought if we can't do it in Idaho i'm just looking around i mean if you understand political science at all demographics different reasons why people vote a certain way your biggest metro area is boyzy you compare that to almost any other state that that's going to naturally be your most favorable climate so i mean you got your work cut out for you but we're certainly counting on you to push back against this and to at least stand for for women being women and and not you know having their spaces being infringed upon their sports being infringed upon by men um you know keep definitely keep us updated on this uh this and many other issues going around um could you just just close a little bit with just the remaining minute or two we have with just what have you learned you're very much you know what people don't see on cable news uh you know the big what we call here the sell a corridor i-95 corridor east coast New York Washington media um big big state politicians you're a citizen legislator ran in a small what we would certainly regard here is a small town Idaho Falls city council now you're just completed your first term um in the state legislator in the state house what have you learned about politics the most that both concerns you and where maybe you see an opportunity this is let me just share then a couple quick thoughts if i may uh along this line first i believe in our constitution and it is a document and a foundation worth fighting for i believe that was on my heart and i am surrounded by fellow legislators who believe the same i have found that if citizens will engage there is power that's really the there's power in numbers and our citizens have to understand that yes we're going to run into roadblocks but if they're not engaged these agendas are going to keep going forward uh citizens can't make a difference through their numbers the other thing and i know i shared this with you before this is what we're up against Daniel we are just your down home uh American patriots uh we're going to work getting up and working every day picking our kids up after school working doing the homework taking them to their their sports activities afterwards coming together as a family eating dinner and then maybe having an hour or so to try to work on issues like this is why we need more the other side Daniel is engaged almost 24 seven they have so many people and they're paid federal monies to come up and craft policies all the way from the human rights commission the human task force plan parenthood and you could name so many other organizations they get paid big money they're working on these things all the time full time and so we're in a reactionary state always in a reactionary state because our actionary state is to support the constitution and so we if i could say anything to your audience it is which i know they already know things are changing but i still believe in my heart we as citizens banding together making our voices heard coming to the legislators the legislative sessions and i think you have to do it work through the state as much as anything the power the the way to do it in my opinion is your state legislatures but i still have fake Daniel i have to otherwise what's the point i believe we can still make a difference and you know and it's great to hear that certainly where could our listeners follow you so do you have any website twitter account you know i right now probably the best place would be on my facebook it represented barber eheart and you know i i'll post other things uh later as we get that backup and going okay so we'll we'll put that up here on the screen uh barber's uh facebook thank you barbara for joining us and we look forward to having you back again to discuss an array of issues state powers you know civil society we got to start in a place like idaho look you know if idaho falls then uh we want the falls the the water not falling our civilization because then then there's nothing left there you have it folks that was barber eheart representative from the state legislature in idaho discussing everything from empowerment of women true empowerment of women and actually defining women as women standing up for their sports their their safety and security from this radical gender-bending agenda um let me tell you friends you never forget this as it stands now there is no such thing as a red state i know we started this out because of the whole trans gender gender-bending castration surgery nine circuit but i hope you saw from someone that you're not likely to see elsewhere but i think you know a lot of you in your communities know people like barbara that are just like you and me um just go to the next level more the lower local political offices but it's so hard to get people like that in larger offices but then then there's the other issue which is even if you're in a bigger office united state senate at the end of the day it's the courts and it's the bureaucracies that are controlling everything the left got very smart about that that is the opposite of republicanism where manis in define that as the power always flowing in some form either directly or indirectly from the people and this is the challenge of our time it's true of illegal migrations true of refugee resettlement it's true of you know the values the education um the sexual licentious alphabet soup agenda all of this is being pushed uh without our consent it's governance without the consent of the people that's what the Declaration of Independence is all about governance by the consent of the governed and what we have is we don't have consent i mean if you had an estate like iowa okay we're gonna take a vote should we put men with women should we pay for them to cut their balls off should we have in the public schools um you know sexual this and gay that uh you know taking away time for math and science and whatever else you would have a whole vote leading up to that public hearings transparency it wouldn't pass frankly most of this stuff wouldn't pass in in blue leaning at least leaning blue states and certainly swing states but certainly in a state like iowa but this is how we gradually allow the left to normalize this behavior not just in swing states but even in a state like iowa and we're left without a red state without anything so i'm glad we got into that broader discussion but yeah i mean don't let anyone intimidate you the lesson here is that you have a fringe radical two percent most extreme people in this country that are the most activated but there's a silent majority that opposes this and i think the mixture of localism and education we really need to focus more on education policy at a local level um and i think that is the way forward i look forward to working with all of you send me your ideas at dharowitz at blaismedia.com what you want to hear um but wanted a little bit of a change of pace today again the type of uh guess that you're really not going to see on some of these other shows but we like this long-form discussion where we actually discuss what is so important to the foundation of our civil society of our government that is missed by you know pretty much everyone else in this industry while the left just uh again wins 50 year cultural battles without firing a shot it's time for a Waterloo in this battle and i'm looking for where that moment's gonna be but there is nothing more radical than uprooting just the existence of women and i think again just like what i believe is the best jujitsu against the left on gun control is to talk about criminal control and show how they're the ones letting go criminals including gun felons while stripping us of our ability to defend ourselves against the people they let out it's a similar thing here the very people that are saying oh they're for women women's empowerment they're the ones endangering women certainly directly security-wise but really even in a worse systemic way to just impersonate and steal from them the very definition of womanhood if you want um me to pass on any notes comments uh feedback to representative barbara ehardt let me know and i'll pass it on to her as as we always do with all of our guests tomorrow we're gonna have a special guest if nothing changes Jason jones our big cartel border expert like nobody else another guest you're not gonna hear elsewhere so again conservative reviews youtube page is going to be your bookmarked website you got to subscribe to our shows like our videos drop a drop us a comment uh tweet at me at arm conservative till tomorrow god bless y'all and thanks for listening"
