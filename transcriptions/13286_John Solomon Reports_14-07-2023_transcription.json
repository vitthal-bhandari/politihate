Hello, American. Happy Friday. We've got a great show for you. It's been a busy, busy week. In fact, the news even finished big on Friday. Now, we Friday Congress said it's out of town in the middle of summer. Not today. The House scored another major victory under Speaker Kevin McCarthy. Why? They got the NDAA, the National Defense Authorization Act passed. Something that the mainstream media and Democrats predicted would not happen, and this makes major changes to the Pentagon, particularly rolling back several of the woke ideological initiatives that the Biden administration had inserted into the Pentagon budget like abortion tourism and the ideological training inside the Pentagon, a major win for conservatism, a major win for Kevin McCarthy, major win for Republican parties. The bill, which a lot of people predicted wouldn't get passed this week, goes over to the Senate. Obviously, there'll be some negotiations. Some things will drop out of it. But a win in another sign that every time it looks like the Republicans are at war with each other. The war ends up in a debate and it ends up in a negotiation that results in some pretty significant outcomes. And so that is a big moment. We're going to have a great guest to kick off the show today. He's one of your favorites. We have him on off in Congress, from the Andy Biggs, from the great state of Arizona. He is on the House Judiciary and Oversight Committee. So on the forefront of all of the weaponization and Hunter Biden investigations, he's also a major voice on spending in the NDA played a big role in the discussions about the NDA. He's going to join us at the top of the show. Then Cash Patel is going to come here to react to a story that we broke last night on Just the News, House Judiciary Jim Jordan opening an investigation into a revelation that was made on Just the News. What is that revelation? The Justice Department and FBI opened up an investigation on to House Intelligence Committee investigators back in 2017 when Devin Nunes was there. They were spying on the very investigators who were trying to uncover wrongdoing by the FBI and Justice Department, basically spying on those who were all giving oversight to them. Serious constitutional issues there. Serious questions of retaliation, as Jim Jordan said, Cash Patel was one of the people who was spied on his phone, telephone and digital records were seized by subpoena. Cash is going to react to that. And then we're going to finish up with the It's Friedman who's doing a lot of work in the policy space today. Really one of the brightest thinkers in Washington these days will join us in the third block. We're really excited to have everybody here. So Andy Bakes, Cash Patel, It's Friedman right after these commercial messages. Debt. You got a bad thinking about it? You'll wake up thinking about it.

Every time he comes on the show, we learn so much. We walk away a lot smarter. He is a really important member of the House Freedom Caucus, a really important member of the House Oversight Committee, one of the great investigators in Congress and one of our good friends, Congressman Andy Bakes from the great state of Arizona. Congressman, welcome back to the show. John, thanks for having me. Thanks for the good work you do. I mean, we in Congress look to you. We're grateful that you're on the case. Man, there's just so much going on and you guys really do a great job. Well, thank you. That means a lot. There are a lot of cases that chase right now. I've got to tell you, I've never seen a time like this in our history. I want to start with something that I just, I think every day Americans would say, wait a second. The Secret Service is like the best in the world and they can't solve a simple drug case. They come in in the last 24 hours and say, no fingerprints, no DNA, no suspects. We're closing it down nine days in. They kept Russia collusion open for three years, four years, two and a half years. They've kept January 6 open. They can't wait to get rid of this drug case. Tell us your reaction to the Secret Service trying to dump this case. Yeah, you know, my thought was really kind of not surprised. I mean, I'll be frank. I'm not surprised. But I've just frustrated. I'm really frustrated because you know, you definitely have cocaine there. There's an issue that this may not have been the only time. And I think that the investigation on a certain level, I mean, it was superficial, right? So, I mean, we end up down in the skip. It's not classified. And then every once in a while they'll say, no, what we're going to tell you now is classified. I mean, it was just very dismaying that this is a group, a great group of men and women at Secret Service. And very frustrating that they're basically pulling the plug on this thing. Yeah. And it seems odd because someone had to touch that baggie to get it in the box and that there's no fingerprints, no DNA. I've talked to a lot of drug investigators in the last 24 hours. They listened every time a dope fiend has a bag, his fingerprints on it seems kind of odd that there's not any evidence that said cocaine bag with a curious lack of evidence. Yeah. I mean, so the way to think of it too is, I mean, when you go into the White House or, you know, a skiff in Congress, if you're just a visitor, you're going to put your digital, you know, your phone or whatever, maybe you've got one of those eye watches or whatever. You're putting them in these little cubbies in your lock in them, right? And so what happened apparently is some guy's leading a tour through and finds he opens it up to put either his or somebody in his tour group there and he finds this baggie of cocaine. So the question is, who else might have touched it other than the person who placed it in there? Because we don't know when it was just another place in there, but we do know that this individual, I mean, it's just heavily trafficked area. Somebody else would have seen it and why no fingerprints? Why no fingerprints really? Because somebody somebody who came in there should have touched it, should have put it in there and they couldn't find it. So, wow, it is really something. And it's like so many of the other things that we've gone through the last few years where there's an incredible chase for evidence against some suspects in defendants and then an utter lack of curiosity or pursuit of other crimes. It really is something you've been in the middle of so many of these important debates and people look at Congress and say, well, why is the NDA such a big deal? Why are they fighting over it? It's because there's so much at stake in refocusing the military's policy, particularly after all the wokeness, the loss of recruiting. Tell us what's at the heart of the debate and why having a good robust debate isn't a bad thing. I'm not being like, oh, this is bad. The media tries to portray it as bad. But in fact, these are like really important things to set the compass on for the future, right? Yeah, no, that's exactly right. I mean, just so people can understand how much we spend, we're nearing a trillion dollars a year in funding for defense, right? So that's gone up over the last five years. That's gone up almost 300 billion dollars in a year. No, that's astronomical. But we just actually had a hearing today and I asked the guy, I said, you know, here's the deal. GAO has had you on its critical financial list for the 30 years government accounting accountability. And so why is that? And the GAO guys says, well, because they can't pass in on it. They don't know where their assets are. They don't know where almost two thirds of their assets are. Like 61%, right? It's insane. Yes. Yeah. And so I asked the guy from DOD, I said, what's, what is the, by the way, they've never passed in on it, can't pass in on it. So I asked the DOD guy, I said to hey, tell me what's the consequence if you can't pass the audit? And he says, well, we can't keep track of our assets. And I said, wait, that's not a consequence. That's one of the reasons you can't pass the audit. A consequence would be discipline of some kind. And he said, well, we just can't find the assets. So ultimately, the bottom line is this, John. And I told this guy that there are no consequences. Why? Because every time you fail an audit, you come back to Congress and we give you even more money. And that's what this is about. And then he throw in the, the top brass' Woke programs that are DEI, ESG, paying for abortions, trans, kicking people out of the military because they didn't want the facts and then refusing to bring them back. And all those, and then the list goes on. And that's why this is so important. And then you begin looking at me, say, well, this is just absurd. This is just absurd. These are the sort of issues that Congress is really trying to get a handle on. And you know, people say, well, it's a big accounting error. It's so much more than that. A lot of the assets that the Pentagon have are lethal assets, right? And so they don't know where they are. It makes you kind of wonder. And of course, after watching all the stuff we left behind in Afghanistan, you know, why there's heartburn. Do you think the Pentagon has gotten a message from this debate in any way? Or are they just go along, get along, and we'll just acknowledge we're incompetent, but we want more money? I don't think they've gotten it. And I think they won't ever get it until we, until Congress says, we want to make sure that you have the best trained, best equipped, and the safest military in the world, most advanced military in the world. But we're not going to keep wasting $100 to $200 billion a year. Look, there are warehouses filled with obsolete equipment that it was never used because members of Congress were able to get an earmark, and they had some manufacture in their district. This is a problem that we face. And oh, one other thing that most people don't realize is every dime, every penny of our military and then other discretionary funding, other funding, any other program is we have to borrow every penny of it this year, every penny, $1.8 trillion worth. The consequences of this cycle, breaking the cycle is really the only cure. It has to be broken at some point. And it seems like you guys are much more determined to start that to this year, not weed another year, kick another year. The president has taken shots of people that dare to challenge the Pentagon or dare to ask for accountability or better performance. National security is not going to be risk if all these issues don't get resolved right away. We're going to be just fine for the next few weeks that we've we sort this out, right? Yeah, absolutely. Look, here's the thing. We don't have to do this even today or next week. Last year, we didn't do it till November. So anything that they're saying is just a bunch of hogwash, number one, number two, we make sure that our military personnel receive their pay and are taken care of. What most people don't realize is there's been a bipartisan statement from Joint Chiefs of Staff and over the last 20 years that our biggest threat is our national debt. Well, you know what, the only thing that's going faster than the military budget is our national debt. And so if we keep up like this, we're not going to be able to fund our military because the interest on our national debt in just a couple of years will actually exceed the trillion dollars a year or so that we spend on military spend. Wow, I'll be eating into our security. That'll be intruding right into the security. That will be a security threat. Really, really remarkable. I know a lot of people were frustrated the way the debt deal, that ceiling deal ended. But I also know something else because I've seen a lot of this and I've been talking to the Freedom Caucus members. You guys didn't fold up camp and just go home. You're working bill by bill, program by program agency by agency to identify really significant cuts that can be enacted through appropriations bills, authorizations and other things. Can you tell us and give us a little insight? I don't think a lot of Americans appreciate that this is going on with all the other stuff going on. But this is a pretty big deal. It is. And that's one of the things that I did probably three months or so ago is I introduced over 500 bills that went line by line in the number of agencies to promise the programs that would cut literally a hundred plus billion dollars a year out of spending. Wow. And that's a real dollar figure. That's a real dollar figure. And my colleagues, they applauded that round the ignore. And the reason is it's not easy to get back and say, look, we're not going to keep funding this crazy stuff. I mean, like I just showed you, we've gone up 300 billion dollars a year on defense spending in five years. But that's nothing. And we've done that across the board in so many areas. But our effort is to consistently come up with ways that you can reduce spending. And it's a real tough effort because the people in DC, they have no desire to cut spending. They have no desire to actually basically balance the budget. Now, here's the thing about John. A lot of times, they're going to tell you that they cut spending. When they cut, say, they cut spending, instead of giving a hundred million dollars new money, they'll give only 90 million. They'll say, well, we cut by 10 billion dollars in that one room. That isn't what happened. You increased it by 90 million instead of 100 million. So it's Washington's speak that you go out there. You have to have real cuts, real reformation to go on. It is extraordinary. There's some big moments coming ahead for the oversight committee where so much progress has been made. But people forget it's only been about six months since you guys got in charge. But there have been really, really significant changes in the Biden story. All the things that we were told were lies have been proven to be true. And we're now seeing it's a lot worse. There's a big moment on the horizon next week. The IRS whistleblowers are going to come in and allow themselves to be seen by the American people in public. They've got nothing to hide. A very important moment. What are you looking forward to that hearing next Wednesday? I think by putting some faces to these whistleblowers, it will add to the gravitas or the veracity of their testimony, the things they're telling us. And so they're going to give us some barn burner information, John. There's no doubt about two things. Number one, the Biden crime syndicate and number two, the fact that the federal government has aided and embedded that crime syndicate by trying to suppress this information and affecting prosecutions. But the third thing that you'll see is you're going to see Democrats who apparently only when it's against a conservative believe in whistleblowers because they're going to go after these people personally. And it will be disgusting to see. But that's what they will do. Well, we saw it yesterday with the FBI whistleblowers. I mean, Sheila Jackson Lee, literally accused Marcus Allen, one of the pay was supposed to be doing something he didn't do. And here's the killer. She's the representative for Marcus's mom. Mom's not happy right now. She's got something to say to the Congresswoman. We had her on the show yesterday. This sort of say anything. I mean, we've seen it a couple of the Abbey Lowell letters where things were said that aren't true. And then, you know, some of the Democrats, it's really remarkable that a party that just a couple years ago said, got to protect the whistleblowers. Now don't have any regard for their reputations. Even if it's false information, is there a cost to be exacted on Democrats for the way they're currently treating the whistleblowers? There should be a cost. But the most effective cost is for America to rise up and say, look, these people are whistleblowers and you you treated them poorly. You treat them like dirt. And your own integrity has been exposed. Joan hypocrisy has been exposed. And I will just tell you, it gets back to the same thing Democrats always do. They project whatever. So whatever allegations they make against most people, it's because they're doing it themselves. We saw that all through Russia. Russia collusion and everything said. It's amazing. Yeah, exactly. It's nuts. The week after looks like Devin Archer might be coming in by all accounts. He's another person. In fact, he's so uniquely positioned because he's kind of sat between Joe Biden and Hunter Biden during the early years of 13 through 16. Another witness, do you think you'll get some more important information from? Yeah, I I am looking forward to hearing from Devin Archer. It takes a lot of courage for him to come forward. He is he was close to that family and to Hunter and Joe. So it's takes a lot of first come forward. But I'll tell you what else I am no doubt that this these these folks have tried to put pressure and threaten them as well. And I look forward to hearing what Devin Archer has to say. Yeah, I suspect there's going to be a lot of revelations there and maybe fill in some of the missing blanks from the Hunter Biden laptop, which will be a really great moment.

If you remember a few months ago on this show, we reported that the FBI back in 2017 during the height of the Russia collusion probe spied on at least two investigators for the House Intelligence Committee, which who were investigating the FBI's misconduct in the Russia collusion case. In fact, the subpoenaing and obtaining a phone and email records was done about two months before the House Intelligence Committee released a blockbuster report alleging that the FBI had can engage in serious misconduct. Well, today, just a little bit ago, based on our reporting and that of the New York Post, the House Judiciary Committee opened an official investigation into this snooping on these intelligence committees that were saying it looked like it might have been retaliation for the House Intelligence Committee's efforts to highlight wrongdoing. We have the perfect guest to react to this. Why? He was one of the victims of this snooping. Cash Patel was the chief investigator for the House Intelligence Committee when his phone records were seized by subpoena by the FBI back in late 2017. And he joins us now to react to this breaking news cash. Welcome back to the show. Hey, thanks for having me. Put simply, the FBI was snooping on the very investigators that were trying to expose their wrongdoing. What does it feel like to know that now Congress is taking the seriously and about to begin a real investigation of it? Good. I hope they get all the records. Look, it's a shock. Just think about this. The Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Department of Justice authorized subpoenas to collect private information on senior congressional staffers who were lawfully, dutifully executing their congressional oversight authority under the House Intelligence Committee. Let that sink in. What if I was a Democrat and Adam Schiff was a chairman and they got warrants on me then? And remember, and John, you know this well, there was a meeting in January of 18 with Rod Rosenstein and Chris Ray. Yes, the same Chris Ray from today, where they threatened to subpoena my records and Devin Nunes. The only lie they've left out was that they had already authorized the subpoenas months ago. So now we know the intent. And that is why I can definitively say it was an unlawful surveillance and snooping of me. And it wasn't just me. And I think it's more than two people. And I think it's more than just telephone and bank and phone records. I think they went further than that and got congressional records. So the House better step up right now, because right now it affects them as much it affects me. And it's not about me. It's about congressional oversight. If they did this, then what do you think they're doing as staffers now? Yeah, that's a great question. Cash, what do you think the repercussions should be number one and number two, as far as Google's policy, because you're only now finding out because of this five-year term that has expired as far as Google learning customers about some type of breach like this, what do you think about that five-year term? Should that be done away with at all or maybe lessened? Oh, absolutely. And look, we got lucky Google sent it to us. I know as a former federal prosecutor, you don't subpoena a grand jury or you don't impenile a grand jury subpoena to investigate a congressional staffer and just say, Oh, we're just going to go after Google. I know that means they went after every one of my selectors, every phone, every bank, every email, every telecommunication and internet thing I have ever had. That's how you do it. So what needs to happen here is that window needs to be shortened to almost nothing, especially when it comes to government officials. And then two things. One, put Rod Rosenstein, who's the attorney general there and Chris Ray in the chair side by side under oath and asked them what lawful basis they had to do this and produce the documents that they use to justify. And two, find every person who is involved in this and I guarantee you it'll lead back all the way to Russiagate and all the same bad actors at the FBI, Strock, Paige, McCabe, Comey and otherwise, well, it wasn't Comey at the time. But Congress needs to send out subpoenas enough for this nice city's in asking and put butts in the seat and get some answers to questions. Yeah, cash. There's a constitutional issue here too, separation of powers. You were exercising the independent power of the legislative branch to do oversight and the target of that oversight is using its powers to survive on you. Could this end up in court? Have you considered or anyone else considered some form of litigation to extend this out? I have and I may have a surprise announcement for you, John, and maybe a week or so. Me and my counselor are going to take all measures necessary. And as you pointed out, it's not like we knew in 2017 and 18, we just found out a few months ago because Google told us so we're still trying to figure out all the appropriate steps to take. But that's something Congress should look at as well. They unlawfully investigate the investigators as my friend and chairman at the time, Devin Nunes always said, and there's no repercussions for them. So there has to be. And whether or not they're in government or not, Chris Ray still is, but Rod Rosenstein isn't. Doesn't mean he's outside the reach of a congressional subpoena. So they better go get them immediately. I'm calling on Congress to stop slow walking it, to stop playing nice, and to start using the rules that the January 6 committee used. No letters, no niceties, no phone calls, subpoenas, answers, and documents. It's what you owe the American people. I don't care that it was me. They're used to maligning me. But this is jeopardizing the institution of Congress and constitutional oversight. Yeah. Cash, I want to pivot to yesterday. I don't know if your ears were burning, but there were a couple of Democrats in the house judiciary committee invoking your name, casting some pretty vicious aspersions, suggesting that you paid two whistleblowers to testify. Now, if the lauded poets of three six mafia were here, they would say, keep my name out your mouth. But I imagine you have a much more sophisticated rebuttal to what they had to say. Though I listened to three six mafia from time to time, basically, it's shocking and not surprising at the same time. Brave whistleblowers provide credible information. And after they did that, my foundation, the cash foundation, which is a 501c3 provided financial assistance because Chris Ray, illegally, in my opinion, retaliated against them, took their money, prevented them from paying rent and feeding their children. So we gave them minimal grants after they had come forward. But Nadler and Sheila Jackson Lee bastardized the process and lie intentionally, along with Goldman, and say that I spent $250,000 a piece in buying their testimony. I wish I had that kind of money. I wish I could cut quarter million dollar checks. I would do it overnight. But they know those checks came from a fundraising campaign that was put on the internet. And why is there two tiers of justice here? Don't you remember when Peter Strach, Lisa Page, Andy McCain, Bill Prestep, and everybody had their GoFundMe pages while employed at the FBI? No one said anything about it back then because it's not illegal. They want to taint brave whistleblowers for coming forward. I don't care what you say about me, but don't remind those guys that came forward and showed FBI corruption. Chris Ray had no answer to it except retaliate and firing them and putting their families at risk. And Sheila Jackson Lee, surprise surprise, finds one of those individuals families in her constituency in Texas, thanks to John's great reporting. So I'd like to hear what they have to say. Folks, everybody, we got one more good one. It's Friedman will be joining us right after this commercial break. Hello, America, you know what? We're up against another government shutdown later this month. And our wise leaders deal with it.

Listen to everything you love on the iHeartRadio app for free. Welcome back America. If you were checking out Justin News right about lunchtime today, you might have saw a breaking news alert. The American Accountability Foundation filed a complaint airing their concerns about the top Air Force General Charles O. Browns. So Charles Q Browns diversity hiring priorities. This is important because General Brown is set to replace General Mark Millie as the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the top military position in our country. Joining us right now, one of the most important officials at that group is communications manager. It's Friedman. It's great to have you on the show. Thank you so much for having me John and Memphis. Good to see you guys. Good to see you and this is a very important complaint. It's chock full of real examples of real comments that General Brown has made over the years suggesting that race and skin color matter more than maybe merit in his hiring decisions inside our military. Can you give us a little flavor of what your group found in its great work? Well, sure. You know, this is Joe Biden's pick to be the new chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. This is going to be over the air to Eisenhower. We have found that he has said things like, for example, we need to nudge and pull to make sure diverse, quote, unquote, diverse candidates get ahead. He just straight up said, I hire for diversity. He's very explicit and very clear that he just wants a military where troops are basically promoted judged by the skin color. And, you know, that just, you know, everyone who would hear that would basically know that that seems a little bit crazy. You know, we deserve better. The American people deserve better. We deserve to be protected by soldiers in a military of the very most, you know, most courageous, most skilled, the smartest people in the world, not the best skin color, but especially, John and Amanda. I think this is so important because our troops who go out there and risk their lives deserve to be led into battle, deserve to be led on these, you know, these important missions where their lives are at risk by the best we have, not by people who are picked by their skin color. What kind of a message are we sending to our troops? Or we're saying that the officer who's responsible for your safety may have been chosen not because of their smarts, not because of their skills, not because of their courage, but because of the color of their skin. And this is, you know, this is the military CQ Brown, general CQ Brown wants to to implement. And what's so mindless about this to me is I remember a year or two ago when United Airlines announced that they were going to place diversity as a main directive when they were doing their hiring. And a lot of people were justifiably when preserved because that was concerning the safety of 250, 300 people on a plane. This concerns the safety of our entire nation when you were distracted with something like that instead of skill. How well known is this do you think the American people? Because I think much like the United Airlines situation, this is something that if more Americans found out about it, they would be enough for. Oh, yeah, you know, we're starting to see people, you know, realize this, you know, we just put this out this story today. It's been getting a lot of attention on Twitter. I encourage everyone to check out. We have on Twitter, we did a thread of video clips of general CQ Brown making these very strange comments. And that's why we filed this complaint today. We are asking the Inspector General of the Air Force to investigate what, you know, what the hell CQ Brown was up to over at the Air Force. He's saying these things like I hire for diversity. Well, guess what? If that's what you're doing, that's against the law. I mean, we just saw the Supreme Court say that, you know, Harvard can't judge people based on the color of their skin. If Harvard can't do it, the Air Force can't do it either. You know, like you're saying, Air Force is, you know, it's much more important to make sure we have this proper system in place in the Army, in the Air Force and the Armed Forces. Yeah. When I was a younger reporter, I had a chance to hang out with some extraordinary early African-American entrants in the military. They were towards the end of their life and they always said to me, there's nothing like being in a foxhole and realizing you don't care about the race of the person next year, only their skill and their dedication to the country. And I was thinking of those comments today as I read your very detailed and very thoughtful complaint. I want to remind people because these complaints have really significant consequences. Earlier this year, your group did a lot of work on the federal communications nominee Gigi Sohn and Luke Concerns, you raised. Ultimately, Sunkra nomination. Tell us a little bit about the success you've had there. Well, sure. You know, when it comes to Biden nominees, a lot of it is just showing the American people who these people really are. I mean, with Gigi Sohn, she had some comments about police officers that for most Americans was just totally out of bounds. And so basically what we have to do is shine a light on that and show the American people what's going on. And the American people make their voices heard. But I think what you were just saying about troops is so important because our troops deserve to be led by officers who see them as individuals, who see them for their merits, not officers who see them for their skin color. And Biden is just trying to pose this new woke regime basically in every corner of the US government and by picking CGQ Brown, he seems to be putting it, trying to make this the military into just, you know, this experiment of wokeness. Yes, we've seen some conservative causes really grow their skills when it comes to utilizing social media and the internet to further their cause. There's one regarding the stove initiative of banning gas stoves with the Biden administration. But you have a brilliant one that I think is an incredible resource. It's bidenombs.com. It's a very catchy everybody. You should go check it out. But it's a great resource because for lawmakers and people in the Senate who would ultimately confirm these positions, this has got to be invaluable for them because as we've seen with this administration, many of them have been shown the door or in the case of Gigi's show. So and I guess she found the door herself. But I just wanted to compliment you on that. Tell us our audience about what it is. Sure. Well, as far as, you know, checking out our website, I fully endorsed that message Amanda. So thank you for that. Definitely check out our website. Yeah, like one of the past nominees we've taken a look at was Anne Carlson, who was going to be one of Biden's top, you know, safety, highway safety regulators. We found that she explicitly called for raising gas prices in America. She wanted higher gas prices in America, you know, for climate change reasons. Well, we kept digging and it turns out, guess what she's invested in? Guess what? She has a serious financial stake in oil and gas. And you know, once that came out, it was only really a matter of time until before, you know, she, you know, like you said, she showed herself the door. But you know, a lot of these nominees are just radical. They come from, you know, academia these days. They come from California. You know, just places where ideas, I guess people, you know, just have different ideas than the rest of America. And when most Americans hear these ideas and hear these statements, they're just shocked. Yeah, that is for sure. One last one I want to ask you about another success. Congresswoman Acasio-Cortez, $35,000, Med Gala gift. She got some pretty big trouble with that, didn't she? Oh, yes. She, we filed another complaint about AOC's famous trip to the Med Gala a couple years ago, where she was going to talk me about how she was accepting gifts. We also found that she hadn't paid vendors that she was supposed to pay. They were actually about to file the vendors, know the makeup people, you know, stuff like that. They're about to file a complaint with, you know, New York's Labor Department demanding payment for their services, which is just bizarre. I mean, like, I don't know why she can't pay, she can't pay these vendors. Thank you for tuning in on a Friday in the middle of summer.

We're up against another government shutdown later this month, and our wise leaders deal with it. How they always do more spending while lawmakers are high-fiving.
