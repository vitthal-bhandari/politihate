Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome everybody to the second hour of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. This is Buck and we promise you an update on these situation in Afghanistan and also all the efforts in the media and for the Democrats from Biden himself. Try to convince you that all that stuff you saw, all the people who were rushing the airport in a frenzy, the chaos, those grabbing on to the gears of planes as they took off from Kabul airport, the situation of the security on the ground, the lack there of 13, 13 killed in a suicide bombing, 13 of our own members, the military, and the Biden administration's already talking about what a success the Afghan withdrawal was. We still have a thousand people, including green card holders, dozens of U.S. citizens yesterday. Chuck Schumer said everybody, every American who wanted to get out got out. That's just not true. That's a lie. But Chuck Schumer is no stranger to lies. It's really what he traffics in. But as promised or as predicted and promised, they're already trying to tell you that they've done a great job, that this was amazing. Remember when it was a disaster that we could all see unfolding before our eyes, there were videos and photos and people were giving interviews, they were saying what a complete mess it was, how embarrassing it was for the United States to have a run for the exits, run for the lifeboats moment as we did. And yet, I said, it's just a matter of time before they're going to tell you, this was a great success. And as if right on cue, and here's Nancy Pelosi doing just that. The historic evacuation of 120,000 people was remarkable and I commend the administration for that. This is never easy. That's not always complete right from the start. But it was remarkable, even though it got off to a hazy start. And now we go forward. A hazy start, she says, Clay. I remember when digital Dunkirk was trending, one thought I had was, yes, it was amazing that just as they had the Brits taking boats, fishing boats, pleasure, pleasure craft to get their British soldiers off the North shores of France, that came after an almost mind-boggling, hard-to-fathom destruction of the military might of France and the UK at the hands of the Germans, right? This was the evacuation came because of the disaster, but Pelosi wants you to think this was a great moment for America. Yeah, and unfortunately, and let's say a positive story here, Dunkirk, I think now in the British mindset is maybe the moment that Britain points to as one of the greatest, if not the greatest moments of modern British history, because the positive there, and this is a little bit of a side, but there's an opportunity to go see some of those boats. And when you get a chance to go back to London, they have incredible history museums there. And buck, some of these boats are, I mean, even call them boats is unbelievable. Like seeing the fact that they got four and five soldiers into these little boats that they were willing to take over in the midst of all of the bombing going on by Germany and everything else. And that really is, I think, a seminal moment in Western remarks. It was a response to an unbelievable military disaster, which was the possible eradication of the entire British Army and one fell swoop. They had an opportunity for D-Day because the British people used their own fleets to get people out. And that's the point on Afghanistan in general. If you had had an orderly withdrawal, there would have been no need to even brag about it in any respect because everybody who wanted to get out of Afghanistan would have been able to get out. And already Pelosi is trying to spin this in some way as a positive achievement by the Biden administration. And I think you're right that they're going to, as time passes, hope that this situation fades and people don't remember how much of a disaster this really was. And are they going to be successful in that? My belief is no because this story ties into all the other Biden administration failures. And so it will be hard to stand alone when you combine it with COVID, the border with murder rates and sundry other failures, including potentially the budget not going to be able to pass. One of the areas that was always hardest for the corporate media to try to prop up the Obama administration in was on foreign policy because there were all these disasters that kept unfolding, yet Syria and Libya and Iraq and ISIS and the situation of Afghanistan also noteworthy that the highest casualty rates the U.S. sustained in the ward Afghanistan by far occurred while Obama was in office, but there was much less talk. That was the good war. So we didn't have to. Whereas we remember during the Bush administration, everything that happened in Iraq, it was like Bush himself was responsible for every single life loss there. Very different approach to it all. But Biden was supposed to be the steady foreign policy hand of the Obama administration. That was the initial pitch. And then people just hope that he didn't say embarrassing things and was the kind of foolish uncle that everyone hides at holidays. And we saw that play out for eight years. But there were things that were there were key decisions made, you know, the pallets of cash given to Iran, the transfer of five senior Taliban members from Guantanamo Bay by the by the Obama administration in 2014 in exchange for Bo Bergdahl, who walked off base and just decided he was going to walk off base. And I've seen and interviewed members of units that were either that Bo Bergdahl was either in or working alongside who were highly critical to say the least of the of the Bo Bergdahl decision. But Clay, it's almost like we're going through this, this cycle here of the Obama administration, foreign policy failures are being revisited on us in very clear ways of those that they call them the Taliban five at the time right back in 2014. Four of those five members are now basically the Taliban cabinet. I mean, they're the guys that are effectively running the situation in Afghanistan. They're not, they're not quite at the very head of government and they're not quite where. Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Now, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir. Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir, Sir did the State Department has voiced concern over the lack of female inclusion in the Taliban government. They're 35 top government officials and they're all male, right? And so they wrote a I that again, this is it feels like it should be satire. Like how do you respond to terrorist with a really harshly worded letter? But that is what we have done now in response to not having a diverse and inclusive enough government, 35 men, all of whom, by the way, are the same religious base. It's just funny to me, like every picture that you see, like so much of what we do in this democracy on a day to day basis is total BS. But maybe the peak of BS is this cosmetic diversity obsession. Like every time there's a photo, it has to have, you know, like it has to be like the United Colors of Benathon back in the day, like the ad has to be like has to have 12% Asian inclusion. It has to have like, you know, and then you look at the Taliban and they just got 35 bearded Islamic fundamentalists that represent the government and we're going to write them a meme letter. Then that's going to somehow have some impact on them. Like they care about any of this. Well, also this is an area where we're going to say that, you know, international opinion and the Taliban is going to say really, well, I mean, I'm just telling you, we know what the response is going to be when we try to have, first of all, we're not going to pressure them in any meaningful way. We all know this. I mean, Blinken, Blinken is like the Dean in the high school that none of the kids listen to, you know, he's like, you know, slow down in the hallways and people are just throwing spitballs out of the old chairs. Where's your all past kids? Yeah. And you know, we see the Taliban right now already understanding the leverage that they have as they're not allowing a thousand people. And there's also reports that the State Department, our State Department has blocked private flights from getting out or landing in ways that, you know, just boggle the mind. But the Taliban, I'm pretty sure they're not going to care. And if about our strongly word letters on their lack of diversity and inclusion and beyond that, I mean, they have an actual war criminal as one of their cabinet members. I mean, a true document, the guy went in and wiped out whole villages of Hazara who were an ethnic minority in Shia minority inside of Afghanistan and Clay, they're going to say, well, America does business with Saudi Arabia, you know, America does business with China, which operates concentration camps. They're going to go and say this stuff at the UN. And you know what? At some level, it's, I mean, it's true. And they're just going to divert from the fact that, yeah, we've got a country that's run by barbarians that we've been at war with for 20 years. And that's the reality. And also this just brings back the ultimate reality, which is sternly worded letters. We are running a country like Twitter. And what I mean by that is words matter on Twitter. Somebody says something somebody else doesn't like. And it's like, oh my God, we've got to cancel that person. Did you see what they said about whatever topic, right? It doesn't matter what the topic is. They made a joke. Like, let's stone them. Let's let's derive them with righteous and furious anger. And that works for the Democratic Party in America. They have turned Twitter into an arm of the Democratic Party. It doesn't work with actual terrorists. And there's a huge percentage of Americans that don't know what actual evil is. They think like target mixing boys and girls toys together is evil, right? That mixing them together. Like they have it. They have it target has a whole aisle that's just girl toys and they have it. I'll that's just boy toys. And like that's the things that our Americans are obsessed with on a day to day basis. And meanwhile, Afghanistan is stoning people, right? And what do you think the impact's going to be when our hypersensitive perpetually offended culture tries to have any impact in Afghanistan? Those dudes are just going to walk up and smack us in the face. They were not even in authority. We're not even really going to try. I mean, this is the other part of this too. I think everyone realizes that there'll be some people that make a little bit of noise. But the left in this country doesn't even really believe that there are foreign enemies. The only enemies are domestic. The only enemies are Trump voters that white are in opposition to the power that they want here at home. So while they'll, you know, they'll do strongly worded letters about the Taliban. They'll try to lock up insurrectionists here for, you know, attempted overthrow of the government when you had a lot of people who are taking selfies and walking around and, you know, whatever I'm on. We'll come back into that in a few moments. We've also got a lot of people that I know still want to weigh in about the satire issue and whatever happened to comedy. I think it's pretty clear the left largely the left will say, oh, but all the comedians are left wing. Right. The same reason all the professors are left wing because they can't tolerate other people and they act like the spoiled children at the high school lunch table won't allow anyone else to sit with them. So that's how that goes. We'll come back into some of that though in a moment. Clay, we got just a few days here before the 20th anniversary of 9 11. And right now, Frank Siller, who's the chairman and CEO of the Tullen to Towers Foundation is making his way across six states. This has been going on for six weeks by foot. Frank connects the 9 11 sites, Pentagon, Shanksville and ground zero in his more than 500 mile tribute to the fallen. His journey ends this Saturday morning on 9 11 when he takes the final steps his baby brother took 20 years ago from the tunnel in downtown New York City to the towers where he gave his life clay, saving others. Yeah. And this 20th anniversary year tunnel to towers is also giving 200 mortgage free homes to America's heroes and their families. September 12th, the foundation is going to have a ceremony to say out loud. The names of the many people who died from 9 11 related illnesses since that day. You won't believe how many more people we've lost to illnesses from that toxic dust and over 100,000 more suffering with those illnesses today. Never forget you can donate $11 a month to tunnel the towers at t2t.org. Again, $11 a month as the 20th anniversary nears of 9 11. Never forget and donate at t2t.org.

Buck, I wanted to make sure we hit on this. Because if this had happened with the January 6th, the riot, if Donald Trump had raised money for people who are arrested on January 6th, and one of the guys that he had raised money for got out on bail and then got accused of murder, this would be the number one story everywhere. Well, if you'll recall that Kamala Harris backed a bail fund surrounding all of the Minnesota riots and they helped get an alleged Minneapolis domestic abuser off of out of jail pay bail. This guy George Howard, 47 years old, he had been arrested due to his behavior in the riots. And Kamala Harris said, Hey, we need a Minnesota Freedom Fund. We want to bring in as much money as possible. And they brought in the money to get this guy out of jail given his charges. Well he has now been arrested and charged with two counts of second degree murder for allegedly shooting Luis Damien Martinez or T's during a road rage incident in Minneapolis on August the 29th. And now this guy has committed murder. Can you imagine the reaction in the media if one of the January 6th perpetrators who's been arrested, Trump helped get them out on bail and then they committed a murder? I'm pretty sure the media will be talking about it a whole lot more. They're talking about this. That's this thing is hard by getting any attention. What would you see is Kamala right now is on this mission to try to keep Gavin Newsom in the governor's role. So that's what she's she's going out to California. I don't think she'll be very effective there either. She's a machine politician. There's not a lot of inspiration than anyone including the residents of California going to take from from Kamala Harris. But I just I think it's also worth noting that there were you have the sitting vice president of the United States was advocating to raise money for people who were guilty of rioting. Right? I mean, this is actually they act like the bail fund was for people who were, you know, who were prisoners of conscience or something were wrongfully accused. No, they rioted. They deserve to be held in jail. They deserve to be criminally charged. But remember riots that Democrats like as long as there's a BLM banner involved. That's okay. Yeah, let me just fix this, by the way, clean up a little bit. What is going on here is he was arrested for having a firearm and they put up $11,500 bond in a domestic assault case. I guess the freedom fund still has money left over from all the people they were bailing out. So they're continuing to bail people out who otherwise might not be able to all funded by Kamala Harris's group. But according to this story, he had, it makes it honestly even worse because he was in for a domestic assault case. Like why is the fund helping people who are accused of domestic assault out of jail in the first place? Regardless, I think almost everybody out there would sit back and say, Hey, maybe some of these guys that are accused of violent crimes should maybe stay in jail. They should let him back out. The Nobel changes made in New York play. When I talk to the NYPD, everyone law enforcement here says, there's also more violence. Resulting bad things. No doubt. It's a huge issue. You know, it's also a huge issue. Everybody being able to follow you around online and know exactly where you've been and be able to sell your data.

This is Buck and I've been saying really from the beginning of the pandemic that if you understand a Lindske, if you understand community organizing and mass mobilization, largely through symbols and propaganda, you would see that COVID is just like an authoritarian's dream. Right now all of a sudden, everything that you do, anything you want to do, you can put through the lens of, well, we better do this or else there's going to be some kind of a health implication or there's no aspect of your life that can't be engineered under the guise of protecting you from, from COVID. And just see this with the rent moratorium that they went with. All of a sudden the CDC Democrats believe very firmly and for a long time they got away with this, the CDC could say, yeah, you're not allowed to actually enforce the contract you have with someone who's renting a home from you. And there are some landlords that I believe have been turned homeless by this policy because the renter, they were relying on that rent to pay their own bills and they ended up being homeless themselves and couldn't go to the home they own that was being rented to somebody, of course, because they couldn't evict them. But we've seen a lot of this. Once you understand the mentality of the left and how a Linskyite mass mobilization works, you know, once you've got people energized on one area in one way, it's much easier to move them onto something else. So when you have them mobilized against corruption, then you can move them to pollution. When you have them mobilized against, you know, capitalism, you can then move them on to whatever else comes to mind for you. And climate change is, I mean, Clay and I were just, we're just having a discussion about how I think an emotionally healthy, normal, rational person spends exactly zero seconds of their life worried about climate change. I believe that this is a religious belief for people who think they're too smart for a religion clay. So let's just first establish it's not like other issues where, you know, income inequality Yeah, I can see some, you know, sometimes private equity does lever up companies and destroy them and take a whole lot of working class people and put them out of jobs. Like there can be back and forth on these issues. You worry about climate change zero. I worry about it zero. I worry about it zero. I mean, I mean, honestly, I mean, there are so many things going on in my life on a day to day basis. And some people say, well, I don't worry about it for myself. I worry about it for my kids or my grandkids. I spend zero time worrying about climate change for my kids and my grandkids too. And it's obviously not because I don't care about my kids or hopefully someday grandkids that I would have. It's because there are a billion other things going on that I'm more concerned about that are more directly related to things that I believe humans can have an impact on. And so I like every time there is a climate change topic. And by the way, I think I'm the vast majority of the American public, right? I think the vast majority of the American public so busy on a day to day basis got kids that you're worried about, jobs that you're worried about, parents that take care of, family members, all these other things going on. I don't think very many people are worried about climate change. I will say the polling totally backs you up on that just to that. That's clear. But you know, the Bolsheviks were never a majority either. So it doesn't. And so that what has changed and pivoted in a big way is every time there is a full flood now, every time there is a hurricane, which by the way, floods and hurricanes have been happening my entire life. I'm 42. I think there's some stuff in the Bible about floods and things. I think I think there might have even been in biblical times floods. I understand that people who are smarter than me and go back and look through like the eons of of sediment and look at where exactly water levels have been. They have fluctuated a great deal over the decades. I'm not worried about it at all. Well, the Democrats are severely worried about it. What has changed, Buck, is now we get direct overt blaming of climate change for any climate related issue. And that did not happen a decade ago. It certainly didn't happen 20 years ago. Fires in California, hurricanes hitting the Southeastern United States, tornadoes in the Midwest, a freak storm in New York, whatever it may be, you're right. All of a sudden there's this, it's almost like an emotional manipulation and blackmail that goes on where Joe Biden shows up and goes, you know, if we don't deal with this, it's existential and he does this whole thing. In fact, here, here, here he is making, making the pitch right after we just got hit with some storms. Here's Joe Biden talking about how we need to take action. Climate change poses an existential threat to our lives, to our economy. And the threat is here. It's not going to get any better. The question can't get worse. We can stop it from getting worse. And when I talk about building back better and Chuck is fighting for my program, our program on the Hill, when I talk about building back better, I mean, you can't build what it was before this last storm. You've got to build better. So if the storm occurred again, there would be no damage. There would be, but that's not going to stop us though, because if we just do that, it's just going to get worse and worse and worse because the storms are going to get worse and worse and worse. And so folks, we got to listen to the scientists. Clay, I mean, this is gibberish. If you were sitting, if you weren't the president of the United States, you were sitting on a bar stool, muttering about the existential threat and all this stuff. You think this guy needed professional help. It's such a good boy. Take the fact that all these microphones are out there and just that's a great analogy. Like if you were sitting in a bar and Joe Biden's sidled up to you and let's pretend we're dudes and he's not girls trying to smell our hair and touch us inappropriately, but let's pretend it's me or you Buck and he might still try to smell our hair. You're probably too. Yeah, we do have good hair. But so let's pretend we get past the hair sniffing and we're like just kind of hanging out with Joe. Would you in any way consider his opinion at all to be remotely valid or would you be like, I'm all the people at bar. It's next to me. I got to have this dude to next to me. I mean, he sounds like he is basically drunk every single time that he is talking now. He's meandering. He's not making sense. There's no logical connection to what he's trying to say and it's disappointing. Look, you can, I always say I don't want the country to be led by a laughing stock. Regardless what your own political beliefs are, we're led by a laughing stock right now. This guy's a Joe. I wouldn't hire Joe Biden to be a one day substitute teacher for an eighth grade English composition class. And I mean that. I mean, I really would say I don't think this guy could cut it. I think the kids would be getting, you know, they would get a short changed on this one. And yet he's the leader of the free world. By the way, to to our point about the nonsense that Biden spews. Here you go. We are determined that we are going to deal with climate change and end, have zero emissions net emissions by 2050 by 2020. Make sure all our electricity is zero emissions. I mean, okay. They'll say he misspoke or whatever, but he miss speaks and then doesn't correct it. Right. So I'm going to say that's exactly what I was going to say. You and I sometimes don't get every word perfect on the radio show. We don't have a script to read from and we're doing live radio every day. Here's a good question. You said you wouldn't hire him to do to be like an eighth grade substitute teacher, which I think is a great question. I wouldn't hire him to work it out. Kick were in the process of hiring a lot of people. There's nothing that I could hire him to do at my company and he's the leader of the free world. I wouldn't trust him to be able to do it. Buck, what if Joe Biden had to sit down in front of our mic and talk to our audience for three hours like we do? There's no way on earth that Joe Biden could do our job. And there's no possibility that he in fact, if he sat down and tried to try to do that, he talked to our audience for three hours. We have to invoke the mercy rule. I mean, I would actually feel I would be embarrassed. I'd feel bad. I'd throw a blanket around his shoulders and want to get him to some apple juice as soon as possible because it's clear he couldn't do it. And Clay, I don't think that's an unfair thing to bring up because they were calling for the 25th amendment to be used against Donald Trump who would stand up at rallies and put on extemporaneously, which you and I appreciate a lot because we we're just rolling here, folks. We're just going and just, you know, going off what's at the top of our minds. You put on the greatest political show on earth off the top of his head. Well, we're going to go down to Mar-a-Lago sooner rather than later, hopefully, and we'll offer Trump the opportunity to be on with us for three hours. By the way, I'd offer Joe Biden the opportunity to be on with us for three hours. I think it would be the single worst decision that the Biden administration could make to put him on with us for three hours. But I think everybody out there listening to us would I mean, let's be asking for three minutes first, but yeah, that's right. That's right. I was going to be fun too.

Go to poof.com today. That's P-O-O-P-H dot com. If it's not poof, it stinks. Welcome back, Adam. Close it out. Hour number two, Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. We got a lot of you who wanted to weigh in so far on the show. We have not taken any calls yet. Let's go to take some of these calls. Let's fill in Charleston, South Carolina, what you got for us, Bill. Boy, and Buck, this is a special moment for me. Thank you very much for putting me on. And love the show so far. You guys are doing a great job. Appreciate you. With one exception, Buck. And I hate to be the guy that has to call you out the first time I get to speak to you. But when you're talking about the late night entertainers and the comedy, and you threw out there's one person who started the whole thing out and you threw John Stewart of the mix when you were sitting behind the golden U.I.D. microphone. Well, we don't know how to do it. You're telling me. You're just understanding, sir, with respect. I said John Stewart started the use of comedy as a propaganda weapon in politics for the left. I was only talking about leftists who were like doing that. One television too, because then thanks for the call. But the argument is, and I think it's a good one for those of you who were not aware, we were talking about the degree to which politics has infected humor. And if you were someone who watched the late night television back in the day, Johnny Carson, David Letterman, and Jay Leno, you didn't really have a sense for their political leanings because they took shots in equal directions. And I will be pointed out that Stephen Colbert during the Trump administration went all in on Trump ridicule. And then Buck, you pointed out that the first person to really do it on television from a humor perspective was John Stewart going from one side, right? Like one side. Because the guy before him, Craig Kilborn, also had that same platform, but it was more of a like making just jokes about the news. John Stewart turned it into editorials that the DNC likes that are funny, which is a different thing. That's a different approach to the same radio perspective. Rush invented a brand new way to speak to the audience. We appreciate that call. But the difference is that perspective didn't exist. We all know that Rush created political talk radio as it exists in any way. I mean, everybody, Sean Hannity who's going to be on after us, Glenn Beck, who's on right before us, us, no one would exist in the political speech arena of radio if Rush hadn't proven how successful it could be in the first place. But from a television perspective, it's totally different. Yeah. Yeah. Gloria in Cordelline Idaho. Hello. The consummate late night entertainer was by far a class after Johnny Carson. If I could watch his reruns, even now I would be watching them and I would go back to late night TV. I don't watch it. It's not funny. I don't need more political speak at that time at time at night. So anyway, love your show. Thank you, Gloria. We appreciate it. Thank you so much for calling in. Yeah, I think, I think there's a lot of people with that perspective and honestly, it's kind of what happened with sports too, right? It used to be an escape. It's kind of a place where at the end of the day you've had serious things happen. You want to have a beer. You want to kick your feet up and then you get this strident political angled one direction. And I think that's why frankly it's collapsed. Even video games now have become the site of controversy over wokeness and, you know, I remember during the pandemic when I went into a video game phase because, you know, what else are you going to do in lockdown New York City by yourself? There was what was it? One of the Viking, I forget, Assassin's Creed games, the beginning, it's this was created by a diverse group of people from like multiple, you know, sexual and identity perspectives and all that. I was like, we're talking about Viking. What is this? It's a video game. I really don't care who made it. Yeah. One of my buddies. What do you got? How's it going, you guys? We're good, man. Thank you for calling. Yeah. So I want to throw out a few names out there. Stephen Crowder who just came back from his recovering from surgery. So I'm going to bring his name up to awareness. Great guy who's still a fantastic audience by doing really good work online. Totally agree. Go ahead, Joel. And Alfonso Rachel, he's a he does a little bit of a commentary on the internet. I think you're discounting so many of the original creators that are on the net. There's also Michael Loftus as well as British fantasy as well as well. We appreciate. Look, I appreciate all these names. The internet is getting paid $30 million to do an audience of millions of people every night by like Disney or one of the biggest media corporations in the world. That's the problem. I know my kids love YouTube. There is still a big difference between late night broadcast television humor and what is going on on YouTube. By the way, this is a strong argument. I think Russ is rust still there and Lexington argues that yes, the left is ruined comedy. They've ruined everything. Here we go, Russ. What are you? Let's let's hear Russ say it. Yeah. Hey guys, thanks for carrying the EIB torch law. Thank you. I appreciate it. Yeah, I think the question that Clay asked about whether the left is ruined comedy, I think absolutely true. But I think the bigger question is what aspect of American life has the left not ruined? I mean, they destroy everything and I mean everything they touch. It is a fascinating question. Thank you for the call. It's a great point, Russ. When we come back, speaking of destroying things, Joe Rogan's talking about trying to destroy CNN. You see this story after they accused him. I wish you could destroy CNN and be a good day for America. Their ratings are destroyed. We had an article up at Outkick. My guy Bobby Barak looked at it. They can barely get a million people to watch their programming now. And Joe Rogan's talking about suing him. What for will tell you about that to start off the third hour. And AOC really wants to speak out in favor of the rights of menstruating and birthing people of America and the world. You're listening to Clay Travis and Buck Sexton on the EIB Network.
