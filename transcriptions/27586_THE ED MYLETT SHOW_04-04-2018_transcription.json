    "text": " This podcast is for those who want to do more, see more and be more, lead, compete and kick some ass. Welcome back to Max Out with Ed Mylet, so excited about today's program. Yay, thank you for having us. Good! I don't think these ladies need much of an introduction, but in case you don't know if you've been living under a rock and don't watch any TV or WWE or you don't drink wine or you're not on the internet in any way you may not know them, but if you are, you know who these two ladies are. So I have next to me, Bree and Nikki Bella, the Bella twins. Hello. From everywhere, from Total Divas, Total Bellas now, WWE, all kinds of brands, we're going to talk about all that today. Yes. Thanks for being here, ladies. Not thanks for having us. I mean, the Veal. The Veal's pretty good. I kid like, look at this all day. Not bad, we're hoping for Wales. We're hoping for Wales. That's a goal by the end of it. We hope we buy the end of the day. Maybe some sunlight too. I'd love you to see that, but. So let's start. Everybody knows the after product. So when I have people on that are so successful, you guys have built these amazing brands of the two of you and businesses too, which we'll get to. But can we go back just like a little bit? Yeah. Because it's a trip. The two of you become really the most too well known, certainly women, but people in the history of your entire business and the WWE. And so, and I told you earlier, one thing that impresses me about you is I don't think fame's altered you. Yeah. No, it really hasn't. I think you're comfortable with your fame. It suits like you're almost born for it. Some people were so. That's very sweet. Thank you. But I bet if we watched from your birth to about 18, we wouldn't predict this. Speaking of it. Well, not at all. No, actually no. I mean, granted, did we like to lip sync to the Spice Girls for my parents and all their friends? I think we love for a group. And we were, you know, we traveled on a competitive soccer team. Right. And, you know, we learned athletics at a very young age and really spent a natural ability for it. But if you told me that I was going to see the East Coast in middle school, I would have been like, wait, what? I could have seen New York sometime in my life. I would have been blown away. There is some in Tokyo. And Russell, yeah. Japan, Italy, all these places. Unbelievable. So did you wrestle though growing up? Like were you wrestling? I mean, each other. Yeah. There was a constant battle. Our brother was a collegiate wrestler. Okay. And so he would always want to practice moves on us, but we were just, I know. It was so obnoxious. I was like, can you just quit the wrestling team? Yeah. Because it was like, we couldn't walk in the house without getting tackled. Well, then he got really into the rock. And then that took everything to a whole different level. So when he was into the rock, were you at least watching WWE back in those days? Nicole and I were into dynasty. Oh, yeah. We never did. We never did. Of course I did. And when we get Nike, like, pretty nice. We'd watch the fawns. Yeah. We lived all the old school shows. We did. Nicole and I were really outdoorsy girls. Like we were building forts. We were outside with all of our farm animals. We weren't really into TV. And soccer took so much time. Yeah. Is it travel soccer? Like everyone? Yeah. And so for us, it was like any free moment we had, it was like we wanted to be outside. Like it wasn't about being inside and watching TV. And to be honest, our parents didn't watch wrestling. And I think that happens a lot when you're younger, is your parents might be fans and put you in front of the TV and watch, or your friends might watch it. And we were never surrounded by it. That's crazy. And not crazy. So how does it happen? How do you end up becoming this? Like what were you doing right before this? We were hooter girls. Hooters. Perfect preparation. Yeah. So we were lucky. We were looking for a job at 18. And we just heard like wait, you're seeing to make a lot of money. And in high school. And it was in California. In California, not in Arizona. In high school, which we went to in Arizona. Nicole was working at a health fitness place. And I was working for my mom. And so we wanted to go to college, go to my community college. And dormit San Diego State. But mom's like, we're going to have to work. And so we were like, okay, well what can we make the most money at? And who will hire us? And we're like, hooters. Perfect. You can be 18. We hear the cash is amazing. It's in California if a restaurant had a heart alcohol. You are spirits. You couldn't, you had to be 21 or over to waitress. So Hooters was just beer wine. And so yeah. So then we started showing the WWE pay per views. They were kind of, were they once a month or every couple months? Oh, at the Hooters, the pay per views would be on. So that's how we started to become really familiar with WWE. I know, is that hilarious? It's funny. And so then there was a program that WWE used to have called Diva Search. And so they were always on a search for like, new at the time they called women wrestlers Divas. Yeah. They were always on a search like looking for them. Okay. And I begged her to come with me to Diva Search. And I actually, I told them, like I have a twin sister. But at the time Nicole was looking to play pro soccer in Italy. All right. And so, cause she had broken her leg, our senior year of high school. And then after it healed, she really wanted to make a comeback. Okay. And soccer. So you were really, really good at that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, she did always get first place with a lot in soccer. And I was right behind her. But you're right behind. But I always like to think I was more artistic than her. And I shared that part of the women. Yeah. You got the creative side. I got more the creative side. Yeah. But you were just the free bird at that time. You wanted to follow the musicians. Yeah. So Nicole, I did. My twenties. So then Nicole, I just told her, I'm like, just come with me. Let's check it out. And if you don't like it, go to Italy, play soccer. If you do, then we'll become wrestlers. So her and I showed up and we showed up in like sneakers, ripped up jeans. And we made these shirts that said, breezy for cheesy, Nicole for show. And we had Van Danis because we wanted to be the coolest. Yeah. Nicknames ever. But we were kind of shocked at what all the women were wearing. And we're like, oh. What were they wearing? They look like go-go dancers. I guess you could say a lot of sparkles and like those kind of skirts. Like the two, two feel skirts. Yeah. And she was so mad. I was so mad at her. But like when you're driving there, are you thinking like, I don't wrestle? Yeah. We just thought they were going to like test our like athletic ability. Okay. And we're like, we're naturally athletic. Okay. I literally remember my preparation for the U of S. I was like running around the track, like doing the mile. Like we literally were at the gym. I'm making like, like Bree tells me, yeah, we're going to go to see the search with wrestling. And I'm like, okay, I'll go. Yeah. People will show you. That's awesome. Kind of like how you see the glow now when the girls get in the ring and they're like, ah, and you see them like pushing and doing weird stuff. I figured maybe something like that was going to happen. Like I didn't know. Yes. But it turned, it was way different than what we thought. And kind of at the time they weren't prepared for twins. So to think of twins going through and to the top 10, they just were like, oh, we don't know if we're ready. But actually Kristen Prowdy, who you know, she pulled aside and was like, we're really interested in you guys. And we're like, we want to do this, but we were kind of like a little down from that day just because like we knew twins couldn't go through. And we felt like they didn't really like us. And they could have picked one or the other. Yeah. I'll be honest, like a lot of the girls were extremely sexy and Nicole and I just never knew our sexiness. Like we kind of, we were the machinis with like, yeah, better tutors. It was like, I think we're, when you're with the San Diego girls and you, you probably know, like in California, it was like, we met actually our best friends in the whole world. We're still this strong group and people always be like, where do you guys meet? We're like college, but we are gonna do it. Yeah. We're at the same bathroom and they all kind of like, we're drawn there in the same way. Yeah. And we are just the girls that like watching football and have you here. We're just, we weren't, I don't know, like, very natural. Yeah. Yeah. But Kristin Pouti just told us like all these great things that we could do with WWE and they offered us to go to McDonough, Georgia, which they called the deep South get, get in the ring and kind of try it. Yeah. So we flew to McDonough, Georgia, we got in the ring and we fell in love. We were like, you loved it. Yeah. You know what it was is an Akona, we're kind of like a little confused what we wanted to do in life. Nothing felt right. We got in that ring. A lot of young people relate to that. By the way, that one says, yeah. That's true. And the minute we got in the ring, it's something we never knew growing up. It was nothing that was ever introduced to us. It was something we found and we instantly connected with. And her and I looked at each other and we go, whoa, this is what, and it gives me goose bumps. This is literally what we have been searching for. See, I think that's how it works, by the way. I don't think, I don't think most of your dreams in life show up in the package you expect to see. I don't think so. Or even your spouse in many cases, right? Maybe I've been told it. But once they do show up, there's this instant intuition you have almost like I belong here. Or it's along with this person. There's like a belonging that you feel. I think when you find something, that's sort of a trip. I mean, let's be honest, you're working at Hooters, you go, they don't want you. Yeah. Right. And then you still, you still pursue it though. So that's the other thing too, that people need to learn, especially young people to watch this. Like that dream may not just reveal itself to you and ease. Like it's just automatic. Like things don't just fall right into place easily. You have to push through some of these walls and barriers, right? And you guys are obviously pointed out. Yeah. And take those chances. I think sometimes people are so afraid to step outside of the box. Or I mean, did I ever think I was going to become a professional wrestler not that time? Like if I was to tell anyone, they're like, wait, what are you going to do? Right. But I didn't have that fear of like, no, yeah, that's what I'm going to go do. And I'm going to try it out. And even when my mom was like, no, my grandfather was like, no, we were like, yes, no, we're going to do it. Huge. Because those two things, by the way, when I interviewed people, those two things, the two things are what stop everybody. The initial like family, actually, people that love you going, you're not stopping. Don't chase that being normal, like conform, right? So you didn't listen to those things. Yeah. And we were in serious relationships at the time. And we were 22 years old at the time. Yeah. Yeah. We were 22 years old at the time, both dating older men who we went and told like we want to be professional wrestlers. And we're going to move to Tampa, Florida. They were like, no. And I don't ever forget. I was with my boyfriend at the time for two years. And he looked at me and goes, you're just all of a sudden going to pick up your stuff and move away from me. And across country, I mean, moving from our now way to Tampa, Florida. Yeah. And so I was like, in my heart, I feel like I need to do this. And I just want you to support me on this. And even though I was 22, so in love, I told myself I'd never let a man hold me down. And I wasn't going to make a decision based on him. And we packed up our, was it an Nissan Sentra? Yeah, Nissan Sentra. Nice ride. Yeah. What was it in Malibu? No, it was a Sentra. It was a Sentra. I think it was a Sentra. But we, her and I were like, we sold one car, we backed all our stuff in one, and then we drove to Tampa. I got to tell you, no matter what it is, such a trip, man, because your career is like totally unique, right? Right. But no matter what it is, when I interview people that have become really successful, there's these threads. And like a lot of them is, they didn't show up like what I thought. I kind of took this risk. My family didn't want me to do it. I sacrificed. I can't tell you how many people have loaded up cars or moved into apartments or like step, I guess what I'm saying is they stepped way back first. Yeah, right. Like you were goo-ders, you're probably doing pretty good. Drink it some beer on the weekend. Yeah. Have some good boyfriends. Life wasn't that bad. Now you're in a car. Yes. Sentra, I could picture you two. Oh my goodness. That's crazy. And were you both saying we're crazy or are you both like, we're going to try this. We're going to do this. Well, there was like an excitement. Yeah. I think it was. There was because as waitress says, we were making good money and then it went from what we make in one night to almost what we were going to make in a week. So we were even taking a big cut. Yeah. With our finances in, but her and I, it was just that connection we had with WWE that was so innocent that even though if we fail, we were like, we have to do this. We have to. And her and I were never. The thing about Nicole and I is we don't have ego. So we're never scared to fail. Because for me, like my mom told us growing up, you can't live with no regrets. Like my mom's like, you wake up in the morning and you regret something. You will hate yourself. So my mom always embedded that in us. And Nicole and I've always lived like that with no regrets. Even if we fail, it's like, boy, try it. You just suck at it. So it's such huge, like things that you do really naturally, the two of your like huge lessons for other people. Like all this stuff, especially the young people who find they need to hear this stuff. Like you don't want to have regrets. You're like, I'm old now, man. I'm 47. I'm so glad I took risks when I was younger. Yeah. And I'm not sitting here now lamenting things I didn't try because I did fail at other people. Other things, right? So I totally want to acknowledge the power you just said. It's awesome. So you go there, obviously something clicks. You're in Tampa. What's that first night? Did you say it was a Monday night Raw that you were in? No. It's Friday night to smack down. We are in Pittsburgh. What was that like? Was it? I wanted to know. I was so blurry going down. But, you know what the time? We were blurry like you were blurry like... I'll never forget because... So she'd... They're like, you guys are going to come up next Friday. We're going to debut. One twin's going to be under the ring. The other one will have the match. Then we'll do a twin switch. Also, she breaks her nose the next night at FCW. Oh my gosh. I mean like, so bad. You could barely see my eyes. Yeah. I look like a dinosaur. Like it was... I didn't even look human. Oh my gosh. It was so bad. So a lot of makeup. I was like, or I could punch you in the face. I was like, no thank you. So then... She... They ended up having me. It'd be my name. Brie Bella coming down the ramp. And she... Nikki... Nikki hadn't debuted yet. So we did the whole twin switch. But I'll never forget... Oh my goodness. FCW didn't have TV at the time. Like there's NXT now. So nobody knew who we were. So we were going to be able to get away with it. But we were semi-main event. When they announced my name, the crowd went dead quiet. Well, but you say... But say everything before with our outfit. Well, so the outfits that we had and then we spent money on it. We came Brie and I always wanted to be prepared. So if we ever got called up on the road. We went and had like these three beautiful outfits. Very Britney Spears inspired. Because we lived there at the time. And we just wanted to have gorgeous TV outfits made. And so if we ever got the call, we were going to be like, looked so well together. But the girls didn't allow us to wear. Which I understand it's being new girl. And you have to deal with the veterans. And at the time, like WWE isn't like that anymore. And I think it's because a lot of us who are now the veterans went through it. I feel like there's no reason but someone threw that. But they just had a lot of roles. It was like swirting. We walked in. Nope, nope, nope. We're like, okay. And we actually got dressed. We changed. Yeah, you changed way down. We changed in the public bathroom down the hall. So we had no idea what to do. And we weren't about to like rock the boat with the other girls. So the seamstress at the time were like, what do you have in your bag? We're like, we have a teeny. And our workout pants from earlier. So they cut our day teeny. And they sew it on, workout pants that we wore earlier that day. And that's how we did it. No way. Yeah, I look back at those pictures and I'm like, oh, geez. But it worked. It worked. But it worked. So they call your name? You went blurry though. I did. I remember I was like in gorilla and everyone's like staring at me like, you got this, you got this. And then I hear my music. And they announce me. And then I hear the crowd go dead quite like, who's that? And I think they're all like, is she local? And I come out and like smiling. And I'm just like, my heart was about to explode. I was underneath the ring watching her on the monitor and I'm like, okay, what's the spot? What am I doing? Like this is, my nerves were like so bad. And I had to get loaded under. So they put me in like sweatpants and a sweatshirt. And then I go out with the crew and I'm hiding. But I was so nervous, I'm like, I can't even get this sweat. And because we're twins, she's nervous with me too. Yeah. Because if I don't perform good, it's on her as well. And I heard the crowd get dead quite. I'm like, oh no. Don't miss that. You didn't get pulled off though. It worked. Did you know it worked? Did you know it worked when you were done? You're like, we did it. Oh yeah. And the crowd actually got into the match. So I actually was like, and I was lucky to work with Victoria who honestly like, I was like, she had been there for so long. And when they're like, you have to beat her. Her and Nicole and I were like, wait, we have to beat Victoria. But she was so cool about it. And she helped me out so much in that match. And we got the crowd into it. And when I went under the ring, the crowd loved it. Okay. And then also, you know, Victoria went under and then she pulled Nicole out. But the crowd didn't know. The crowd loved that. They just loved that Victoria reached under and yanked Nicole out. She was a perfect person to do it because not only was she like this powerhouse, but she was so animated. Yeah. So she really sold the whole like twin thing going under the ring. And I think that also helped people believe in it so much. I think also like what you're doing also, you know, those lines that run through other things. And you prepare and you prepare. There are points in your life where like you have to get that moment. Like there's a moment and you got to deliver, right? And like you guys prepared and prepared and prepare that. Right. You don't deliver that night. You may be going to get any heat again, right? Yeah, exactly. Your heat might be gone forever. So it's so good. It's so good. Because that's so true. Yeah, you've got to hit your moment. You do. And we would, we had those actually and then being like a month straight because events love the joint switch. And so he would work with us and rehearse like this is the timing you have to get. And I'd be like, breathe. You don't have to go in. Go to rehearsal. And I'm like, did you say, did you say events work with you? Yeah. Really directly with all our twin switches, which was almost like more nerve wrecking than performing. Sure, sure. Because I wanted to make them so happy. Of course you wanted to make them proud, exactly. And so why does it work though? Like why did it work? What do you think it is about you two that's worked? You know what? I think for Nicole and I, I think as we're twins. And I think for us, the one thing we've noticed and you can say your part like out onto it. But as little girls, people would grab us and go like they're like, are you guys twins you look like? And we'd be like, yeah, they're like, no, her nose is this and her eyes are that and this and that. They, every day what happened to us. And they're like, but you're all the time getting, we'd get compared and then picked apart every day. So it made us very like confident because it was like we could never get insecure because it just happened. We got used to it. So I felt like we never were in competition because I always read it her on and myself on. So then we never got in competition with other people. So are you two, don't have that normal rivalry that you would think siblings have? No. So we never waste our energy. I feel like on going against a break against other people. We only use our energy to like help each other out and push forward. And I think that's how we made it work backstage. But I think how we made it work as our characters and people getting behind us on one match was, Breena, I have this, I think natural ability to connect with the audience. And I think sometimes that's what some of our superstars forget is you can't be a superstar in the WWE if you don't connect with the audience because our WWE universe, they make all of WWE. So our shows would mean nothing without our crowd. Right. We'd have no one just boo us or cheer us or say this is awesome or they make our stories happen. Yeah. And then I just realized that early on we just had that instant crowd connection. Yeah. And then we realized like this is about the fans. This isn't even about us. And I think they felt that like I think they've got the respect that we are giving to them making them a part of the show. Yeah. So I see that with you guys. Tell me about that. Like what's this Bella army whole thing you guys. They're amazing. And they started it by the way. They did. I was so very early on. So we had this crowd connection. Bre and I just started to learn like I was like, okay, so you mean something here if the crowd believes in you. Like and it could be booing or cheering. But if they don't make noise then no one cares. So you need to make them care. And so green I just became very interactive with our fans. We'd always think about them when we put matches together. We at that day and age it wasn't about like how big your moves are. I still feel it isn't about that now. It's about like what's going to draw them in and let them. Like believe this story. And so then social media came on. And I think Bre and I were just some of the first that were very interactive with our fans online. Like people like to ignore play the two cool but we're like, I'm not too cool. Like these people are the reason why I am cool. And so all of a sudden we are so interactive with them they started to call themselves the Bella army. So we embraced it. And then they were getting each other positioned. I'm the leader of this. And then we acknowledge the positions. And I think like I'll never forget when we were at the state fair and we saw Reba McIntyre perform. And we sprint into the way back and when she was walking on her bus there was a crowd of us. She waved and I swore she waved at me. And I was so young but that wave made me as a little kid. So excited to go to school and tell people all this and I'll never forget that because I want to do that for my fans. I love that. I want them to know like I see you. I see what you're saying. I see the help you need. I see the encouragement you give me. And I want to acknowledge that because I want them to feel good. It's just real with you though. Like now that I've met you like it's how you are. So it's not like some strategy. You know what I mean? That's what I love. It's that's so important. Like I think the whole like even with me with my group that you know that I work with or follow me on social media this whole like old school thing of like you're better or above the group of people is like major old school. Yeah. Unless you really think that way which means you're twisted right? Yeah. Like the two of you really are real. I said this earlier like very few people I meet are really comfortable with fame. Like they're really didn't alter you all that much. It magnified you. Yeah. Made you even better which is awesome. It's kind of like alcohol right or money. Money alcohol and fame are the same things they're magnifiers. They make you more of what you already are. So if you get a really good person a whole bunch of money they're typically more generous and more philanthropic and better. You have a crumudge and a bunch of money they're cheaper and more mean right? Right. You give a good person fame and they magnify themselves. They magnify the people and you guys really really do exemplify that's why you're so big. Thank you. That means a lot. So like there's all this stuff to talk about. So you obviously dominate on that. The show is incredibly popular and then you've split off now and there's now total bellows right? Yes. So now you've got your show. How's what's it like having it's got to be different. You're working at Hooters you grow up kind of on a kind of a farm time of environment right? You told me about your mom who will talk about in a minute. What's it like having fame though having cameras around you a lot all the time. Is that natural for you? Is it is there an adjustment that you had to make and what's that like? It's a big adjustment. I mean it's definitely yeah it's definitely become natural now but in the beginning like when the opportunity came to brain eye we definitely had a sense it wasn't an immediate yes and I think it's why it wasn't for us is brain I never crave to be famous so it was like oh they're gonna be on TV we both like let's talk about this this is our life this is gonna be our relationships we want this stuff out there but then we said if we say yes we have to put everything out there yeah we have to be an open book and so it took us like two weeks to like discuss and then I told my husband well at the time we were just boyfriend-girlfriend he's like I don't think we're entertaining I'm like I think you're right I don't think we're entertaining I don't think anybody thinks they're entertaining I'll be right obviously obviously you are there's something to it so you're willing to put it all out there which is really interesting yeah totally and I think that's why like we got the spin-off total bellas and why total divas did become such a massive success not only because I think the whole world wanted to see behind the scenes of one is wrestling but Green I was so organic we were just us and I think the world was craving realness yeah because so many people go to Front Street and they are they just they're they act like there's something they're not but just smokey mirrors right 100% and we're like no we're these normal people that live like this and we do this and we really like to drink and we don't have filters yeah I like and we say what's on our mind yes people laughing some people like I can't believe so that I'm like we went was that like what's on by the way I gotta say this to you what is on people's minds as they watch me you yeah like they would want me to ask you a couple these things so I need to do that so both of your husbands are part of the show to from time to time they're interesting dudes yeah I'm sure future husband your husband and so for you I'm curious so you've had a lot of change the last few years oh my gosh you've had a baby so talk a little bit about what I don't know the easy question like how's it have being a mom that's like a generic like right what surprised you about it I want to know that and then secondly your husband Brian or Daniel Brian he's coming back right and so there's been this three year really struggling your family between his injury and being out of the business you being in the business having baby tell us about that and then the baby part what surprised you about yeah you know it's crazy with the baby part I think especially being a new mom before having birdie I thought birdie comes she's gonna walk into my life I'm still gonna do everything all these like type of stuff but what I didn't know is the love that you would feel and that all of a sudden everything that was important to you just took notches down and birdie all of a sudden it's number one and we were traveling like for the royal rumble and it was right when birdie first started teething and then she got a fever and got sick and I all sent out she was getting RSV and we went to the hospital and I remember seeing the hospital with her and she was on my chest sleeping and I was kind of like what the hell am I doing like my baby's number one and in that moment I was willing to almost drop everything and that's I was not I had no idea what that kind of love felt like I love my husband and I love my sister and everything your child is that love is the most I have unconditional thing that's no that's the difference though I don't think I think you love your spouse condition they can't cheat they can't do this right your baby could do whatever I know I know they can they can kill somebody you love your baby right it's unconditional I just was not expecting you a lot I just never knew it yeah and it's crazy because it will make you change your whole life that's wonderful and you know with my husband I think it was one of the best things for him because when Brian had to retire a couple years ago from WWE he had a major breakdown and the one thing he's been fighting kind of his whole life is depression and that really amplified it and in our marriage it was hard because I have a lot of energy I'm a very positive person but the doctors kept telling me you can't change him like you can't say but all these other things are so great because to someone who deals with depression it's not right and so they're like you got to take a step back you got to give him space you need to let him brave he has to find it himself happiness and that was really hard on me because I'm like I want to nurture and help everyone and but you know like my husband even said in his speech I kind of was like listen you want to wrestle figure it out and if WWE won't allow it maybe someone else will but go to all the doctors like they had one doctor say no go see the NFL doctor see this doctor and that and he did he paid for his own flights to Denver to New York to Jupiter Florida we were lucky enough in Phoenix to have the NFL doctor there every single doctor was like you're healthy you are healthy yeah you can perform but every time you go to you know WWE they're just like you know and I will say not only was it protocol but the WWE cares about Brian what I was gonna say and they kept trying Brian we're looking at your next 20 years yeah we're not looking at your next two years in the ring we care about your well being which as a wife I was like I do too but I'm also looking at my husband who wants to wrestle and that's the only thing that makes him happy and life's too short so wonderful there's a video that y'all can watch on YouTube of when he got back in the ring and he was in character but he gets back in the ring and he decides to talk about his comeback and instantly he leaves character just starts talking about you and what you did for him and by the way that is a great thing about WWE because I work with a lot of NFL guys and their doctors the reverse oh you're fine you're fine you're fine because they just want that product out there so I think it's I oddly it's wonderful that they care about his life that way the other piece too that's interesting to watch and this is for all of you that struggle with depression too because a lot of the people I work with do one of the things that's a catalyst in causing it to exaggerate itself is lack of physical activity so like when you already struggle with that you've got to move your body regularly you've got to work out regularly because depression is actually a physical move too and so it can be triggered by a lack of physical activity so he had like the double whammy going to some extent where he struggled with it a little bit and then he's probably not as athletic anymore as he once was when he was hurt and that'll make it flare so one of the triggers out is actually working out and moving your body just so you all know that is a trigger to get out so yeah well you know what's crazy is he I know he needs to work out because the doctors told me that too but when birdie first came I'd complain to call him like Brian's at the gym every day for three hours and I know I can't get mad but like I'm here with an infant that it is it's crazy how workout makes him change changes your state changes your state it's like a it's a major major trigger for most people so so you got good things going girl you got the baby you got Bernie you're coming back too right you're gonna be back soon I had a match at Royal Rumble and I that kind of made me think I need to rethink my comeback and I just want to wait a little longer until I feel really settled with birdie and sure that I can do stuff it was funny because I told Brian I'm like well the mix match challenge sounds really interesting and I'm like maybe I can come back and do a fun story with you on that okay so it's definitely in my future I'm just trying to pick I thought I could do it quickly and we've gotten back in shape quickly oh thank you obviously you don't look like you've had a baby 11 months ago but so you're in a great season of your life though so you've got the programs cranking you've got your you're kind of coming back he's come back the baby such a great time in your life and I'm happy for you by the way thank you that means a lot and then for you you your deal is interesting too so those of you that don't know Nikki is getting married to get tell you when but getting married to John Cena yeah yeah yeah and so it's a great time for you too and so tell me a little bit about that what's it like for you I'm curious because now there's you know you have this too but now there's two super well-known people your travel schedules are bananas right so how do you navigate all that stuff I'm curious it's very difficult it's taken some therapy I'm not gonna lie yeah I'm like so for therapy I think it's just it's nice to have that neutral person sure because sometimes when our communication can just get a little lost because someone mainly me wants to hear one thing in a moment but John and I have made it work we've been together five and a half years will be six years in August and I will say that since we got engaged in April I mean it's been almost a year we barely have seen each other I want to say we have probably have shared our bed 40 days well yeah maybe a little more he says a little more and I'm like I feel like I can count them all but we just both have been so busy but I think why we work so well if we both are so supportive of our careers and like John Hobo should I say no to this movie like I have to be on set the song and I'm like absolutely not because I don't want you to ever take an opportunity for me and I will never take one from you but you have to make those sacrifices like okay I know I could be at home these three days but I should go to set and see John or John's like these three days I could be in Tampa but I know I should go all the way to West Coast and see Nicole on her set and so we both have been really great about that and I have to say that his health especially because I still agree we're older and like we've been together a while so our wedding like wedding playing bliss is a little different I think when you're in that first two years of being together it's like whoa we're getting closer to the seven-year itch yeah so there's certain things that we're stressed and I'll be like we've been together a really long time you guys letting people in the candle is a way different way differently really have thank goodness have figured out a way because I'm not gonna lie it gets really tough when you're waking your partner for so long oh yeah I thought people really do have a busy spouse when you have two that's magnified the show is interesting because at least it appears as if you've been real about that dynamic too on the show yeah your relationship with them like marriage the whole thing like whether it was gonna happen whether he wanted to have more than you know all that kind of stuff has the show helped hurt or neutral the relationship really um I times it's definitely hurt because you have to relive those really tough moments and I because I am such an open book John is anonymous yes that's right I see that private so then you put that in the mix and he'll be like I can't believe you talked about that and I'm like well we I was in a normal conversation with my sister you guys but the cameras are rolling and I'm like I don't know they're rolling or not I'm so beyond that and that that's the stuff that will like start an argument when it wouldn't have been an argument but then there are times where I feel like it's helped because I have a hard time communicating like I'm just such a pleaser by nature so it is forced me to talk about things and John will be like I mean I guess I have to give a whole world involved you really know how you but um so those are times where I'm like okay it's been a plus it's forced me to communicate with my significant other but then it's just hard to relive those moments and it was hard to be the girl that like yeah hey I'm that girl that the guy doesn't want to marry her have been with me that was like really tough and like when I would like see him talk about it too in the media I'd be like dang like did you really have to do today show and talk about that right this topic right but so now I'm loving all his media lately because he's like just lovey-dovey yeah I noticed that so lovey-dovey talking about this and that so now I'm like oh I like how this because I saw him saying an interview that one of the things on the show that was good for him is watching himself back a little bit too though right like what struck me about it was I'm from the wing I'm from Massachusetts all so visually so I relate to being one way like on and then privately I'm really introverted and when we come from that part of the country there's this sort of buttoned up and miss that we have you guys haven't that you're so true and I've noticed that in him he's got this persona and then he's got this other side that he's private and he's introverted and I think part of that is our personality but also where we grew up I'm from the same area of the country it's true so there's an element of that that someone from San Diego or you know you're up there yeah so it's a little bit different I just I just noticed that that's different so that's cool it's so true and it's not about that because I always feel I'm like you get so corporate like who's enough yes you the guy that I get to see it's like well no I mean I am at times like no you're not your face changing but I watched that dynamic and I have other friends that are on some reality shows and one of my buddies keeps telling me goes well they just edit me that way I'm like no dude you're that way that's an actual camera and you actually said those things yeah I don't know okay I'm like you get so stirred I'm like believe me I'm troubled by you but it is oftentimes for the male it is like snippets of moments whereas it's more a breadth of content with you right so but my buddy struggles that and they usually keep catching a catch him and they they catch my buddy sort of in these buttoned up cold moments and I'm like you're way warmer and you know and I bet you he is too so and he's showing that more in the interviews totally and the interviews and even in his movies you see like John's doing improv but he's so good at it because that's who he is he's hilarious hilarious weird and funny his instagram feed is weird and funny right you want to go check out it you want to check out it if the dude has way more followers than me and you should go check out seeing his instagram because it's crazy it's kind of crazy it's it's there's not a lot of them like it I just saw the other day I was trying to figure it out why doesn't think into this yeah this is like what it means and I'm like okay yeah just making sure like we're all okay it takes me a while when I watch I have to like process what the heck he's doing that so cool congratulations to you too thank you on the wedding whenever it ends up happening we won't talk everybody so let's segue a little bit into biz because the two of you are the reason I wanted you on the show is actually not WWE it was I think I want to feature people but particularly women that I think are branding marketing and business experts that come from wherever they come from and so you too exemplify that I think you're exemplary business women and even our conversations off camera it's obvious to me what you're gonna do your career is gonna have legs even beyond this right because you're branding yourself so let's talk about that just for a second just branding in general are you guys conscious of a brand that you have I know the answer to that but do you think about that do you ever talk about like you are brand you know protecting it and and that sort of thing so talk about that for me yeah I mean we do want to search and we we re and I constantly talk about that and I feel like we did in the beginning we we wanted to be this brand that no matter where it was going or how it was growing or where you would see you'd always recognize it and you always know it was Bella twins but we also wanted to have this brand that had meaning and had passion like just how Bree and I live life and something that can make a great change and so that's like when the brand started as these wrestling girls we knew that a key to growing our brand was always adapting so always seeing the change of the audience but then becoming these characters that how kids look at like Wonder Woman or Superman that when they see a Bella twin they're like that's Bree Bella that's sneaky Bella and so I feel like our characters were first how we branded so when I do an appearance anytime I I'm in my Nikki Bella outfit because that is immediate kid when they see me they're like wait that's Nikki Bella like the snap back and the shoes and the socks and the jersey and so that was like my first our first way yeah and it was interesting yeah little bit it shows oh Superman yeah I never leaves without his cape or Wonder Woman without her crown and wow that's one yeah my snap back is like my crown yeah and the one thing that Nikki and I wanted is for so long in WWE we did have to be twins twins and dressed identical but because of Total Divas we saw how different we were yeah and he was like you guys we asked we go you know now Total Divas really showcasing that I'm more earthy and Cole's more glam can we bring that to the ring and he was very like open to it and and we were lucky that Total Divas was so successful you know in the first season and so the minute we did that and we branded ourselves like not only are we the Bella twins but Bree is this way and Nikki's this way I felt like it made like a bigger connection with the audience and our fans because they got to know who we were instead of just these two girls that did everything I didn't I mean they make us talk identical it was like the worst and we were grateful for those times but so I that was definitely our first way branding and then it was just we're gonna really listening to our fans so the Bella Army was cradys so when I started when we started to look at that here we were like okay these are Nikki and Bree these characters and now they have this army and that's a part of our brand what makes our brand is the Bella Army and so that started so when we acknowledged the Bella Army I was getting beat up on TV every week because this one got fired by the boss Storyland Wyas and they started calling me fearless Nikki the fans started calling me that so I was like you know what that needs to be my name so I went to W.D. Shock and I was like hey guys should I talk to about branding myself as fearless Nikki and they're like oh wow we never thought of someone like having you know their name and I'm like I want this because that's what my fans call me so all of a sudden you made a logo and here's fearless Nikki and I thanked the fans and I kept them a part of it which started to make the brand bigger then naturally this one gets buzzed on um to be on total divas and I'm like high school of called at Bre mode I should say college so Bre mode became a huge deal on the reality show but then I noticed the WWE fans would channad or say stuff but I was like I cared a lot about my younger audience so I was like with wrestling how can I make Bre mode stand out because the fans love it but it means something to an adult and to a kid so I would start screaming it before I do a missile drop kick or my big running knee so I kind of started doing Bre mode activated like all of a sudden I would fire up so I was a good guy to beat up and then all sudden I'd start coming up coming up and then the minute I scream Bre mode the crowd knew like okay you just hit the wrong button with Bre and then I would do my comeback and then it started meaning something to the little kids and meant like that's when I get amped but then to the mom they come up and go I was in Bre mode last night and I'm feeling it and that's brilliant but like honestly that's brilliant I did that so that would be difficult when we came up with the shirt designs the first they were thinking girly and I go no no no it just needs to be unisex she knew she would have two different types of customers I knew I'd have the ones who wanted to wear it to get drunk and then the ones who wear it because they love my wrestling and would come and like so we made just the red with the big black letters Bre mode and anyone can wear it and it means something different that's brilliant by the way I'm so stupid I actually thought that storyline was true where you were fired I was actually gonna ask you about it oh really believeable they did they did very well yeah I had so much fun working with Stephanie oh it's so awesome so we so then we have that brand very now have branded names and we have our branded looks and we have this amazing fandom the Bella army and Bre and I wanted to continue to grow it we and that's I mean since day one we've wanted to break barriers as women in this country and total thank you total diva started to help give us that power of really breaking barriers because more women the middle girls were coming to shows to watch the total divas so it started to give women more time on tv and a lot more people did appreciate women's wrestling and then triple h just took a huge investment in the women down at nxt so with the power of total divas on the main roster and then the power of what the nxt women were doing it was like women were just dominating and so to continue our brand Bre and I always wanted our brand to have passion and meaning and to continue to grow it and adapt with it and nothing was more perfect than being a part of this amazing women's revolution and Bre and I truly have passion and just a big part of our hearts is to even now continue to help the women like break barriers whether it's promoting them or giving them advice or just helping them to fix the next level because there's still so much more we could do as women there oh yeah but then that's how we came up with Bre and I love it because we're like how can we branch off and still like have the Bella twins brand and have these branded superheroes but then also continue to reach women in a different way and empower them and so we were sitting on a plane and we're like okay so how can we do this without taking bumps because we're gonna hit a certain age and we're not going to be able to be in that ring as much right or the little kids might not think we're that cool but everyone thinks Superman's still cool so I don't know maybe they'll still think we're cool and wonder woman but we came up with Verdi being what was crazy was um we came up with we're just like looking online about stuff well because at first I said I don't want to make just any type of product I want something that's in need because I am hippie and I get anxiety when I see so much stuff out there we're so impressed by taunts yeah but I was kind of like why don't we get into feminine hygiene because everyone needs feminine hygiene well women need feminine yes well women yeah everyone and then Nicole yeah and then Nicole was kind of like what we could create a whole big brand around it like it doesn't a community like it doesn't have to just be those products and then we started doing some research on the plane it's like well what's kind of in need because you feel like everything all the markets are like just over satchered like every there's stuff everywhere right but I really was like not a lot of people are doing like panties where it's like co-pie for you and I'm like there's nothing direct at the time when we have this idea there was nothing really then directed towards working out that this is the right fabric I should wear working out or I should wear during the day or do I wear panties and I decided to research what doctors were saying and I was like braid did you know that we were supposed to be doing this yeah and that I'm like how am I I think we're 31 at the time I'm like how am I 31 years old and I'm just about all this yeah and with the rise of all the different like cervical cancer and breast cancer and Nicole and I'm like is it because the fabrics close to your body are so cheaply made that we don't realize it so her and I really like started investigating so much and that's embroidery these birds and the bees that's how we like we just stay together it's brilliant and by the way for the men who do this this is a brand like I already just did this so this is a brand men should be engaged with on behalf of their women and behalf of their daughters right we we should be consuming this too because what I love about it is and I want to say this to everybody the reason I love you too is like I love how your brand was acquired in other words and I don't mean to demean anybody else but like if you're looking for women to believe in to be something that your daughters or you can be proud of to support their brand you've heard how they've acquired their fame how they've acquired their success it's the right way right there's no and I don't mean this in any other anyway but there's not a tape floating around or some sensational thing that took place these are women who acquired their fame the right way and you leverage it the right way and the brand is awesome because it's I was looking through everything it's a really a combo of both of you it's really earthy yet it's it's an important for their health etc but it's glamorous too totally there's like sexiness to it it really is so it's important it's really awesome and I want to support this brand I want the men that are watching this program to understand that the females in your life need to be engaged with them and the ladies this is obvious to you this is something you can be proud of it's healthy for you and it's good for you it's going to grow it's just going to be great how do they find birdie be though let's just make sure they know that but they go to birdiebeet.com yes birdiebeet.com make sure y'all go there and so I'm I'm super impressed with the way y'all are branding yourself like this is how you're supposed to do it and this is going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and I want to help you with it too thank you that means so much we need to do that we need to promote the brand on the show a little bit more too and also what I love like in addition to birdiebeet is you guys like wine no wine no some super super fired up because yeah we really got that again we feel like we should be the mares of Napa Valley is that right why that's how we got that much are you there that really we're killing their vineyards like you said that's like almost like that my mouth was just a lot of wine it was like we saw that Opus 1 bottle let's go should have a beer in the show yeah it was it was breena we're going there so much we made like well we've made such great friends yeah and on the show we are starting to really get known as wine o's and this is an amazing thing that was really awesome look at the dolphins sorry there they are I told you oh wow I told you that is amazing so I got you dolphins hopefully I'll get you a whale too yeah couple minutes I told you I'm and there's two Nicole there they are you got it there's at least two cute I love that um so yeah we were just going to Napa Valley a lot and everyone knew us as wine o's all of a sudden all our gifts from our Bella army were turning to wine bottles yeah it was amazing I was like this is awesome and so finally it was some of the winemakers that were like do you guys want to get into the business and we're like we thought you remember us what it was also a dream like we're like wait really like us and then like not the wine snob but the the women that appreciate wine I was like well I mean I was gonna be this cheap wine that we're just gonna throw like Bella twins on it because I don't want to do that yeah we don't want to just sell stuff like I want to have a great wine and they're like oh do you think we want to do that yeah let me appreciate wine so that's like a good and then next thing you knew we're working with the son of Hill family state Ryan Hill and then I don't know if you know Tusca state yes Tim Martin Tusca state okay that's another partner and then his business partner more yeah okay who engaged branding all five of us just we're like okay we're gonna do this and we're all gonna invest some money we know where to get grapes and then we're boutique we're small but now in case it's here you know many are gonna do well it's crazy because we've had three test runs and we've sold out our red wine sold out within a 38 hour 38 hours yeah our white white was 12 at the Sauvian block was 12 hours and our ros\u00e9 was a minute and 30 seconds get out of here and so yeah yeah and you guys buy it all or did other people know I've been this one I actually didn't even get a bottle ros\u00e9 I was like Sam I'm like compute the computer system wouldn't shut down so we oversold by so much because so many people hit it and it over all it we all were like we were thinking because the other one was 13 hours and 38 or whatever so we were prepped for like all of us were off doing our own thing and they were trying to get a hold of us like you guys this isn't one shut down the lady who was running it was freaking out so we were like wait what happened they're like we just oversold our ros\u00e9 I'm like it's we went on sell at 9 a.m. I'm like it's 9.05 that's crazy that is crazy crazy we were just like oh my goodness and it's funny because the corn I feel so bad for because there was a lot upset fans so we yeah so we printed out like oh stuff and we're signing the stuff to send them like just like sorry and so Torwine's coming so Torwine's coming so the name of the wine is just so they know the name of the wine is Faller-Ridicci which is beautiful roots in Italian and the reason why we came up with that name is all of us have some farming roots um all of us partners so we and some of us are Italians but we all were like we have these beautiful roots and wine brings beautiful conversations and it brings up the roots and that was like why we wanted to have a name that captured people that gave a good conversation a good topic and then we wanted good art for our bottle and in our label we know how many people love labels and when you talk you like to hold it and show it so we we wanted something that had more a high fashion film so we got this artist from Paris and she does like all high fashion and so she had brina's inspiration but we didn't want it to like be like us but I think that's what's so cool about our labels you're like is that the bellows or are these two women I know it takes you back so I'm so excited for you guys yeah thank you we don't have that much time left unfortunately but one of the things probably my favorite thing about your brand isn't even all of this and I love all of this I love watching young strong business women build their brands build their companies and have business lines like the two you have but one of the things that I love about WWE particularly because I've watched the McMans do this for years and now you guys do it and John is the number one giver of Make A Wish grants and it's the philanthropic I get choked up on that sorry yeah oh I love that so the um it's the charitable stuff that you all do that WWE does and he does as well John does and Make A Wish is my I'm involved as well and so I'm so for fiance is the number one giver of wishes to children ever and so I love that I know me too I love the the philanthropic piece that you all give back so just talk a second about how important that is to you talk about that just for a second why that's so important to you guys well you know it's crazy because my husband um WWE works with Connor's Cure and I was lucky enough to be really close with Connor because he was such a huge fan of my husband but to see how all that went down it was a YouTube video and people kept tweeting Brian about it and then finally Justin he was a ring announcer to be he was like hey have you seen this he's like I have he's like I got in touch with the dad can you do something and so Brian like showed up and surprised him and I'll never forget Connor's face being able to put him in a headlock and it was this whole ordeal and you know Brian I always talked about this in Nicole and I too when we are connected with that those fans and those people it makes you go this is all everything else can go but this I will do the rest of my life because it's the energy it's the way you feel and it's the way they make me feel like you know while we say we put smiles on kids faces but they don't realize they put a smile on our face and there's times you do walk away and you get upset and like so many times when you're leaving the hospital especially now that I'm a mom but I also think like I needed that I needed just such an innocent soul to just refresh my life and make me realize what's truly important in life and that's wonderful I just love giving back because they get so much to us yeah anything for me and I know Brie feels the same but I I do all this because I want to have a purpose like I have to have a purpose when I'm putting so much passion with things and at the end of the day for me it's to make some type of change in this world for the better yeah it's either to change one person's life that like the day I leave here that someone's like she really helped me that's why I do reality reality can be tough at times but I can't tell you how many women come up to and go he said no to me for like so many years straight but you give me hope it's more hugs than the Starbucks line than I do but I'm right there with you girl let's hug it out yeah but it's I always think like if I just if I didn't have a purpose there'd be no reason like I love the life I live and I'm so grateful for it and I think that's it at the end of the day is especially when I see the make a wish kids I'm more grateful for my health and happiness you could take everything else away but I'm so grateful for that and they remind me of that but I also want to give them that happiness and I just want to change things because why are we here for you know I know what I mean and that's what I'm so grateful to have such an amazing soon to be spouts like John because we both keep each other in check like we call our like fake life and so we'll sit it down like here's this fake life and then we'll like talk about things of this is real life and I love it yeah it's so amazing like and we just keep each other that we do those checks and balances but like John we're at the house and he had literally five hours so he had a week for the airport and he was home for I think a day and a half and there was a man that was diagnosed with cancer that lived an hour away and they're like he's your biggest fan our neighbor just come over and she's like I don't expect you to go see him but they give him like four weeks and his world got rocked he had a headache and then they're like you have brain cancer in here four weeks and he drove an hour and spent an hour with him and hung out with him and then yeah came back packed his bags and he was off and I just said like that's why we do what we do I love that by the way I know you mean it like it's interesting people talk about making their dreams come true talk about chasing things talk about giving to other people but you actually do it like that's the difference like you do it no and I want everyone to learn lessons talk is kind of cheap like you got to do it right and the reason you feel this emotion when they're talking is because they're doing it there's a power to actually doing it and so I got one more question I want I got 50 more I got like three of them but I'm curious for women maybe even young women that are watching this yeah what advice would you give them about their lives about chasing their dreams and you can talk directly to them if you want I'm just curious what you would say these young ladies who follow you when I say young that's all women frankly right but I mean you know this the women that the the Bell Army but all the people that they may be watching you guys for the first time today right they've never seen you before what advice would you give to young women well Nicole and I always have a thing we always say and it's you know we always turn our negatives into positives we always turn no into yeses and through our blood sweat and tears we realized anything was possible and you know where we're at today it didn't happen overnight took us a little over a decade and I think now sometimes we expect things to happen fast we expect to wake up in the morning have an idea give a little effort and think boom I should be successful but you have to enjoy the journey because the journey helped us grow as women the mistakes we made made me realize that whoa I just learned something my mom always say that like isn't it fun learning business and I'm like it is because there's so many times I failed and when I failed I was like okay never doing that again now I know it's this way and I just never give up and it's so important to like just take that leap of faith and just go for it I agree and I also you know I love being called fearless Nikki but I represent it so much because I truly feel you have to live your life fearlessly and everything that comes your way just stay so fearless and you don't want to have the regrets and I think also the most the best advice I could give is use your voice yes if you feel a certain way express it and don't be afraid of it there are times that I wish I communicated better with people or I stood up for myself and it took me years to learn it and I was like oh I wish I learned this earlier but I'm happy that I know it now right and that is just such I think that's the best advice ever give it is just use your voice and use it so strong and so fearlessly this was such a damn good conversation today I didn't want it to end I know you're really unique oh thank you no you are unique like there are many but I like the two of you before so wow thank you so much thank you thank you for this view yeah oh wait Nicole I saw a little blue thing no you can't make it up it's probably another bird way back there I am not even kidding imagining well you guys oh it's a bird I told you it was a bird that bird just messed up the whole wheel I did it and then you follow your advice yeah I think you're one it's nice to meet people like you too because I feel like it helps our energy and our excitement keep growing when we meet people like you it's just like me a co-test I'm working on I'm here for you absolutely gonna start throwing a coach coach coach hey listen everybody one thing you can find them on Instagram you can find them on their youtube channel is awesome as well oh yeah also go look for the ww
