We've got the border crisis completely overwhelming. The democrat media has ability to come up with some excuse for it. You've got Governor Abbott of Texas planning to have buses dropping illegals off in the Capitol. What will this actually do? I'll break that one down for you in just a moment here. Plus you have CBS News saying that they have learned more than 150 financial transactions involving Hunter or James Biden doing shady stuff in the financial world. Global business affairs were flagged by US banks for further review including large wire transfers. Oh, the Biden crime family. It's just so fascinating to watch this finally all come together. We will discuss. Have you ever wanted to invest in real estate but you knew you had no idea how to do it? That was me till a few years ago. I met my friends at Dunford, your real estate. I sat down with the founders in a conference room and I said, hey guys, tell me what you do. They explained it and they're thinking maybe they'll be advertisers on my show. We're having that initial meeting. At that first meeting, I said, I don't just want you guys as advertisers. I actually want to be a client and I became one. I invested in real estate by buying single family home in a growth market and Dunford real estate helped me pick the house, pick the market and took me through every step and I've had phenomenal results already. We're only talking about a few years here. Phenomenal results. I've bought several houses with Dunford real estate and I'm holding because I want to grow that equity over time and I want to have that cash flow coming in for decades to come. Go to Dunfordyoubuck.com to see how this whole process works. That's doneforyoubuck.com. One more time, Dunforyoubuck.com to begin your real estate investment journey today. Trust me, it's amazing what they'll show you what they'll take you through. I've had phenomenal success with Dunford real estate. All right, my friends. Now, let's talk about immigration for a second here. Governor Abbott has announced that he will be sending illegals to the US Capitol. This was the big headline this morning. Please play the governor's announcement for him. To help local officials whose communities are being overwhelmed by hordes of illegal immigrants who are being dropped off by the Biden administration. Texas is providing charter buses to send these illegal immigrants who have been dropped off by the Biden administration to Washington, DC. We are sending them to the United States Capitol where the Biden administration will be able to more immediately address the needs of the people that they are allowing to come across our border. Now, at some level, let's let's just be clear. I'm always going to be honest with you. I like the messaging here, but this is a political stunt. They're still going to be in the US interior and they have to volunteer to get on the buses. This is not using some detainment authority and then moving people. This is, hey, we've lined up buses for you. We're taking you straight to Washington, DC. Do you want to hop on? So given that reality, that means that how many people are actually going to do this? I don't know. How many of these illegals are really going to put themselves in that on those buses and then get dropped off in DC, but it does make the point here. And Ted Cruz also followed up with it in a tweet where he said that he believes that there should be buses dropping people off in a whole range of places. Fancy places where Democrats love to be. Martha's Vineyard, Nantucket, Palo Alto, Greenwich, Connecticut, Scarsdale, New York, Newport, Rhode Island, Rehoboth Beach, Delaware. I think that's where Biden's multi million dollar beach front home is. So yeah, drop off the illegal aliens in neighborhoods in places where Democrats like to summer, to summer as a verb, of course. Now the messaging here is absolutely correct. The ultra rich elite libs know that it's not going to affect their kids' schools because they send them to a fancy private school. It's not going to affect their healthcare because they don't go to the ER or to free clinics for their health care. They paid doctors probably have concierge doctors lined up. You think Nancy Pelosi goes to a waiting room somewhere and sits there for an hour or two, three, four, like you and I have had to? No. No, Nancy Pelosi has her staff call a MD who went to an Ivy League school to tend to her. By the way, Nancy Pelosi just tested positive for COVID entirely asymptomatic her staff says. I guess though, I mean, she did get COVID anyway, so you have to wonder, maybe she just should have gotten that fifth shot even faster. I'm sure she's boosted, probably double boosted. And fortunately for her, she will now have natural immunity, which is actually more durable, as we know, even though they lied about that for over a year, but I don't want to get too deep into the COVID situation right now. Here's what's going to happen at the border. They are going to kick this thing wide open and they're going to try to hide it from you. And the best way to hide it is to make the entry of a legal seamless. This is going to be happening all along the Texas border where illegals come in. They're going to be told that there's an alternative to detention. That's that's the way the Border Patrol refers to the process. Not even given a notice to appear in court necessarily because there won't even be time to go through that initial stage. They'll just be told, Hey, we're letting you in. And please show up and turn your I've talked to Border Patrol about this. So this is not, I'm not theorizing here. This is what Border Patrol agents think is going to happen. And they've been doing this for a long time. I mean, they they know how this is going to go. They're going to say, please turn yourself into an immigration authority and get in the system at some point. And guess what? That's actually not going to happen. Fat chance of that one. They will be given a phone. That's rather be given a free phone so that they can be checked in with here is Jen Psaki saying, yep, that's what happens. Here she is telling you exactly where your taxpayer dollars are going on. immigration. Our team in Texas is saying that you guys are starting to give smartphones to border crossers hoping that they'll use the phones to check in or to be tracked. Which part of that is supposed to deter people from crossing illegally into the States? Well, I think you have all people since you've asked me a range of questions on this topic over time would recognize that we need to take steps to ensure that we know where individuals are and we can track it and we can check in with them. Ah, yes, I'm sure that the government bureaucrats who are checking in with the illegals are going to do a really thorough and excellent job. And the illegals are going to pick up the phone they were given when it's a number they don't recognize and say, yes, of course, I will show up to the asylum officer meeting or the asylum court. Yes, of course, I will check in with integrations and customs enforcement. See it tomorrow. Sure, they will. This is how laughable the process has actually become. I mean, it's it's not a laughing matter, but it's absurd what they've done. And here we are, friends, watching this in real time, they're not trying to deter illegal immigrants from coming into the country. They're trying to make it seem like they are still the Democrats want to make it seem like they're still upholding the rule of law at some level. But that is not what is going on. They're creating as many loopholes as possible. Their problem is not with illegal immigration. Their problem is with the American people overall, knowing about the extent of the illegal immigration. That is the difference here. That is the reality of what makes them concerned. And you're going to have, I mean, this is all the estimates from the Department of Homeland Security. This is from the Biden government bureaucracy itself. You're going to have right now, you've got 8,000 apprehensions a day, 8,000 people a day are crossing the border saying, Hey, here I am. They're being they're being apprehended. I mean, arrested essentially, but it's not they're not tackling people and throwing the cuffs on them because they're surrendering themselves. They're not even trying to get away. Most of the time, they're saying, Yeah, here I am. I'm some of them are trying to get away. Depends. And then you have God always in huge numbers. We don't even know they estimate the God always in the hundreds of thousands over the last six months. I've spoken to Border Patrol folks who say that if the number they if the official number is three or 400,000 God always, it's probably double that in reality, because there are so many sectors of the border without any actual manpower deployed to them because they're doing the what they call humanitarian part of the mission, which is a real obviously important part of the mission to making sure people are safe, taking them to the hospital. If they're kids, they're dehydrated, they got to get them IV fluids or whatever. And that's that's what Border Patrol, frontline Border Patrol officers are doing. But when they get taken off the line to make sure that a 12 year old, you know, who has measles is getting the right, you know, care or whatever, they're not there to stop the importation of fentanyl in the country. And then the and I've seen this in real time. I sat there night vision goggles on with Texas National Guard watching as cartels would move the migrants on one series of rafts. And then as soon as they're picked up and all of the resources are processing and bring them in a mile down the river, they'll just see it. They'll pick it up on the sensors. Yep. They just they just ran through a go fast boat, basically. And with guys meeting somebody with a pickup truck, they all have backpacks full of fentanyl. That's how they do it. Think of how much money's at stake here for them. I mean, this is big business for the cartels and the smuggling is big business for the cartels. But how's the Biden administration handling this, making it easier for them and hiding it from you. That's the plan. Make it easier to come to the country illegally and hide from the American people. The reality of our lawless poorest open border. That's the whole program. That's the plan for the Biden administration. They're not going to make it any better. A million people they estimate after title 42 goes away in six weeks, a million people entering illegally. Think about that. That's in six weeks. Hmm. Yeah. Oh, don't worry though. Joe Biden, he's a law and order guy. You can you could trust Joe. You know, he's spinning the game. No, no, not a joke, folks. I look guy who's going to get the stuff done. Sure is. Did anyone really believe that anymore? He can whisper as weirdly as he wants. Doesn't make a difference.

Now, I try to be always truthful in my analysis and assessments. There are times when I feel like I could go a little further than I do with something, but I don't want to be misrepresenting the facts. I always want to stay within what I believe to be supportable by the evidence, by the data, and therefore what is what is true. So I haven't gone as all out with the groomer allegations about the left's agenda when it comes to children and the whole transgender kids at Disney and the opposition to the state law in Florida about parental rights and education. I say that definitely brainwashing, grooming, let me look at the evidence more. If there's a sympathy for groomers or something along those lines, because that's a very serious allegation. I mean, that's, of course, why the left is so outraged about it. It's a serious allegation, but also somehow it hits them. If somebody yelled at you, hey, you're a terrorist member of Al-Qaeda, you'd laugh. You'd laugh. Well, no, that's so stupid, right? But if you say that the left has a sympathy for groomers, they completely freak out. They lose their minds, which is interesting, isn't it? Well, I keep seeing more and more stuff that to me is deeply concerning and shows certainly an agenda to brainwash children from the left and from the biggest institutions that a lot of Americans turn their kids over to schools, obviously, in the case of the state law in Florida about not talking about gender identity and transgender issues to little kids, kindergartners, first graders, second graders, but even Disney. I mean, I grew up watching Disney movies. Disney was the great American content company, right? Well, there's also Nickelodeon, a kind of newer upstart, but similar to Disney appeals to kids too. This is just a few days ago. I hadn't seen this. Here is Disney. I'm sorry, Nickelodeon putting out a video of a kid celebrating transgender day and being a trans kid. In honor of International Transgender Day of Visibility, Meetime and Nickelodeon's 2021 Kid of the Year finalist, Rebecca Brussehoff. Growing up in the LGBTQ plus community has given me a different perspective on how I see the world. Trans kids are so much more than their gender identity, and it's so important for people to listen to kids. I wish for a world where everyone can be lifted up and celebrated. So today and every day we celebrate those who are helping others realize that everyone should be proud of what makes them who they are. Yeah, this is now very clear, not only brainwashing, but something else, something really nefarious going on here. Children of this age, talking about 10, 11, 12-year-olds, they are adopting this trans ideology because it is being pushed on them as fashionable and celebratory. All right, team, more tomorrow.
