    "text": " You're listening to Comedy Central. Learn the chilling truth about the traitorous FBI agent Robert Hansen in the podcast, Agent of Betrayal, the double life of Robert Hansen from CBS News. Binge the full series now wherever you get your podcast. Welcome to the day, Charlie Wong. Thanks, Trevor. It's my first time being here. It is your first time being here. I feel like it's been... It's been way too long. It's like I watch everything you do and I'm like a giant fan and then I see you everywhere else. Oh my God, you're like stalking me. No, for real. Congratulations on everything you've done. I mean, like we watched you blow up and stand up which everyone loves and then the thing that really brought me to you I was just seeing how you kick ass in movies as well. Oh, thanks so much. You're a movie star now. You realize that, right? It was really fun and I got to Mac on those three fine ass dudes. You watched the movie. That's true. Yes. It was like, who wrote this thing? Like, whose idea was this? She was in charge. You have Keanu Reeves fighting over you. I mean... I mean... He came to your show, didn't he? He came to my show which was amazing. He was so sweet and he was like in such a good mood. Afterwards too, he was really smiley. Yeah, it was the best. Do people get confused though if Keanu Reeves plays your boyfriend in the movie and then they see him at your show? Isn't someone like, I think it's real? No one fit. I mean, I'm cute or whatever but no one thinks that he really wants to date me. They were like, that movie was straight up fiction. Like, all my friends were like, Ali, you're cute but you ain't that cute. You have fans of your stand up. You have fans of your movies but a book is a very different medium for us to engage Ali Wong in your first book. And it's also an interesting style of book. You've written this book. Dear girls, it's specifically written to your children. Just to my two daughters. I have two girls who are under the age of four. And the first one was in that striped dress. When I filmed Baby Cobra and the second one's in the leopard dress. They're very aware of it too. They know which ones they were. And I wanted to, my dad wrote me this letter before he passed away and my real name is Alexandra and it was started with dear Alexandra. And he reflected a lot in our relationship and how I had affected his life. And it was a short letter. And I love it so much. Wow. But I wish that he had written me more because after he passed it was too late to ask him all these questions about when I was born. Like he was already this successful amesthesiologist. Right. And in the same way, like when my girls were born, they only know me after I filmed those two specials and they don't know what it took for me to get where I am. And how I... The grind before and I think that's such an important life lesson. And I want them to know that I struggled a lot and then I had to work really hard. It really is an interesting book because when I first got the book they were like, oh no, Ali wrote this for her two daughters. And I was like, oh this is going to be a cute little kids book. Oh no. And then she writes about a rectal dysfunction. Yeah. That she experienced all of New York. Yeah. And I was like, this is like, it's very... It's graphic and it's real. It's like, it's real. Like I'm assuming it's not for them now. No! They're like reading like, they're watching Daniel Tiger. I hope they watch like, it's so... There's so much like dirty content in there that they're even more dirty than my specials that I hope that they watch the specials long before they read the book. Right. But I mean, as much as it is for your daughters, it really is for women in general. That's what I love about the book because you're telling your story. And for instance, you share stories about stand-up comedy that I would have never thought of and have never experienced because I'm a man in stand-up. So for instance, you just talk about how much you have to love stand-up as a woman. Like you talk about like going to like walking to your car at like 1 a.m. by yourself. I think the reason, I think a big reason why there aren't more women who do stand-up. It's not getting on stage is the easy part. That's the fun part. And being funny is the fun part. But going on, you have to go on the road to be a great stand-up because you have to test out your material in all these different cities, in front of all these different audiences. And that's, it's a safety issue. I think that's why more women don't do it because when you go on the road, the first day you go out, as you know, you get into a car with four strangers. Always. Yes. And it's crazy. You just like get to a car and you'll, I never met this person before. Yes. They could kidnap you. It's like a random thing. And you're very kidnappable. Yes. But you could defend her. Because when we started was before Uber, before any of that, so what would be funny is you'd get to like a random town. This would happen, like every comedian has a story. You get to a random town. You're performing in a random comedy club. And then they'd just tell you like Jim is going to pick you up. Right. And you're like who's Jim? They're like he works with the club. You're like at the club or with the club. Yeah. There's no picture being sent to your phone. No. No. You know who Jim is. Some guys coming in some like 1975 tour of the Corolla that smells like the ghost of like a dead caulk sperm. And you're just like is this for real new? Every time you get in the car, there's always like you get in the car and the person says oh you can just throw that on the back seat. There's always something on the back that you have to throw. Oh my god. There's like old Fritos and stuff. Yes. Yeah. Yeah. So I can imagine how unnerving that must be. For a man that's like oh this is gross but so is my apartment. Whoever. Whatever. But for a woman it's like am I going to get killed? You like every time. Right. You know you think about that. It was like I think about the days when I started and I would never want my daughters to go through that. You also talk about like just the journey of your rise in comedy. You know you talk about your success, the grind that came behind it but then you talk about like just the experiences that you've had where someone you know many people in fact try to reduce you to just you know your factor. So they went like oh you're getting your successful just because you're Asian. Oh my god. There's like even now. Just because you're pregnant. There's so many there was a guy who I won't name names he's not a very successful comedian so I don't even know if you would know who he was. No I don't. But he came up to you wouldn't know you're out of there now. But he like came up to me while I was pregnant the second time and he touched my belly with his like fat sweaty hand which is so gross to begin with. It's like it's like why don't you finger me while you're at it. This is so not okay. Like just because I'm pregnant doesn't mean it's okay for you to touch my belly and he was like oh so this is your shtick. This is like your thing now right. And I'm like I was like getting pregnant is not rainbow suspenders. It's not a shtick. And then he was like you're so lucky Ali because you get all of this attention because you're both a female and a minority. And I was like yeah because you know historically that's always been the winning combo for recognition and success. And he was like and he was like you know what I mean. Me and just another white guy. And I was like be a better white guy. There's so many successful. There's like there's Jimmy Kimmel, there's Will Ferrell, there's Nick Crow, there's John Mulaney. I can name like I can go on this whole show for like 35 days. Will do like a show just like comedians just be a funnier white guy. Like that's it. So the girls are going to read the book. Girls out there will read the book. Women can read the book. Men can read the book too Trevor. I like that. I did. I did. I did. I did. So do you girls. My husband wrote the afterword too. It's very sweet. Yes he did. He wrote a beautiful thing about how like you consult with him about the jokes that you will tell about him on stage. Which is really nice. I like that. That was really sweet. It was very sweet. And what it's like to be married to me. You know because people that's the number one question people ask them all the time because they think I'm like standing up on a couch with like a growing life form inside me just like screaming these like very funny anecdotes at him all the time and he's like that's not you know. That's not our life. Ali Wong congratulations on another successful endeavor. Thank you so much. Thank you for being on the daily basis for it. The Daily Show with Trevor Noah Ears Edition.
