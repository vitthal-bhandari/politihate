    "text": " Hi, Gabb Fest listeners. It's me, Emily Baslan. I am not here with a new episode of our show. Instead, I'm here with a very special midterm episode of The Waves, Slate's podcast on women, politics, and feminism. Ever since Donald Trump was elected, women across the country have become re-energized in the political sphere, and there'll be a crucial voting bloc in this year's November election. As they head to the polls, The Waves is doing a special episode on the issues most important to women voters, and the female candidates to watch on election day. Your hosts for this special episode include Hannah Rosen, co-host of NPR's Invisibilia, Celeste Katz, senior political reporter for Glamour Magazine, Latifah Lyles, a former Obama administration official and former director of the Women's Bureau at the Department of Labor, and Christina Kaderucci, a staff writer for Slate. Before I get to this episode, I'm just going to tell you The Waves is one of my favorite shows to listen to when I want to hear people think through difficult topics relating to politics and feminism and culture and gender. They talked about the Kavanaugh hearings. They talked about Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, and they've talked a lot about Stormy Daniels and the way the media has treated her. One of my favorite episodes is about the future of Roe vs. Wade when they had Linda Greenhouse come on. I'm an amazing guest. If you like the show, I encourage you to subscribe. New episodes drop every Thursday. And we here at the GAB Fest are doing our own midterm special. Keep an eye out for that on November 1st. Our special guest will be David Axelrod, former chief strategist for President Obama. Thanks. I hope you love this special episode of The Waves. The following podcast contains explicit language. Hello, and welcome to The Waves for Thursday, October 25th, the She's Running Edition. I'm Christina Caudirucci, a staff writer at Slate and host of the Slate podcast Outward. And you are in for a treat this week. In anticipation of the upcoming midterm elections, we have a very special episode, TM planned for today. And because of that, I am pleased to welcome a Waves host from the other week of the show, Hannah Rosen of NPR's Invisibelia. We overlap at last. I know. I'm so excited. I'm gotten so into the midterms. It's unusual for me. I'm listening to every podcast I can listen to about the midterms, listen to 30 episodes of 538. I'm like, I'm just into it this midterm time. I feel like I feel all the drama. Well, you'll have another episode to listen to on Thursday. Also here with me in DC is Latifah Liles, a vice president at the National Network to Endomestic Violence, and the former director of the Women's Bureau at the Labor Department under Barack Obama. She's also a DC Democratic State Committee woman. Hi, Latifah. Hi. And this week's episode is a collaboration with Glamour Magazine. So to help us dig into the midterms, we have a fourth host this week. Glamour's senior political reporter Celeste Katz, who is calling in from out on the trail where she's reporting. Welcome to the Waves Celeste. Hey, it's great to be here with you. Thanks so much. We're so happy to have you. So if you're listening to this podcast, it's probably not news to you that there is an election coming up on November 6th. There's been a lot of talk about this proverbial blue wave, a backlash to Trump that could win Democrats of the House. And with more women running for office than ever, a lot of people are hoping that the election will usher in an unprecedented number of female senators and representatives in Congress and maybe even governors. So today, we are going to devote the whole episode to women in politics. First, we'll take a look at how female candidates have presented themselves in their campaigns this year. We'll discuss how this slate of candidates has changed what it means to be a woman running for a political office. Then we'll decide whether electing more women to office will make a substantive difference in the lives of their constituents and whether gender parity is really the key to better policies. And finally, we will talk about fictional women in politics and how those depictions have evolved over time. If you're a slate plus member, you will get an especially juicy slate plus segment today, I hope. We're going to discuss whether or not it's sexist that activists have raised millions of dollars to fund a challenger to main senators Susan Collins as punishment for her vote to confirm Brett Kavanaugh, while the many, many, many male senators who supported Kavanaugh are just getting ignored. If you're not a slate plus member yet and you should be, you can start your free two-week trial by visiting slate.com slash the waves plus. And before we get started, we actually have one order of business. We are going to Miami next month. We have. Yeah, we are so excited. We don't get to go to Miami. We hang out even though we're on different weeks, like outside of the podcast. I think so. Well, we're both going to be, Hannah and I will both be on our Miami episode. It's so hard for me not to make like Will Smith Miami joke right now, but I know that people who actually live in Miami are probably sick of people saying like, welcome to Miami. But so I thought I was going to stop myself from doing that, but I just did it. Anyway, the live show is on November 17th. It's going to be Hannah, Noreen and me. And I'm so excited for our guests. We're going to have Rebecca Traster and Celeste Ng with us. They're going to be at the Miami Book Fair discussing their books. So if you're in Miami or near Miami or if you've been looking for an excuse to visit Miami, please come. Tickets are free. You can get more details at slate.com slash live. All right. First topic today. We know that there are a ton of women running for office. 476 women filed to run just for house seats in the 2018 election. That was 60% more than the previous high in 2012 and 235 of those women won their primaries, which was up from 167 in 2016, which was the former record. But in addition to that quantifiable jump in the number of women on the ballot, there's also been a qualitative difference in how female candidates have marketed themselves. So multiple women have shown themselves breastfeeding in their campaign ads. They're showing their tattoos. They're wearing jeans and t-shirts and getting ultrasounds. And it seems like for a lot of candidates, this year has sort of marked an opportunity to stop pretending that they're just like any male candidate, that the experience of living as a woman is sort of incidental to their qualifications for political office. And they're making it more of a part of their affirmative argument for themselves. So Celeste, you've been following a lot of these races. Which candidates have stood out to you as far as self presentation is concerned? There have been a lot of women that have done some innovative things that I think really the idea that a lot of us have looked at is this idea of authenticity on the trail. But as you say, it's no longer sort of a hindrance, so to speak. Although, obviously it never should have been considered one. But now that it's not just okay to be a woman, it's important to be a woman. Being a woman means maybe you've had experiences that men haven't had or that you consider problems in a way that men don't consider them. Being a mom isn't something traditionally that voters have lacked questions about. There's research that shows that female candidates are questioned by voters as to whether they can quote, handle the rigors of public life while taking care of their families. Now you see a lot of women out there, as you say breastfeeding, but also talking about being a mom and being a family person as a qualification, as an experience. And that is something that's been really prominent in this race. Not every candidate who does this wins. We had one candidate in New York, Zephyr Teachout, who was running for state attorney general, who was pregnant during the campaign in the primaries. She even had an ad where she was undergoing a sonogram. You could literally hear the baby's heartbeat while she's talking about how awesome she'd be at this office. That was something I don't believe I had seen in any of the 85,000 campaigns I'd covered before this. Can I just wait? You use the word authentic. It's so interesting that stuck out to me because to me it feels performative. And I love it. I'm not saying performative in a bad way, but to me what's intoxicating when you sit down and watch these videos is that they're performing motherhood on the ads. It's so in your face. It's not the way the male campaign ads just have their family around. I have a family. They're in your face with my breastfeeding and my ultrasound. It's very performative. I wouldn't say femininity, but just femaleness in a way which feels very badass to me. Yeah. I hesitate to use the word gimmicky, but that was the first word that popped to my mind when I watched the two candidates who were breastfeeding in their ads. Both of them lost their primaries, but one was running for Maryland governor. The other was running for governor of Wisconsin. And the fact that both of them were breastfeeding in their videos, it seemed slightly awkward. They were trying to make it seem like, oh, this wasn't planned and I just had to breastfeed at this exact moment that my commercial had to be filmed. We couldn't have timed it around the baby's feeding schedule. It was clear to me that they had probably thought a lot about this because if you're not that they were actually showing their breasts, but if you're sharing this intimate moment with your baby on camera, clearly you've planned it. And same with Zephyr Teachout. I don't think I've even seen a political candidate's belly button before, much less watching them get a medical procedure in a doctor's office. And so I agree with you, Hanna. It was kind of shocking to me. And yeah, I don't think I got the authenticity vibe, but I did get the I am trying to be authentic vibe. Yeah. The statement part of it is really clear. And if there's enough time for folks to make a statement, I guess folks are like, this is it. This is my time to show my boob on camera. But I did have this moment when certainly the fact that there has to be such a dramatic display is I think in some ways a little bit of a backlash against I need to show up as gender neutral as possible, which historically a lot of women have done, down to how to how they dress and how they don't talk about their family or family responsibilities. Because of the fear that it might seem that, you know, just like when you walk into a job interview, you don't start, you don't start off by saying, so I have five kids and I'm expecting another one. And there's this conversation about whether that's even okay for people to ask. So there is very much still this very strong and any, I think, most workplaces, maybe, why? Yeah, I would say most workplaces where this idea of motherhood, there's, you know, we call the motherhood penalty where whether it's getting a job, keeping it wages, running for office, this is this is really the the the the contrast to that is so stark. And I think it's important that it's so stark because the penalty is paid so much every day. Okay, but Linty, but did it freak you out? Like actually watching them because for me, I was like, I was really scared. Like the penalty is real. Like the cultural visceral stereotypes are real. Like I actually was like, I could, my mind was racing when I watched these ads because I thought like, I was like, do it. Don't do it. Do it. Don't do it. Like I just couldn't just like, did you watch them as somebody who's actually been through this? Did you watch them and think like, yeah, absolutely. And also somebody who, you know, just like throwing my hat in the ring for local politics and thinking and that like, I was like, I would, that was, that is absolutely something that I would never do nor would I advise someone to do on what's the that the woman or breast feed or like what would you know, it's just like keep it on some level. Like I'm also one of these people, it's like very private and it just seems like a very intimate, private moment. And the sort of oversharing culture is one of those things where I'm just like, you know, even like I have, I have family members who are like, don't take pictures of your bare belly when you're pregnant. It's crazy. So like there's definitely like this, this foundation that I have for my upbringing of, of, you know, modesty when it comes to, you know, bodies and, you know, even putting your kids out there, you know, that's the other piece of it that I was kind of shocked about too. But oh, absolutely. I was like, no, because now you're going to be like the breastfeeding candidate. And that's all anyone's going to ever talk about. You're the breastfeeding candidate. Which is what we're talking about right now. Maybe that's maybe that's the point though. I mean, the fact is we are talking about it. If you think about all the candidates that were out there that were sort of, you know, you might think of them in their, in their 80s power suits. Not trying to show that they're just one of the guys, not breastfeeding. Well, that would be, I didn't see anybody breastfeeding in an 80s power. Not only not breastfeeding, but not having breasts, you know, like everything's so covered up. Yeah. Yeah. It's just, the fact is it is getting attention. A lot of people got a lot of attention through these ads that they might not have gotten. And of course, that's just one part of the story. But I think people sort of also, at least observationally, if this was a year to do it, this was going to be the year. This was going to be the time to sort of turn the tables well, because, you know, because women have been so much at the forefront of politics in terms of, in terms of the MeToo movement in terms of just a backlash to Donald Trump to sort of translating the passion and the intensity of the women's march into action, you know, walking with a sign for a lot of people wasn't enough to, to, to express or to, to, to take action on how they felt about a lot of stuff the Trump administration was doing. And that was way before Brett Kavanaugh got involved in the picture. So I think very much being forward and out there about being a woman, yes, sometimes look, I mean, by the, the third ad, you know, just being like breastfeeding or being basically like, you know, hey, ladies, that kind of thing. Maybe it starts to look a little road, but there were people willing to take that chance, especially in these crowded primaries where you got to stand out from the crowd or, you know, you're just, you're wasting your time. And also Celeste, you wrote in a piece about women candidates that if women don't confront questions about, you know, having kids and balancing their life at home with their life in public, they will take a hit with voters. And so I wonder if some of these women by coming out and saying like, look, I am a woman. I am a mom. Here's what my life looks like. I'm not going to pretend that I'm not at home like surrounded by primary colored children's toys all the time. And like a burp cloth on my shoulder that they're trying to get out ahead of some criticisms that they might face or some stereotypes that might be projected onto them. Yeah, I think that there is a reality there that for women candidates, those questions with voters are different than for men. I mean, you see men featuring, you know, their loving wife and family in their commercials all the time. And it's never like, God, how is he going to make it work being a dad, being in public office? It's just too much. You know, so you don't get that dynamic. But with women, some people are like, but what about the children? You know, and then it's so it's really not fair. So you do have to, you do have to talk about that. There was a big case even in this cycle with a woman who's running for Congress out on Long Island in New York who convinced the FEC to let her use some of the money that she'd raised in donations for childcare. And that was a kind of a big deal. So the fact that it took this long, I mean, it's 2018 people had kids before this midterm cycle. And the fact that this is just coming up now is to me kind of amazing. The other thing I want to say is that I think that to the folks that are saying, at least on the dem side, there has to be a change in the playbook because, you know, we're losing on message and we're not reaching people or maybe both parties are having that problem. So the other point I think is important is that in addition to standing out, it's like, how do I relate to voters and how do I get people out in the midterm? How do I relate in a way that is outside the party norms? And this is one way that people have reached out outside the norms in cases where women are running without endorsement of the national party or, you know, without the coffers and the financial backing. And there is this sense that, you know, we have to change and not be the everyone. No one wants to be the establishment right now because because, you know, that's a losing message for every town America. So I think that, you know, I think that is another piece of it is like, how can I, you know, dissociate myself from the political establishment and the expected candidate because, you know, whether which I drew on, we're losing with that paradigm. So can we just spin out like best possible scenario of this wave of ads? Now we're just talking imagery here, right? We're not talking about who's going to win right yet. Like best possible scenario of all these ads and like worst possible scenario. Like best possible scenario is we change the language around political presentation. We make it more real. We allow women to be themselves. It's a kind of authenticity like it leads to authenticity eventually because women can be more honest about like the realities they face and what their life is like and like they can handle it, you know. And so there isn't this kind of unspoken question around whether women are able to do power and children at the same time. OMG. What's the worst possible scenario? I think it's exactly the stuff that you described that I think it's people have people have a reaction to women have a bad reaction to it. They think it's sort of cheap. I hate to use that word, but it's sort of like let me let me exploit my adorable baby to get you to vote for me because I really want to go to Congress or I really want to be mayor or I really want something I want something from you and I am using my personal story to tug at your heartstrings and to get it which is kind of a lot of what people do all along other than the other options are either read your resume or talk about how bad the other guy is and what a chump you know what a chumpy is. Now you should never vote for him because no, but I mean like spin it out even further. So like that's what happens in this and so therefore what happens for women in politics. So like let's say people think it's cheap trick or they're just not buying it for some reason than what we're just back to square zero or women or people think I so I read some of the YouTube comments on one of these campaign videos with a breastfeeding candidate it was Maryland gubernatorial candidate Chris Vignerajah and I should never read the comments I know that and I usually never read the comments but I'm like I want to know what the people are saying about this video and the YouTube people were saying things like just because you show your titties on TV doesn't mean you can be governor. They called her and meanwhile you know her breast was not exposed I think it's very important though we make that clear but they called her an entitled bimbo they said you know Hillary tried to do the whole woman thing and it failed which I thought was hilarious like as if you know just by being a woman running you're like doing the woman thing doing the woman thing. Someone else transcribed the ad and replaced the word woman with the JJ. Jesus. So I think and not that YouTube comments just do that. We were kind of riding like the little way. Fair line. So I think we were feeling good. Probably none of these YouTube commenters will vote that probably a lot of them don't even live in the US I was guessing based on the way they were spelling some of their words but I do think that if I took that as like the pulse of the public I think or the pulse of the worst possible scenario of the public I would say that people will look at videos like this that sort of forefront the things that people usually say make women look weak and they'll project those things onto all women candidates to say that you know women are just like breastfeeders they're just people who get sold sonograms all the time. They're only moms you know and even a woman who doesn't have kids is like I'm thinking of her through the lens of this other candidate who I think showed her quote unquote titties on TV. Yeah and I think that the broader question about whether we can use identity or at least embrace identity as an asset in politics is still in a lot of people's minds especially following the 2016 presidential election where it was like we can we can we can we should but at the end of the day you know it's the identity or the gender or the being the woman itself that is so hard for people to get around as opposed to I'm a candidate and I'm really qualified and that's why you should believe me even if you don't think women should be in power which is kind of sucks and cynical but for those people who are already having a hard time with women in power this sort of meeting you where you are i.e. in my pantsuit or my like collared shirts sort of I think alienates those people that you know maybe it's as much smaller slice of the American electorate but there's definitely this folks who kind of squirm around and have never seen locally even a woman you know in any power at all so that this goes the other direction and you know pantsuits will make a comeback I don't know. I want to talk about two female candidates who had ads that sort of went viral and they were ads that tried to make them look extremely strong and I would say traditionally masculine these are two women who were in the armed forces one was MJ Hagar who's running for Congress in Texas she had I want to say one of the most viral videos viral campaign videos of all time especially Farah Candid who was you know had no history in political office and I think we can probably listen to a clip of it. But my story begins much earlier one of my first memories was of a door but it was my dad throwing my mom through a glass. Three years later mom got the courage to walk out the door and she opened a new one for my sister and me here in Texas and it was here that I put my foot on the gas and followed my dream to be a pilot. And that meant opening pushing sometimes kicking through every door that was in my way. So yeah you know she shows herself not only caring for her kids and playing with toys with them but also she talks about when she got shot down piloting a helicopter in Afghanistan and there's this one line where she's like you know I strapped myself to the skids and returned fire on the Taliban and then like oh my god I love that ad so much. And then like the next scene she's like you know back at home and the other candidate was Amy McGrath she's running for Congress in Kentucky. She's also a pilot in the Marines but both of these women not only did they talk about their military service they talked about lobbying to get women into combat roles in the military and the men who shut them down. And I thought showing that sort of like female power in the face of men who didn't want them to have power was extremely powerful and possibly you know a way forward for women who are wanting to show like that they are both women and strong. I thought that there was a great parallel with that with those two messages with the current climate right now which is very much like I survived. It's like the survivor is opposed to the sort of like I'm a woman so that's okay. I think that the message especially in light of the political and social discourse around you know assault and other things that are coming to light is the survivor story. And I felt like there were various survivors centric someone even talked about history of you know you're just growing up. And so this sense of like you know I'm a survivor and bringing the story comes along with it a skill like you know so the story is not just like I'm a person and I'm very you know I'm like you but like I'm using the story to sort of show a strength that I can bring to the office which is very different obviously than what we just talked about on the breastfeeding. So I was very moved by these but also like just women in combat generally is extremely exciting to me. Yeah I gotta say listeners all of you should go out and watch this out if you haven't seen it it's on YouTube it's everywhere you can find it. It is so genuinely moving. I mean it's what you just said like it's a survivor thing but to me what was perfect about it was the tone like it didn't the tone was extremely practical. You know what I mean it was like I did this and I was flying the plane and then this happened and then the kids came and then this happened and then I went knocked on doors couldn't do it did something else. It's like you really have to read the survivor thing between the lines because there's so much action in it and the doors trope is really really good and so you just like you trust this person. Like you trust this person to feel things but have everything under control like it is such a good political ad it's amazing. The MJ Hagerad was was a very very effective for a lot of the reasons that everybody here is talking about. I mean yeah it is exciting it is exciting to talk about this woman being in the military and having this experience that are you know earning up purple heart but at the same time there is a narrative that runs through it the idea that her experience and sort of the pitch for this candidate can be summed up in this idea of doors of passing through doors of going you know entering doors knocking kicking in doors is very effective and it really got people's attention and it wasn't so much necessarily about like hey I'm a woman but I'm a woman who did this who lived through that who will do this for you and it's it came off as it didn't come up as perhaps as forced and it also didn't come off apparently from what I'm hearing from everybody here is it didn't come off as icky which is which I think kind of kind of important here. No my gosh it's like blown up in a helicopter like it's definitely not icky. There's definitely this this I have less of an idea of what the sort of anti-femin or this the folks who are like you know the gratuitous ads mean nothing you know criticism that a lot of women are getting is sort of like you need a real platform if you're going to be in office this is not real even if you have one all they see is you know your breasts. So I think this is this is very different to and this elicitation of responses from the naysayers who say you know tell us about what you're going to do not about who you are which is ridiculous in politics because it should be about who you are but if you're going to be you know it's an opportunistic argument to say like you know I think that this person doesn't have a real platform which I mean this is the way ads work so I think it has a much better staying power as a strategy. Yeah I mean and I was trying to think whether it's a replicable strategy for other candidates who maybe haven't been shot down in a helicopter and returned fire on the Taliban and you know was one of the people who got the Pentagon to change their policy about allowing women in combat roles. But I think the way like you said Latifah she she takes her personal narrative and her identity and translates that into how she would actually lead and in our next segment we'll actually talk about how identity does or does not inform how people lead. I think that's a thing that could possibly capture voters attention more than just you know even if you haven't had all of these experiences you've survived domestic violence and you know anybody can sort of take their own background and make a story like this. It's just an incredibly good set of communication skills that she and her advisors have. I do wonder though if there's a way to tell the story like a lot of the research that shows that you know women tend to be more or overqualified and you know don't think of themselves as ready for office so the women that we get are like you know way overqualified not necessarily for the job but compared to men. And a lot of cases and I wonder and part of the thing there is how many things that one potentially has to overcome there's less there are less paths laid out for women I guess there's less of a legacy assumption you have to sort of make your case. And I do think there's possibly a way to translate that into a message so it isn't like you got shot down in a plane but you could say like the path here was not easy which I think would distinguish for many women themselves from the male candidates and some level you want people to think you have money in backers and you don't want people to know that you're not you know raising money but at the same time there's a message and like you know I decided to do this and I've been able to make it to this point without X, Y and Z and that could be a way to answer your question. Are there any other candidates or ads that y'all have that stood out to you? Well there's that Heidi Heitkamp arm wrestling one. I can believe it. Yeah so Heidi Heitkamp is a senator, democratic senator in a very very tough race in North Dakota and she put out an ad that shows her sitting at a table arm wrestling with this guy you know guy twice her size wearing a muscle shirt and she's talking to the camera as they're going at it there but she's saying that she says you know maybe this is how we should decide elections and her premise of course is that that would be a ridiculous way to decide elections but it's an attack ad. It is going after her opponent but the idea of a woman arm wrestling in a political commercial again having covered a lot of these not something I remember seeing too you know too often in terms of advertising but you know the again sort of the point that we've gotten to this level says a lot of things about this campaign it says it talks about you know the different strategies the fact that you could be you could be a little bit more blind she's not actually saying she's kind of beat up physically beat up the other guy but there is this sort of you know male female component there and also it's just it was just eye-catching it's just something you look at and you're like what the hell is going on here. Yeah and at the end she does beat him and she says something to her opponent like Kevin I'm just getting warmed up it's like a little bit of a threat so yeah I think the person watching that video was supposed to think like wow Heidi Heitkamp like so strong so powerful so manly. Well the other thing I wanted to just quickly mention we've been talking about women in this race and using issues of the day related specifically to women in their ads you know specifically around things like sexual assault and domestic violence and being survivors and I whereas you know we would not necessarily have seen that in the past or past election cycles but the other thing we're seeing is men doing the same using this opportunity to appeal to the elusive or the women voters that everyone's been talking about are you know the ones to to appeal to right now because of the loss of women voters and their trust of all these falling you know politicians and other folks who have been accused of misdeeds and so the other interesting part of right now is I think you wrote a part mentioning you know Andrew Cuomo's mention of of sexual assault or in his ads and in some cases it's very clear that the men are just like sort of taking a box and in other cases you may not know how they feel one way or the other and others it's very clear that it's totally opportunistic and totally not on that authentic at all and you know my question when I see those like is that really working do people really believe yeah that you know this guy is is really super excited about his ability to get into office and actually do something about sexual assault and we see that there's history that bears that some cases there's a very there's a lot of doubt yeah that that's the case let's leave it there then listeners let us know what you think about the ads that forefront the womanness and the the motherhood of the candidates you can email us at the waves at slate.com This week's episode is brought to you by Squarespace from websites and online stores to marketing tools and analytics Squarespace is the all-in-one platform to build a beautiful online presence and run your business if you're ready to start your new business make it stand out with Squarespace think it dream it make it with Squarespace.

All right our next topic today do women make a difference if all the women who won their congressional primaries end up winning their general elections which is not going to happen a lot of them are running against Republicans in very conservative districts would that leadership meaningfully differ from any other Democrat majority Congress. I have a tough time with this question sometimes because I know that there's a ton of studies that show that women do pursue different policy priorities in office but a lot of that has to do with the fact that so few women in office are Republicans and so to insist on that there's some sort of essential difference between like a progressive woman and a progressive man feels a little uncomfortable to me. Hannah what do you think? You know I think it's like a it's you're right it's completely theoretical which is pathetic that it's completely theoretical like the best studies that I've or the best sort of test case for me that I read about this is the women on Norwegian boards like when Norway passed a law saying that a certain percentage of their corporate boards had to be female and then sort of track to that or some somebody track that and saw whether it made a difference in decision making and the one difference in decision making that they pointed out was not so much that like women were more empathetic or that they they focused on a different set of issues but that they weren't as reactive which actually made a difference so when there was a recession for example they didn't instantly fire people like they weren't super focused on the bottom line they had kind of a long view so that's a form of empathy like let's let's look at the long term and see things play out over time so I don't really know how to translate that to politics like I'm often torn between thinking well is the right future we're hoping for a future in which women can be anything like is that what we want or do we want we just want women to be progressive and like everyone should be Stacy Abrams well I do think everyone should be a I do too she's amazing everyone should be I want to be Stacy Abrams I'm just saying like in my mind I'm just not sure what is ideal for the world I think if there's no question that the idea that somebody has to scrap and you know get to the top of whichever political branch they get to I can't dissociate that I think that you know there's there's a story there there's a paving the way potentially for other women even if it's you know with a set of more conservative viewpoints I know that's a little controversial but I think that we're so divided on partisan lines these days that I can't even tell sometimes who's a feminist and who's not a feminist and I think because we associate so many progressive policies that benefit women with the parties we kind of let a lot of the candidates off the hook a lot of the elected officials on both sides off to hook does like like there are a lot of progressives that I'm not a hundred percent sure women or men that they're feminists per se because they support tick the box or pro-choice and they're like I'm good but that doesn't mean that they're not you know there's not they're not you know things going on in their offices or they're not like perpetuating misogyny in some other way which as we know has come up with some Democratic lawmakers who were who sort of like faded into the black because of being accused of harassment and assault so you know I I don't know I I personally think that it's a it's about what happens in our everyday lives and like thinking of you know feminism and whether or not something is good for women on partisan lines is extremely difficult for me speaking of partisanship I think it's it's important to remember I mean I've seen a lot of research that would suggest that partisanship is more important than gender in the end whether you're a Democrat or a Republican is going to be more important perhaps in the decision-making process or in how you vote than whether you're a man or a woman um we see you see studies that show that women are perceived as more trustworthy you also see indications that women may be more collaborative and more into teamwork outside of government but once you get into once you get into you know the matrix so to speak does that you know how much does that change I think a lot of people find it it it is uh it is different than uh than in the real world you know real real world u.s. capital may be different than you know real world like successful business. When I think about women who are republicans and whether I should be excited for them to succeed I mean this this wave of women we've seen running for office is absolutely limited to the Democratic Party that I mean there are no more republican women running now than there were ten years ago and republican women have trouble now because they have to kind of walk this line that's very difficult to walk at this particular moment Trump whatever it's really hard at this particular moment for republican women to run right and I almost think this is uh probably anti-feminist of me in some way but I think that it's almost worse when a conservative woman succeeds than when uh you know any normal like bad republican man succeeds because they're able to funnel their arguments against gender equality and against feminism through a woman's perspective so when they say something like oh yeah you know Christine blazie ford is lying and women lie about sexual assault then men can point to them and say like oh well look look what women are saying and people can feel better about subscribing to that view or parroting that perspective because a woman has said it um and that I think about people like Sarah Peland who really did forefront her motherhood in her campaign um for vice president and the way people use their sort of mom status to justify racism and xenophobia like keeping their kids safe from uh MS 13 and when you hear politicians talk about trans people in bathrooms it's always invoking this idea of like a little daughter being accosted by a man in the bathroom I feel like there are ways that people can use their womanhood and their motherhood uh to to harm people in ways that like a any old man can't because they're easier to brush off as oh well that's a man talking ooh that's a really hard one you know because you're absolutely right you're like 100 right maybe it's just in phases like I sort of want eventually like 70 years from now for it to be possible for women to occupy lots of different spaces like there isn't just one way to be a woman yeah I mean I know it's like super damaging you know like right now what you're saying is super damaging like at this particular moment yeah um I will say that I think being a woman does matter when we're talking about reproductive rights even even within progressives in the pro choice community um I was reading an article recently about um Australia in the state of Queensland they the parliament just voted to legalize abortion which had been banned since 1899 and people have been crediting that shift with more women coming into political office and I remember when Hillary Clinton ran for president and she talked about abortion during one of the debates she had with Donald Trump it felt different to me and I would actually be curious to hear from men any if any of our male listeners want to write in how men interpreted that because to me it felt completely different from even when extremely progressive men talk about abortion rights because for her it felt real it felt like the stakes were personal it wasn't just like oh this is a political issue that I feel passionate about this is about like women's bodies and flesh and blood and something that I can intimately understand for me that showed like there's a difference between just voting the right way and being a leader on certain issues and I think from that perspective women's leadership can matter a lot and we've seen that also uh in the way that Iana Presley who ousted of an extremely progressive um congressman in her primary she's almost certainly going to be um the next congresswoman from her district in Massachusetts she said in her campaign you know I probably won't vote much differently uh from this guy that I'm running against but I will lead differently and you know I pretty sure she's her district is like the only majority people of color district in Massachusetts she's a black woman and he's white and so she was like it makes a difference that I am representing this district and even though we might have similar views on things my leadership will be different yeah and who are we kidding of course it's going to be different like do we think if Stacey Abrams doesn't isn't is elected governor it like it won't be different it will be amazing you know it will just be amazing to watch like these um and particularly at this moment because the women who are running are energized in a particular way and if enough of them win will have models of leadership that work differently and will be driven by identity yeah and I think that you know I was just reading something about Theresa May and how for for multiple reasons she's problematic for a lot of people but she's one of these uh women in power who made a point of saying it's important for women to be in power and I'm committed to make to making sure more women are in power as a societal exercise different from what her policy you know agenda is which is as I said problematic for lots of people and you know I think that whether or not whatever side you're on I just idea that we're sort of even hemmed in uh to like this limited scope of of hot button political issues is part of the the problem you know it's it's the fact that you you know you've got the party who supports abortion rights and the party who doesn't and fundamentally you know you could have and you do have but they're hard to they don't always talk about it there's a lot we've always thought that there's a lot more republicans and quote-unquote you know conservatives who are pro-choice but they don't campaign on that issue and they don't come out and they don't vote pro-choice because of the partisan divide and you know I think that is what's clouding a lot of this as well is that you've got a there's certain things you just can't speak against which for a lot of feminists are just like if you're if you're if you're not for this there's no way you can support women and be a feminist um and to some extent it's sort of almost like how you lead and you know and how you how you talk about women's you know advancement in society is much more important and can you do both can you talk about women's advancement and not be pro-choice that's the question uh i just i was just thinking one thing about um in regard to to sort of these contrasts that we're seeing between the newer women candidates and the older men candidates or more traditional candidates the example of uh Rashida Tlaib in Michigan really interests me I mean there you have John Conyers who was uh you know a veteran veteran lawmaker I think was there for over 50 years and left uh office after a bunch of sexual misconduct allegations and now you have a woman replacing him I don't know if that's gonna be kind of a a moment for people if people are going to look at that that sort of changing of the guard she has no uh republican opponent on the ballot in in November so it looks like she's she's pretty well on her way to Washington but you know the idea of of that person that exchange you know that succession is is I don't know kind of powerful to me it's it's kind of a a moment I think in in American politics that's part of something bigger that that we're talking about yeah all right listeners uh I'm excited to hear your thoughts on whether whether women make a difference once they get into office and how and also I yeah if you're a man and you saw Hillary Clinton talk about abortion tell me what you thought of that the waves at slate.com is our email

like the Jetsons where in the future we're gonna have like flying cars and also a woman president the future is so much brighter in hollywood um the Jetsons yeah like she was like a stay-at-home mom who like depended on the robot I know but I'm thinking like the the idea of a woman as for example president or vice president is like is a thing that has never happened in real life for us but all of those things have happened like you know we're gonna have a robot who's gonna cook all of our meals uh before we're gonna have a woman in the white house that's not true but I do think that that watching women in office on tv and in movies is like a little bit of wish fulfillment also a little bit of like projecting our worst fears about what women in power will do um so I think it's not totally off topic as we talk about this landmark election in terms of women's representation you know god willing to talk about what these female politicians in the culture tell us about what we want and what we don't want um latifa I'm gonna turn it over to you first well who do you have for us so I have a couple so Claire Underwood from House of Cards who who ascends you know um as a result perhaps of her making and a combination of her husband's demise but it's all very cloak and dagger um I think that the it was a very interesting time for that character to to rise as this very shrewd smart um I've been standing by my husband who's the president of the united states and sort of you know sort of waiting for my time and then very much having her own agenda um and that's very very clear and as opposed to sort of you know waiting for her time to sort of like jump into the machine I think the the contrast with this character is that like she very much is an operative in her own right and has a very very specific set of things that she wants to happen and do and and so that that despite how like grim and like scary that show is in some way some ways it was just like amazing to watch her I just loved that character so much for so many reasons and she was also very stayed and very calm very elegant I have to say that I'm sure it was intentional but she was just very poised uh despite all of that and being shrewd and that that that doesn't always come together usually like shrewd is like raging raging feminist but she was shrewd and respected and also very um just very well put together and very like you know calm the other I have to I have to throw uh Julie Reese Rifis into the mix for VEEP oh yeah you love VEEP don't you know I love VEEP for so many reasons and the while the description of her character has been like you know this is like narcissistic unqualified like cursing you know woman who's who's who's the vice president who wants to be president doesn't sound too far off from a lot of what we see and so this idea that you know this is this is such a far gone idea that you would have someone with with such a personality is on the one hand on the other hand I think the show does a really good job despite the fact that she comes across as a buffoon in a lot of ways there's a lot of cutting moments where she talks about um how difficult it is for her as a woman she talks about you know she refers to um the reason she curses so much is because she had to like you know survive in her early days she talks about that there's one favorite favorite scene I have is when she's in Finland and one of her nemesis is the prime minister of Finland and she's there and like she's giving her a gift and her husband the prime minister's husband gropes Selena Meyer and there's this conversation in the hotel after the incident happens and she's talking to her aides and one of her women aides says well you have to say something you have to talk about this so she says I can't be the woman I'm gonna just be known no one's gonna make a statue out of me because I got groped by the prime minister's husband and she kind of lays out to her aide why she can't come out about being groped by the prime minister's husband because she would be known that would be her legacy and she's like I can't talk about being assaulted and she's lying on a she's lying on the bed smoking which she only does on international trips and it was just a perfect moment her male advisors are standing and she looks at her her aide her woman aide who's very confused and it's like you really have to come out she's gonna not coming out and she's like that's because we live in a man's world and she takes a puff of smoke and she turns to her aide and she says the axis of dick and it was just like the most perfect moment of her basically being like yes this is crazy but at the end of the day politics is a man's world and I can't talk about my sexual assault you know this is like a few years ago but I thought that that the show does have these moments of really like laying out what it's like wow Celeste who do you have ironically the exact same two characters I literally do and I think it's it's it's incredibly the contrast between the two of them between between the character in house of cards and the character in v is is what's so appealing to me in in house of cards and the clear underworld character you do have this sort of I would go beyond poised frankly I would go to to sort of hold and sort of you know having this this exceptionally perfect veneer at least in public of always you know never never a hair out of place never a wrong word everything so exceptionally exceptionally calculated now this is a woman who's obviously risen to extreme power and it's exciting and interesting to see how she exercises it but the idea of how she gets there is completely treacherous completely cold-hearted her her marriage has become essentially a put on it's a it's a front until it ceases to exist you know so the idea of her being still being a sort of an engaging character from an emotional standpoint it does have a real life she does have an emotional life it's just not necessarily with her husband that to me is very interesting now on the other hand you do have this sort of the silliness and the sort of the goofy character the Julia Louis Dreyfus character but at the same time I think she's much more much more relatable than the Claire Underwood character because who I mean people could fantasize about being in this this plot twisty world of house of cards I think the VEEP character is more like like you know dang I spilled coffee I'm a shirt again I have this really important thing to to go to have a really important meeting I've got to do a really good job in this presentation this is this has got to go down perfectly and I you know I I tripped I slipped I whatever so I think that you have these two characters that both have power in their own ways still somewhat reliant on men still trying to deal with men or you know succeed despite men but both both approachable in in varying degrees but both I'm still fun to watch and you know a way to get people into politics that might not be which I am I am I I prove that message I would love somebody to get into politics who was inspired by Claire Underwood who like stabbed her way to the top I also liked the way the show handled her abortion where it was like started out as something that she wanted to hide but then she kind of turned it into something that like a like a plus for her something that she could use to galvanize women and I I curious to see whether that will ever happen in future election seasons whether like the breastfeeding commercial will turn into the I have an abortion commercial um hannah I got nothing for you on American television I hate all the representations of lady politicians on American television wow they never strike me as real they're total fantasies they're either parodies or kind of fantasies of sort of sexy power or just kind of liberal bullshit fantasies where like a woman gets elected president and like fixes the environment and like it's just it's all wrong to me and so all I got for you is borgon and beerget and I borg which is that Danish TV series there is a TV series called borgon b-o-r-g-e-n it's a Danish political drama it is unbelievably great it was hugely popular in the UK for a while and I've watched every episode of it there are three seasons and she's like a minor politician who becomes the first female prime minister of denmark and and and and the other main character in it is this reporter Katrina fawns mark she's like the tv one news anchor and there's such a natural grappling of the kinds of issues that not women would realistically face like a woman would realistically face like there's the abortion scene but it doesn't go down like the way it does in america where it's like omg obvious child she had an abortion it was no big deal it's like fuck you it's 2018 you know it just you you like watch borgon and you're like yeah it is 2018 like this is actually how it would happen these are the issues that she would deal with I feel like abortions and american tv is usually like a tragedy and and such a difficult decision it's either a tragedy and a difficult decision or it's not and then we have to write 50 000 articles about it like oh my god it's not a tragedy that's so radical that they portrayed it as not a tragedy thank you you know so anyway and borgon it's just like she has a husband her husband cheats on her they end up getting a divorce it's like what happens when you get a divorce and you're the prime minister it's not so operatic it just goes down in this realistic way now i'm a realist so i prefer my dramas that way i totally love both like i watched v like i love v but it's so funny like there are episodes of v but i've watched over and over again but it does nothing for me in terms of like the real real like what would this like getting my head around what it would actually be like like only borgon does that for me so um i know you're laughing at me but it's a really good show it's a really really good show and mostly laughing at the word borgon but i do know what i would tell you you know i i would go even further and talk about the woman who plays bergad who whenever she's interviewed says the most funny like like just wise things about women in power and about her own language but i just cannot pronounce her name so i'm not going to talk to you about her but if you just google borgon and bergad her name is Sidso Babat Knudsen i don't know listeners just sounds right laugh at me and then just like write in or send us a little like like uh you know voice memo about how to actually pronounce all these names but um but anyway it's it's the best on the women in power the best yeah um i am going to i was so glad that nobody already took this um melly grant on scandal do we have any scandal fans in here wow wow nobody not even Danielle wow i've watched shit that falls is hard in my box of like wack fantasy but like i i like it i watch it it's totally intoxicating but yeah it doesn't do that thing for me i mean there's nothing realistic about this the portrayal of anything in scandal it's all like incredibly uh it's like soap opera nothing would ever it's like the drama compounds season by season so that by season five you're like i now there's like 800 backstories you have to deal with and everything just gets more and more bizarre but melly grant is a pro-choice republican she starts out as i want to say a senator and she is also actually starts out as the first lady becomes a senator and she does this sort of wendy davis style like filibuster to defend women's health care at one point and that rockets her into the onto the national stage as an actual politician and not just the first lady um but then by the time she becomes president her and her husband are divorced and so she's not only uh for the first woman president but she's single and i kind of think that the most radical thing that's scandal portrayed both when her husband was president and then when melly grant is president is the depiction of a single president and how they're dating um and how the secret service has to like bring their one night stands to and from their bedroom um but then there's this one plot point in the season where melly is president where the head of state of this fictional middle eastern country called bachron uh gets they they have like a romantic entanglement and it kind of puts her in a tight spot with foreign policy because he gets ousted in a coup and she has to decide whether to like go to war with this country to reinstate him and uh then he ends up getting killed by her aides because she got too close to him and they felt like it was clouding her foreign policy decisions so that to me was like uh the ultimate look what will happen if we put a woman in the oval office like her emotions will get in the way and will end up going to war with a country just because they have a really handsome prime minister I kind of loved it though it's I also like the idea that we could elect a single president that it doesn't have to be like oh something is wrong with somebody if they don't have a wife or or if they haven't had uh if they don't have a partner who's willing to stand beside them um amen I just say amen to that listeners please tell us

thing i've seen in forever it was on HBO for a while i hope it still is um but it's called minding the gap uh and it's just it's fabulous it's fabulous it sounds really good so let's how about you i would definitely recommend that people check out uh the glamour women of the year summit that's coming up uh november 10th november 11th there are a whole bunch of things to uh to see and do there are going to be speakers there are going to be what you call experiences and then this all leads up to our our big award ceremony where we honor women who are are important in in a number of different walks of life it could be uh politics it could be entertainment it could be business so glamour women of the year summit definitely check it out awesome and when is that that is november 10th and november 11th right after the election cool um latifa what do you have this week so this week and it's not a new show but i know that they have made it more available um if you don't have an afflict i think you can get and watch it on um some local uh we uh PBS stations so this is happy valley um which i absolutely love um it's british tv which i also absolutely love um and the reason that i love this show i love british crime drama generally but uh there's multiple things that it has going forward including the fact that the the main character who's uh i think the it's a small town she's more like a small town chief of police but she's got a lot the weight of the world in her shoulder she's raising her grandson um and because her her daughter was uh killed by her ex-boyfriend who then goes to prison and then she has to like battle the boyfriend coming out and wanting wanting to access the child her sister lives with her who's a recovering alcoholic um she herself is single and has has a lot of you know young people looking up to her at work and so it's like she you just want her to thrive and she's a badass and she's you know got all the stuff happening in her house then she goes and sort of like fights crime in the streets and it has a small time feel it's not like urban gritty um there's a little bit of prettiness in it it's a little dark in terms of some of the cases um but it's just the other thing about this show which is a lot of british shows that i like in the genre is that it also features a middle-aged woman as the the main character which is also always very refreshing and you want to root for her she's got power and she's got a lot of power and it's very believable and it's just a great way to just unplug and and if you need someone to root for you need to yeah it is featuring middle-aged women and lead roles a british thing yes i mean maybe it's just the genre of like crime dramas and sort of mysteries that i like but by far i can't think of only a couple of us shows that i like or watch where it features middle-aged women and now you know i don't just mean like middle-aged women like real women like they're they're not nest they're not they're not robin right on house and so they're not and so just being able to sort of see that every woman in a profession or in the job i feel like that's so much more of a british thing than it is something that i see here which is one of the reasons that i'm drawn in addition to having like really strong female characters in law enforcement spaces that sounds really good um i'm going to recommend a show that's been out for a while but i'm always late to things it's uh the marvelous mrs mazel it's on amazon prime um everyone had been telling me to watch it i was worried it would be really corny and it is uh and i don't hate it um if you listen to this podcast you probably know that i've been in the mood for some escapism in recent months and this show it's not pure escapism there's definitely some serious story lines but it's about a woman in the late 50s who uh her life is sort of thrown into turmoil when her husband leaves her and she's been sort of like this perfect housewife um and then she decides to go into comedy which her husband did and and was just very unsuccessful at but she has a real knack for it um it has kind of this like a starry-eyed view of comedy and like you know you do it because you love it even though it ruins your life which i find a little bit dubious at this moment in history knowing what we know about how female comedians are treated but it is incredibly funny i actually have laughed out loud several times while watching it which i don't usually do when i'm watching tv um and there's also a great one of the lead characters is this butch woman named susie who is awesome and i'm so happy to see a masculine of center woman get such great character treatment in this show actually my partner and i are dressing up as susie and uh midge the main character for halloween at a party we're throwing this weekend there's just so many great characters in the show rachel braws and hannah's fantastic in the lead role and i highly recommend it i've like blown through the first season and i'm waiting for the second one it's so it's gotten so many great reviews and then i see it and i'm like that's not something i think it seems very campy yeah like it's it's really more than that and i think so my partner was the one who was like we need to watch the show and i was always like i'm like i'll watch the first episode with you and then we'll see i think it had to do with the font that the the title is in it sort of looks like the bewitched font um but it's honestly a lot better than it seems it's really funny i highly recommend it you can stream it on amazon prime all right that's our show for today thank you so much to our production assistant alex bersh and our producer danielle huitt and thank you latifa thank you thanks hannah totally my pleasure and thank you so much for calling in Celeste really appreciate it was fun all right for hannah rosin latifa liles and Celeste cats i'm christina kataruchi thanks for listening"
