We've been talking about today already Started off the show talking about how only 18% of Americans according to Gallup are satisfied with the state of the nation so people are very aware that the Biden presidency is a Disaster that's That's for about 20% we're like Joe Biden's just great He's amazing Which is a that another thing 20% of people buck believe that I think they're just so committed to the left wing But they're not even committed to Biden No, no one thinks he's doing who really likes Biden. No, no one thinks he's doing a great job They all just pretend because he is a vessel for the radical Left-wing policies, right? And that's what you get with Biden, you know people that have said oh But Biden is gonna be a moderate he absolutely is not a moderate and He because he's not really any the thing of a Biden is he stands for nothing He's actually built a whole career on Bidenism He's also in recent years as we've seen built a career on taking money or having his family members take money from foreign interests for Business ventures. I thought this is fascinating You know I spoke clay on our clay and buck podcast recently to Peter Schweitzer And I thought this was such an important point about the Biden crime family You know that the money that hundred Biden got from the Chinese interest I forget CFC. I think it was CFC holdings For future to be determined business activities. Yeah, I mean imagine if you were on like hey guys Can you give me like eight million dollars? I'm gonna figure out something really cool to do with it later That is called a bribe That is called a bribe everybody but you know it's on her Biden So it's not technically Joe so as long as they can't prove the money was getting siphoned to Joe can they prove it in some way? It's all it's all fine But Biden is in some ways really the perfect prototypical Democrat of his era Which is whatever works? Whatever the leftist mob wants whatever's gonna help his career in the moment He is a pure political opportunist and now one with dementia as well and so at some level he's perfect for many of these Democrats because you know he's like the idiot king who The ministers are getting whatever they want behind the scenes and they don't have to take any of the heat I think buck when he got passed over in 2016 for Hillary and by but and and Barack Obama himself said you aren't able to be president I think everybody forgets that Barack Obama set down his vice president and basically said You aren't able to be president. I'm supporting Hillary Which is you want to talk about loyalty as close to a slap in the face as you can get to tell your sitting vice president You aren't able to do this job. I'm picking someone else to support instead, right? And remember Obama never endorsed Biden in the 2020 primaries either until he was already the nominee It's not like when Biden got into the race that Obama said okay You know what in 16 I was wrong. Let me make it clear I'm all in on Joe Biden. He's my guy everybody who supports me go support him No, he stayed out of the primary and my point on this is I think Biden as Soon as he got passed over Looked in the mirror and said I'm old Hillary's gonna win in 16 Then she's gonna run in 20 again and then I'll be 84 years old or whatever it is It's time to make money and I think he flipped the switch from I want to maintain my political viability to I want to get my family rich and I think you can go back and look and I bet The dollar started flowing in aggressively about 2014 and 15 even while he was still vice president when he realized that he wasn't gonna make the money That he wasn't gonna be president and so let's start making this money now and that's when the hunter Biden crime family Really kicked into high gear Democrats have really perfected the art of turning politics into a cash cow That's what's happened. It really started with the Clintons who will tell you and they told everyone Oh, we had no money, you know, we were leaving the White House and then they rate do you ever hear about the Clinton foundation anymore clay? No, you don't whatever. He wasn't viable. He vanished. Yep. Whatever happened the Clinton global initiative tackling climate change and women's in with it look inequality globally sure it was a bunch of foreign governments buying Access and influence with the Clinton crime family What was the Clinton global? What was the the Clinton foundation really about it was a pass through? They'll tell you they give money to charity, but they were taking a cut to pay for I think it was 80 million dollars of private jet travel for You guessed it the Clinton family to pay for their lifestyles to send them around the world to give an excuse as well To pay Bill Clinton up to eight hundred thousand dollars for a single speech Clay and I both give speeches sometimes for money by the way reach out to our people And no one gets paid eight hundred grand for a speech. That's not a thing That's a bribe But the Clintons did it the Bidens did it you look at Nancy Pelosi you look at Diane Feinstein and see their stock Activities and their stock trades and you wonder hmm is somehow Nancy Pelosi is like better at trading than then the hedge funds. How is that possible Nancy? How is Nancy Pelosi a more astute stock market analyst? I don't think Nancy Pelosi could name three of the first five presidents of the United States But man is she good at trading the stock market? So we all see this right the corruption the craziness and I think Democrats at some level No, there's a little bit of panic. They think Joe is still their best option. There's a little bit of panic. Did you see this? Oh, I mean look we talk about the view sometimes here and in some ways Yes, is the view bad for this country sure is the view making people who watch it dumber? Absolutely, but is it a rich source of content for clay and buck? Absolutely the same though can be said for MSNBC And even more specifically joy-read show on MSNBC. Did you see this? Now they're going with after what was it a week or two ago? We were told that Florida was an unsafe state for For LGBT people for black people Joy-Reed is saying that DeSantis wants to make us like North Korea Cuba which I thought the left love Cuba and China play 11 There is a model for what this little dictator in the making wants to do just look at China Cuba North Korea Afghanistan or Iran where the government censors the media or for speeds a strict conservative religious ideology to children in schools deploys morality police to make sure you're wearing what they want learning what they want doing what they want That model also happens to have a name and it's called totalitarianism The political concept that the citizen should totally be subject to an absolute state authority now I I don't I don't know how to say this The Democrats are full-blown authoritarians and totalitarian and we saw it during covid and it couldn't be any more clear and they're absolute lunatics I'm never going to forget it. We're gonna have Ian Miller joining us to talk about his latest book Who was the guy who was phenomenally useful during covid for sharing the graphs on masks spoiler alert? They don't work at all. They don't do a thing It's fun to be able to say that now know that you know, oh, we're not gonna get like censored on the inner webs But joy-read here saying that Florida is a totalitarian state She did this is one thing we have to be on guard for clay when it comes to democrats. They don't just lie They go to it's like anti-truth. They go to the absolute polar opposite of the truth Florida has built a brand as the play a place where Donald Trump lives the place where ronda santis lives the place where so many people Is where I live so many people in the media live now as the pro Freedom state because of covid and now over at msnbc they want to tell you that florida is a totalitarianism Because they don't want third graders being handed books in school that I don't even I'm not even comfortable Telling people on the radio really what's in these books? That's it's also an easy argument to make on the contrary buck How many people try to get into Cuba? How many people try to get into North Korea? right Florida has added Millions of people in the four years that ronda santis has been governor Thankfully, we still have the free flow of people in this country, right? You can move from one state to another Although it's worth noting that many of the furthest left wing Science advocates during covid wanted to restrict your ability to actually leave the state that you're in they forget about that now But the anti slavitt company out there that was advising the biden administration Actually wanted to restrict your ability to leave your state over covid But an easy counter to joy read. I mean clearly this is baulder dash buck, but it would just be hey wait a word Thank you. How many people out there? Are trying to go to? totalitarian country. Am I missing all of the People trying to get into cuba Am I missing all of the people moving to north korea because everybody's moving to florida Yeah, which is the ultimate counter you may not know this But as you I read will tell you real estate prices in piong Yang or skyrocketing because every everyone wants a condo in piong Yang Just like they do in miami You know when I left your miami Apartment we were doing the show hanging by like hung out. I had a cuban driver Um recently and she drove me to the airport and she she was awesome And she said I hope she's listening right now She said, you know, there's a lot of complaining in america and i'm paraphrasing But she said when I was in cuba It got really hot at night Nobody had air conditioning It's like every time I walk around in miami and I see anybody complaining about anything I'm like go back to your air conditioned home And live in your luxury You don't even realize until you have experienced what socialism is And what it does to the people You don't even realize in this country how fortunate you are in in south florida buck I bet you're constantly surrounded by venezuelans and cubans and people who have fled latin american Totalitarianism that are just a wash in the freedoms that they get to embrace every single day in florida They're very important. I actually just visited with a friend of mine with karae over the weekend who Um was at the bay of pigs Oh wow, he was a fighter at the bay of pigs the dear friend of mine and later joined the marine corps United states marine corps when we got him out because he loved this country even though he felt like the democrat kennedy Uh did not give the air cover and kind of betrayed the troops on the beach Um, but still loved america with all of his heart I think he would still sign up to fight in the marines tomorrow if he could but he's in his 80s and When you see people that have left Uh in recent years, it's really you know a lot of it is venezuela you still have cuban immigration to florida from uh to florida from cuba But from venezuela and the collapse of venezuela and I just wish people would Hear this more and I think there's an important part of the narrative in this country that that Sometimes doesn't get enough attention. The policies that aoc and bernie want for america Are the policies of the meduro regime in venezuela It's the end stage of those policies, but it is Ideologically aligned with a socialist country run by social justice principles where all of a sudden the elites Are the only ones doing well and everybody else can just you know go jump off appear um and People should be reminded that that's a it's a country that was for the region very wealthy uh for the region um Culturally rich highly educated population and in the span of 20 years has been destroyed Yeah and turned to penury turned to just sheer poverty malnutrition. Why? Social justice got to spread a little more of that money around for the poor people got to take a little more of the industry over by the government And I I think the venezuela in refugee population in america Is incredibly important as a warning of what happens when the leftist lunatics Take power Always worth mentioning do you remember where bernie sanders went on his honeymoon? Isn't that the craziest thing? Moscow when it was the soviet union what a maniac that's why whenever someone says Oh, he's like a cuddly old grandpa. No, he's not no he's not He would tell you that the price the price of your slow starvation Under bernie's idiotic economic policies because he's economically illiterate He would say yeah, well, you know, sorry for you But to make an omelet you got to break a few eggs that you don't have any more he went to the soviet union During his honeymoon during the cold war to celebrate their style of government Just think about that everybody wants to pretend it didn't happen Think about how much time you spend planning your honeymoon And that numbskull chose to go to the soviet union and actually propagated lies about how great it was there That's who you're dealing with verise and at and t mobile if you're with them you're overpaying pure talk can easily save your family Over $900 a year right now you can get unlimited talk unlimited text ultra fast 5g data Just $20 a month coverage every bit as good as those other cell phone service providers pure talk Use the most dependable 5g network in the country So grab your phone dial pound 250 say the key word clay and buck to get unlimited talk text Plenty of data for just 20 bucks a month pure talks amazing us customer service team will make switching so easy That's why you need to choose a veteran owned company who cares about keeping jobs in america and saving you money Pick up your phone dial pound 250 say clay and buck for unlimited talk Text plenty of 5g data for just 20 bucks a month dial pound 250 say clay and buck and save an additional 50 off your first month with pure talk He's bucks exton. He's clay travels Together they're breathing sanity into an insane world appreciate all of you hanging out with us We mentioned this buck in the open to the show um and I do think This is getting crazy Sam ponder as at espian and she tweeted out during our show Uh, she is a prominent espian employee And she has been one of the few espian employees who's outspoken and actually supporting the idea of Men not being able to compete against women And she said biology is not bigotry, which is a great Synthesis of why men pretending to be women shouldn't be able to compete in women's athletics But she got called a bigot by usa today No one at espian in the corporate office buck has defended sam ponder at all Usually when you get attacks like that from other media outlets your pr team goes to work And they end up defending you in fact quite the contrary Tomorrow buck espian is raising the trans flag over the espian campus And this is more than just the pride flag. This is espian Sticking their thumb in all of your eyes If you are a sports fan espian has already said lea thomas is a women's sports hero They're now Raising the trans flag to fly over a sports network And they are now to me making it clear that their corporate mantra is If you're a man And you want to identify as a woman as a woman you are a women sports champion. This is where we are And even for me, this is a staggering spot Wait, wait, hold but hold on so the corporate espian owned by disney, right doing this interesting isn't it disney on the espian disney um Do the hosts though Publicly all go along with this Like many of them will and a lot of them are afraid if they don't have a lot of Security in their jobs to actually speak out against it. I don't mean speak out against it I mean do they affirm it public good. We can come back to this. Yeah, it's a good question And also we're going to talk with uh, Ian miller who's at outkick last Kim this question as well Uh team at ipillow never fails to disappoint their latest value offer proves the point if you're updating your home with new towels This is your lucky week their latest offer six p style set just 25 bucks 75 Off the regular price sets made with usacot and extremely absorbent yet still providing the soft feel you look for an A towel set comes with two bath two hand towels two washcloths typically a retail for a hundred dollars right now You can get the set for just 25 bucks with our names as the promo code clay and buck to get this offer Just go to my pillow.com click on the radio listener special square to get a clearance price of 25 dollars on the towel set Feel won't last long enter the promo code clay and buck you can also call 80792 32 69 for this special offer Clay Travis and bucks exton On the front lines of truth. Welcome back We've got our friend ean miller with us now. He is a writer for outkick and author of a new book illusion of control COVID-19 and the collapse of expertise ean. Welcome back to the show. I'm assuming This is not a lot of fauci is brilliant and right uh analysis. Tell us what you get into in this book That's that's a good assumption. Uh, yeah It is kind of going in detail on on fauci and the cuc and a lot of other experts about how they kind of mismanaged Virtual everything about the covid pandemic and in our response to it Um and the mistakes they made and more importantly, you know pointing out how little accountability there was You know, they they never took any responsibility for the mistakes that they've made they never acknowledged half of them Um, a lot of cases. They're still kind of maintaining that a lot of these policies were actually effective Um, and so the case with the book is kind of make that this comprehensive overview Of why that's wrong how they got it wrong and why we need to hold them accountable going forward So in when you see arguments being made That florida handled covid poorly That the rate of death in florida was bad. This is actually the argument that trump is now trotting out against ron desantis You are a data guy you spent and you lived in california So you had to deal with all the craziness of gavin new some you shared incredible charts over the years How did florida do relative to the rest of the country? What sort of benefit if any did say new york in california gain from shutting down What is the raw data? intelligently analyzed tell us Right. Well, and it's the exact opposite conclusion of what kind of messaging has been If you look at age-adjusted cold room mortality because obviously florida has a much more elderly population compared to new york in california Uh florida outperforms the rest of the country. They had a much lower age adjusted covid death rate than new york despite new york's lockdowns Uh had lower excess mortality than california meaning fewer people than Over the expected normal died in florida than california And florida benefited because they kept their economy open as much as possible and kept kids in schools and which is going to have huge For a positive effects down the road. You know california New york have both been losing huge numbers of people in the new york city lost almost half a million people in just a couple of years That's a huge that's a huge difference with a lot of them going florida because it was open and because they could get their kids in schools Uh, so you know trying to revisionist history trying to stay florida didn't perform well It's just not backed up by data at all Ian Is there any sign that you're seeing and and as part of the research for the book did you find? um meaningful Mayakolpas from major medical institutions from uh, you know the the science as it was known for a while Not just from the fauci's the cdc's the nih's etc, but uh, you know major hospital systems Um, the the the so-called consensus about so much of this stuff that was Shockingly wrong. I mean the data as i've been talking about on this show the data on for example the Frenzy to put everybody on ventilators, uh shows they were killing people By putting them on ventilators. There were a lot of people who would have survived their first bout with covid who were put on a ventilator Far too quickly because there was a panic in the medical community Is anyone saying we're sorry where we got this wrong or does everyone just move past it in the medical field At these big institutions and act like it didn't happen Definitely the latter pretty much everybody is just trying to move on and kind of quietly dismiss everything and not really take any Responsibility or acknowledge that they were wrong about this stuff. Um, like you said ventilators were a huge issue You know masking people forever and masking toddlers You know and the CDC director came out there not long ago and said you know our guidance doesn't really change over time We're going to continue to recommend masking kids essentially forever based off of community transmission I think you know, obviously public health agencies, but in particular a lot of these hospital systems that were very openly promoting You know all the vaccine passports and things like that They just kind of want to move past it because I think everybody could see at this point or people that have been paying attention that they were wrong The data shows that were wrong Everybody got cobra anyway despite what all these experts were saying to do Uh, and so I think they they feel like it would undermine their credibility if they admitted that they got this wrong that they made mistakes Some said they're just kind of trying to move past it. If anything, there's there's been I mean a shocking lack of accountability as opposed to kind of taking responsibility for their actions Ian Now that we look back where three years are moved. I think you wrote an article at out kick about the fact that Only now is air travel getting back to where it was when we shut down in march of 2020 Which is really kind of crazy to think about the three years What country did? Actually handle covid the best is there now that we've got three years of data And we can look and analyze all the different perspectives we talk about states But is it sweeten like if you could point to a european or united states, uh, or you know, north american country Is there a country that you think handled covid really well and if so who and what should we have done in retrospect? Yeah, it has to be sweeten. I mean they did the most to keep their economy moving They didn't close schools if at all Or for very limited age groups were very limited amount of time. You know, there were no mask mandates generally for for the whole country Basically and what's so frustrating is that they essentially followed all of these pre covid pandemic planning documents that all these public health agencies spent years developing They followed it everybody else panicked and threw it out And you know, I write a chapter about it in the book But you can compare sweetened to all these other countries to european countries and basically in every comparison They come out looking really well where they have lower excess mortality rates or they overperform compared to other countries that's uh, some more populations Uh, and they did it all without disrupting their population as much as as we did in the united states in most most states Especially or places like australia or new z1 that went the entire opposite direction And if you look australia has now had you know, huge excess mortality rates where over the last year and a half So I think there's a there's a clear winner here in sweeten and it's not that they did anything particularly special It's just that they actually followed the guidance that everybody had set out before covid For some reason our experts just completely panicked and threw it out and they stayed strong The book is illusion of control covid-19 and the collapse of expertis eon miller.

All right. Let's start with Tim in upstate new york, Tim what you got for us Not a lot. Okay. Let's go to charlie inventura california charlie. What do you have for us? So guys this this is like a little double meaning thing it's trump In the whole trans flag thing at dspn. It's the pride before the fall With trump it's the pride before the fall because he's he's just running people away from him. I know people in florida All the trump supporters. I know they're just sick and tired. They want to hear policy. They're tired of this tip for tat What happened to calie macanelli that's soupy commercially runs on fox news every night looks like, you know, nanny nanny booboo a third grader And then you got all the woke You know companies that are going under because they're flying the pride flag. So there is the pride before their fall And quite frankly, you know, united states is looking like it's going the way of the romans We're just allowing this stuff to take over and we're just playing games and we're no longer taking our our country and our lives seriously But If we got into a real war I The pronouns that we would use in battle Um, I think we'd go out the window in a hurry and I think we'd want the baddest ass of the baddest asses to be fighting for us and A part of me feels like we're just getting lost in all of this absurdity on a day-to-day basis But the other part of me says As soon as you can get someone to get you to admit something that you know to be untrue Is true then you've given up on your ability to live as an independent and flourishing country Yeah, that's the first step. Yeah, I know it's we will always adhere to the truth here and come what may Jim in minnesota, what do you got for us jim I Hey guys I just wanted to say that I voted for trump twice and if he's nominated, I'll vote for him again happily But the stuff he said about katley mac and any as Among other things That's the reason he's not sitting in the white house today Because that's what turns 50 percent of the country off to him And we're competing over a really small slice of pie To get the independent voters and if you put trump nominate trump for the republicans That that place that flight the pie just became significantly smaller. Well, you know, you know, jim, thank Yeah, jim. I thank you for calling in. I just would say There's something that I I put out as an as an open question And not for one person to answer because I don't believe clay there is an answer to it But I think it's an important question as I move through this primary What is the trump plan to win the independence that he needs in the states that he needs I don't say that because there is no answer I say it because I want to know the answer and I think we ought to all keep that in mind How is trump going to do better with independence this time? And you know the campaign may well address that i'm sure this is something that his Strategists are are thinking about and and I think it's in it's something we all need to know And if someone asked me well, what is it? Uh, you know, what is it exactly that you would say in the case of ronda santis ronda santis. I can just Point out what his pitch is to people Uh, who are independence is not going to win the far left obviously is not going to win democrats His pitch to independence is look at everybody who's moving to my state scoreboard that's basically the pitch People want the kind of policies that I enact Does that work for independence? That's that's another question. He says he's going to make america florida And there are a lot of people in florida that are happy about that tom and bonita springs florida. I think speaking of florida How would you assess what's going on right now? Well, I think uh with trump it's the problem the personality versus policy He weighs in on his personality too much and if he just worked on reminding the people what he did from 2016 to 2020 even with all the headwinds that he had Um, he'd do a lot better, but his own mouth puts a crisis in play almost every day Instead of shaping a solid message that says this is where we're going. I my feeling with Donald trump I know he's got great policy, but I honestly don't know if he sees what's over the horizon so much very well And I look at this whole kaling mac and anything and I asked myself How are all those trumps surround himself with good people and I think is scaramucci? I think of koan I think of amorosa in the white house. So why is that woman in the white house? Okay, she's college educated whoopee, but she had no legitimate reason for history for being there and one of the people you'll know when trump is finally throwing everybody overboard when you Text Sean Hannity that would have happened is we'll get a Herschel Walker type Electric they will vote for everybody else, but they're we're just not in this Check the box for him That that to me look I did everything I could and we've talked about this on the show and i've used george as a specific example That's my concern Seven out of eight statewide republicans one in georgia. The only one who didn't was herchel walker Herschel was the most closely connected to donald trump Now Herschel had in his past All sorts of as everyone does things that are not ideal they came after him with everything they had they spent Probably a hundred million dollars buck trying to tear him down and he came very close to winning But I look at it and say a generic republican running for the senate Seven out of eight statewide one in georgia The only one who didn't was herchel a generic republican would have won And if someone believes that georgia is just democrats cheating I I need an explanation for why they only cheat in that race and not the other Right, you know, they're only they're only picking the race where the trump backed guy Isn't gonna win and then now maybe some people believe that but I would just want to hear the explanation for why they would risk You know being caught and risk possible prison time for one race, but not all the others Uh, you know, because you could make a very clear case if you lose all the races It's a democrat wave, right? Yep, but if you're gonna rig it and rig it so only lose one of them That seems very weird doesn't it? It's a big risk for one race and also to win a lot of them not close I mean Kemp beat stacey abrams who was a well-funded challenger by almost eight points. Look, it's a great email from hulio Oh, yeah, go ahead. He's a VIP Hi to both of you and thank you for the show I was born and raised in in vina's wayla and came here shortly after shawves got into power And you guys are correct when you said socialism destroyed vina's wayla They sell the idea they're fighting for the poor Which is a lie because there are more Poor people and misery in vina's wayla than ever before that must all caps never happen with the usa That's why it's always funny buck when democrats try to lecture people Oh, you don't know what socialism really is Oh, you want to tell vina's wayla's really the people who are risking their lives to get here to fight for the freedoms that many of us Unfortunately take for granted on a day-to-day basis. No, I think they have a pretty good idea Same thing for the cubans of what socialism can do. Oh, so I always say this um some of the people you'll come across who appreciate and Love america the most are those who have come here from totalitarian regimes legally come here as True refugees, which is an important thing and is something that um, you know should should continue on not the Abuse of this this notion that goes on in our southern border right now Uh because they understand when things go badly what that really means They understand if you're in kambodia or you're in cuba or you're in vina's wayla or you're in the soviet Union When the ao seeds of the world get their way everyone's gonna have everything and it's gonna be great It's actually horrible and people end up in camps and it's awful. So there's that bit of breaking news as we go Uh to uh to finish off today show we'll talk about tomorrow mike pence according to nbc news officially announcing june 7th So we think we're going to add not only chris christy former governor of new jr But also former vice president mike pence to the race both next week Uh, I think we're going to be here at a lot about loyalty in the weeks ahead here, which will be interesting. I think maybe Guys, it's going to be quite a primary. We're honored you're spending time with us talking about this and everything else going on in the news Thank you"
