    "text": " Thank you for listening to this podcast one production available on Apple podcast and podcast one Your life your country your listening to the Laura Ingram podcast Welcome to the best of the Laura Ingram podcast. Thanks for listening There's so many memorable guests and unforgettable moments from both radio over the years and this podcast And I thought it'd be a great time to put some of this together So you have it at your fingertips conversations my most Incredibly simulating guests hilarious moments all unforgettable enjoy it here on the Laura Ingram podcast I think that my campaign kind of speaks to the idealism of young people who know that Who know understand what's going on today is is not we're not where we should be and young people have a tendency to want Think bigger than older generations joining us now. What a great treat He started the phenomenal group turning point USA and runs it We're gonna talk about the youth vote and how Republicans should actually take heart about what's happening out there in the heartland with young Americans and also about this This new radicalism in the Democrat Party that has put the Democrats in a huge bind I think and they're they're still trying to grapple with it Here joining us now is Charlie Kirk who is hosting now. It's brand new his own podcast Which I can't wait to hear on podcast one so you just go to podcast one calm or apple iTunes Put in Charlie Kirk's name if you if you want to do it that way and just subscribe So listen to him every chance you get he's gonna be great episodes. I can't wait to join him He's a good friend Charlie great to have you on congrats on the podcast. Yeah. Thank you so much Laura And thanks for having me really a treat all right Charlie I want to start with what Obama said over the weekend He was doing a sit down kind of a confab thing and he's still the big global rock star young people still look to Obama It's a great political sage even though you know I think the majority of Americans thought the country was more divided at the end of his eight years than than not So that was an interesting factoid, but he gets up there and he says what he said during the 2016 campaign that didn't work the danger of Us resorting to fear To organize ourselves falling back on tribe race ethnicity sectarian Lines that always become strong That's been true in this country in the United States the good news is that fear is typically the province of the old and Hope is the province of the young now Do you think young voters are going to look at the world in in that way that to be to be Truly young and informed today You have to be with kind of the cool cat crowd, which is always going to be the liberal crowd Is that where you see this going in 2020? well, that's the way that they're trying to frame it and I'll tell you one of the biggest mistakes that That Republicans and conservatives make is they think that all young voters are on college campuses And this is something that you talked about so effectively on your show Which is the disinfranchisement of middle America Blue-collar America of people that work in the trade and technical schools people that work with their hands There are so many young people that May not be in universities and colleges that are being brainwashed far the last there are millions of 20 something that are in the youth that are in the workforce that are union members that are Becoming hVAC certified and these are the folks that resonated with Donald Trump's message Now of course the universities tend to be much more to the last than that's the work that we're doing at turning point USA To try and win over Students around these ideas, but I'll tell you Laura that there's a huge opportunity The division between the academic elites and people that are just in the workforce Living their lives trying to make a better country out of them make a better country for themselves and for their for their family And so like I'll tell you and then the final thing is that if Obama's really just trying to make it even this Only old people are the ones that are still being fear isn't it their party that saying we're gonna die in 10 years if we don't take Radical multi trillion dollar action against climate change aren't they the ones that are still being fear? I don't quite understand how they could possibly say that's a great problem with any sort of evidence behind it Do you love how AOC Charlie she said 12 years and then They do a work said 10 an interview A couple days ago I want to make sure that those who work in the oil and gas Industry are brought along as partners to make sure that we make this transition in the 10 years that we have left to us as the science And scientists tell us to make the kind of bold change that we need it now my next week It's gonna be eight years. This is a fast two years I'm from 12 to 10 What I need to see is I need to see a receiver to Robert Francis or which I actually call him that instead of the fake name They don't Have a debate of why they think it's 10 years or 12 years and why they need to know what why? They just the 97 trillion versus a hundred trillion dollars and Here's the reality that Laura is that far too often on these college campuses the professor's deal and utopianism that if you just give government a little bit more power and you give a little bit more authority to the Elite and the ruling class things will get better. Just trust us with your life and things will get better and Far too. It's the easiest generation to sell that to the population I should say to sell that message to because inherently young people want to create a better world You know, you know that would I'm describing Laura at Dartmouth You have these students that think they're fighting for what is right to them what is good But as soon as they start to affect them personally, it's a wait a second I don't have to get away more my money. I don't have to pay more in taxes have somebody else do that and just to sum it up really Simply it's very easy to be generous with other people's money now OPM again when when your life is Steeped in the politics of resentment like if someone you know the Obama line you didn't build that Then you're never gonna be happy because there's always gonna be someone who has more than you and there's always gonna be someone who's Gone to a better school or has had more privileges and But I guess that's really it's a long way of saying that it's just all the Democrats really Have to traffic in right now is the same old tired cliches bromides tropes about wealth inequality and like cuz that's never existed throughout the history of human civilization We've had it unequal opportunities and unequal Standard of living. I mean so they have to throw this out because it I don't know makes them sound More virtuous more compassionate cooler And meanwhile the economy is red hot they have no real alternative Charlie They're not trying to argue that they're gonna produce a better economy than Trump. They've just given up on that altogether That's exactly right and so this is this present a huge opportunity for when I talk to students is a lot of the left to Talk about theory and how they're gonna recreate our society. We can talk to practice practicality in reality Talk about how wages are going up for the first time In over 20 years and Laura you covered this so great on your show. What is a tight labor market means for middle America? Wages going up. This is like illegal immigration is a huge threat to middle America because when you have cheap labor that is undercutting Blue collar jobs. They're stealing social security numbers. They're dealing in cash only businesses who gets disenfranchised Well, the folks that are earning fifty or fifty thousand dollars a year living paycheck to paycheck They're not going to see a pay increase and so this is exactly what you're talking about Laura where We have an opportunity to sell the real success of the populist Conservative ideas that you and I talk about versus just the unrealistic and you can morally incorrect ideas of the radical left that was totally harbor the success that we're seeing Now and by the way Laura, I think this economy could get even better for middle America If the president continued to double and triple down on his immigration stance and his trade deals being tough on China And I would love to see that the continuation of this term and you know God willing his second term Yeah, I think that he should do a new tax cut if I were Trump I would offer a much bit much more substantial middle-class tax cut and let the Democrats say no Yes, and just call it the working man's tax cut and something I advocate for all the time on college campuses because believe it or not Laura one of the top questions that I'll get is about this Very dangerous idea of universal basic income. I think you've covered it once or twice on your show Yeah, which is Andrew Yang running for president saying he's a person deserves a thousand dollars a month When I respond to that and it resonates with students Well, why not a thousand dollar a month tax cut for anyone that earns less than $80,000 a year any household that earned $80,000 a year or less. Why not keep more of your own money? That would be so Powerful for the economy Laura and I think look I I'm I believe in free market economics I believe in the supply side theory But I do think there's some merit in giving the consumer some relief as well in middle class working man's tax cut I think would have huge effects on the economy that would keep this growth going Charlie Kirk we are so grateful that you're out there the job of speaking with and helping educate and understand I think the young people in this country It cannot be left up to the liberal Preface Orient. It must be tackled with facts and Courage and you're doing that. I know you're such great team Working with you at turning point USA. Let me know what I can do to help and I just know you're gonna be a huge success In podcasting and and I'm just I'm grateful you become a friend and proud of you my friend Well, I'm such a huge fan of yours and I catch your show every night Thank you for mentoring me and for help to be part of the podcast one family and just thank you for all you do for our country Thanks for listening to the best of the Laura Ingram podcast your life your country You're listening to the Laura Ingram podcast Next month the Leander public library will not hold what it billed as drag queen story time overnight several right-wing websites and outspoken activists started sharing a flyer Promoting the event the library invited people on June 15th to quote join us for fabulous stories and songs Libraries all across the country have held similar events with drag queens to promote tolerance and acceptance of others those events though have drawn both support and pushback including in neighboring states like Arkansas and Louisiana One Leander mother told us that she could not wait to bring her son to this event when she heard about it Wednesday She's now disappointed to learn about its cancellation and as a message to whomever made that decision. It's really upsetting to think that People can be excluded because of who they are or Because of what they wear It's it's nothing more than that. It's just somebody coming in a fancy outfit to read stories to little kids Is that really what it's about? Really so is that the way Transgendered persons or drag queens would describe themselves just people who wear funny costumes. I think that's wrong Actually, they certainly don't describe themselves that way. It's a lot more complex than that But do you see how? The left and these progressive parents. I mean, I don't know how they found like they found one person who would be so excited about this But that's how they have to sell it. Oh, don't worry. It's just for the kids It's just a nice story hour. This is so cute isn't this fun. It's just a clown dressed like a dress like someone else We like costumes. We use them on Halloween and in masquerade parties What is this really all about though? Well, the Washington Post has a piece and it's you know typical bias clap trap from the Washington Post But it has a piece about this Drag Queen storytime issue, which is it's kind of you know what I described as this is the new Challenge to the Christian Baker story You wonder well why you know a gay couple can go anywhere for cake. Why do they seek a? You know some type of controversy with the one baker they know Who is like I don't know born-again Christian doesn't want to make like why are they pushing this? It's just a coincidence and Why is this happening in other? forums a flower or a ranger, you know, is it just this is just random stuff that's happened. No, it's not random This is a concerted effort on the part in the Washington Post makes this point It's a concerted effort on the part of San Francisco activists to spread the Tolerance this is what they call the tolerance what it really is is I think foisting San Francisco values on the rest of the country That you parents are going to get numb to this everyone will and especially kids This is just this is just this is just like everybody you know the drag queens just like everybody else So don't this if you don't like the drag queen then you don't like Anything you are not a tolerant good person So you must love the drag queen in story time You must bring your child if you object to this in any way shape or form you're part of the Trump Atmosphere of intolerance and hatred toward people who aren't like you the other as the left likes to call the other But what you really find when you dig down into these types of stories is that They're being foisted upon the country with a clear agenda This is a gender-driven cultural politics here And it's wrapped up as all this is just for the kids isn't this nice. It's done for the kids Well, this is done to change The kids and the perhaps even in some cases the parents perceptions of Gender and traditional norms of gender and understanding of gender and so forth And so by the time the kid gets into high school or college there's been a long period of of You know becoming You know a climatized acclimated I should say to this Understanding of the fluidity of gender and and the idea of man and woman and masculine and feminine That's not the window. No, no, no, no. That's old. That's yesterday. No, no, no This is this is part of the new atmosphere the new environment in which you must You must embrace it in order to be truly compassionate. I should say human being otherwise You're just one of these religious Intolerant holier-than-thou-pious narrow-minded Traglodyte types Who don't like their kids who claim that they don't like their kids to be sexualized at a young age and exposed to new sexual understandings even though The parents who think well, why are you doing this in a public library? Why is why do little kids? Have to be introduced to these Yeah, these visions of the changing fluid world of gender Why why are you going after the kids this way? That's what a lot of the parents are saying in these comments, but those parents are treated like complete pariahs in the Dominant media culture someone the Washington Post The story is always framed as well the intolerant Christian right Stands up and says no to the poor drag queens. How dare they? But then you there's also some tidbits buried in the story the organization drag queen story hour. It's actually an organization's name Started in late 2015 in San Francisco ready. This is the Washington Post piece Just this is the rise of Trump, right? Just as the country's reinvigorated right wing was coming to form But it has found many fans with chapters in areas outside traditionally liberal cities it Now has outposts. I mean they have an office In places like Milwaukee, New Orleans Charlotte, Mobile, Alabama and San Marcos, Texas its founders have Described it as a reaction to the harsh political landscape of the past few years in which painful debates about issues like identity Sexuality and race Have animated the country's politics think about just that writing that sense in other words If anyone disagrees with what the left is doing on issues of gender race or anything else for that matter This is a painful environment that must be confronted directly face to face by The drag queens and others and anyone on the other side is a horrible awful rotten person. That's just it That's that's what this is but what the real goal here And I'm you know reading all these message boards on this the real goal here is the kids If you if you get the kids whether they're in a public school and suddenly you have you know A day where a six-year-old Who was John the day before comes to school as Jane or Jeanette and you have to call the boy now Jeanette because of that's what the boy identifies it that's the new introduction at a young age to children who You know they they don't understand they're just little kids They just want to be kids and what I would say to all of this is why are you doing this to the children? Why do you feel like you have to subject children to adult themes and These are adult themes don't don't say it's just a costume and ain't a cost a drag queen is a nightclub Performing is a nightclub performer. Thank you very much and it's been popularized because of RuPaul and You know everyone loves RuPaul's miss but this is just what it's you know This is what it what it's all about and don't don't disabuse yourself of the notion that this is about oh You know these these are just volunteers. I want to read stories to kids No, no the Washington Post makes it clear that the founders started this in reaction to Trump That's what it is like as if Trump talks about like gay or any other issues I didn't talk about that silly absolutely ridiculous, but that's where we are. It's very very disturbing and I Think what we're going to continue to see is this effort to sexualize Young people if adults want to you know dress up or call themselves different names I don't I don't care what you do But don't tell me that my children have to get up and and you know give you a high-five for it because guess what everyone can believe what they want to believe and What we intend to do on this podcast is to demonstrate how the left and It's clear at this point are is the most completely intolerant group of folks Because of the way that they they require you to bow down and if you don't bow down to this You're an intolerant bigoted horrible awful rotten person Except them by the way the the church that they said saved this story hour is the United Church of Christ Which is as you know the the most left-wing church in the United States is pushed a lot of these types of issues over the years So that's just that's just where we are on that, but drag Queen's story hour So it's just it's a new Christian Baker challenge to the Christian Baker story.

This has been long Anticipated and long awaited a lot of people have problems with Pope Francis think he's too liberal We're concerned that this was going to be opening the door to a reconsideration of time I never thought that but a lot of people did and they came down with basically a very traditional document about the understanding of male versus female And so we'll get into that in just a moment with Bill Donahue from the Catholic League and what does all this mean? but first well Now they're not only Welcoming kids to drag queen story hours They're encouraging kids to themselves become drag queens I'm Desmond. I'm 11 years old and I like pizza Trains and drinking root beers and it's tapping free. I Also do drag and I love to put on makeup dresses and wigs and of course jewelry is necessary My full drag name is Desmond is amazing. I love doing drag because it makes me feel amazing and self-expressive It just feels amazing to know that people love what I do my one big message would be dreamers be yourself always Wow joining us now is built on a here from the Catholic League Bill there's a piece of Nash review by Madeline Kern's about this little boy and the title is Desmond is amazing needs saving About this this little boy and what's happened to our youth their innocence before puberty even trying to change kids understanding of just or you know basic concepts or sexualize them and Destroy their innocence. What's happening here? Well, this is child abuse. Let's go for what it is And the people behind this I want to make it clear the average gay person is probably no more interested in this than the average Straight person and you're having got enough gays in this country If they lined up single file to pull this kind of a lot of cessation of our society together No, you couldn't do it without the help of a normal lot of straight people almost all of them are straight people They may be guided by gay activists and there's a difference for the gay activists and a person is not an activist Obviously those are the ones I'm talking about but this is an attempt basically. It's an assault on nature and our nature is gone That's what it's really about. It's about the family of course and everything else and they're using radical individualism As their spear, but it's basically an assault on nature They're trying to deny the existence of nature that there are fundamental profound differences between men and woman rooted not in culture But in nature and and that's what we're up against Well, I think when you look at this new, you know again contrived controversy and it's started as a group of activists in San Francisco in 2015 who decided how do we sell this gender fluidity concept and Get publicity and grow this movement They grow it by starting this drag queen story hour Organization in San Francisco in 2015 happens to coincide with the rise of Donald Trump They they start this organization and then they Export it across the United States and get all these liberal reporters to write pieces about these intolerant Christian conservatives and Catholic groups who are Expressing outrage that even the public libraries are turning into these little political and social transformation instruments Well a number of years ago. I wrote about the public libraries hosting NAMBLA. That's right the North American Manboy Love Association Which believes? If if these eighties too late If they're organized one purpose to sexually molest little boys and girls mostly boys And they are they organized and meet for the purpose of molesting molesting kids in Public libraries at public expense and defended by the American Civil Liberties Union So it's not it's not a great leap now you talk about intolerance The Nevada can put that a document which simply restates the obvious that there are fundamental difference between men and women and last night The most filthy-mounted comedian on television today Trevor Noah goes off and says things which I cannot we're gonna play some of it podcast. Yeah, well, we're gonna play some absolutely astonishing Yeah, let's play. We'll play some of it the stuff that we can play Let's listen. Oh and get this dance together part of the Vasikans rationale is that transgender people go against its belief that God made men and women to reproduce which first of all transgender people can reproduce and Secondly again, why do you care? All right, you don't even let your people reproduce right? Nums aren't allowed to have sex, right? Priests can't get little boys pregnant. Yeah Yeah, yeah Horrific person. Yeah, I mean, you know, we've been dealing with some of the people at Viacom before but I just Before I went on the air here with you Laura Mobilizing this day if we've contacted we're gonna contact we have the names. I'm gonna put out a statement on Trevor Noah shortly I'll help you on following our victory in Michigan with this Trump nominee who was terribly flawed But this thing here is amazing. We've got the names and the address is now all the top people who work at Viacom They've got to do something about this and I don't want to be lectured by one more person on the left That the people who are you don't agree with civility and the people who are intolerant are Conservatives nobody would put this guy on television if he attacked homosexuals is much as he taxed the Catholic Church And the and of course he misrepresents the church's teachings which that's all deliberate to either that or just the display in fools But this is what we're up against in my lifetime I've never seen such an all-out frontal assault by moral nihilists who are morally bankrupt on the traditional Values that this country was rooted in again so much of this comes down to advancing an agenda by using children and Manipulating the thoughts and the natural understanding of children That's where I have a real real concern and I'm not alone Yeah, they want to get the hands of the kids. There's no question about that and this whole idea of changing your sex They're not changing your gender. That's social Role that I learned from nature Changing your sex this started in Johns Hopkins University in the medical school back in the 1960s And it was started by people who not some of whom I think had good intentions others whom I don't think I know quite a bit about this subject and again about the mode of their they started back in the 1960s at Johns Hopkins And after about two or three decades they came to the conclusion most of them at least That not only does it not work in the sense of making somebody happy But approximately nine years after the people make the sex change. There's a big spike in the suicide rate Now, this is not only true in the United States. It's true in places like Sweden. Oh, yeah, well palma to who is the leading researcher at Johns Hopkins on and has been for decades on this gender fluidity movement the medical Research behind it Sex reassignment this idea of sex reassignment. It doesn't work It's impossible to reassign someone sex physically and attempting to do so doesn't produce good outcomes psychosocially and this this was written initially as a Synopsis by Ryan Anderson as a PhD also and this focuses on this area for the Heritage Foundation, but McEw is the distinguished service professor of psychiatry at Johns Hopkins and He said transgendered men do not become women nor do transgendered women become men all including people like Bruce Bruce Jenner become Feminized men or masculine eyes women counterfeits or impersonators of the sex with which they quote identify in that lies their problematic future and That's you know Sex equality in a new book called common sense Catholicism There's this issue and in fact I'd mention Jenner and I said he can't menstruate Okay, can people get that through their head? He can't menstruate. He will never be a woman He will always be a male you can't change your chromosomal makeup I mean this is madness on stilts and the idea that it's coming from the Academy doesn't surprise me That's where the loons are there used to be in the asylum now they get now they have tenure and they're teaching this stuff It bubbles down Percolates down into into the culture itself. What really is amazing to me though Laura more than anything else The one segment of the population that I most really Disheartened with because they've totally dropped their guard altogether. That's the corporate elite of America They are on board from Amazon and the Silicon Valley to Goldman Sachs here in the Wall Street area Kellogg Macy's has has on I'm like a quest street from Macy's the big big one here in Hell Square in New York City I was walking down the street near the dead get to a doctor's appointment on 34th Street and I see they have all the rainbow colors out into the sidewalk I guess New York City allows them to do that all of a pride pride pride Look, I don't care whether somebody's gay or not I know people were discriminated against in the past and I understand that a lot of times unjustly But the idea of people being pride and by the way, how did this turn out to be a month? I don't know the day We can have st. Patrick's day month and making to make March Irish month or I don't know where do we go with this? I'm kind of over all the months. I mean, I mean people like cuz I was a breast cancer You know, I had breast cancer, but if you like breast cancer month I said it seems like for people who've had breast cancer for us We're always we're always being very vigilant about our health and trying so it's kind of all the time for us So I'm not really understanding the month But I guess it's just a time to have awareness about issues and so forth But this is being done on the on this on the gender reassignment and then the drag queen is you know, it's kind of is different because not all drag queens are Transgender persons are seeking sex reassignment surgery. There are lots of different topics here But my point is why are we dragging? Children into this debate if you want to debate this as an adult and debate Paul McEw and the the Guardian in Britain did this piece that Looked at a hundred follow-up studies of post-operative Transsexuals by Birmingham University's research intelligence facility and they found some really interesting things about post-operative transsexuals and It was not at all conclusive that this was a good thing to encourage people to get this surgery And so if we wanted to bait that then that would be interesting among adults But why do I have to drag the children into this that is my concern? Well, it fits in with the left agenda. They're always driven by one word power And so what you try to do is to indoctrinate and why not start it in the kindergarten Try to try to go go to the preschool if you can try to get kids when they're young and try to get to get them Their minds molded that this is acceptable That's what they're teaching in schools now and there's every kind of sex is all equal But what is not more dangerous than the other even though that's obviously not true They're trying to teach these kids that a boy can become a girl and so Sally can become Sam and Sam can become Sally Has as dr. McEw's appointed out as you mentioned him before these people are mentally ill that is his Considered judgment after dealing with this for decades and we were to treat these people Treat them as human beings for the maladies that they suffer from and not try to proselytize Others and then when people rightly object as parents that I don't want my kids subjected to this kind of indoctrination This kind of perverse Understandative sexuality that we're called in tolerant yet They're the ones trying to shove their radical secular gender down the throats of people and they won't allow you opt out We've seen this in California. What's going on right now? There's no opt out clause for any of this kind of stuff and that's what they are teaching in the textbooks and unfortunately California is the gold standard of textbook with sets of standard for textbooks across the other 49 states That's where they where they get their lead from so no they don't want to allow choice for that To that extent obviously the only choice they'd like is what is the choice to abort? But when it comes to parent parental choice, that's just simply that's something the left will never tolerate Yeah, I'm looking at the American psychiatric diagnostic manual and the DSM it's called and they have the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and Transsexualism gender identity disorder and so forth. There's been a lot of political pressure put on the psychiatric Community to destigmatize these you know these what they called maladies and And to say this is not though. No, this is not a condition. This is not a Psychiatric condition. This is just a state of being so they're under pressure and have been and that's why someone like Paul Mckew You'll rarely see him do an interview because this is a man who's dealt in facts and long-term studies follow-up studies of individuals and So they can't really debate someone like Mckew on the facts Bill instead they go straight to the politics Love is love you're a horrible person if you don't embrace this and parents who don't bring their kids to this, you know Drag Queen's story time. They're also part of the right-wing white nationalist movement I mean, so it's just a complete tiring of anyone who calls into question this and I think sexualization of our kids And this actually began around 1970 it was 1973 the American Psychological Association Decided that That homosexuality was not a mental illness And that's that's fine if they want to come to that conclusion based on scientific evidence But starting three years before that around 1970 gay activists showed up at the at the convention the American Psychological Association every year to intimidate And call them Nazis and got the home phone numbers and addresses. This was all Pressure politics coming from the left. There was no scientific evidence to suggest that they should change the diagnostic Statistical manual whatsoever and they did so they gave a caved in out of intimidation This is pretty well been recounted and now of course They got the psychiatric community on board as well You get the corporations on board you even have some of the churches you mentioned United Church of Christ That was Barry Lynn's church Americans United for Separation of Church and State so We really got our hands full on this the average American of course does want to protect his kid But those who have parents unfortunately were not reproducing the way we should but those Single people don't seem to care but those who have those of us who have parent parents and have kids They're the ones who care about this stuff and unless we we can get to them and mobilize them The left will simply take over altogether Yeah, just so at though everyone understands what bill is referencing here. I think it's important to read it right from the research gate dot net which publishes the American psychiatric Diagnostic manual and you can read through all the changes over the years and you know look things change and we understand that but let's just listen to this It's very very interesting in 1980 the American Psychiatric Association Recognized trans sexuality as a quote mental disorder Revising this designation more specifically in 1994 as a quote gender identity disorder then in 2013 the term for diagnosis was changed to quote gender dysphoria in order to make it sound less pathological And that's a zucker the guy who wrote this for the manual another term that has been used in order to Pathologize the diagnosis of trans identities is quote gender incongruence So you see how the language has changed over time and it's meant to ease it into the you know the common parlance and also ease it into the common understanding and acceptance But that's interesting for so 1980 from a mental disorder and today It's gender incongruence which signed it sounds fine. I mean it sounds well. It's kind of incongruent, but what isn't? Well, you know, it's interesting I still hold on to some of my textbooks that I used to sign to my students in sociology In social problem and now of course everything's changed, but again it changed not for scientific reasons There was no empirical evidence that came out which said no previous ideas were wrong It was all a matter of the politicization Of the Academy as Robert Nismith a great sociologist said a long time ago We don't have any more social sciences the world political sciences And it's on that basis that kids are just being told what what to think on this and and of course the The media Hollywood the autistic community now the corporate world They're all lining up single file and they've decided who's oppressed and who isn't oppressed and that's why Trevor Noah can go ahead With his filthy mouth ripping the Catholic Church with impunity because they simply don't care that's how that's how much the moral Distribution of some segments of the media has collapsed to such an extent that they would allow this kind of vile language Used against any religion.

That's ADT calm Mmm America now and forever you're listening to the best of the Laura Ingraham podcast Hi, I am Gia and I am transgender at the end of middle school like eighth grade I decided to come out to my friends and like tell them that I was transgender and like this how I've been feeling for like The past 13 years of my life so I decided to write a letter to my whole entire school to let like everyone know what was going on The letter just said that this is how I've been feeling for the past 13 years and that I will be coming to school and like I guess like with society says like girls clothes and I'll be like identifying like with she her pronouns well, we've had a lot of Changes in our schools over the years and this one Really is one of the most profound where children are Just sua sponte that means seemingly out of nowhere beginning to say no They're not wanting to be called a girl or a boy anymore This is my new name and this is who I am and this is how I quote identify It's been documented in Britain and in some towns. There's been a 900% increase and the incidents of individuals young people calling themselves quote Transgendered what's going on here and is there any concern and it seems to be building of Children going down this road some wanting attention some having other problems then an Exirably altering their body their development and perhaps endangering their psychological futures Let alone their physical futures And what of this do we need to have a conversation about this? We are talking about children here joining us now is wall tire. He's the founder of the website sex change regret and It's a site for people Who of course regret trying to change? Their genders he joins us now Walt we've been talking about a lot of topics today I mean, I love all people and I always say I'm I'm the most flawed person out there. So I'm I really try not to I'm not gonna Judge people condemn people. That's not my job. My job is to ask questions and and I hope to try to be fair as I do that But it there really seems to be a building consensus solidified in the popular culture in the mainstream media that The these types of quote reassignment surgeries and gender blockers for children that they're fine No problem and it's just a in it's just a logical choice for kids who are you know Feel like they're not in the right bodies. What what is your experience and how can you inform us with it? Yeah, working with the people are thanks for at me on working with the people who've been through this of all ages What we find is that somewhere between Three and fifteen years after they transition sometimes 20 years They find that it's not what they thought it was going to be they regretted deeply they found that their body has been Transformed beyond repair they become even more deeply depressed After then they were before and so what we're really dealing with Laura is what we call a social contagion This is exploding as you pointed out Only because other people are doing it. So this is this effect of people joining other people It's a way to gain attention many of these young people who are identifying as transgender have had difficulty being Accepted socially and as soon as you identify as a transgender you can suck all the air out of the room and become recognized in your hero and so we're dealing with What people have identified is rapid onset of gender dysphoria What that really means is they don't have gender dysphoria. It's just a social Idea boy. I can become popular immediately if I come out people will recognize me I'll become the center of attention and so it's it's really Very destructive the long-term harm that comes from hormone blockers and engaging in cross-gender hormones and surgeries Are we see very high rates of suicide? 19 times more likely to have a successful suicide by the people who've transitioned than the people who haven't Well What can be done? You know what what can be done about this in a culture where if you even raise the issue now I know a lot of people who won't even talk about this because they're afraid of of the backlash and I just don't you know, I just I just say look if you're if you're honest about Children and what children need and want and what you know what the science is if you're honest about it then you have to ask questions, you know, they're always accusing of Christian conservatives and people who try to be You know traditional Catholics and just traditional people period they always accuse them of being anti science And so so now we're saying okay the world renowned experts on this issue like Paul McEw and Paul Hrews These people have actually done the work peer-reviewed studies actually done the long-term work and their Their findings are disturbing Yeah disturbing Very disturbing and Laura what can be done? And I recently wrote a book that's been released is called trans life survivors And this is probably one of the ways that we can impact it because it's very hard to come out publicly Or have an effect in schools and say you shouldn't be doing this, but I found The people are grabbing this book. They're beginning to understand the destructive because it talks about the destruction There's 30 stories in there people who've been through this of all ages And it talks about their suicides it talks about their attempted suicides and the destructive components of a tempting to change genders And so what we realize is nobody actually changes They make themselves look different But after a period of time they realized that this is a masquerade They really didn't change if they were affirmed and missed by you know their psychological help or from school or whatever and And then it fades away and and they don't have this desire to change genders anymore And that's why my website gets hundreds of thousands of views And that's why I'm working with people every single day of the week who are struggling to now be transitioned back and and find peace After having gone through this so it's a very destructive Well, it looks really good and there's a lot of people pushing for this at the outset the downside Is horrible and that's why like Paul Ruse and the cube who are friends of mine Have got the data they've done the research and it's destructive and we shouldn't be promoting transgender ideology even in the summary of the diagnostic changes of how they Diagnosed excuse me people individuals with gender dysphoria, which is the new way they refer to this It's been a changing nomenclature since 1980 And I just I just documented that reading from the diagnostic manuals is not a conservative website they're even Concerned about the gender. This is part. This is like a footnote five. I'm into the footnotes This is how geeky I am the gender dysphoria criteria for children are Potentially more conservative than they were in the DSM for TR because the current Criterion and its eight symptoms is now a necessary symptom for the diagnosis And in total the the criterion pertains to the child's strong desire to be the other Gender or some alternative gender different from one's assigned gender the tightening of the requirement for caseness Will likely sharpen the distinction between a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and normative variation? I think I Think more people are concerned now than ever more than ever that children respond to the power of suggestion and That in in many of these cases the children are seeing through the power of suggestion and glamorization in the popular culture that this is a way to be accepted and they might be suffering in many ways of things going on at home or they might just they might be upset about various things in their lives But it's very very important that Children are not improperly diagnosed and then put on a track for Procedures or medication whose long-term effect we do not know is that correctly stated? Absolutely correct and keep in mind that the diagnosis for gender dysphoria is consistent Insistent and persistent but also those three components. That's all it takes to be diagnosed as a child with gender dysphoria That also is the same way and criteria used for mental disorders if they if they're struggling from depression Or bipolar disorder anything else consistent persistent and insistent that it's continued These are all the same things used to diagnose mental disorders so we're diagnosing children and and putting them on a path. It's very destructive for them and It's just way too easy for them to say I feel like I'm a girl If they're a guy and then for mom to say oh well, you're probably transgender and you should change your name and get a different Pronouns and this is absolutely what happened to me. It was very destructive I've been dealing with this now for 74 years. There is nothing good about it Except my D transition in 1990 and I've been speaking about it ever since and that's why I mentioned again My book trans live survivors. It has the stories in there about children and why it's important Appearance to read this book before they affirm and guide their children down to transgender path just so people understand your own story 1990 I mean I didn't even know this was a thing in 1990 what happened to you? Specifically in briefly well, I was a four-year-old kid who today would be considered a transgender kid who was cross-dressing And I was affirmed as a young child and began to have that seed of and we didn't have the word dysphoria then but to be ID idea that I should have been a girl went on until I had surgery at age 42 and Lived eight years as a female until I began to study psychology and realized this is a psychologically disorder Then so if we spend the time to understand how they got there and sometimes it's a disorder of being affirmed and guided and supported in a cross-gender identity because This is where the dysphoria begins is in the affirmation process and how destructive is child abuse to affirm a child in a cross-gender identity So I came out of this in 1990 and we've been helping people we've helped hundreds of people now Find their way back and That's part of what's in the book And so but there are a lot of people who will say there you know I've met some transgender folks over the last few years and they seem really happy I've got to say I'm just I'm just trying to play devil's advocate They seem really happy and they're and they're and they're and they're living you know their own truth and they're living their own experience and and You know they're I mean I really mean I really like them a great people and I just happened to have met them through friends or through work and You know so they would say Well, I'm sorry you had a bad experience, but that's not our experience and we have a lot of friends who don't have that bad experience at all So what do you say to them? Yeah? Well, I say that I was one of those people if they interviewed who had a good experience during the eight year period And so you know the what what we know is it's a temporary reprieve at some point between Three and twenty years that experience may not happen now if it goes beyond that and what we found out is that people Most likely are not transgender, but they're actually suffering from autogainophilia And so the autogain of people who are autogainophiliates will continue to persist in this cross-gender identity because of What autogainophiliates is not really transgenderism so being able to pull these things apart and begin to understand what autogainophiliates and what transgenderism is and what being a drag queen is or Transvestic fetish is really important and that's why the book translice survivors will help people pull this stuff apart All right, we really appreciate your story Paul Hire founder of the website sex change regret here on the Laura Ingram podcast And let's go to Liz and Pennsylvania Liz go ahead. Oh, hi I just wanted to say that you know, I do think that this is affecting my children. I have fourth and sixth-grade daughters Yesterday my daughter at school Was told by many other kids by leaving stickies on their death to make sure you wear gay pride shirts tomorrow in support of their you know agenda my daughter said that I don't support that because that's how she was raised and They can't they really gave her a hard time. They bully her. I bet they bullied her They definitely bullied her they they said what is wrong with you? Why do you hate gays and my daughter is very fourth grader and said I don't hate anybody. I just don't support this lifestyle and You know, they really came out her and bullied her so I did call the school and thank God the school did do something about it I will give them that But it's being pushed so much in the town with picketing in the libraries with drag queens It's just pushed that all I'm asking is can can we stop pushing it on our children? I'm raising my child not to think that way. I'm not Raising them to hate them just that we should be able to have our beliefs also No, that's not the ear You know what you have to understand is no, they will not allow you to have your beliefs. They will try to run You out of town. They'll try to Demonize you. They'll try to run people off the air who disagree with the prevailing Wisdom they want to shut down debate because the debate takes them to an uncomfortable place actual debate where it's not imbued with all sorts of slogans that Sound nice with you know with colors that look nice a Real debate about the science and the facts. It's very different, isn't it? I mean it's a different We you end up in a different place or you just say look I love all people I'm not judging anybody, but this is not what we believe so why do they get to have their truth? But you don't get to have your truth. That's my My question when I know the answer to is because they believe You and your daughter and all traditional Americans are an existential threat to their continued advancement That's what they believe and they believe America's history in this traditional Christian heritage is itself Deeply flawed and in fact in many ways evil. So that's what they believe a Standhold Liz cuz I want to find out more about what's happening in that particular school of a standhold. We're gonna I talked you off air. Let's go to Trent in Alabama Trent's a middle school teacher Trent Yes, ma'am. Thank you for having me and I just want to encourage you to keep doing what you're doing We thank you for doing it. Thank you Teach children I've been doing it for about 23 years now. I have a daughter myself and it's just Sable and these kids are impressionable Let a kid be a kid Let these parents be able to pop out of programs with before just Putting them in places and environments where they're gonna hear things like this It's crazy. Well again. They need the kids though. Don't they? They need the kids they without without indoctrinating children on a whole variety of issues whether it's abortion or any of these other issues Without that the the movement kind of dies out So they need the kids they need to turn the kids into their own little community organizers activists Across the board on a whole host of issues, and this is just one of the more I think Potentially destructive issues, which is trying to get little children sexualized so they become sexual beings and I think a lot of this is geared toward lowering the age of consent for children, too In other words if you can change your gender and say I'm changing my gender at age seven Why couldn't you say well? How who are you to say children can't have sexual intercourse? You see what I'm saying like if you can if you as a child can make a decision that would lead to perhaps permanently altering your Existence as you know as someone who can reproduce or Your body or if that's the case then why can't you do what you want with your body? including have sex There I mean, I'm not the first one to say this is this has been written about for many many years.
