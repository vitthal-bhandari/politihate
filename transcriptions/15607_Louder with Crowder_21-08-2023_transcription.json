Sorry. You won't shut up. May I do the sipping, please? Please. Now, great. Just got third degree burns because I rushed it. It's the great start. Hey, that's because we have a very, very busy week next week, just so you know, first off, we have Alex Jones, a show launched this week. So I'm sitting in the next the next seven days. Very busy this Friday. Boom. Also our show Friday, if you are not a member of mug club, so we're doing five shows a week. You got Alex Jones, got Nick to Apollo, four days a week, feel better Nick. He's been a little bit under the weather. Then on Monday, we are going to be releasing the first black and white and the gray issues. It's pretty simple on the street. Talk with black guys. That's it. Sweet. As a white guy. Why? You'll be shocked as to how much common ground you find as a white Christian conservative with the average black American who has lived what the left calls the so-called black experience, right? I don't know if they and Jones is right now or Joy Reid, but it was a great experience. And next one, we'll be doing in a barbershop. I think we're missing each other. We need to keep speaking with each other. Then, Gerald is going to Milwaukee. We're doing a live debate stream on Wednesday night live, tune in for that. And we will have the candidates. We'll have a mug club booth down there in Milwaukee. So a lot of stuff going on next week. This week, I'm angry because apparently now we've lost the words. And by the way, if you see this, this means head from YouTube over to rumble, if you see this ever at any point. Yeah. And you might see it soon. We've lost the words. That's a warning to the people out there in Mission Control. We've lost the words retarded. We've lost the word fag. And now we've lost the word riggers. Riggers is the word rig. If you're listening on audio, once again, that word is riggers because Donald Trump has talked about the riggers of the election. And of course, the left is lost their mind saying that that is a racist dog whistle. Let me know. What word do you think we lose next? You can comment below. And my point here today is it doesn't matter what you do or what you say. Do you see it? Do you see it? No, but I'm not racist. Yeah, but you said riggers. So and then you have, you have a peanut guy who goes, oh, riggers, well, that clearly he clearly means to say the N word and burn across is re is regrow. Well, still. How about how about don't talk before the introduction? Sorry. Again, I'm like a race. All right. So we'll be talking about that. Maui, you've been lied to three key facts. It gets to be white noise. I understand it. We're distilling it down to three key facts. You know, climate change is not chief amongst them. No, it's not amongst them at all. Those facts will be stunned to find out that climate change is not amongst them. And we'll also be announcing some contest winners here on the show. Gerald A, number two CEO. How are you? I am doing well. I love it when you're a little prickly. Joe Lewis woke me up at 2 30 a.m. is which because you know, he doesn't bark. Yeah, he's not a barker and he his hair was up. He was his ears were up and it sounded like there were people in the house there. There's this weird area of my neighborhood where it echoes. Right. And they were doing like some work on the street and stuff like that. So I woke up. So I got about two hours of sleep, but I had to encourage him because I don't want to lose that. Right. So the guys showed up on time. I pay them to be up in the middle of the night just to piss you off. Well, I encourage him because I want him to mess them up if they do. Well, that's true. Yeah, I never want to lose that. No, I'm going to go with Joe Lewis. Good boy, Joe Lewis. We'll bring it on my club. And then when you hear this, you know who it is. Oh, look at that. Yeah, nothing like revealing the lead. Thursday, Friday, Saturday, August 24th through the 26th, he's going to be left out out loud comedy club in San Antonio. And his show starts here September 1st on Muck Club. The Brian Kalins, Mr. Brian Kalins. How are you? I'm just a man, my friend wearing this blue. Yeah, I think tempers, the hatred in my eyes, I hope. Man, we're using that term loose, which Oh, come on now, by the way, I was in your house last night. I like to watch sleep. Oh, I know. I thought I thought Joe Lewis a treat. He loves you. I know you sleep deep. You sleep. You play dirty, Brian, you play dirty. That's not fair. I do. I know I need my sleep. I like to pick locks and ninja creep. Some people call it beauty sleep. I call it staving off death sleep. Just doing my best. I have all these things. My Instagram about reverse aging. I don't know if you know this. Another ball cramp. All right, doesn't work. Nope. So let's go right into it. Donald Trump, right? Some people call him former president. Some people refer to him as sitting president. I call him sitting president. Okay. So Donald Trump is going to be hosting a live stream on Monday regarding Georgia and the safest and most secure. Oh, that's right. YouTube now allows us to say that the biggest bullshit election of our time. Yeah. So he is going to be doing a live stream on Monday. Now he also responded in his latest indictment here to Georgia. And then he put something on truth social, which they're now accusing of being racist surprise. So let's first watch a clip of his press conference that took place, I believe, on Monday. I challenge the election in Georgia, which I have every right to do, which I was right about, frankly. And they want to indict me because I challenge the election. Then they have this crap going on. I never even thought of this one. Trump didn't really believe he won the election. Let me tell you, people that nobody say, that's one thing. There was never a second of any day that I didn't believe that that election was remember, I told you nothing else matters. If he believed it was a rigged election, but there were shenanigans. There's nothing illegal. There's a disgusting election. And this country should be ashamed. And they go after the people that want to prove that it was rigged and stolen. So it never happens. They go after them. They don't go after the people that rigged it. Okay. And we'll see how it all turns out. You know, do you see, do you hear that? Hold on, faintly in the distance. It's the sound of of DeSantis, soiling his panties. So low. I love the way that he did. I just one of these things I never even thought for any second. And then they go after the people. Can you believe it? Well, it's important though, because in the indictment, if they can prove that he said, I actually don't believe this or if they can prove that he at any time said, they actually can't go the can't if they do that, then then he would be considered he'd make him false statement right, exactly. With election, but he's like, we say can't find that. We talked about this on Monday, if he believed as many of you, right? You can hit like if you're watching on YouTube or rumble, I recommend you watch on rumble. If you think that the election had some discrepancies, at least if you're one, if he thought that, then he was trying to preserve our Republic. If he was lying and he didn't think that there was any foul play, then they would have a case. I can tell you having been in communication with many people, not and I don't just, I don't mean Donald Trump directly, but people who were looking into the election, every single one saw the discrepancies. Not a single one was a lot. Now, people can be wrong. There's a huge difference between being wrong and lying. Being wrong is not a crime. And I don't believe that they were wrong. Now, look, just hear me out. Everyone who came forward with affidavits or evidence, they were largely dismissed. They didn't run the investigations properly, just to be clear. So, it's one of those things you can't really prove that it's wrong, because you don't want to prove that it's wrong. You just want to say it's wrong. And here's Donald Trump statement on truth social. This is this is what brings us here to the racist giant loud whistle. A large complex detailed but irrefutable report on the presidential election fraud, which took place in Georgia. My favorite Georgia. It's on my mind. They say, I got it. I could have midnight train to it, frankly, is almost complete will be presented by me at a major news conference at 11 a.m. on Monday of next week in Bedminster, New Jersey, based on the results of this conclusive all caps report. All charges should be dropped against me and others. There will be a complete exoneration, folks. They never went after those that rigged the election. They only went after those that fought to find the rigors. And that is now where the everything catches fire. So the in crosses everywhere. The independence said that Donald Trump called out for racist dog whistle in the apostrophe quotes at these in rent against Georgia prosecutors. Yeah, political analysts, whatever that means. A riot, Kovler, Kovler said, I don't know if Trump deliberately uses rigors as a dog whistle, but his supporters here at either way, they're going after you. He's just in the way. Then you have another author Keith Boykin saying that Donald Trump says he wants to find the rigors. Trump's choice of words is not an accident after spending days making racist attacks against Fannie Willis. But then there was a podcast that said Michael Cohen told us that Trump used the N word. Oh, great. Hey, look, except it was an R. Oh, you mean, you mean the lawyer, the disgrace lawyer that went to jail? Yes. That guy. He said that Donald Trump used the N word. Now he has a new favorite word. Guess what it is? Rigors. Hey, anyone there who lives in the South, you ever heard of Chiggers? Oh, comment below. Remember the first time I had to go and ask for the Chigger be gone, whatever Chigger off, whatever the hell it's called. They got a new skin. And it was an Asian pharmacist. And she was from New Jersey. So she was not familiar. And she popped up. It's like, no, no, no, it's a thing. It's a thing. So now is it anything that rhymes with the racial epithet? And then they say, yeah, Michael Cohen told us that he used the N word. Therefore, he's racist. But hold on a second, you made that up. That's what they do. They make it up and then try and sit you down in court and say, Oh, did you say this person says you use the N word? Yeah, that's because that piece of shit said that. And you believe it? You must be confusing me with that piece of shit. Oh my gosh, riggers. So of course they've always accused him of racist dog whistles, right? Remember when I said he nicknamed Laetitia James peekaboo? He said six theories as to why. And of course they were all about racism. Remember the independence of that Mary Trump says she heard the president use the N word and anti Semitic slurs as a White House claim she's lying. Mary Trump who has come out and tried to slander him so many times. Yeah, I'm gonna believe a word she says. Yeah, by the way, record a black vote. Just to be clear, change the electoral map. And he'll be surprised again, black and white in the crazy music comes out money. You'll be surprised what the average black American thinks about Donald Trump. You'll be surprised what the average black American thinks about the state of this country. And if they are proud to be a citizen of this country, I can't, they don't share a lot in common with white suburban women. Now the term is riggers to be clear. That's what people are upset about, saying that's a racist dog whistle and a spirit of full disclosure. To be fair, there have been instances where that term has been used for a while and contextually, it made a point. Hey, the sheriff is a racist. Why are you crying? Well, it's comedic license and to be clear, only they can say it. We took a risk. No, I don't approve. I gotta go back to LA. Yeah, you don't bring the rock guys that too far guys. You don't bring the ruckus? You don't bring the ruckus? You're far listen, they made the song not us. Okay, we made it better. Clan in their name. Now, it's not surprising. Here's where we are. And I hope that you under, it's the same thing with big tech. It doesn't matter how much you couch your words. They're going to accuse you of it anyway. Yep. They're going to say racism. They're going to say sexism. They're going to say trans phobia, whatever the hell that means. They're experts at this seems to me you are the expert. Mark name that movie line. Coffee is racist. All references are available at ladlescredit.com. I'm not making this up. Camping is racist. Air is racist. Hot weather is racist. Manors are racist. The nuclear family is racist. Waking up early is racist. Exercising is racist. Gardening is racist. Bicycling is racist. Now, spaces on college campuses segregated exclusively by race to be clear. That's progressive. Oh, I love this. By the way, for him not do you understand, have you not been watching Donald Trump for the last, I don't know ever, especially the last five, six, seven years of his life? Do you think there is one part of him that would ever think that he didn't win the election, even if it was a landslide in the opposite direction? He was saying it before he was saying it before he was no way on earth that is hilarious to me that you would think that Donald Trump of all people would not think that he won the election. Yeah, he is the only person on the planet who could have thought that and he would have been convinced of it. Yeah, even if it was wrong. And in this case, he doesn't. I appreciate your boldness. Yes. You're my rigor. That's not your word. Yeah, that's right. You know what? I just made it my word. Wow. Yeah. I Jerry. So forceful. So dominant. I Jerry curled the rigor's word. He lives away. He sleeps. I'm a pet. Yes. In abjects terror. That's right. So we're live streaming the debate, by the way. I don't think Donald Trump is going to be there Wednesday night, August 23rd. We will have these people. Anyone who has the ball to sit down on this show, we don't do the talking points. We'll have a mug club booth there, of course, rumble is supporting it. Yeah. Here's something else. You look like you're live. So you probably like swimming. I am live. Yeah. A little too shredded. I usually I sink, but yeah. Yeah. I've got good. It's tough when you're that. But you are lat dominant. I am. I can't believe you said that. You can not build a building. But you really do this. I glide. Hold on. Hold on. Hold on. By the way, that right there, that's years of practice. No one does that little show. That's why I was about to ask. Because that's how you show the obliques. But Brian, you're how do you hide them? That's a good question. Impossible for him. Two shirts, two American shirts. We're trying to show us how you glide through the air and you just wanted to do the shimmy. You wouldn't do that falling through the air. You would just do. Yeah. Well, that's how I sent myself to college. You wanted to do it. That was his next day. Sugar glider. Now welcome to the stage. Sugar glider. This kid needs help with his rent, boys. That's when he worked at Chippendales, but didn't really work because he actually tried to be correct biologically. Like he was, then he came out. They said sugar glider. He went, he just came out and started telling jokes. This isn't sexy at all. What did you said sugar glider? Are we going to the marsupial family? Come on, just be accurate with me. I can't dance. I can. I know me. I'll know my pleasure. All right. Speaking of things that make no sense if you believe in science, not the science science. October, the world aquatics, they'll host the first swim competition. I have to read this because I still don't believe it. Featuring an open category. Now what that means is just to be clear, chicks with weiners. So trans athletes, here's them announcing it. New plans tonight in the world of swimming with the organization overseeing that internationally announcing plans for an open category for trans athletes to participate. They're trying to balance the concerns of people who are concerned about access for trans women to sports and as well as concerns about fairness in sports. When you have some women, some trans women who are doing very well. Now, research has found that by large trans women do not tend to dominate. What's so fun. They can't not step on themselves because of some women, some trans women. And then there's, then there's an author or reporter who's going to say trans women are just women. Don't say trans women by a set women, but then just take my livelihood, please. I just couldn't get my eyes off his, he's got those eyebrows. He's so surprised. He had his brows done. Yeah. Well, he looks like a marionette. Yeah, he looks like he's always surprised. He looks like he should start every phrase with a loser. No. Yeah, he looks like an athlete. Here's the thing. We already have a special category in swimming for those missing parts of their body. Yeah, he's just, there's something different about what he does to the others, isn't there? But you can see this, that he goes deeper for a start. He comes up pretty much level, but it's this, this is, I don't know what he does, I don't know how he does it. And it's glorious. Hi, five. Everybody here is going to hell. Well, so he's the River Sticks champion. We showed them doing very well. Yes. He's the River Sticks champion. It also didn't get that Greek myth. You found there was also a cyclist that you armless cycling and whoop, this is true. It was a Paralympic cycling and his, he had no arms and the award for winning was a watch. I'm not making this up. Look up. So research get a Paralympic cyclist given watch. You can wear it on your ankle or you can wear it on your can on your D. But he was mad really just because it was a Cassio. I just, I feel like walking up to the podium, you're like, Oh crap. So just to be clear what they'll always say there, there's no clear biological advantage. Right. That's what they first off, that's untrue. And when I say this, I mean, you know, basic things like bone density, muscle mass, lung capacity, all of this, not to mention your hormonal levels. But there are clear concrete examples, right? It's the reverse Nirvana fallacy. Well, it hasn't hasn't been a problem yet. Therefore it must be perfect. If it happens, there won't be a problem. That's because there aren't enough trans people in the world and there aren't enough people yet who figured out how to gain the system of the people who have the percentage, the winning percentage of trans male athletes and female sports is incredible. Of course, you know, Leah Thomas, right? Right. Top times in the NCAA women's 200 meter and the 500 meter. That by the way, as a man would be 893rd best and 501st best. That's, I don't know, I'm not a mathematician, but that's 500 spaces below number one. That's insane. I had no idea. I took 500. Hold on. 893rd in the world or in this class for 200 meter and first in the women's championship of the women's guy saw in the 500 and first in the women's. Yeah, see the difference? And it's not small. And that's just the one you know about because Leah Thomas likes the limelight, you know, as a lot of narcissists do. But cycling, you have Rachel McKinnon, biological male, one woman's championship set the world record high school track Terry Miller won two state titles of the 2018 Connecticut state track championships, trans athletes that make about 1.2% of all high school athletes. And then they win a disproportionate percentage. So Terry Miller, by the way, 167% of the events she competed in on Monday. This is a trans power lifter. And Andre set the Canadian national record for women's deadlift. And by the way, had just consumed four beers. I think I think by over 400 pounds. Yes, it was this amazing like it wasn't even close. Like just destroyed. You didn't even smell like salt. By the way, we do have the clip of the the the the cyclists. Yeah, well, we are going to guys guys. No, it's a lot to laugh about this. Terrible. We're not terrible. They're terrible. That's for giving that person a what? I bet you that guy finds it funny. Well, he'll sell it. He's a huge ladder with Crater Fanny. Yeah, he's wearing fight like hell under Jersey. We're not making fun of him for his like obviously terrible issue that he's had to deal with. However, that happened. We're making fun of them for giving him a watch. It also claimed came with gloves. Yes. That's that's where I drove the line. Change the prize. Just give them your fault. Not ours. Change it. He knew the prize going into the race. Come on. Change it to no warmers. He's always had a dream. He was a young child. Yes. I've always wanted to win a watch, sir. Yes. We'd like Rolex to sponsor the homeless cycling category. It's what Brian. Nothing. You about to say something. I wanted to raise some kind of I wanted to be I wanted to raise objections, but I had nothing witty to say. Yeah, what's okay? Because you know what? There can be no objections. That's objectively funny. And that's objectifying a guy with no arms. That's what I say. I'm not objectifying. I'm exalting it. They were. How dare they have it. He figured out a way to use a wristwatch. Yeah. He's the MacGyver of the Nubbies. Limb different. Yes. Exactly. Did the bike have long handles? How do they do that? Brian, don't ask. Don't ask these questions. I have questions as long as I have questions how they select the events at the Paralympics. Someone can answer honestly if you've competed at the Paralympics. I know there's wheelchair basketball. Okay. But what if there's a guy who does have some kind of physical disability, but it's not a wheelchair. Well, there's no basketball for you. Yeah. You got to be wheeled. You got to be a wheelchair guy for basketball. It's like, but I want to play basketball and I'm missing an arm. Do we have one hand of basketball? It's wheelchair basketball. It's all about wheelchair basketball these days. Armless is swimming. You can swim or you can cycle, but you cannot play basketball. Wheelchair boxing. I don't know if they have boxing. I don't know what these. Since when did we need to make up these different categories for people? I'm sorry. I know the trans thing. We actually talked about this. We said, look, if you want to compete, yeah, fine. You got to compete in your biological sex so they can make this other category. Nobody's going to care. Like, fine. You know what? Make an open category for steroids as well. Let anybody who wants to compete no matter. At least they are doing an open category. Yeah. No rules. That's fine. Hey, how much you want to bet the open category won't be won by a woman. That's the only thing we do. A lot of variables except that. Yeah. Eliminate that one won't be a woman. Zero women will win that competition. And if you're offended by that, okay, I'm going to put you on the spot here. All right. Someone says, you either you either win a million dollars. You want a billion dollars, or if you lose, your whole family dies. Okay. We have a lineup here. It's five women, five average men. Who's going to win a pull up competition? Guys with the dicks. Guys, just stop it. Stop it. Why did you have to be specific? The pretzels that you twist yourselves into. And by the way, that's also limb different phobic because they can't twist themselves. There's no yogi barrows limb different. Hey, we have limb different. That's the term. That's the term. People got in trouble. We announced a contest and now we have the winner for newest non-mug club members. We asked you to write a tweet explaining what the idea of mug club meant to you use the hashtag mug club giveaway. We'll be continuing to do it into next week. And the winners are going to be gifted a free year of mug club. Here's winner number one, Caleb FB333 said mug club to me is for free thinkers. We are constantly bombarded with rhetoric from mass media who bend over backwards for the corrupt government big tech and the narratives they push mug club is fighting against that. Thank you very much. Absolutely. Get a free of the mug club. You want to read the next one there? Chirled? Ah, didn't know who you were talking to. Oh, sorry. What does mug club mean to me working in a stressful job with chronically ill patients who are transitioning into end of life. I look forward to your shows each day while I love your candor. Your humor helps me to focus on something more positive. Well, I like Brian Callan's lats. What kind of job is that where you're working with chronically ill people? It's hospice. Yeah. Oh, nurse. I don't know what I thought the employees were chronic. But woman's a saint. Where is this? Like, well, he's so with leprosy, time to take your pills. A leper colony. Where's that? It was doing router's work. I thought one was going to go to hospice. No, that's us. Speaking of limbless, why am I paying? Yeah, you let's write off. Well, you get a free year of mug club. Thanks for watching. Good for you. Spots on your skin. Let's go to Maui. If you've been following this, the fires, sorry. Yeah. Not going to Maui. Sorry. Not laughing about the fires. So. Now, look, yes, because it's obvious there's nothing, there's nothing funny. No, there's not. It was something else. Yeah. Too much wild crap. I hope she's not somebody transitioning to end of life. Otherwise, it might not be a full year. Oh, okay. Oh, right. You had to every one. I wonder. This river sticks out. It's a live show, by the way, Monday through Thursday, 10 a.m. Eastern here, the free portion. Then you can continue watching on mug club, today's chat Thursday. So in Maui, now let me ask you this with Maui. What do you believe is the biggest contributing factor here? And I would like for you when you contrast that with what the media has told you is the biggest contributing factor. Of course, you know, it's climate change because they're dicks. Now, here's the problem with that. Let's sort of, let's sort of amplify the idea of, you know, the lie of rigors. Well, what ends up happening when you say everything's this racist dog whistle, it's not true. The lie creates black lives matter riots and billions of dollars in damages and, you know, thousands of casualties just to be clear. And so what happens when you lie about climate change is more people die because you don't prepare for these problems in the future. If you cannot properly address the problem, then you're of no use. Now take that and add a few dollars and you get our government. So in Maui, death toll is over 100. It's terrible. It's a tragedy. 1300 are still missing. But there are three key facts that you need. And we know what has happened now just to be clear. There is no doubt. And we'll get into it. But first, let me refresh your memory. Today marks one week since the wildfires tore through Lahaina. But the search and recovery for victims is just in the beginning stages. The death toll stands at nearly 100. But that number is expected to grow dramatically in the coming days. The National Guard and 20 cadaver dogs continue the painstaking search for victims. Now here's an actual video title from a local Miami ABC affiliate. Wild fires in Maui about 1300 vanished at least 96 dead. I'm sorry, what? 1300 vanished. Yeah, vanished. That's an interesting word choice. Yeah, vanished. And here are kind of the three key facts that you need to know. All right, let's go to Fastback number three. And we'll make all these references publicly available. I think you need to hit there Tim. Yeah, number three. Very. All right. The media is clearly running cover here for in inept government. Okay, ABC to give you an example, they were forced to change their headline about the fires. The original headline was why climate change can't be blamed for Maui wildfires. Then they revised it to why climate change can't be blamed entirely for the money. What? It can't be blamed at all just to be clear for the Maui fires. No, not at all. Here's no idea that even happened. Yeah, the amount of manipulation that happens with the media is insane. What you see is the tip of the iceberg. Here's a Fastback, I guess, number two for you. This is where we deal with inept government. I mean, especially when you have like just water that basically disappears. It's like that happened. We'll get to that. The emergency officials, they had no experience. So according to Nora O'Donnell there at CBS News, CBS News has learned Maui's emergency operations chief had no background in disaster response. That's what I look for in my chief. Exactly. It's his department that is responsible for setting off warning signs, which rang silent during the fires. They had warning signs that didn't warn. Jesus, person in charge of them had no business in that job. Government for you. You don't get to fire these people just to be clear. This wasn't an employee that didn't have any experience and they were working their way up. This was the chief. This was the person solely responsible at the end of the day for making sure this was done right. And his answer for why he didn't do it is terrifying. Who owned a chief? Name that we like. Guys, it's not water. It's it's I know you're worried. It's a tsunami. It's not water. Everybody's fine. Go back to bed. It's fire. Yeah, it won't hurt you. Yeah. It's a wave of fire, not water. You're safe. Yeah. No need for a siren. Yeah. I was we were going to do it, but it's a different sound. I got to switch it out and I don't have my iPad. Yeah, I'm not not Yakuza. I can't make that. So yeah, the chief, his name is Herman Adania defended not using the sirens because yeah, didn't want people to think. That's what that was his actual defense. You're being kind of satirical. But he actually said, I don't know. I didn't want people to think there was a tsunami. I love that. And he's like, yeah, I don't want them to run towards the fire. Yeah, I'm like, they would have seen it. Right. You idiot. Well, right. Not necessarily. Maybe they were sleeping until the fire was upon them, because they weren't awakened from their slumber. Yeah, because there was no siren, which the taxpayers, by the way, they pay for that. They're not paying for you to give free, free internet to someone in Poughkeepsie. They're paying so that you keep them safe. And if you're on an island, you know, tsunamis, but also fires that can travel really quickly, I certainly think Charlie boy that qualifies. Yeah, by the way, these systems living in Texas, we deal with tornadoes, right? So they don't just have sirens. They have things that they can actually say. Yes, one time it was really ominous outside. I walked outside and I heard seek shelter instead of the siren. And I was like, well, that's interesting. Instead of seeking shelter, I walked to the industry. So I can see what's going on. I'm an idiot. But nonetheless, well, that's what you do. Yeah, but you can do things like that. And I never heard they play the Rolling Stones gimmy shelter, which is sort of cryptic. Cryptic. Well, I will say tsunami siren, if you're conditioned to run away from the water, is not what you, you know, it's not what you sound when there are fires because yeah, but you know what? I understand your point. Yes. Counterpoint seems to me if they have the ability to use sirens. They have a speaker system. Right. I was gonna say the speaker system say run toward the water. There's a fire fire. There's a fire. Hey, it's just going to Hey, you know how a lot of you here don't want to be burned alive? Yeah. Yeah. Well, if you want the opposite of that, then just to, you know, go away from the fire fire, get over. Go toward the waves. Yeah. Hope you enjoy that quarter million pay, pay stub. So fast back here. Key fact, I should say number one. Again, we talked about the media running cover. We've talked about them having no experience being completely inept. The water resources in this always goes back to no climate change is not responsible, but climate change activism and how muddled it has become and how dishonest is often responsible for wildfires, you know, whether or not allowed to do controlled and not allowed to carry out controlled burns in California. A big part of it. We've talked about this was the dams. I can't build dams because of a smelt, which is a fish that doesn't swim well, which should die. So water resources and there's so much red tape that happens when you're dealing with water now because of climate change record levels. I think last year in the Great Lakes, most important fresh, fresh water body in the country just to be clear. I never tell you that. They were being squandered. They weren't being managed properly. So in October 2022, the Hawaii Commission on Water Resource Management and the director was a Kaleo Manuel said this. So don't believe me, believe your lion eyes and ears about Maui's water resources. We've become used to looking at water as like something which we use and not necessarily something that we revere as that thing that gives us life, right? I mean, to me, it's a shift in value set. If we can start to really look at how we as humans in an island can reconnect to that traditional value set, let water connect us and not divide us. We can share it, but it requires true conversations about equity. You're so stupid. Connect us and not divide. Are you talking about land bridge theory? You're on an island. I tell you, there's water. Water divides you from everybody. It's an island. I think we should start drinking from a communal cup, everybody. Yes. Sharing the same water. Yeah. It's not something you mouth. It's something that should be revered. Again, this comes from pagan earth worship. Think Gaia, right? Mother Earth. Well, by the way, if that's the case, Mother Earth is a bitch just to be clear. This is not a mother who fully loves you and takes care of you. Yeah, that guy's never had cholera or jardian. No, exactly. Water's not your friend. Yes, cholera. You're not from the age of it. Now, he says it should not be used, but revered. That the priority is not that the resources, the earth, by the way, animals as well, that human beings have dominion over them and that we should be responsible. It's it is our duty to serve them. That's the difference. So when the left says, Oh, you think that you have ownership, you think that you have control over animals or whenever a vegan says that if you're a Godfearing person, yes, absolutely. This is why it's antithetical to a Christian worldview. We are supposed to. We are called to be responsible. Good stewards of our resources, just to be clear. But those are our resources as human beings who have dominion over the earth, meaning we want humans to live. We want to propagate. Think about everything that they push. Water is something we need to serve water. We need to serve the earth. We need to serve the great white sharks who are going larger and more aggressive in Cape Cod and eating all the fish and people. Whereas we believe, no, no, no, on a second, we need to be good. We need to be good stewards of our planet, but they serve us overpopulation. Every single issue when it comes to natural resource management from the left, it's anti people. It is it's anti people and it lines up on the side of the earth and the ecosystem that exists outside of human beings as though we are not the apex predator, which I would argue, light bulbs. So we are. That deserves priority. Okay. So this same guy, Manuel was asked, by the way, by the Maui fire department for more water. Okay, this will piss you off. Yeah, this is a quote here says, ask them if Maui fire department had requested permission, he asked them Manuel, if they had requested permission to dip into the reservoirs, told them to inquire with a local farmer first to check how a diversion of the water supply would affect him. Wow. How about no? How about no rules? There's a fire. I'm putting it out. I don't care if it's the last drop of water and I kill an endangered species in the process. I'm saving human life. There's not enough macadamia nuts in the world, Manuel. He still wants you to poop in water. Yes. Yes. It's incredible. Can you believe that? That's the kind of thinking. So apparently climate change did have a bit of a role in this. It infected people's minds. Yes. And they started thinking more like you said, it's not, they're not just putting those things first and not letting us have dominion over it. They're literally enacting policies in California, Oregon, Washington, Canada right now has tons of wildfires. These policies end up killing people and saving fish. Yeah. Think about that juxtaposition. When those decisions are being made, stuff like this is a problem. By the way, can I add a plus one? Do you mind if I add a plus one? Yeah, go, go, go, go, plus one electric company was actually and is currently actually being sued because some of this information actually came out that said they knew that their power lines were going to be a problem and could potentially spark wildfires years ago, right? In 2022, they actually asked for some federal funding because of this specific problem so that they could shore up that and they got it. I don't know if it's actually federal, maybe it was state funding there. I think it was like $198 million that they were awarded to do but it had not done anything with it yet. This problem was not an unknown. Yeah. These people did not have an issue that just surprised them a wildfire on an island. No way. No, everybody knew that this was a big potential risk. Nobody did anything about it. Yeah. And by the way, if you're watching on rumble, you can smash the rumble button or hit share on YouTube. This is why I don't agree. You can hit that there, gentlemen. This is why I don't agree when people say, you know, I don't believe in any ideology. I just take issues on an individual basis. No, no, no, you need to take the factual, the evidence presented on an individual issue basis, of course, but you can't fight what I will argue is evil ideology with no ideology of your own. You can't fight an ism with only a few sets of facts. You have to present them right through a lens. Now, here's the thing for us to get here with Hawaii. They would have to look at these facts, these circumstances. In other words, none of this was a surprise, right? The idea that these water resources are not, you would have to start off with government is good and is the solution to the problem in order to think that having a massive blotted government and people without experience being assigned to chief roles is a good idea. You would have to start with that. This starts with government needs to solve these problems. Government is the answer got bit more government good and then you would also need to have the worldview of and earth is priority ecosystem over people. That's the only because if you say, hold on this, defies reason, it does. It doesn't fine. The ideological motivations of those people in charge and you cannot combat them by saying, well, hold on a second. All these are key facts. But to preemptively combat that, you need to start off with, hold on a second, my worldview tells me that no government is not inherently the answer and that larger government tends to be ineffective and lead to corruption unchecked power leads to unfettered power to put it simply hold on a second. I believe we should be responsible in managing our resources. But with the key, the North Star in mind being in order to serve humanity, these are at odds with each other. This is how we get here. It's the same way you get there with COVID. No, no government can solve the problem. If you start off with government good, you may not understand that it could have come from a lab because your government was lying to you. If you believe, hold on a second, hold on a second. The government's job is to only control behavior right at the cost of freedom. This starts with an ism. It's the same symptom of that root problem when you're looking at Maui as we had with COVID as we have with elections. You have to cut off the head of the beast. Don't be led astray by people saying, I just take it on an individual basis. Well, then you're behind the eight ball. I say this as the person who makes all references publicly available. I don't know another show that does it. I hope more people do. I think facts matter. But if you don't start off with what is what is the moral backbone of what I am arguing here, then you are doomed to fail and dominated by a lack of. By the way, in most emergencies, disasters, national disasters, it's not government that bales you out. It's your neighbor. It's your community. The first responders are the people that live right next to you, almost always. Yeah. And people have to understand that you got to be a little bit prepared because there are a lot of people think that like a helicopter is going to land in your backyard. Not the case almost always. Yeah. That's just unless your neighbor is an old helicopter gym that well, there you go. Oh, that's a gym or you're right next to the White House. Yes. But other than that, yeah, you're you should be prepared, which is why I always shop at Patriot Supply, guys. Can I? Yes. I always got to drive food, guys. Yeah. I know how to tie knots and the people who believe in big government mock you as a doomsday pepper. Right. Look, I lived through the ice storms in Montreal. How many earthquakes right have happened in California where supplies were low if you didn't drive outside of your 100 mile rate. Yeah. I've always like have enough dried food, have enough food that's non perishable for at least a month, supply of water and a way to heat it up. That is not unreasonable. It's the democratic part, the elites, the leftists who tell you that's just come on. What? Why do you think we're going to take care of what you think the shit's going to hit the fan that scenario? I don't know what's going on in Maui. Does that require someone to believe that there's going to be some kind of digital is it EMT attack? The EMT or EMT? EMT. That's right. EMP. I apologize. That's right. So I have a neighbor like Steven. Steven, I need to borrow your back. Your mouth. They mock you. Somebody's got to carry my water. Oh, by the way, they mock you for being prepared for exactly this scenario. You should be prepared. It's going to happen. Yeah. That's an isn't it. They don't want strong individuals and communities. They want you dependent on them. Right. And they should have been prepared from the government. They should have said, Hey guys, by the way, wildfires, huge risk right now because we haven't cut the grass because we want to do it. By the way, yeah, there's the overfave talking about the deadly threat of wildfires. Yeah. Also, just know, Democrats have been in control. I think at every single level of government for at least a decade there. Wow. Those are the kinds of policies that this party brings with them. It ends up costing to try the palm trees. This is why when I work out, it's not about bodybuilding. It's about functional fitness, guys. It's about running from fires. Oh, I hate every word of that phrase. What I said. It's just why I'm back dominant guys. It's why my back. Look at my thighs and back. Not my chair. More of this September 1st, the Brian Kalancho. Now, now I should be looking forward to the show. You're going to have people on both conversations. Yes. People who try to engage people in debates. I mean, I want to have people on that I disagree with. Yeah. I'm looking forward to it. You're going to run into a booking problem after some time. Yes, I am. That's a problem. That's all right. Let's see what happens. I can, I can, I can trick them into it. Well, it's called sandbagging. Now, leave Crowder's name out of it. That's always a good call. So, I do want to talk. Should we talk about this here? So, yeah, this is something else. We're talking about the ism while we're talking about the ideology. You know, this is what we do here at mug club and we're incredibly grateful for those of you who have joined in. If you're watching the free portion on Rumble or on YouTube right now, hey, none of this happens if you don't support us at lot of scutter.com slash mug club with everything that we have there. We're growing. We've expanded it. It's an umbrella. It's a full scale network powered by Rumble. But here's why. And we always said we were willing to forego so some numbers as we transferred from big tech platforms, YouTube right to Rumble. Yeah. Because Rumble has now reached, I think, 6% a few months ago, 6% of the video, video market share, which is a great thing. Doesn't sound like a lot. That is huge. That's a huge milestone considering the struggle that YouTube has had. Yes. And the reason for that is because these people will always remove you. They promise to kill you last and a lot of people on the right play ball. And the idea is, well, I want to reach the unreached. I have always agreed with that, right? I've been on YouTube since 2006, I believe political video since 2008. Believe me, I understand it. However, we have reached a tipping point where you are precluded on these platforms from telling the truth. And basically reaching people without the truth is of no value. It's based on a lie. Even if you're not lying, but at a certain point, the half truth is worse than a lie. So this has now happened with Glenbeck this week. He's been going through it. We have some other examples. They're able to throttle you, shut you off at any moment, Wednesday afternoon, without warning, Apple removed all of Glenbeck's shows. Was this yesterday? Did it start Tuesday? It was yesterday. It was all yesterday? It's all happened yesterday. Men that happened quickly. So they removed all of Glenbeck's shows, Apple, all of them. And we have some issues that have been going on with Apple this very same week from the podcast platform here. Let's see his clip first. Hey, we're just sitting here in my office and we're discussing something that we just saw here. This is from Apple. We found an issue with your show, the Glenn Beck program, which must be resolved before it's available on Apple podcast. Your show has been removed from Apple podcast from the Apple podcast team. They sent us to send us a link and said for more details, go to the link and the link only says, your show has been removed from Apple podcasts. Well, we got that one, dummy. I mean, I cannot imagine what they are what they're basing this one. I can't. I mean, have we even had strikes? Nothing, right? This is crazy. Now, crazy. By the way, before anyone goes into, you like Glenn Beck, I like none of that matters. People should not be removed. Okay, I only ask that everyone out there who experiences this, you know, look back to, they do the same for Alex Jones for ourselves, for all these people. I don't care if I agree with them. Now, it doesn't mean that you have to hire them. It doesn't mean you have to pay them, but you should, of course, support people as long as they are not committing a crime being able to speak their mind on these platforms that are protected by laws as a digital town square. The problem there, the only problem is the mindset of, I don't think we have any any strikes. By the way, we have countless strikes. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter. They're going to do it anyway. We all need to get out of that mindset. Oh, well, Alex Jones is just, he's too extreme on X, YZ. It doesn't matter. I don't think we had any, we've never said anything that would run afoul these policies. It doesn't matter. And I fully support Glenn Beck being re-platformed. It seems like he has been about four hours later. He tweeted that his episodes were back on. They still don't have answers. They were claiming it was a copyright issue. And this is something new as well retroactively. They can create copyright issues. Let me tell you where this is a bigger issue is investigative journalism. For example, we have done Change My Minds where I think YouTube changed this policy now. Thank you, Mug Club, where people gave an interview, gave their name, signed a release, and then said, I don't like the way that the interview came across, even though it was unedited, went to YouTube and YouTube said we're going to remove it because it's a privacy violation. I said, it's a single part of consent state, and we have a release which we don't need. Doesn't matter. That's our policy. They can make up any rule they want to catch you. And was it this week that as well, was it our show on Apple? You guys can let me know if you're listening on the audio version. They were only uploaded today. All three, that was all three were uploaded today. Even though we were uploading them, people were letting us know like, hey, I haven't seen your Apple podcast for the show in the last couple of days. And we're like, what? Yeah. What's no idea why it was up on Spotify everywhere else that you can get podcasts, just not Apple could just be a glitch, but you'll never know because there's no transparency and your government doesn't want to investigate ridiculous. By the way, if you have an issue like this, so just just so you know how transparent this is, we dealt with this, I think with faith, Facebook on a live stream for like the Oscars or something like that one time where we went back when we were doing that. That was the first one. Yeah. They did it immediately. They don't have to give you an explanation. So here's how it goes. If there is a problem, you reach out and say, hey, we have a problem, please respond within 24 hours. Otherwise, we're going to pull all of your stuff down. Right. That's an easy way to do it. Hey, we have an issue. Somebody saying this, can you give us some more details because they were saying that our thing, we're just restreaming it. It's like, no, it's parody. I was dressed as a gold statue. You were crying out loud. You were a good old statue. It was a very good old statue. They don't talk to you right now. They just remove you. Because it takes away all of the momentum. But what you were saying, you're saying there's a way to are you saying what to do when they say the default position shouldn't be to shut off someone's lively immediately immediately. It should be to not to assume guilt before it's driven. Is that an algorithm though? Does that happen automatically? I don't care. It doesn't matter. They're setting it up to fail. So basically, if I go in right now and I claim something on another person's show, they're going to take it off immediately. Now, I don't I'd love to do an A.B. test on conservative versus liberal and see how they handle that. Right? If I make it. Oh, we've done it in the past. Yeah. But if they make that claim, you have to be able to prove that. Right. Don't take somebody off in the middle of a live stream because then all of the viewers go, Oh, I guess they're down. I'm going to go somewhere else. And now you've lost all that momentum. Right. That's all they have to do is go, Oh, whoops. Sorry. You had a claim or Oh, there's a glitch a trademark dispute. Sorry. Fix it. Four hours later. Yeah. Those things don't get resolved in four hours and to people saying, go and create your great join my club. At least go over to rumble people who say go and create your own. If you don't, first off, that's not a valid argument here because we're talking about section 230. These platforms are created and they're protected by big government. They are one and the same. They are more powerful than most governments. It's not I don't I don't concede any territory to that argument. But if that's the case, right now, even if you don't have a dime, switch from YouTube to rumble and you should do it for everything that you possibly can. And if you want some to create it, hey, it's the first umbrella network ever autonomously from a mainstream platform on rumble is my club. We have ourselves Alex Jones, Nick DiPalo, Brian Callan, Hotch twins, guns and gear, and we have an investigative unit and we're going to expand. But it only exists because of people like you. The point is you will always be removed and they will find a new reason just like Donald Trump, President Trump with the indictments. And they don't need a reason to ban ideas they don't like. If you say, Oh, Alex Jones is too extreme. Fine. You say, Oh, Glenn Becca's too extreme, which is absurd to say, but fine. You don't like any of those people. Okay. How about Kayleigh McEnany? She was locked out of her Twitter for sharing the New York posts. The Biden story, the Hunter Biden story, I should say I should clarify what I'm talking about, a piece of crap Biden, the Sun. While she was press secretary, not Biden, the elder. It's incredible. It's her job. Jordan Peterson was suspended from Twitter. Because they had an interview with RFK Jr. That was also removed from YouTube. Unbelievable. At least I know that's why I was removed from YouTube. I don't know why I was suspended from Twitter. Lives of TikTok. They were removed from Twitter with no explanations. No tweets were even flagged just for reposting other posts. Hey, you may say, I don't like Andrew Tate. Okay. But you shouldn't be removed from all platforms for being a top G. Whatever that means. I say he's like upper middle of the pack G. I don't know. Top is a little bit lofty. Yeah, but he was doing all right. And I can disagree. Third best student. Yes. Alex Jones, of course, still banned from Twitter, still banned from Twitter. And of course, our sales, how many times have we been suspended? Like this is something this is the most important before we get to mail in voting, before we get to voter ID. Just the Hunter Biden story would have changed that last election period. It wouldn't have even been close. What do you think they want to do for the next election? That changes the very future of your country. If you could do that butterfly effect, if you could do the shitty back to the future, whichever one it is, where they go to the West, they're all good, whatever. I don't need to get sideways with the back to the future. You would see a parallel world of a dystopian future that you probably can't imagine unless this changes. And you can change it right now. You have a moment in time right now where you can say, all right, we can migrate somewhere else. That's what we all believe in doing. And they are going to come for you anyway. It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter if you are a mainstream conservative, more men for crying out loud. Allegedly. Of course you went there. Of course you went there. Sorry, guys. Serious show. Let's keep going. If you were to drug test Glenn Beckett would read, why are you here? Yes. The guy is sweet. The guy is not controversial. He just said that himself. He's a decent man. The things that he says are in line with a huge portion of Americans. Oh, they make up a copyright reason. And then they don't give you an answer. They can always create a reason. They can make it up. And do you have anything else you guys want to add? I we're actually thinking about having Dr. Robert Epstein, I believe is his name. Oh, I know Robert. I've interviewed him. Phenomenally. He talks a lot about like you said big tech, they can just remove you. Yeah. Before we get to mail in ballots and everything else, you're right. This is the new the new field of battle essentially for us right now is to make sure fine, you're not stealing the elections anymore. You're manipulating the election. Robert Epstein has shown time and again. And by the way, Robert is a Democrat. He's itself a professed Harvard guy. But he has shown over and over again that Google. So for example, the videos that Google will push towards the youth are I think 98% have a 98% left leaning bias. But but also the fact that I think if you were a Democrat, you saw when it was time to vote, you got this message that said go vote. If you were if you listen to right wing radio or whatever, you didn't get that right. He's done a lot of research. It's really interesting. He's in a show called the creepy line, which is basically the search bar for Google is what they called it because they're not just giving you information. They're actually manipulating what you do. That changes elections and a lefty from Harvard who absolutely would disagree with us on a ton of issues is saying this is a problem. We need our elections to at least we need to at least trust that what happened on election day is accurate. We need to trust that and that nobody's messing with that. This is remember when they were talking about Cambridge Analytica and how it affected Brexit and all that stuff that happened over there. That is child's play. It's not even close to what he's talking about with Google and those guys. Child's play. Yeah. Well, take okay take an example. Let's take this company right here. We're foregoing many millions of dollars in revenue with just YouTube and Google. Just YouTube and we don't get a dime from that. That has been and then Facebook created this this competitor right where they were saying, oh, we're going to compete and then basically they became what they became one and the same as there is no competition really in the ad space right now and rumble actually just made a new announcement regarding this. I don't have the ins and outs of it, but you can go and follow Chris Pavlaski on Twitter. So we forgo many, many millions. Okay. How many other people out there like us? How many other companies out there forgo many, many, many, many millions of dollars, many or even hundreds of thousands of dollars if they're an upstart that they could use to amplify their message? Oh, and by the way, they can't even use the resources they do have because they're throttled and they're not allowed to advertise. Take this program, multiply it by several hundred thousand other people out there trying to do the same thing. On the flip side, you get the right of way. You get the express lane. If you're a leftist, not only do you get tens of millions of dollars on YouTube and on Facebook, but you get preferential treatment so that your stories get thrust into someone's feet. Just take that. You see how much you see how much that shifts the balance? This is why appeasing Crocodiles is futile. And this is why we have migrated to rumble. Nothing would make me happier than to never have the broadcast on YouTube ever again. The closest we can do right now is use them as long as they're useful. And we don't make it dime. Stephen Colbert does though. Every time we run a business, they get to claim. They get to claim the revenue at any time they can pull you. Brian, and this is also something, by the way, we've had changed my minds pulled in the past. I don't know what's going to happen with the segment because we did have one of these. I'm going to show you here at teaser. We'll be doing the debate live stream on Wednesday night, but Monday, this is what will be going up is the teaser. I'm about to show you. There was one person, two men you were there who begged to be on camera. Oh, yeah. Begged to be on camera. We were walking to the car. We're all right. We're done. My job. Begged. And then when they didn't like what was happening, and this wasn't a debate, yeah, said, I do not consent. I don't consent. I don't consent for this to be used as well. It is single party consent. You asked me, we had packed up our camera equipment. And well, then this is not you'll see this when it comes to you. This is not in line with your company or its values. And you should not be allowed because these are entitled people who don't understand the law. What's going to happen? YouTube, Facebook, are you going to follow the law? Or are you going to follow your own rules? Here's the choice that you have to make if you benefit from the government with Section 230 as a platform and not a publisher, you better follow the law. But you don't. And we always have to do that. We always have to go through this guessing game. Everything we've done is legal. It's above board. And by the way, it's incredibly productive. This is one out of five conversations where everything was friendly. But this one person, I don't consent looking at the camera. You can't run this. And to you, they're going to file a complaint with YouTube and Facebook when we do run it. It's not something an investigative journalist should have to worry about. So we are going to go to chat Thursday. If you are not a member at mucklub, let us go to that come slash mucklub. But Monday, here's a little taste of what you'll be seeing. It's new installment of black and white, a new segment, new show, black and white on the gray issues. Are your personal interactions with white people worse than ever? Yeah. Watch the media today. You'd think we're more divided than ever. And I realize that race issues aren't necessarily depicted in the same way that people are experiencing it in real time. So we're going to go out and talk with people. So we stop missing each other. This is black and white on the gray issues. What about the American culture? Yeah. So do you have a great Milton plan? Are you proud to be American? So you think that in certain areas of 10, you think that white women are afraid of you? I have to be a bit more Hi, how are you? And do you find that then the interaction is usually positive? If you do. Yeah. I experience a lot more racism from the black people than from the white people. Well, whether you look at my qualifications, you're like, hey, what is it that I do? Right. And see, like, okay, great, you're the best candidate for this versus like, okay, well, you got to go to black. What is the right thing I do to hire based on race or just higher diversity? But what if they're not the best person? If Beyonce can find 14 black trombodas, I'm sure you can find one black person to join your team."
