    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash the blind. Today we have new details on actor Jamie Foxx's mysterious disappearance. The FBI has agreed to provide the whistleblower documents to the house and a high school teacher and structure students on where to get sex toys and lives to tell about it. We've got all of that and more coming up, and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and new details are emerging about actor Jamie Foxx's medical condition after a lengthy absence from both the public eye and the movie set he had been working on before he was admitted to the hospital after suffering a medical complication on April 11th. Independent journalist AJ Benza appeared on the Dr Drew podcast yesterday and dropped some pretty shocking allegations about what he says actually happened to Foxx and his current medical state to watch. I worked my butt off to get a story about why what happened is Jamie Foxx's. It was all baloney that they were reporting. He's playing pickleball, he's responding on Instagram. No, he's not. People do that for you. It's all lies. I had somebody in the room who let me know that Jamie had a blood clot in his brain after he got the shot. He did not want the shot, but the movie he was on, he was pressured to get it. This movie he's doing with Cameron Diaz and I'm thinking, is that why he blew up on the set a week before this medical emergency happened? Is that why he fired three or four people because he just had a had it with these mandates? I don't know. But what I found out from the man in the room was that the blood clot in the brain caused him at that point to be partially paralyzed and blind. To be clear, now he mentions pickleball playing pickleball. It was actually Foxx's daughter Corinne who told the media several weeks ago that her father was out of rehab and even he was so healthy and spry that he was playing pickleball, which I feel like would be hard to do if you were blind and paralyzed. But there certainly hasn't been any visual evidence that Jamie Foxx as well. And reports indicate that the director of his latest film is using a body double in his mysterious absence. Now, if rumors about me being blinded and paralyzed from the clot shot started going around and I wasn't actually blinded or paralyzed, it wasn't true, I would definitely make sure that people heard from me directly. But the only thing so far we've seen from Jamie Foxx was an Instagram post containing only text, no picture, reading, appreciate all the love feeling blessed. And this was all the way back at the beginning of May. Time will tell if the allegations are true, he can't hide forever. But if Jamie Foxx is one of the latest victims of the job, he certainly sadly won't be the last here to discuss this and more. We have Eric July, released to be contributor and founder and owner of Ripiverse Comics. So Eric, I want to also play just to throw into the conversation here. Mike Tyson was on a podcast recently, and this was like mid May. He was on a podcast recently and he was asked about Jamie Foxx. And the rumors were always like, yeah, we think he had a stroke, he definitely had a medical event. And Mike Tyson went on and said, yeah, I heard he had a stroke. And apparently they don't want us to know. Watch. Mike, are you following what's going on with Jamie Foxx? He's not feeling well. This time's going on with it. Yeah, it's a stroke. I had no idea what happened to him. Yeah. And listen, we can't anticipate our neck breath. We don't know where we're going to die. After we leave this bad stuff can happen. It wasn't there like stories of him playing your life. Well, it was a possibility. You know, I don't know what's going to happen now, but you know, it's a strong possibility. Yeah. Has there been any actual news on what this medical condition is? I mean, Jimmy Foxx is a young, vibrant, healthy guy. Hey, listen, if we don't know by now, they don't want us in there. I recall the same type of weird secrecy when Demar Hamlin, you know, suffered his event. And he was being interviewed afterwards. And there was that really weird, like, I don't want to talk about this that we're hearing now. But I got to tell you, if it turns out to be true, and his daughter was running cover for big pharma rather than sounding the alarm for everyone else's family members so that they could know, hey, this happened to my dad. This is real. The vaccine injury is real. You guys need to know about it. Make your own decision. But true informed consent requires that people are able to tell their stories of what happened to them. If his own daughter was running cover for big pharma, that's disgusting. Oh, it absolutely is. And look, there's two things going on here. It is that part that you just just mentioned as far as if it is indeed a negative reaction from this jab, then think about it like this. Hollywood was arguably the biggest of like these major institutions. Biggest shiller, you know, of this of this jab. All of the promotional stuff that they did with ad counsel and with even directly getting paid by Pfizer to talk about this and encourage folks to get this. So they would find themselves sort of culpable, right? Band-aid their actors. Right. They also, obviously, in what we had with this situation, where people are talking about within Hollywood, on the movies and all these mandates, you have to go through this, you have to go through that. So they facilitated a lot of that individual culture. So in any event that Jamie had a negative reaction out of that, well, all of them are going to have to look themselves in the mirror. And this is why even if it does come back, and it's the other thing, this is why I say there was two parts of it because yeah, he might actually have, and I think he does, a severe medical issue, no matter if it's from the jab or not, because this doesn't make any sort of sense. He's been nowhere to be seen, nowhere to be found. We get these vague posts, this vague post on Instagram. Nobody knows what the hell's going on. And because people are assuming the worse strokes, a serious thing being paralyzed, that's pretty serious. Blind? Blind? Right. That is a massive thing. And if it was like, if it was like, oh, I'm good, and I am like recovering from an injury, and I'm fine, video or something other than that, it will be out, but it's not. So I do believe at least minimum that, but the unfortunate thing, this is, I hate to be that guy, the downer here, if it was from a severe reaction with the, with the COVID jab, we're never going to know about it. It's too much on the line. For his, for the institution that he works for, and everybody that sort of shield this jab these last couple of years. So that's the thing that sucks. So even if it is, like maybe they say it's clot, it seems that they always know, they never know what will cause a medical issue when you get that severe reaction, but they always seem to know what did not cause it. It's the jab. Yeah. I think there, it just adds a whole other layer to this too, if, if in fact it is true. And again, I mean, something weird is up because he's nowhere to be found. And I get it that, that people, you know, you, you get privacy if you want privacy. I totally understand that. But the nature of actors is that they share what happens. Jeremy Renner was just, just almost died from that crazy snowmobile accident. And he's like constantly sharing pictures of his recovery. Right. Like letting his fans know this is what happened to me because I think generally speaking, they understand the PR game of making sure your fans know what's happened to you because they care. So the whole, the way that they presented this from the beginning was really weird and sketch how Corinne Fox, his daughter was like, it was, it was just a medical complication. But luckily, he, due to quick action and great care, he is already on his way to recovery. And then they just never said anything else about what that medical complication was. That to me is weird. Because again, the true nature of actors usually is that they share a certain level of their lives. They don't have to. I'm not saying they should be required to. I'm just saying they usually do. So for them to be so secretive about it in the first place, and then for him to be MIA, this entire time he's supposed to be filming a movie. And all of a sudden, right, and all of a sudden, you know, mid May, Corinne Fox is like, oh yeah, he's been out of the hospital for weeks. Well, where the hell has he been? How come you guys didn't say anything at the time that you claim he went out of the hospital? How come we haven't seen from him or seen him? How come we haven't heard from him directly? These are all really weird things. And so even if it doesn't end up being this, clearly it's something that they don't want us to find out. And again, the other layer to that is that Corinne Fox herself is in the Hollywood industry. So I'm wondering, does she not want to jeopardize her chances of making it to the top? Because if she were to sound the alarm, she knows she would be blacklisted. Yeah. Oh, and that's exactly what would happen if they did. I mean, we've seen sort of actors that have come out really against the establishment, the establishment, Hollywood establishment, actors, actresses and all that. And they have been exactly that blacklisted. So I don't know if they're covering for the career. Or again, like you got to understand it. These guys shield for this. And they all were part of this sort of one of the most criminal acts that we've seen over the course of, let's say modern history, at least as long as I've been alive, I couldn't remember anything that was sort of this mass. I don't want to call it a scyop. I guess you can call it that if you want to be really, really accurate, but more so that they lied and so many people bought into it. Right. And as people were sounding the alarm, there was silencing, there was all that's going on. And one of the major guys, because at least these guys understand, if you control entertainment, you can pretty much get away with anything. And they use these actors and actors and actions and mouthpieces for exactly this. I'm not saying they use Jamie. I'm saying they use the institution of Hollywood. So that would criminalize themselves. Why wouldn't, why on earth what they want to do that? But either way, like I said, if it comes out and he's like, yeah, I was recovering from maybe it was a stroke, maybe it was something that that didn't have much to do with the jab at minimum. You can't gas like everybody else and act like this isn't weird. And yeah, you're right. Actors and stuff, they're all about privacy. And they can be all about it. I think they've lost their mystique, certainly after the sum of love in 2020, a lot of them lost all of that. Like now they're telling on themselves far as where they're at, they can't, they can't shut up anymore. Right. And some people don't like that. Right. So, but with health, with something like that, like health, generally they keep it, they keep it under wraps or at least they're public. You remember what happened to Chadwick Boseman when he was getting slim, right? And but he was still like doing public appearances. Like nothing happened. People could tell something was what's going on, but he just kept kept rocking because he didn't want to stress anybody out. But we at least saw the man. Right. And then unfortunately he passed away. Right now we have someone that has been missing in action for what how long is it been too much? Basically, we ain't heard nothing. He hasn't appeared on set. He's not being spotted on set. We got body doubles, we got all of that. What else are we supposed to think other than something very, very serious happened and they're trying to cover it up? Yeah, I know. Well, like I said, only time, we're going to have to find out sometime. We're going to have to see him at some point. Right. So hopefully I tend to agree with you. I don't think that we will find out the true extent of what happened, especially if his daughter has already said that he's playing pickleball and all of these things like they're not they can't. How do they walk that back and say actually I was lying. Right. But I mean, I tend to think we might start hearing at least trickling of what's happening. But listen, make sure you get your 10th booster. Okay, it's all safe and effective. No, no shot for COVID has ever had any sort of adverse reaction. That would be crazy talk. All right. And I did hear that from Anthony Fauci. So I do know that it's true. All right, we've got a good take a quick break. We'll be back with more. But we want to thank our sponsor Express VPN.

So I want to get your take Eric on the latest with the debt ceiling bill. So the Senate passed the debt ceiling bill last night. It was 63 to 36. 31 Republicans, four Democrats and one independent of course Bernie Sanders voted no on the bill. Let's see. There's some of the big ones in the GOP, Blackburn, Cotton Cruz, Graham, Hawley, Johnson, Kennedy, Lee, Rubio, Tim Scott, Rick Scott, Tuberville, and J.D. Vance. Fetterman voted against it. Warren voted against it in the dems, of course, Marky and Merkley voted against it. I've we've talked about this all week. I spoke to Chip Roy. He was in studio yesterday and he was of course incensed about it. But it now will head to Biden's desk for signature. It's just fascinating to me because you hear Kevin McCarthy taking a victory lap over something that he himself said, it grows the government but at a slower rate. And you and I are supposed to be like, oh, okay, great. Okay. No, that's that's totally great. That's what we want as conservatives or I know you wouldn't call yourself conservative. But as anyone who believes in limited government, small government, oh yeah. No. Okay. So you're growing the government, but it's at a slightly slower rate. And you want to brag about that to me and have me say, great job, Kevin. Really great job. No, I'm sorry. No. Well, this is what Malice and other guys have talked about like, what is the old saying that basically they are Democrats going to speed limit, Republicans generally speaking. So that's really all they've ever done historically. I mean, even if you look on the subject of like gun rights, it's the same exact kind of thing. It's like, well, we're just going to move it a little bit this way. Now if we gave them full power, they would have went all the way. But at least we're here to stop. What's that? Well, we don't want to be moving in that direction at all. There's a fundamental problem with your spending effort. Can we just like stop that and address that? Why would you aid in driving this country into the economic ground like you have over the last several decades? And look, this is what I want to constituent to the voters or whatever it is you want to call these people who claim that they're supposed to represent the views of the people to understand that the vast majority of these cats that yeah, you always want to concede or you want to pretend, let's say, that they are the worse or the two evils. And maybe they are in some aspects spending certainly they haven't really proven that they are willing to reign that back. I mean, you've heard me on this show even grill Trump on that. He was, yeah, right? Okay, how much you feel? How good you feel about that man on the subject of spending? He was absolute trash. But when we talk about the issues of like inflation, why your dollar doesn't go as far, yeah, it's a combination of let's say the Federal Reserve, as well as the Treasury, but look at the spending efforts of these guys and the growth of the welfare stateism as long as they can continue to justify spending amounts of money that you can't possibly comprehend guys. When someone says like a trillion dollars, you're like, now people are like, there's just another trillion. Do you think that's part of the problem too? Absolutely. That you being like desensitizing? Yeah, it's an imaginary number that you can't even grasp. You can't even grasp the con. It is a lot of money and they spending it every fiscal year like it's going out of style. And then when the issues start to catch up five years later, everybody's like, whoa, what possibly could have happened? It's like, I don't know, maybe the spending efforts that have been a problem for as long as you've been alive is the actual issue. And that's the part that it really, really irks me because what's going to happen is we're going to enter into the next election cycle and everybody's going to forget about every idiot that voted for that for that bill or any of the other ridiculous like actual spending like the actual spending up, forget the debt ceiling, the actual spending bills like gets me just makes me laugh and I'm like, well, we don't come to an agreement. Maybe the government might shut down. Great. Fantastic. That's exactly what it is that we want. Don't threaten me with an old bill. You're threatening me with a good time when you say the government's going to shut down. That's the that you want to talk about really like the best case scenario because yeah, I can't get them to quit. The best case scenario is for them to just not do anything. I prefer that they do that. They're like, they're like, but the government might shut down. Eric's like, you're turning me off. Yeah, exactly. Stop sexting me with that. All right. So I wanted to switch gears here and talk still about the corrupt and disgusting government, but this time the FBI. So Chris Ray FBI director, they were he was in breach of a subpoena because he had been subpoenaed to provide this document that whistleblower's alleged proves that the FBI has been running cover for Joe Biden being connected to this bribery scheme involving a foreign national. And Chris Ray has finally agreed to allow James Comer and Jamie Raskin. So one Republican, one Democrat, they are going to be allowed to view it in a very secure room with no technology allowed. They can't bring in their phones. So they tape and you know, taken pictures or tape in conversations or whatever. And so FBI, the director offered Comer the chance to view the document with redacted information at the FBI headquarters. And they said, no, we don't we don't want to do that. We want to view the full unredacted version. So he will be showing it to them. I still do not hold out very much hope that anything is going to happen. Right? It's like, okay, well, they're going to show them in an ultra secure room and they're we're going to have no proof of what is actually on there. So even if Comer says, wow, I saw this and it exists and it proves. Okay. Well, you're the one who saw it. Yeah, we don't have to receive. But even then, it's like, even if you accepted that, Comer was going to do anything worth a damn, like the fact that they're even going into it like, all right, this is going to be this really, really controlled setting. And we're also going to take stuff out off of it so you don't really know every bit of what happened. So even if you're accepting that it was good, you can end around Paul in there. If you give him a document that doesn't say any damn thing, what is he supposed to do with it? I also, I think it was Jason butch role earlier this week made the point that he's like, at this point, would you even trust the document that they bring you? It's not to not be to not be doctored already. Like, are you trusting that there? Do you the same FBI who, you know, the same, you know, bureaucracy who abused the fight the warrant system, who, you know, illegally spied on the Trump campaign, who did all of these things, who are arresting pro life activists for, you know, daring prey outside of an abortion clinic. That's, oh, oh, you trust that same FBI to not doctor a paper before they give it to someone when they know that it could incriminate the president of the United States that they support? You're, I mean, like, is that a bridge too far? It's not for me. I don't know what I don't trust any of them. I'll tell you what, I think it's an absolute X. It should be at least for any rational viewers. All of our viewers should be rational. They're not going in and staying with good faith. Anything that's going to at least criminalize them will make them look bad, or especially the president that they kind of have been backing us of late. They're not going to give that information willingly. So again, just the fact that it's, yeah, I guess they're going to fall back on the fact that it's the FBI. So it has to be the super controlled environment because it's the ever-important godly FBI. So yeah, Even though that information is, that's information for the people. Well, not according to him. It should be. That you can go, I mean, we can have much more time than we got because we can talk about all the agencies and them sort of investigating themselves and finding absolutely no wrong doing, because that's the nature of it. That stuff, they're not in it for you. It is a criminal organization. Sorry if you got family members that work for the FBI, they work for a criminal organization, and it's been that way for a very long time. They'll be mad at me. But anything that can even mildly incriminate, not just themselves, but people that they have aided, they're not going to give that stuff away willingly. So just expect it to be in such a controlled environment, expect the actual documents itself to be controlled. Yeah, I totally agree. But we will have the latest for you on Monday whenever that shakes out. All right, we got to take another quick break, but I want to thank our sponsor, the segment, Jase Case. So why don't you think about what it might be like if all of a sudden, you know, the global medication supply chain of antibiotics just, I don't know, like disappeared right before our eyes. Most of the medicine in this country, I've been trying to sound the alarm about this for forever. It's manufactured, not here. It's manufactured in places like China. So something happens even in China, not here. Your medication could go away like that. So if you or someone you love, you know, needs access to these antibiotics, there simply aren't any to be had, you've got to prepare with Jase Case. All right, this is Jase Case from Jase Medical. It's a really, really great way to keep yourself prepared for the worst. It's got five different courses of antibiotics that you can take to treat, you know, a long list of bacterial illnesses, UTI, respiratory infections, sinusitis, skin infections, ear infections. And not only is it a great way to be ready for shortages, it's great for traveling. And it's also great if you are a really, really, maybe you're a busy mom like me and you're like, I have a kid, he always gets respiratory infections. I know what it is. I know what the symptoms are. And I don't freaking have time to take him in the car, go to the doctor, get him checked out, go to the pharmacy, wait for the prescription. I just need my antibiotics. You need the Jase Case.

Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the blaze and I traveled to Maui for this first ever blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of blaze originals, a new docu series featuring your favorite blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism.

Well, I hope all of you have taken your blood pressure medication for this one. I'm going to play for you a pretty disturbing video of a teacher from El Dorado High School in Placentia, California educating her students how to pleasure themselves using sex toys that can be found at Target. This is Judy Reberg. She is the physiology and AP environmental science teacher and also I think should be behind bars right now as a nice gesture. Here is some of that video watch. Is where the prostate is? So you don't have to go inside the booby hole. You can actually just push on the scene and that stimulates the prostate gland as well and that they apparently really like that. But yeah, so that's why for mail-in-mail anal sex is still very pleasurable because of the fact that it hits the prostate and there's a lot of nerve endings in your booty as well. So the girls, the G-spot prostate, they're the equivalent to each other. But apparently that's why if you ever see like, I mean Target has a mail sex toys. If you go to Target seriously, if you go to Target and go into tampons and pabs are, they have, they just look like a little box. But if you open up the, there's like a bell pro front to the box, you open it up and then bam sex toy. And you'll see them hungry. CBS, CBS, CBS. You get a lot of them. And so lastly, when you look at the toys, a lot of them look like this. And the reason because is providing that spot. So I want to be clear here when my, my, my sons are not in high school yet. But if my son in high school has, you know, a teacher, some old bitch who starts talking to him about where to find sex toys and how he can enjoy mail-to-mail anal sex. Let me, I'm just going to put it very delicately. I will be visiting the school. I will be visiting that teacher. I will be in her face. And the cops probably will be called. I'm just going to go ahead and just lay it out like that. So apparently this teacher is on administrative leave pending a thorough investigation. I'm sure they will have in California, but they say due to employee confidential confidentiality, additional details regarding this will not be disclosed. Please know that our school district has a very explicit set of expectations and conduct of our employees. So I just, I cannot stress to you enough guys. Like I know that there are good teachers in public schools. I am aware every time we talk about get your kids the hell out of public schools. I hear from people who are like, but I'm a teacher and I'm a good person. I get it. Okay. But you also can't deny that it is also where a bunch of creeps and weirdos go who want to sexualize children. I mean, like it's not even just this woman. It's also the numerous teachers who have already been arrested for having sexual relations with children, having child born on their computers. It's where weirdos who want to do gross things to children or want to sexualize children go because it gives them easy access to children. That's not hard, right? Like that's not hard to comprehend. And so now you have these maybe I was harsh earlier when I called her an old bitch. No, I wasn't. So you have people like her who are instructing high school children on how anal sex can be pleasurable, male on male, and also where to find sex toys. Yeah, that's look it's disturbing all around it. But let's talk about the real stuff because the fact that she even felt bold enough because usually like you mentioned teachers, you know, for whatever reason has been this rise or maybe I'm just seeing it more. Definitely a female teacher is having very inappropriate relationships with with little boys. And liberal white women. Yeah, that's generally what it is. And we're gonna be completely completely honest. But you know, you see all that and it's it's happening really top to bottom. But the fact that someone's confident enough because usually they try to do it in secrecy. But the fact that she's just, hey, I'm just gonna go flat out, talk about it in the open like it's like it's part of the curriculum. Let you know how confident they are, but it also lets you know how bad things have got because now they're like, I'm I'm essentially unstoppable. Everybody's got my back. They think this is something that is now more appropriate to teach the children. And there, you know, a lot of left and said, or watch this will fall back on what L. Lee's high school is I'm like, dude, I don't care what age they are as minors in the classroom. Right? Right. That is a completely inappropriate way to be wording how the how the bodies actually work. Like because it's what she's a physiology teacher or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. So it wasn't even like direct sexual education. Right. It's like, what and why are you talking about that gate in butt six to a bunch of like that's weird, dude. Right. Nobody no matter where you are on the on the issues, that is bizarre. Yeah. I mean, it is because you know, you would think about a health teacher who is required to teach children about reproductive health. Right. And that's like, I would never say that children shouldn't be learning about reproductive health and about their own, you know, organs that they have. I do think that that is necessary. But I have to imagine that that course is even hard for a normal teacher to teach because it's like, I mean, it's uncomfortable, it's awkward, even just teaching about basic reproductive systems. How in the world does someone feel comfortable enough to be talking about booty holes to their high school students and where to find sex toys? Like I'm just like, what kind of a freaking degenerate person? That's what I was about to say is complete degeneracy is more hedonistic the way that she's talking. It's not more of an educational sense. So like, this is how the body works. This is all about liberty, not libertarian, libertarianism, hedonism, because he's talking strictly about pleasure, right, g spots and and pro states and and buts. This is all pleasure, pleasure stuff. This ain't got nothing. And it's the antithesis of reproductive. Yeah, exactly. Oh, definitely talking about melometas not works. Right. So this has nothing to do with educational stuff. She's telling people out, definitely, hey, if you if you're gay, this is why I feel like, whoa, what what are you doing? Dude, but look, you've been presented with this information. I know there's a lot of people that get upset with us, particularly teachers, but it's long been compromised. You know what I mean? It's just it's just what it is. And it's getting progressively, and I used that term unironically, uh, worse. It just keeps getting worse. You keep hearing newer and new stories of them, really print. I mean, and to be fair, they really told on themselves with the whole Florida stuff, where you had all these teachers that were coming out just because they were like, hey, we're not gonna be teaching. I don't know, fourth graders, how to do any of this weird stuff. And then you had all these teachers coming out like, well, they're attacking me. And I'm like, wait, wait a minute. What do you mean? And why first of all, why you think that's appropriate in talking that so they out of themselves as far as what they what they think is the appropriate thing to be teaching, uh, minors in regards to sex. So this is a problem that it has played. I think it really speaks to the structural issue of how public education and the system in itself works. And I just don't think it's worth salvaging. I think it needs to be burned to the ground. Let these, uh, let the parents keep the money that you're stealing from them in various ways and allow them to let's have actual competitive school systems, not ones just get money because they're public actual competitive school system. And let's let the teacher, excuse me, the, let's the last. Don't let the teachers. Don't let them do Jack, Jack, daily, let the parents be able to control exactly who they trust and who they entrust with this responsibility of teaching their children. Yeah. Amen. All right. Let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be right back. So, uh, daily wire, our friends over at the daily wire, uh, they have their documentary, What is a Woman? Which Matt Walsh did and it was tremendous work. I encourage everyone to watch it if you haven't. Well, they had done a deal with Twitter that they were going to put the entire movie on Twitter for 24 hours for free so that anyone could watch it. And it was fascinating because Twitter, um, like blocked it from being shared, um, uh, labeled it hateful conduct, uh, or hateful content. And so you couldn't retweet it. You couldn't share it. I mean, it was a huge ordeal. And everyone's calling on Elon Musk, who happened to be in China, by the way, so it was on a completely different schedule. Um, and so he released a statement that said this was a mistake by many people at Twitter. Uh, the content is definitely allowed, whether or not you agree with using someone's preferred pronouns, not doing so is at most rude and certainly breaks no laws. I should note that I do personally use someone's preferred pronouns just as I use someone's preferred name, simply from the standpoint of good manners. However, for the same reason, I object to rude behavior, ostracism or threats of violence, if the wrong pronoun or name, uh, is used. So, um, it's, it's been fascinating watching this play out because Elon, um, also posted a couple different retweets in which he said, um, well, it's not being, it's, there's going to be no ads attached to it. It's going to be limited to advertisers. It's not going to be recommended to people, but if people want to share it, they can. And he said, due to the sensitive content. Now I know Matt Walsh responded and said, what is the sensitive content? Have you even watched the movie? Please tell me what the sensitive content is. And I don't think we ever saw a response from Elon on that. But once the issue was fixed, he did retweet it from his own account and said every parent should watch this. Now it'll be interesting to know if we, um, if we ever hear the full story, because the same night that all of this was going on and Elon was like, this, this shouldn't be happening. Hold on. Let me fix it from China. The Twitter head of trust and safety Ella Gurbin resigned. Yeah. Legally, coincidentally, the same very evening she was removed from the Slack channels and she had resigned. So was she the one who was blocking all of this? I don't know if we're ever going to know, but I think it's important for people to realize there are still major issues with Twitter. Maybe that was what this was, a stress test. Like who's really about this sort of idea? Look, as, as much as I might, I'll rag on them here and there. Kudos to them because at, at minimum, he shared it out. The issue got resolved. The other was some kind of conflicting and contradicting tweets of his own that didn't really make a whole lot of sense. But I saw it. I saw the shared tweet. He gave it a boost on his own, on his own platform as far as, him, on his own page. And some people are never going to think that that's, that's, that's a good enough at minimum. He at least tried to correct the, the issue. And I, you know, look, I empathize with guy, the employees, other people, you know, you're trying to get something resolved. And it's like, who, who, who's in charge of this? Let me try to figure out who try to get down to the bottom of it. So I understand how that can be a little bit, a little bit difficult. But yes, it does go the show that maybe it's, I don't know if it's one of those technical issues where, you know, it's just automatically Twitter, they had the infrastructure there to like block all sorts of stuff. And I don't know if it's just one of those auto sort of catch, catch things. You think they would have that resolved after agreeing that this was what was going to happen. But at least it got resolved. And look, I don't like when people say, and this isn't me trying to protect Elon Musk, I'm just giving it to you factually, it is, it is not true. Let's just say that if you say that Twitter of now is the same Twitter of all, it's verifiably false. Yeah. Well, we can say that it might be not be completely as free as we like it to be. Right. But that's a, that's a different thing. And I think all of us that have said inflammatory things on this website, understand that we're able to get away with a lot more than what we just don't like. For example, the jab alone, then what we were able to do before without it being censored, censored and all that. So it is a better platform. But as far as a platform that has it all down together, there's no throttling, no, no hateful content, bull crap and all that, Twitter's got a ways to go. And I would argue that they're in front of at least the vast majority of social media platforms. Oh, 100%. By the way, I just looked this up. So someone said responded to Matt Walsh and said, two people left Twitter's trust and safety team in the past 12 hours. I'd like to know if that's related because that would be hilarious. Elon responded directly to this guy. I think he made a little bit of a typo because he said director related, which I think he meant directly related. So because he so he, he did confirm, even if it was director related, it would still be the same thing. Right. So he did confirm that the people who have left the trust and safety team was related to the blocking of what is a woman, which by the way, I think now has like over 45 million views. Yeah, on Twitter in 24 hours. So a really big win in the end. But I think it's an important lesson for Elon to keep in mind is that regardless of how he feels about free speech, regardless of what he wants to build, he is not everyone else in his firm in his company. And you have to make sure that you surround yourself and your company with qualified competent individuals who share your mission. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. It's hard. I say this as an employee. We were just sort of having that conversation off air. Exactly. It's not an easy thing, guys, to get people that you can trust to get people on the same exact page as you. It's something that he's in a more difficult situation because he inherited the actual infrastructure of Twitter where I saw it through a phone. He inherited a dumpster fire. Yes, that's exactly what it is. He has his work way more cut out for us than if he, let's say, started a new social media platform from scratch and everybody was his guy. Right. Right. All right. Let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back. Glamour UK released their special June Pride Month magazine cover featuring a topless pregnant, what they would call a transgender man, which we know is just a woman who chopped off her breasts because, well, that's as far as I'll go YouTube. But this is 27-year-old Logan Brown. And you can see the scars, which I just find to be so weird because I'm sure it's a slap in the face to any woman who has had cancer who is very not ashamed of their scars, but I'm sure it's a confidence issue. It reminds them of the horrible moment that they had to remove their own breasts from their body. These people are just doing it for funsies and taking pictures afterwards of their awesome scars, which is a whole other problem. But she also wrote a children's book about being pregnant as a daddy. Yes, it's called In My Daddy's Belly, The Miracle of Male Birth, which again, isn't a thing. Like, that's not, that's not a thing. It can't happen. It's because this is a woman who stopped taking testosterone in her own words. Watch. Found out I was pregnant because I took a pregnancy test. Early, I was in the morning. Mars Belly was asleep. And I just had this really weird feeling that something wasn't right. And obviously I've been off the testosterone for a while due to some health issues. So just kind of had this really weird feeling. And that's all the pregnancy test. And it was just like this. It was like my whole world just stopped. And yeah, it was literally when I saw them two lines, I was just like, what the heck? That everything just all the manly hoods that I've tried to work hard for so long, just completely felt like it was erased. Yeah, that's how I found out. So I'm curious if we are to believe that this is in fact a man who is miraculously pregnant, what, where does the baby come out? I don't even want to think about that. But I will say this, this is one of the more complicated kind of, I guess, the rainbow coalition alphabet stuff that I don't understand because, okay, so you went through all of this extra work to still go check up with a dude. What was the point? Like no sense. I just, I can't wrap my mind around that. I don't know. It's like this, I can't remember what African show or TV show where the guy's like, why are you gay? Like it's one and it was, and the chick was like, well, she calls herself a man. And because she's with other women or whatever, she thinks she's straight. And he's like, no, he was like, you are gay. Yeah, whatever. But like, this is my thing. It's like, dude, you didn't have to chop up your breath. You at the dude. Be pregnant. Especially. You're not going to just do it regularly. You're going to just do it the old fashioned way. Why did you go through all these extra steps, man? You know, cut your stuff off and add stuff on my manly hood is because men don't get pregnant. It's not how it works. Right. So I'm sorry. So I've got pop billows, but it ain't nothing in there, but like fat and stuff. Baby. Yeah, you know, they don't get kids coming out of her. So what was the point? You with the wildest extra work to end up pregnant and end up with another dude, man, you don't have to cut off your stuff for that, man, you don't have to do that. Well, I mean, I'm just saying, I don't know if the book that she wrote about daddy being pregnant, does it end with daddy pushing the baby out of his penis? Oh, is that how it? No, does it does it end with her giving birth through the vaginal canal with because she has a vagina because she's a woman? Is that how it ends? No, I just I like I can't if there's literally one person that buys that book. I'm I just I can't you can't fix stupid. I guess when someone is that this is a legitimate clown world and someone probably paid $1000 to check up with a dude she couldn't do it. I also love to that they're like she says testosterone causes help it really really tell me more."
