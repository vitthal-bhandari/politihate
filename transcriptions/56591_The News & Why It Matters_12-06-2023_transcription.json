    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. Today, the White House celebrates Pride Month because Joe Biden really cares who you have sex with. Also, California wants to criminalize parents who don't affirm children who believe they are transgender and shocking findings from South Korea on COVID vaccine deaths. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and President Biden hosted the largest Pride Month event in White House history over the weekend. More than a thousand guests attended the event on the White House lawn and he acclaimed the Pride community as the bravest and most inspiring people and an example for the United States and the entire world. He also said that he dedicated his speech to the trans children and told them they belong here. Some of that watch have to act as a nation. We need to push back against the hundreds of callous and cynical bills and laws introduced in states targeting transgender children, terrifying families, criminalizing doctors and nurses. These bills and laws attack the most basic values and freedoms we have as Americans. That's not hyperbole. That's a fact. The right to be yourself, the right to make your own health decisions, the right to raise your own children. You know, too many people in the LGBT community are worried and afraid about their future and their safety. So today, I want to send a message to the entire community, especially the transgender children. You are loved. You are heard. You are understood and you belong. I don't know why he's screaming at them or why he's saying be who you are because if we were to allow them to be who they were, we would be telling them that they were born with a penis. Therefore, they are a boy and vice versa. But he later in the speech made up this weird fake scenario saying that Americans are getting thrown out of restaurants for being gay, which I personally have not seen happen. Watch. When a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay any afternoon, something is still very wrong in America. I don't think that's happening. And I don't think that that's legal, but okay. Among the performers, there were the drag queen Britta Filter, who oh my gosh, I'm a big fan of Britta. Britta. Britta. Britta. Britta Filter, like you're filtering water, but it's a surprise. It's not water. It's this creature and bisexual singer Betty who and of course they displayed a gigantic progress pride flag on the White House for the event. But I mean, it wasn't the center of two American flags, but the pride flag was the most important thing. So it was of course front and center. And of course the Biden Harris administration has been one of the most LGBTQIA apostrophe plus root sign, whatever friendly having some of the most openly LGBTQ people working at every level of the government. Sometimes those members of the LGBT community who are working in the federal government do get sent to prison because they are in fact criminals, but I digress. He tweeted out the photo of the pride flag over the weekend with a message to the country saying today, the people's house, your house sends a clear message to the country and to the world, America is a nation of pride. That for my angle, it looks like a guillotine for what I saw. Well, that's not a inaccurate. That's not an act. Listen, oopsies. It's just a weird coincidence here to discuss this and more. We have Eric July, founder and owner of Ripovus comics and Chad Prather, host of the Chad Prather show. I heard you guys laughing. I don't know why you think this is funny. This is a very serious event. We have to honor creatures like that. Brit of filter? We have to honor Brit of filter. What would the nation be like? I ask you, what would the nation be like without people like Brit of filter? Probably better for sure. Probably. Anyway, this is a bizarre, but that whole line where he said make your own health decisions, considering what he is, party and all his constituents that have been saying, definitely after 2020 is just hilarious. But it goes to show they do not care about contradicting themselves. Oh, Hippo Chris, that's the only stuff that we generally care about. They'll contradict themselves from what they said yesterday, if it's advantageous to them at the time. That's why it's so hard to argue and reason with a person that is like that. But yeah, I mean, this whole just don't see how anybody, no matter where you're at on the issue, doesn't find this to be weird. How these guys are paraded around their flag is almost looked at in the equivalent sense as we see right here of the of even the American flag as if it's its own government on audiology, which that's really exactly what it what it is. But now, you know, with him speaking out loud or saying that what it used to be the quiet part is not so quiet. They shot it from the mountaintops. This whole trans kids issue thing. And this is the president, man. This is how crazy it's gotten with a president is paying lip service to this idea that a child can be transgender. It's insane. That's crazy, man. And I think that's again, the line that's going to do it for so many people. And you consider just how small to the representation of the population that they represent and folks that are bending over backwards, not in a homosexual way, but bending over backwards for this community is bizarre. And again, paying that lip service to that to to to to to transgender children when your president is saying stuff like that because again, America, there's no such thing as that. That's not a thing. I hate to just be that guy. Usually we say we reserve that kind of talk for people like Glenn, but this is demonic. I don't know what else to how else can I put this? This is demons at play here. So I want to just to kind of hammer Eric's point home here. I want to I want to show two things. Number one, there was a tweet that I saw that showed the White House during other times of year. So here is the White House during Easter, the White House during Veterans Day, the White House during Christmas and the White House during Pride Month. As you can see, Veterans Day, no flags on the White House, no flat, nothing, no no cross right during Christmas or Easter, nothing celebrating all of these things. But you do have the Pride flag during Pride Month front and center. I don't think there were any American flags during Memorial Day as well, which was just leading up into Pride Month. And then this tweet from President Biden, who said, everyone is entitled to dignity and respect no matter who they are, whom they love or how they identify. And he lists new actions to protect the LGBTQI plus community, strengthening physical safety, and then addressing civil rights violations. So now the Biden-Harris administration wants you to believe that it is a civil rights violation to protect children from pornographic books in schools. Because this says, new communication to protect LGBTQI plus students from book bands. Which again, it is not a book band. If you can get the- If you can get the book- Most you were close. You were closer. If you can get the book. If you can get the book on Amazon, it's not a book band. You don't see hustler or playboy in school libraries for a reason because they are inappropriate. So it's not a book band. But the Biden-Harris administration wants you to believe that they are fighting for the LGBT community because they are fighting against pornographic materials being kept from students, censored from students who obviously are not yet capable of handling that content. Well, I mean, you got to hand it to Joe Biden. He does a great job as the President of the United States of validating individuals and their humanity and their existence. He recognizes their visibility unless you're his biological granddaughter and Arkansas. So it sort of falls on deaf ears. That type of rhetoric. I know a lot of gay people. I'm just going to come out. Unless I've tried to be gay. I can't. It doesn't work for me. You know, pride month is you know, I just want to be popular. Yeah, I'm going to be trendy. I love all bright colors. I love the bright colors. And being in the entertainment industry for as long as I have working in Hollywood, doing things with a lot of different entertainers and people behind the scenes, we all know that there's a lot of people in that are gay that are in there. I don't know a single one that I have a conversation with interaction with a meal with any single one of them have said, you know, I feel oppressed and I feel worried about my future. Not a single one of them. I have one particular friend who's an agent. He was my agent for a number of years. He's gay as it gets. And he just he one of his one of his clients just signed a $75 million deal of which he took 10%. I think he's not oppressed. He's doing pretty damn okay. You know, so this rhetoric, this ideology, I would love to see the picture of the White House on the National Day of Prayer because they're not going to host that on the front lawn. They're not going to honor that. And you said, well, that's religious. If you don't think this is religious, they're bowing, paying homage to a symbol. They're erecting an idol. If you don't bow down to it, then you're immediately outcast and shunned and in your call to all the names and castigated. I had somebody, you know, I tweeted that picture and somebody said, really responded, they said, they're just flags. Really? Well, there's people who died for the stars and stripes. People died for what that stands for. And they said, well, everybody can be included now. Well, if you understand the meaning of the American flag, you understand that the symbolism of it is for everybody to already feel included. And then there were other people who said, you can't point to one specific situation where the LGBTQ whatever community has targeted children. What really? They said, well, I'm not, they said, you can't use drag queen story hour either. I'm like, well, you can't tell me what I can't include. It doesn't work like that. That's not that's not how proper debate and discourse goes. You can't use a biological male exposing their junk in front of a kid. I said, let me simplify it for you, stupid. This is target.com. Yeah. They're selling pride clothing for kids. Target is targeting kids. I said, well, that doesn't count. That's a t-shirt. Okay, stupid. This debate is over. I gave you your example. They targeted kids. It's over with. Right. So, so the logic is gone. The idea that they're validating any people is gone. This whole thing is about money. Why is everything about transgenderism now? Why is it all about that? And here's the thing. It'd be one thing. I'm going to break this down on my show after this one. So watch it. I'm going to break down why people are sick of this. It's not because you hate gay people. That's not, I'll tell you why they hate it. But I will go ahead and say this, this whole thing, the reason they're all of a sudden talking about all of this at once, the way they are. And it's just on steroids this time around is there's money in it. There's money in it. And that's the bottom line. And this administration, Joe Biden, don't know what flag was hanging from the White House. He don't know what curtains are hanging in his bedroom. So, you know, but again, the power brokers that are out there, it's about money. Well, I mean, speaking of they're not after the children just go over to California where a new bill over there in that state would classify not affirming a child's preferred pronoun as child abuse. This is AB 957. And of course, state Senator Scott Wiener is attached to it because I like I've literally never I've never heard of a person with a more appropriate name than Scott Wiener over in California who continues pushing these, you know, LGBT laws that are like, Oh, you can have HIV now and knowingly spread it to someone else. And that's not a crime. Oh, you can have kids transition kids without letting their parents know that's not a crime. There's no one that is more appropriately named than Scott Wiener. But it's going to rewrite much of the state's family law and classify as a parent's affirmation of the child's gender identity as part of the health, safety and welfare of the child. And then they're going to change the definition, of course, of what health, safety and welfare of the child actually means. And any organization on top of the parents, any organization that interacts with children will be required to affirm gender transitions in minors, which includes schools, churches and hospitals. But they're not coming for the children, Eric, it's quite I mean, it's amazing how they get to do that. How they can claim something is abuse. When the thing that they're doing is abuse in itself, it's psychological abuse because you're trying to tell some child or affirm that they are something that they are not. So that's psychological abuse. It enters into the physical abuse. When you talk about sterilization, the puberty blockers and worse, which we know, and in California that it's happening that they absolutely are providing the surgeries to minors. Okay. So that's literal abuse. I just gave you two examples on both fronts, psychological abuse, emotional abuse as well as physical abuse. And they're going to say that you definitely as a parent, if you don't go along with this charade, that you're the one abusing them. Like, I just, I know that there's a lot of people that watch this show that's from California and they are trying to go down with the ship or they think that they can change the tide. Going back to what I said in the first segment, that place is run by demons for sure. And you might have to at some point live to fight another day because I don't think you are doing anything that's conducive to liberty. You're not doing anything conducive to your family getting caught up in this bull crap. And then whether you get imprisoned or something of that nature, the worst thing that could possibly happen. And again, you're not of use to anybody, including your own children. If you're locked behind bars or you've had your child taken away from you because you don't want to uphold this nonsense, these guys are demons. Yeah, there's no question about it. I don't know if you saw in Ottawa, Canada, they got a new deal for the new school year. So if you're a teacher, educator, administrator, you have to automatically refer to the child as they them until they give you an identifier pronoun. But you automatically passing that law in Ottawa, Canada. So if you're looking at it, you look at Canada and you see what's coming here. And that's the deal. I mean, you got to automatically, your student is automatically schizophrenic. But to the point on this thing is, is they have to go after the children, right? Because no movement will exist or last if you don't go after the next generation. That's why churches have vacation Bible school. That's why they have youth groups. That's why they have Sunday school. They have to capture the next generation. But you know, when the Bolsheviks took over in Russia in 1918, they took the children out of the home, put them in communist schools. Whenever Hitler was rising to power, he had the Nazi youth, they have to go after the children. And that's whether it's a good movement or a bad movement, you can't say they're not going after children. They have to because all organizations to continue to exist and perpetuate themselves into the future have got to go after the next generation. So to say they're not doing it is just asinine and insane. It's completely illogical. Of course, they're going after the children. That's what they must do. Yeah. Yeah. All right, let's go ahead and take a quick break. We'll be back with more one-and-a-thick response or bank on yourself.

I got one now. When I want my Glenn Beck's dressing room in there, he's got a plaque for when he hit 100,000. I know. They never sent me no plaque. You never got the honeymoon. Never. They were supposed to. I've never got my ex-wife. You should have made sure that you specified you wanted that in the divorce. I didn't get the quarter million mark. I got nothing. I think it's a hundred thousand. I get you another hundred million. And then it's like five or ten million. We get to it's like a third one. That's a big that's a very big gap. Yes, a big gap. You give me 10 million subscribers on YouTube. I buy my own plaque. Anyway, help us out if you would help me show my kids that I'm cool. I want to bring up this new study from South Korea. This is the South Korean national reporting system, their medical reporting system that found that among roughly 44 million residents that are 12 and older who received at least one vaccine dose through December 2021, just that those people had the highest vaccine related myocarditis rates. This is males 12 through 17 and 18 through 29 had a rate of 5.29 and 2.93 per 100,000. Nearly 20 percent of the vaccine related myocarditis were severe cases. And among those severe cases, nine in 10 required ICU admission. Three and eight had a fullment myocarditis that is marked by severe and sudden onset and high mortality rate and 22 percent of each death and required extracorpural membrane oxygenation therapy. So this is, I'm going to throw up a tweet here from Tracy Hogue. I hope I'm not mispronouncing her name. This is a doctor and PhD. She said, just published Korean nationwide study reports eight cases of sudden cardiac death attributable to vaccine related myocarditis proved by an autopsy all developed less than one week post mRNA vaccine, two females, six males, three post dose, one, five post dose, two, all less than 46 years old. How is this possible that we are living in a time where there are not, like, I mean, this is- People getting put under prison, honestly. Yes, crimes against humanity. This is crimes against humanity. I mean, we had Nuremberg trials in this world and we decided as a cohesive, you know, world powers that this was, this type of thing was not supposed to be done. Governments were not supposed to be requiring their own citizens to get injected with something that was going to harm them. And now here we are. And yet still, I would just like to throw in here as well. Yet still, the White House is still enforcing mask mandates for unvaccinated visitors. Oh, this makes me mad. So here is a White House Office of Legislative Affairs, an email from the masking guidance. Fully vaccinated guests are not required to wear a mask on White House grounds. Guests who are not fully vaccinated must wear a mask at all times and maintain at least six feet distance from others while on the White House grounds. This is, of course, after Joe Biden signed a resolution in April ending the COVID-19 emergency orders. But you still, as an unvaccinated person, have to wear a mask to go visit the White House. I'm about to break this on the table. You still have to wear a mask as punishment for not taking a jab that is killing people. Let's open that up, sir. I'll take it. So yeah, things are crazy here. South Korea is an interesting story. For those of you that don't know, I actually covered this back in March of 2020. They were one of the first countries that actually had collected data about the whole COVID sting. And the data showed exactly what it showed after the fact coming from South Korea. That it was basically harming the very elderly. A lot of people with cold morbidities, all that data was already available. I was ringing alarm and go back and watch my old videos. Y'all, I was ringing alarm. I was like, please do not overreact. I don't have a PhD. I'm not a medical doctor. Yet I somehow was able to figure it out. And now these guys are late to the party. And they don't win as far as to get your children or say that you must get the least vulnerable population. The population where they're risk, if they did catch the COVID stuff was, I mean, if you aren't rounded to the nearest number, that number is zero. It's zero. Yet they were just screaming at the top of the lungs that you had to get it. And it happened worldwide. It wasn't just in a unique to American thing. And that's where the criminal behavior is. Because despite this evidence being very available to us early, that particularly young males were getting myocarditis and pericarditis. They were getting issues with the heart after taking this. The risk is not there. Why on earth would you take something that might mess up your heart to stop yourself, I guess, from maybe having some symptoms to something that you might not have symptoms for in the first place. Because at your age, the risk is essentially zero. So that's where the criminal behavior is, is that this let's not act like this is daily is new. We knew about the myocarditis and young and young and young for a long time ago, right? Yet they still pushed it. And that's why I say guys like the Fauci's of the world will ask you who just resigned and she's gonna get off easy. Trial ain't enough. They need to be put in the prison, not in it. Actually take them out and throw them under that bad boy because that's where they belong. These guys are criminals of the utmost, I mean by literal textbook definition, they are criminals. And the fact that they're able to get Fauci still walking the streets like nothing happened. These last three years, all of these people, these doctors, like these, these guys that work with of course for the government, the medical doctors that work for the government that were shilling for this job, right? As all of this stuff, we sat in there, we were banning people, all the people that were in, in on it, as the information was starting to spread and the doctors they did have since tried to ring the alarm. They were saying, look, this is this is a this is a mistake. And then they got you, they silenced. You remember the was Dr. Erickson, those guys out of out there in California, I think I covered that. They took my video down. They were taking everybody's video down that was talking about them speaking about what the youth. So you did that to the youth and they have nerve to try to lecture people as an act as if they have the moral high ground. It's it's it's it's a say to add to Eric's point, Chad. I remember whenever the vaccine first came out and we were talking about it and we were talking about the issues and we were talking about all of a sudden this weird myocarditis that started popping up in young in young people. And I remember, I remember there was a point where the one of the boards of the the CDC were going to meet to discuss the myocarditis that was happening and decide whether or not they wanted to give a different opinion or different instructions to Americans. And they postponed it because of a Juneteenth celebration. So they couldn't meet they listen, they were busy. They had to take the government holiday for Juneteenth and they couldn't get to it. And once they did finally get to it, because it wasn't a priority for them, your health wasn't a priority to them. When they finally got to it, you know, they it was like what you would expect, right? Like, oh, don't worry, nothing to see here. We're just not going to allow Johnson and Johnson. But all the other ones are totally fine, even though all of these other countries, including South Korea, were bringing forth this evidence, this data that said this is not okay. Something is very wrong. People's livelihoods were ruined over this, not just doctors, but people who wouldn't get the shot. Their livelihoods were ruined over this. And now, literally all of the data that we see shows that they were right to not get it. We were right. And yet still 200 colleges in this country require their students to be vaccinated. Y'all need anger management. This is for a bah. Okay. Let's just bring this back to the center. I can't. Listen, you and I had a conversation on my show last week where I told you that Pfizer just bought arena. Arena creates the medication that fights this kind of thing. And so they not only created the thing that causes the thing. Now they bought the company that makes the medication that the problem is the solution. Yeah, exactly. So it's all about the money, right? And by the way, that email that went out from the White House talking about the mask mandate and the social distancing that was included too was to the National for the National Day of College Athletes or not National Day, but the college athletes day where they brought them in there. These are young athletes in college, prime of their life, prime fitness, all of these things. Those are the ones. Now you look at the videos of the Pride Day. There's no masks. There's no social distance. I mean, they just rub in monkey pucks all over each other. And I mean, there's there's Pete and chasing Buttigieg out there playing grab and right there from the Pride flag, the whole thing. And it's a joke. It's a clown show. It's a circus. It's a charade, the whole deal is. But again, it all comes back to the money. That's why we know that you and I, you and I, we all said over and over again, listen, I've done enough drugs in my life that I know that when I do them, it's going to make me feel different. That's why you do them, right? So if you do the drugs that you know, sometimes you're going to bad trip and you're like, holy s***, that's a bulldozer flying around. And it's like, I'm never doing acid again because that had a chemical reaction to my body. My brain didn't fit well with that bad trip. And now I'm having reactions, you know, and flashbacks of Earth getting bitten off behind me while I'm walking on the beach. So I've done enough of that stuff to know that when the government comes out with a serum that says you're going to be perfectly fine, if you put this in your arm, no, no, that's why I still have Bitcoin sperm, baby. It is, it is unvaxed, untouched, untainted. You just pay for the reversal of the, the sectomy and I'm delivering it to you the old fascia way. But I'll give it to you because we got to save the planet. And that's the only way to do it. Unvaxed right here, baby. But he does. It is a requirement that it has to be the old. It's got to be, we got to do it manually in just old fashion ways. It's got to be a delivery system like a mom and daddy did it. But let me tell you something. You're not getting me in a tube. Here's the thing. We're not involving pharma in this transaction. But here's the thing, they villainized us. We said it with common sense. We said it with common sense and you're that to your point, Eric, we don't need a medical degree to be able to tell you what makes sense. I learned that by doing drugs. I mean, I was smarter than Dr. Fauci, the world's virologist and I was smarter than him. Why? I call it pot. Yeah. Well, and by the way, I know we got to go to break. But by the way, like we said all these things, knowing that we were going to be outcast and villainized because we care. Like I care, I cared the pregnant women were getting the vaccine. Absolutely. Seeing all of these miscarriages rates. I cared about all of these people who ended up in the hospital and put on, remdesivir when their organs fit. Like we cared about people enough to say this and now it's really frustrating seeing all these things and still seeing the United States government go along with it and pushing people more to be more prone into death. I'll just go ahead and say it. I'm already demonetized on YouTube. So who cares? All right, we've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor, Tommy John. So most of your dad's taste, I guess, maybe get better with age. Like scotch or steaks. I don't know. Naps. But he might not have yet upgraded his underwear if he's still rocking those old, tidy whities. It is time for an overdue upgrade. Listen, this is saying this, but like I don't, you probably shouldn't know what type of underwear your dad wears. I don't know what kind of underwear my dad wears. I don't want to know what kind of underwear my dad wears. But what I do know is that he will be the most comfortable in Tommy John underwear. Chad wants to say something. No, I'm just going to say around my house, you knew what your dad's underwear looked like because it was all hands, tidy whities that weren't tidy or whitey. Just hanging down. Fruit of the loohoo. Don't do that. Like a hammock. Don't don't do that to your dad. Rear in look like Morse code in them. So many holes. That's why your dad needs Tommy John. I'm telling you guys, we have Tommy John in our house because they don't I mean, they have stuff for men and women. They've got it all. They've got lounge wear, not just underwear, but it is literally the softest, most comfortable fabric I have ever put on my body. My husband has the boxer briefs. He agrees. We've got the lounge wear. We've got it all. It really is the softest and the best. You can go to TommyJohn.com slash Y for Father's Day. Get 20% off your first order.

They told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you're weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind Today at BlazeTV.com slash The Blind. For the first time, the man who has been charged with manslaughter for killing Jordan Neely on a subway train. This is Daniel Penny. He is speaking out. He posted a video over the weekend of defending his actions back in May. This was of course the it came after, this is very bizarre to me. It came right after Daniel Perry in Texas who was charged for defending his own life against the BLM riots and a man that flashed a gun at him. Then we had Daniel Penny in New York City on a subway, Jordan Neely acting erratically, threatening to kill and harm people on the subway. Daniel Penny explained this confrontation in this video. Watch. This was a scary situation and Mr. Neely came on. He was threatening. I'm 6'2\", and he was taller than me. There's a common misconception that Marines don't get scared. We're actually taught one of our core values is courage. Courage is not the absence of fear, but how you handle fear. I was scared for myself, but I looked around. I saw women and children yelling in their faces, saying these threats, I couldn't just sit still. Some people say that I was holding on to Mr. Neely for 15 minutes. This is not true. Between stops is only a couple of minutes, so the whole interaction less than less than five minutes. Some people say I was trying to choke him to death, which is also not true. I was trying to restrain him. You could see in the video, there's a clear rise in fall of his chest indicating that he's breathing. I'm trying to restrain him from him being able to carry out the threats. Then some people say that this is about race, which is absolutely ridiculous. I didn't see a black man threatening passengers. I saw a man threatening passengers. There are all of these very radical DAs across the country, Soros DAs oftentimes. It's getting really scary because I think that it's very clear that they want you to be too scared to defend yourself at the same time that they are letting out actual criminals. Jordan Neely had a very, very long rap sheet of criminal behavior. Yet, if you're riding the subway in New York, you should be too scared to defend yourself or women and children around you. Yeah, that's what officers and DAs, that's been a message that's been sent really all across the nation. If anything, 2020 showed you that, where they'd much rather you be scared to death to the point to where someone does something to you, often irreversible. They'd much rather that happen as opposed to you doing something and putting it in your own hands. Because every time that happens, that person is seen or met with some sort of consequence. I always bring up the pawn shop owner. I think it was a Minneapolis when doing the sum of love and looter comes in and he shoots them and he dies and they were a son from her. It's always, and then that's because I think they try to pin that because I think they have a duty to retreat law, where essentially you can't even defend yourself unless you're like about to die. And then at that point, it's probably too late anyway, but otherwise you be criminalized. And this is the issues that I have with the state and why in itself it's so dangerous, not just in the actions that it inflicts upon other individuals, but also in how it threatens people to not act as community, to not act even as individuals in protecting themselves and the people around them. And that's the thing that sucks so much because this is just yet another example of it where someone, I mean, videos, I always, someone's threatening someone, threatening a group of people and I guess you're just supposed to stand around and wait. Maybe until this guy carries something out and we could sit up here and talk until we're blue in the face and theorize like maybe, oh, well, he's just crap crazy. He wasn't even going to do anything. But when you're in the moment, you have no idea, man. And often people that have never been in conflict, all the ones that say that it's easy after the fact, everybody's kind of the armchair quarterback and we can say, should have did this, should have did that. But I say this is a guy that used to bang. You know, when you're faced with, you're looking down the barrel of that gun or you know, you're faced with fight of flight or you're faced with, okay, I have to do this. Otherwise it could people that ain't never been in conflict don't know anything about that. So it's easy for them to say, yeah, just just wait until they do do something physically to harm someone else. And that's unfortunate. And hope that you live through it so you can defend yourself. These, you know, Soros funded Yahoo's, the DA's and all the rest of them, they should ride the subway. Yeah, just let them go ride the subway. Don't take you security detail with you. Don't do any of that. Just go ride the subway every day be forced to do that. Then you come back with a different perspective, because of Jordan nearly had pulled out a gun and shot everybody on that train car. They'd have been elated. They'd have been all like, look, oh, now we got another opportunity to talk about common sense gun reform and all this kind of stuff. So this, this, I mean, good job, Daniel Penny for doing what you did. If I'm in that situation, I want, you know, all the pennies I can get around me, right? So I'm hoping because again, if that he hadn't done it, they would have been saying, there was a Marine on the car. Why didn't he do something about this guy? Why didn't he shut him down? So it's the hypocrisy is there. But yeah, I say, let's go back to not relying on the police and relying on all this kind of stuff, just take care of your own stuff. It's, it solves the problem. I mean, did it get the issue not get resolved here? I mean, he's not going to attack any, he will not commit any more felonies. That's a guarantee. Yeah, it won't do it. Just like George Floyd, he's drunk free. Yeah. I like to say, like two things can be true. It can be unfortunate that someone, someone died. But in the same respect, we can't just sit up and ignore someone threatening people. We cannot do that. Right. They probably should have thought about that before they threaten people. Yeah. All right, we got to take a break. We'll be right back. Over the weekend, Fox News sent a cease and desist letter to Tucker Carlson alleging that he broke his contract by launching a new show on Twitter. This is of course Tucker on Twitter. He has branded it and it has had over a hundred million views since its launch with just two shows posted. Harmeet Dylan is Tucker's attorney and she posted a tweet over the weekend in defense of her friend and client. She says Tucker Carlson will not be silenced by the far left or by Fox News. Fox sends Tucker Carlson. This is scoop Fox sends Tucker Carlson cease and desist letter. She followed it up with another tweet that was interesting because she says she's not appearing on Tucker Carlson. I'm sorry, on Fox News anymore because she is committed to free speech. And she says what you are seeing on Fox today is a censored version of the news. Keep that in mind as you make your viewing and your commenting choices. I tend to agree. And it seems that Tucker is not is not being intimidated because his producer Justin Wells posted on Twitter yesterday that Tucker will respond to the recent Trump indictment on his new show tomorrow. So we will see how this plays out. But you know, you got to believe if you're Tucker Carlson and you have the right people around you to review your contracts, you're not going to make such a stupid mistake as to get yourself involved in a legal battle that you can't clearly win. And I wouldn't put it past Fox to be like, oh, we totally forgot to address Twitter or social media at all because we thought mainstream media was the thing and didn't realize it was dying all around us. Yeah, this whole deal is interesting. I mean, I remember that rumors were floating around that that was a thing. And then it's us seem like the attorney is really confirming that. Yeah, there there were some kind of I don't want to say a conflict of interest. It's more of they felt like they he couldn't do anything. Yeah, they wanted to sideline him until his contract was up. And that's it's several of angles to take. But I think it's more telling that, you know, a contract like that is is a thing. It was not a clean break. Clearly, it was not something that both sides kind of agreed upon, like this is okay. It's whatever you don't agree with me. I don't agree with you. I'm going to go do my thing. You keep doing whatever that that wasn't what this was. It's clearly more to the story. I'm always intrigued by that because you know, it's a contractual dispute. It's a it's something that we see and we've all dealt with. We all do stuff over here at the blaze. But the fact that he's going to keep doing it, I think that's what people want in a Twitter. Look, man, Twitter, you're in a decent spot right now, Elon. I don't know. You better be taking advantage of it because you see what's going on with with with him and Fox. But also, I don't know if you guys seeing what's going on with like Twitch right now and and and all that. And we know YouTube's going to YouTube like you are positioning yourself for you by proxy. Really, you didn't have to do anything. He kind of just in a position you have to use a base to just make some sort of something that is really good for video content for all of us. So we'll see. Yeah, we've got about a minute to check. Well, I mean, why belabor the point? I mean, I think that it's pathetic. When you watch these mainstream outlets that are just absolutely in decline, it's pathetic to watch their efforts to try to, you know, silence all voices that could potentially hinder them in any way. Listen, you've already put the nail in the coffin. It's a done deal. And the idea that you're going to continue to go out and silence a guy for what he's saying, it makes you look very, very suspect, even more so than what we already believe about you. Yeah, it's like, how did you think that this was going to end? Yeah. Yeah. What did you think was going to be? You martyred a guy and then don't want people to worship him. Exactly. I mean, here it is. Yeah, yeah, exactly. Should have maybe wargamed this one out a little further. Fox. All right, we've got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. Yeah. Jill Biden, first lady, Jill Biden, had an interesting moment over, I guess this was the end of the last week, she thought that she was like really, really building up the crowd for this awesome applause and it did not go the way that she thought launch. And as I've traveled around the country, I visited red states and blue states. And I found that the common values that unite us are deeper than our divisions. And I thought you might talk for that. Oh, no, that is just giving me major Jeb Bush energy. Let's have a flashback to that watch. Please clap. That is so sad. What's funny is how these people think they actually inspire other people. Yeah. She's about self deception. Well, I mean, it's like, what are you, she has compared Hispanics to breakfast tacos. She has, what else has she done? She sees it. She dresses like a bedspread. Other than that, there's nothing about her that's memorable. Yeah, it's everybody was listening to her. Nobody pack of nerds in there. They weren't listening to her. And yet she's the one who has to go to the campaign trail because they can't trust Joe Biden. I was trying to, I was, had to comment on that clip and I wasn't listening to her. So you just made this up? Yeah. Other than the clap thing, because I want to see what was so motivational and I was like, I didn't get it. She thought she had a nice little one line. Don't talk to doesn't land. To be fair. Yeah, you can't. Timing was off. Yeah. To be fair, I mean, it's still whatever she has to say is better than her husband, who happens to be the president. So there's that."
