    "text": " Welcome back to hashtag sisters in law with Kimberly Atkins store Jill wine banks Barb McQuaid and me Joyce Vance. Today we'll be discussing the announcement by New Mexico prosecutors that they'll charge actor Alec Baldwin and others with involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with a shooting death that occurred on the streets. The Supreme Court's announcement that it's unable to determine who leaked the opinion in the abortion case dogs before it was final. We'll also discuss the latest on a lawsuit filed by Tesla shareholders against Elon Musk and as always we look forward to answering your questions at the end of the show. Today I actually wanted to start us off with a conversation based on a question that one of our listeners sent in. And the question was after you do wordle do you do the be and for those of you who have no idea what I've just said. I know that both Jill and I play a game on the New York Times app called wordle almost every day where you have to guess a five letter word and I also play a game called the B where you get seven letters and you have to use them to make lots of different words. I always finish wordle I don't always finish the B sometimes there's just way too many possible combinations but I do really enjoy doing it I feel like it turns my brain on in the morning. I guess if any of y'all do it and do you do it morning or night. I do it at night it is part of my bedtime routine of I set an alarm for 10 p.m. Which is my first clue that I have to stop eating and start relaxing. Although it's also my clue that I start working because I'm a night owl and I'm better at 11 o'clock at night to two or three in the morning than I am during the day. So that's part of it but when I do finally say it's time for bed. I do wordle and that is my okay now you're turning off your brain. Well you start if you're right you're turning on your brain it's very good for keeping your brain active and then I do start B and then during the day I will go back to the spelling B. I love that game because you get these random words arranged around a like a beehive and with those seven letters you can make five letter words and it's amazing how many you can't think of. And then when you look at the list the next day that they put up it's like oh that was so obvious how did I miss that. And I really I enjoy that those are my nighttime routines for going to bed. They are really fun. Do you do it Kim? I do wordle in the morning really when my husband does so I was at first I was very anti-wordle because I was annoyed at everybody putting the scores on their Twitter like I was just like nobody cares nobody cares about your wordle score. Then my husband would do it like every single morning and he would send it to me so I don't post mine but we send them to each other so we have a light gentle competition about who can get one in two guesses this week which I was pretty proud of I must say but I do too. He's usually much better at it than me I also had one day that it took me all six to get it so but yeah I do it in the morning what about you Barb. Well I would probably do it in the evening except for the fact I do wordle usually in the evening when it comes out at midnight. For the spelling bee I have to do it in the morning my husband and I raced to be the first one to do it because we only we share one subscription and you can't clear it. And so whoever gets it first like it shows up on our phone so whenever I tap it to start it up I'm so thrilled when it says you know it's fresh like nobody's found any words I guess I get to go first. But so often I open it and he's already a genius he's really good at it so not only has he found some of the words he found all the words I boo done for the day. But sometimes what's best is when we do it back and forth because as you say Jill sometimes they're obvious words that you miss but if you're doing it with someone else they find them and said together we can do it pretty well but you know a lot of times I know he's in the other room doing it and I jump on and try and beat him to it. They're both really fun. I hope our listeners will also send us their stories of whether they do it because Barb I honestly had not thought of that Bob and I do it separately it would be so much fun to do the bee together. I can't get my husband interested in these word games he won't do them and he's very good at it so it's really too bad. I'd like to hear from people about posting scores because I got criticized for posting scores and then I got people saying oh please come on join us you have to post your score and I thought what the heck. And so I'm back to posting my scores and interacting with people about whether it's a tough day or an easy day or celebrating because like you I this week got one in two. I think it's maybe the first or second time that I've gotten it into instead of in mostly four or five and sometimes six and very rarely but sometimes not at all. I enjoy seeing your scores Jill makes me smile. I do I love that you and Stephanie rule both post your scores and I like to sing it. So it's been yet another busy news week including the news that actor Alec Baldwin is facing criminal charges in the shooting death of cinematographer Helena Hutchins on the set of the film Rust near Santa Fe, New Mexico in 2021. Was the one who shot around on the set the one that killed Hutchins and the film's armor Hannah Gutierrez read is the one who loaded the gun and was responsible for the weapons on the set. And she'll also be charged each each of them face two counts of involuntary manslaughter. I have so many questions for you prosecutors since I heard the news of this I want to get right to it Jill help us understand the nature of these charges the charges that they face and what penalties they face. It's so interesting but what's even more interesting to me and so I'll answer your question but first I want to say when we say they will face charges. Normally that means they've been indicted by a grand jury and they are going to trial. This is really where the prosecutors decided to refer charges and it is now going to go before a judge who will decide whether or not to let them bring the charges. So there's still a chance that they can talk their way out of this but the charges that the prosecutor is asking for are both involuntary manslaughter and that means that there has to be some underlying negligence under New Mexico law. It's a fourth degree felony and is punishable by up to 18 months in jail and a $5,000 fine. It also includes a lesser included offense of negligent use of a firearm and the other charge which is involuntary manslaughter in the commission of a lawful act which requires proof that it was more than simple negligence. It's the same punishment of 18 years but it also has a firearm enhancement which could raise the mandatory minimum to five years because a firearm was involved. So that would be pretty serious. There's a third person who was charged I guess would be the correct terminology but who pled to a lesser offense. So we can assume that the assistant director who has already pled is cooperating. So Barb we talk a lot on this podcast about the concept of intent and I think a lot of our listeners are probably thinking well what about intent you know I think that probably with both of these defendants the intent was to make a movie not to kill someone. So with these charges how does that concept work Barb the concept of intent? Yes Kim and I'm sure everyone agrees that their intent was to make a movie and not to kill someone what they've been charged with is involuntary manslaughter and so that means it was an accident but that they were acting under the intent of under the New Mexico law gross negligence. And what that means is someone failed to exercise the reasonable duty of care in an extraordinary way. In this case you know we don't know all the facts in the public domain and those will matter the investigators have determined what those are but you know I have heard it said that the industry standards are that you check a gun before you hand it to an actor to make sure there's not a live round in it. And so this armorer you know clearly fell down on the job there and did not do what the ordinary standard of care would suggest there. For Alec Baldwin I have read that it is the industry standard to never point a gun at someone. And so even though he says I didn't pull the trigger it doesn't matter because the gun did discharge however it discharged whether his finger was on the trigger or he says he had it in a cocks position. And it snapped back that's why you don't point a gun at another person. And in addition Alec Baldwin isn't just an actor in this movie he was also the producer and so if there was something that he did as the producer that was a failure of the ordinary care that a producer would do under the circumstances for example the armorer was also the property master. Which is perhaps contributed to a distraction of duties and so all of those factual questions will be for a fact finder later which makes me believe that ultimately a judge will allow this case to go forward to Jill's point. All the judge needs to determine is whether there's probable cause. You know I think it's another question whether a jury finds the facts that will satisfy the guilt beyond a reasonable doubt that's necessary in a criminal case. And I also think there's you know an awful lot of discretion at work here by this prosecutor to charge this case and said upon saying that she would pursue charges that it was important to send a message for deterrence that no one is above the law. And also that in the movie making industry people understand that there are serious consequences if you don't follow the proper procedures to ensure that everybody is safe on the set. Yeah I think that's really interesting how the impact that this will have not just in this particular case but on the film industry more broadly and I think that's something that we will be watching in the months and years ahead. You know Joyce Alec Baldwin is not a typical defendant and this is not a typical case and just thinking about this. It occurs to me that normally a lawyer of a defendant would want that defendant to be pretty circumspect to not be making public statements about the case and to really try to stay as mom as possible while potential charges penned. But Alec Baldwin has been out there doing interviews we have you know him see we saw him after the after the scene happened. He's been doing damage control he's even filed lawsuits against other crew members in an effort to reduce his own civil liability. How does this affect the prosecutors in this case and how difficult if at all does it make his the job of his defense attorneys. Yeah you know it's such an interesting situation it took so long there was no suggestion a criminal prosecution was in the works and then sort of poof out of nowhere. This shows up and you know sometimes defendants do something that in the south we colloquially refer to as pissing off the police. And I wonder if there wasn't some sense of that here if Baldwin wasn't in some ways to cavalier about his involvement and at some point there was a feeling that he needed to pay consequences. We don't know that but it's a very unusual situation and as Barb was saying we know what they're what we're reading because this is so early that there's not a lot that's out public but at least for Baldwin's purposes Kim because he's got this really strong public presence all of this stuff would be admissible at trial. It's hearsay it's out of court statements they would presumably be offered at trial to prove the truth of what he's saying but this falls within a well known exception to the hearsay rule and a number of them really at a minimum one for defendants who make out of court statements against their interest. So if there's something that he said that has caught prosecutors attention they'll very likely be able to offer it at trial they may even have video that they can play which is sort of every prosecutors dream. So it's a real interesting dynamic in this case but like Barb says ultimately this comes down to what was in his mind when these events were happening you know there are four basic homicide crimes or at least in the federal system there are there's first and second degree murder and then there's voluntary and involuntary manslaughter and the dividing line between the different crimes is the defendant's state of mind. So when we get down to involuntary manslaughter there's no intent involved no malice involved we're really talking about a form of gross negligence there are a couple of different variations of involuntary manslaughter but here it looks like it would most likely be based on that sort of a gross negligence theory. His public statements are very much to the contrary mostly he's talked about the fact you know his shot his personal sorrow the fact that he thought that they were doing everything right. So this might be the unusual case where his public statements actually help instead of her. That's really interesting. Can I just add the language of the New Mexico statute defines it as producing death commission of a lawful act which might produce death in an unlawful manner or without due caution and circumspection. That's sort of how they define the negligence. You know and we should say that there's also under the statute there's some possibility that if you're mishandling a firearm that that can produce an involuntary manslaughter charge there's this notion of misdemeanor manslaughter which essentially means you're committing a misdemeanor and in the course of the misdemeanor the death takes place. The prosecutor could have one of those theories we don't really know a lot yet. Yeah and Jill you mentioned the firearm enhancement earlier. Talk a little bit more about that because unlike the underlying crime which has an 18 month potential sentence and it could be very likely that in any other case that there may not be a prison time sentence at all. The firearm enhancement comes with a mandatory five year sentence if he's convicted. Why do we have enhancement statutes like that? Why do states have them ones that come with such hefty penalties and do you think it's appropriate in this case that the prosecutor is thinking about charging it? So that's two very different questions Kim and Illinois by the way has a very strict enhancements for a number of crimes if you use a gun. And the reason that that exists is a matter of deterring the use of guns because guns can turn deadly. If you're robbing a bank and you bring a gun in the chances that someone's going to die are much greater than if you brought in a can of mace. And so to deter the use of guns and to prevent death from guns enhancements are added as a way to control the use of guns. Now that's when you're going in to commit a deliberate crime but as you said they were there to make a movie and there are a lot of factual questions. It is reported that Hutchins who is the deceased told him to point the gun at her in a practice round. So that's one question we have. He was handed the gun by the assistant director who's pled guilty and who said cold gun so he didn't know that there was anything in it. And so there are a lot of issues along this line. But in this case I'm not sure it's really appropriate to add a gun enhancement because it wasn't really part of committing a crime. And so it seems to me it's much more appropriate when there's an intentional crime that's being committed and you're trying to stop people as opposed to someone who is making a movie a Western where guns are used. It feels like double counting in a way right? Yeah. The gun itself is part of the crime. Yeah. And you know how I mean prosecutors love to say bad facts make bad law. I think if they do bring that gun charge here it could really rebound on them. The courts could react badly to that. So Barb one of the things that that occurs me about this case is that it really has everything including a special prosecutor in this case. And I thought about this morning I thought about the fact like oh right one of the things Alec Baldwin did that we all know was on Saturday Night Live. He portrayed Donald Trump for years and now literally they both have cases where there are special prosecutors. Why is there a special prosecutor in Santa Fe, New Mexico, Barb handling this case? Very different scenario from the special counsel situation of Jack Smith or even Robert Herr. Just give the case to Jack right? I mean let him have it. Just what he needs. I've got Mar-a-Lago, I've got January 6 and I've got the Rust set. This is a different scenario Kim. This is you know in the special counsel situation where Merrick Garland has appointed special counsel under the federal regulations. It is because he has determined there is either a conflict of interest of investigating his own boss or his own boss's political rival or other extraordinary circumstances. Here in the case of Santa Fe the prosecutor there the elected district attorney I think simply wanted additional help. She said she thought it would move faster more expeditiously more effectively if they brought in one person who could focus solely on this. You know so many district attorney's offices are overworked burden case loads. They're working day and night just to keep their dockets rolling and the idea that someone could clear the decks to handle a case like this I think was not a luxury that the district attorney there had. So what she did is she appointed a retired district attorney who had spent her whole career as a prosecutor in a nearby county and was even the elected prosecutor. Although plot twist in November she was elected to the state house so now she's got a day job so that'll be interesting to see how that plays out. Although maybe now that she has investigated the case she can turn it over to someone else to try. You know what it's like Kim a good example I think is in the case of Derek Chauvin brought by the Minnesota Attorney General's office. Remember they hired that lawyer from private practice named Jerry Blackwell who was you know an excellent trial lawyer and they just wanted someone with a lot of trial experience. Who might be in a really good with juries who could just care focus solely on this case and not have you know to juggle the usual caseload of somebody who works in the office so that's why there's a special prosecutor here. In particular since this will undoubtedly be a very high profile case especially in terms of what they normally see in Santa Fe that makes a lot of sense. Joyce another thing that this case has as Jill mentioned is a potential cooperating witness. What impact do you think that had on the decision to bring charges here. Yes so again we don't know it's it's very intriguing because anytime you see someone who's pleading guilty early you know this little blip goes on in your mind and you're thinking oh could that person be cooperating. And we don't know here this is the person who called that the gun was cold when it was in fact hot. Maybe there was always a thought that they would let that person plead to a lesser charge or maybe that person has additional information about what went on here that gives prosecutors a better chance at convicting in this case. And you know it's I think easy to think that here because based on what's publicly known this is a dicey case this is by no means a case where the judge signs off on it let alone where the prosecution gets a conviction. Prosecutors don't usually do that kind of thing especially in high profile settings so I do have to wonder if this witness didn't offer something that makes the case stronger. Well it'll be dramatic indeed and we will keep an eye on the developments as they come. When the draft opinion of Dobbs leaked it was a big deal and it was an even bigger deal when the final opinion closely resembled that draft. Chief Justice Roberts ordered an investigation the day after the leak and yesterday eight months later we got the report which failed to identify who the leaker was based on a preponderance of the evidence standard of proof. The report has met with derision and mockery and so let's start with you Kim and talk about who did Roberts assign to conduct the investigation and what are her qualifications. So I know we use the term unprecedented way too much but in this case it really fits because rarely I won't say never because there have been leaks out of the Supreme Court before including Roe v. Wade given this weekend's anniversary it's important to know but just everything about this case is so out of the ordinary I've been covering the court since 2006 and just everything about this just blew my mind. And so when you have a leak like this there's really not a go to place for the Supreme Court to go to conduct this kind of investigation so Chief Justice Roberts turned to the marshal of the Supreme Court her name is Gail Curly. Now think about her what her role is is essentially akin to chief of police of the Supreme Court building right so anything security related in the Supreme Court so I as a reporter when I would go cover cases there. There are marshals in there that they're the people who I hand I get a little card from the public information office and I handed to them to say yes I am authorized to go into the court and sit in the press section and watch these oral arguments there they're basically the police of the court. They're tasked in making sure there's not disruptions that the building is secure if anything happens they would investigate it. They're not tasked with conducting some sort of forensic analysis of emails and printers and other things that this kind of investigation involves so as this has really not I don't want to sail her qualifications personal she had and she's only been there since 2021. She's relatively new in this role. So this is just something that probably she nor anybody else had contemplated when she took this job she's not it's not like the FBI it's not like you know Homeland Security and other investigative agencies so this was already at a disadvantage but that being said they didn't turn it over to another agency who does this the FBI or anybody else who is more akin at doing this so they took it on they did the investigation they had Michael Cherdoff the former Homeland Security Secretary kind of you know look it over and he said no there's nothing else I could think they could have done and that was pretty much it. Yeah it's really interesting because her background is certainly not in investigations she certainly qualified for the job of Marshall which if you read the definition of it does not include anything about supervising investigations of this nature. Her background is in the military so bar let's talk about the report it identifies crimes that may have been committed in connection with the leak and so maybe following up on Kim's reference why didn't they use the FBI to investigate possible crimes. Yeah I'm not sure they could have here you know if you look at the diode it's the domestic operations domestic investigations operations guide for the FBI. It says that the FBI can get involved in an investigation only when there is an allegation that a crime has been committed and here you know there's a leak it is certainly a violation of the employment manual the employee handbook of the court. It's certainly unethical but it isn't necessarily a crime. Now they do say it's possible that someone had the motive of leaking it of obstructing justice somehow but that requires a little more speculation I suppose. Maybe someone could make that argument that there's a predication here and now people have signed statements to the Marshall Gill Curly. I suppose if there's a lie in those statements that could be a basis for criminal investigation but we don't know that anybody has lied and so I don't know that they could have gotten the FBI to investigate. I suppose there's also the case if you're Chief Justice Roberts some concern about separation of powers you as the court want to keep it in house and have someone within your own organization. Conducting this investigation as opposed to somebody from a separate branch of government so as to keep your own house in order in your own secret secret. I think a third alternative that might have been better here is what most other organizations do I know universities and corporations will hire an outside law firm to conduct an independent investigation. And that is a way that you can have people who are experienced you know the Marshall sounds like she's an incredible person has done an awful lot of things but not a lot of experience conducting an internal investigation like this. Maybe that would have been a way but either way without a criminal investigation they were missing some of those tools that they could have used like a grand jury subpoena to bring people in under oath and have them testify as opposed to simply saying so did you do it are you the leaker. Nope okay thanks have a good day who's next but I think I think those are probably some of the considerations that were given into who was the right person to conduct this investigation. So let's look at that investigation and talk about the scope and Joyce did it seem to you that it focused on opponents of Dobs I mean the cover note from the Chief Justice said this was no mere misguided attempt at protest. And so you know like who did they interview well let's say that for Kim you just talked about the scope and whether it was focused wrongly. Yeah I mean I think what you're really asking was it biased in its inception right did they have a preconceived notion or did the Chief Justice have a preconceived notion about who was responsible and did he try to conduct an investigation that would prove that it's hard to say for certain I mean frankly I found this report very frustrating to read. It's not an exercise in transparency but you do get some sense that they were in fact looking for disgruntled people I think that they actually go so far as to say that they focused on people who were disgruntled with the decision in Dobs. And that really goes back to Barb's point about the fact that this should have been conducted by someone who is independent and outside of the court. Some of the restrictions on the scope of this investigation that I know Kim is going to talk about are very puzzling to me because when you go into an investigation you are supposed to be figuring out what happened. You're not supposed to walk in and say I think X happened let's prove X and to the extent that that's a plausible reading of this report then all it does is it further damages the public's confidence in this court and that public confidence is I think in an all time low certainly at least in our lifetimes at an all time low. The court didn't do itself any favors here. So Kim that does take us to the key question here of who was interviewed how many people were interviewed were there obvious candidates who should have been interviewed but weren't. So yes so more than 100 employees at the court were interviewed in more than 125 interviews so some of them were brought back in as part of this investigation. Now I've read the I've read this report multiple times and it seems that according to my reading none of those 100 people were the nine justices and it's very hard to tell if the nine justices were involved in this investigation at all them or their family. Well it wouldn't have been their family members because they're only talking about employees here. Nobody who is outside of the court which I found very interesting. It gets to the point about trust. So on the one hand there is a case to be made that look the Supreme Court justices are the people who believe deeply in this institution and that the rules should be followed and that its integrity should be protected and so you know if there's no need to question a Supreme Court justice and in a case like this of course they wouldn't do something like leak in opinion. I would think maybe 10, 12 years ago that might be the case. I think especially when it comes to public transparency and public trust right now I don't think that that was the right way to go. I think that at the very least it should have spelled out clearly the role that the justices played in this investigation whether they were interviewed or not and that's one way I was really disappointed in this report. To get back to Joyce's point about who was interviewed and you know whether the point about people they paid certain attention to people who may have been disgruntled or upset by this opinion. I was struck by just in the first paragraph in this that as you said Jill the leak of the draft opinion the leak was no misguided attempt at protest. I had that to me. At protest to me there was an inference of one side or another because if it was a protest then it was coming from one side of the court. And I didn't I just thought John Roberts is a very thoughtful man and he chooses his words very carefully and when I saw that I thought huh it felt to me like there was a presumption that it came from one side of the ideal logical spectrum of that court. So right away I was just like oh boy here we go. And so these are the you know maybe that was inadvertent I don't know but these are little things to me that's just like look the people on this court know what the public is struggling with them right now they know what the job's decision did to this nation. And so for them to put out a report that's worded in that way that has this idea that maybe somebody who is angry about jobs and stuff we don't know it could have been somebody who wanted to hold the conservatives to the police. So they wanted to be a conservative to their positions so that they wouldn't change them once this became public we don't know. So these are all things that I have big problems with. Hey Kim can I ask you a question. Yes can ask you a question because I read that first part you know of what I assume is John Roberts cover letter he didn't sign in but I think it's reasonable to assume that that's him. And then the second time I went back and read it I thought well he's saying it's no mere protest is he implying that maybe it was an effort to consolidate votes on the Republican side. And I feel like the whole report is permeated with that uncertainty. I'm stunned that no one has you know gotten out of the court an official statement about whether the justices themselves were questioned or not because that's super equivocal in the report. You know they actually go to the lengths of citing the judicial canons of ethics which may be implies that they talk to the justices. But then like you say there's this real disconnect where just the sort of questions that they ask suggest it's not a justice. And you know you've got to really think here you're a moron if you are a law clerk and you are willing to compromise your entire career to get a draft of an opinion out a couple of weeks early right. The only people here who can leak within PUNITY are the justices. So if you were doing barbs independent outside investigation they'd be a very logical place to ask questions. The court's going to have to issue a statement here. So I agree with you and I let me just say I agree but I think there are some serious clues in how this is written that suggest that no justice and no justice is spouse were interviewed and that's despite two times. Do you know just as a spouse was interviewed because they're limited to employees. Yes and when they say employees or personnel which are the two words they use in general they also go on to say that anybody who was interviewed could have been fired. Well you can't fire a justice. So to me that was like saying you can't know justice was in the group. I agree with you that that's there but it's equivocal because judges are employees of the court. You know if you're a judge and you're asked where do you work I'm employed by the Supreme Court or whatever your court is. That one comment though about being fired. I agree but justices can be asked to resign. That was in terms of who was interviewed. What I said was it's unclear whether any of the justices were even involved. It doesn't have to be through an interview. That's what spoke volumes to me. I mean Justice Roberts could have gone to all of the other justices and said okay it's just us who did it. Did you do it? Yep. I'm agreeing with Jill on this one. I think it's obvious that they did not interview the justices and that if they had they'd say so. The failure to speak means well we don't want to flag it. We want to advertise it but we're not going to say so. But the fact that we're engaging in this exercise is a shame because it should have been clear enough that that should have been clear for all the American people. It's just more evidence that this court is not fully committed to transparency which is the whole heart of the problem. Right and it's certainly a reflection on the leadership provided by the Chief Justice I'm afraid. So let's look at the review by Chertoff which has been mentioned. What's his background? It's more than that he was Secretary of Homeland Security. Did it help at all to persuade you? Barb. Yeah it's kind of funny isn't it? We've got this incredible marshal on our staff. We have entrusted her to do this whole investigation and what she says goes. And then in the end oh and by the way we had this other guy look over her shoulder and say yes she did a good job. And what is that? So I thought that was kind of weird but I suppose it was like getting a second opinion right. Knowing that there would be critics like us who would say this is sort of unsatisfactory that there is no resolution to this that perhaps we ought to have a second opinion take a look at this. But you know Michael Chertoff is someone who has been in government for his whole career. He was a U.S. attorney. He worked in the criminal division in the Justice Department. He was a federal judge. He was Secretary of Homeland Security and now he runs something called the Chertoff group which was one of these security firms. So he does have really impeccable qualifications I think to look at this. And so he issues a one or two pager. This short very short little document that says yeah I looked at it looks pretty good to me. Can't think of anything else she should have done. Here are a couple of recommendations like be more careful with those documents folks. The end. And I'm sure he cleared like $100,000 to write this thing. But in their defense I suppose they are bringing in somebody with some very strong bona fides to review and give this second opinion I suppose in hopes of giving the public some assurance that this was not you know just some whitewash job that he's putting his name on it and saying that I reviewed everything she did and I agree that she did all she could do and this result was inevitable. Yes spoiler alert it was just a whitewash right given her background and given his background and given your comment that maybe an independent law firm should have been doing it. Why wasn't his firm hired to do the investigation not just to sort of yeah second guess it. So now as I said this this document has been subject of mockery and derision. So I'm going to ask each of you two questions. First question is what made you laugh in the report. So Joyce you go first. So absolutely nothing. I thought that this was just such a gloomy experience to read this you know. I've spent so much time as an appellate lawyer I appreciate how important it is for people to have confidence in the courts. That's not always easy because courts are going to rule against you part of the time or do things that you don't like. And the fact that the court did nothing whatsoever to restore public confidence through this report I thought was super depressing. And what about you Kim. Well I mean I just thought so much of it was laughable like the fact that I mean you know instead of the Keystone cops I kind of called it. Keystone CSI like we tried to we check the chips of the printers that were. You know in remote locations and we could not retrieve the data. We checked the fingerprints that could have been found on this document and we didn't really got no info. It was just so it they were doing this you know forensic analysis that turned up absolutely nothing. And another part that stood out to me is the part that said the interviews provided very few leads concern concerning who may have publicly disclosed the document. Very few of the individuals interviewed were willing to speculate on how the disclosure could have occurred or who might have been involved. So wait a minute this whole point is that in the Supreme Court you're not supposed to snitch right. And so then they went and asked people are you going to snitch and then they didn't snitch and they put that in a report like what. Like of course they're not going to tell on each other. You know and then it's also the part about how some of the clerks had to amend their affidavits because they didn't think that it was wrong to. You know talk to their spouses about their work once this once this leak happened I just thought about my like who would not go home after having the craziest work day ever and tell your spouse Oh my God. This was the craziest work day ever and they didn't think that that was against the rules and the fact that there are basically no rules. There were no rules governing how to keep these deliberations completely and solidly secret. It's just it was such a mess that I literally chuckled my way through I agree with choice that this is deadly serious but I chuckled my way through this whole report because it's just so laughable. And what about you Barb. Yeah you know I don't know where they laughed either because I do think it's it's pretty sad but I had just the opposite reaction to the spouse of references to Kim which was I can't believe all these people are talking to their spouse. No kidding right. You know my husband and I have worked in the US Attorney's office on separate grand jury matters for our whole careers. There was a time when he was out of the Detroit office there's a time now I'm out of the Detroit House and we do not talk about cases. I do agree Kim that it's likely that they're saying this crazy thing happened today and I was interviewed and those kinds of things sure I mean that's that is a crazy day but in terms of talking about the case you know that wow this really important opinion is coming down and we're about to reverse 50 years of precedent of Roe versus Wade I would expect to keep that confidence and the idea that they're all talking about it with their spouses it really makes me think twice about what Clarence Thomas and his wife Jenny are talking about. That's for sure. Well we don't know the clerk is not a prosecutor right a clerk could they could have just realized they're about to sign an affidavit that says if this is a lie you can be prosecuted. And so I would too say okay I may have gone home and told my husband I had the craziest day and you're going to see why. And feel fearful that that might lead to my prosecution but they're not yeah I think that this is a little different. So anything else that stood out to you about this report that you want to mention to our audience. So I think it's sort of stunning that the court thought that this would satisfy the American public right and it I think it highlights what we've been talking about but but it goes a little bit beyond the lack of public confidence and it suggests that perhaps there's a little bit of the thought ivory tower syndrome going on over at the court and that they're very out of touch with how savvy the public is and how carefully the public is watching them. I'll say one other thing and be a little bit of a contrarian Joyce have you ever conducted a leak investigation. It's it's not easy. I can't tell you Barb. I will tell you that Bob at one point notoriously was asked by somebody in public about a case that I was working on when I was a line prosecutor and he just sort of looked Florida and he's like Joyce is working on that. And the reporters at the local papers called me and said your husband just paid you the nicest compliment because he didn't know because we never talk about any. No and I expect to but on the leak thing. There was a time when there was a grand jury leak in a case we were working on in my former office and we wanted to get to the bottom of it. We are not going to tolerate leaks. So we did an inquiry within the office and we did not find anybody who did it. I was satisfied it didn't actually come out of the office that it probably came from somewhere else probably a witness which is more likely because they are permitted to talk. But it made me realize just how hard it is to conduct one of these because people aren't going to confess to you. It would be career suicide to say I'm the one who did this. And you know with the processes they had at the court which I think is one thing that is a useful revelation here is just how sloppy they are. They print out these copies and they're just lying around all over the place. Everybody gets access to them. Especially when they're working from home. I think it would have been very easy for someone to have printed it left it and a household worker or a family member to have gotten a hold of this thing. Who knows but I think it is more difficult perhaps than people realize especially when you don't have tight controls over your documents to solve a leak case. And when you don't have criminal investigators pursuing that investigation. Uh oh this just in breaking news by Greg Stor. Oh my gosh. Supreme Court Marshall says she did question the justices. Oh. Oh wow. Uh oh. Uh oh. Proof that you don't talk to your husband about what? I know. I know. He did not tell me that. It's three minutes ago breaking news three minutes ago. Three minutes ago. A trial began this week in San Francisco in a case brought by investors against Elon Musk. This case has nothing to do with his ownership of Twitter though. This case is about his role as CEO of Tesla. The electric car company. Um and Twitter does have a role in this case however. Um Chil can you tell us about this lawsuit? I mean why are Tesla investors suing Elon Musk? What's their claim? They are claiming they lost billions of dollars because of a tweet that he posted before he owned Twitter. He posted that he was going to take Tesla private at $420 a share and that funding was secured. That was not correct and it was reckless to have said it. And in fact the judges basically said, uh yeah it's basically you got summary judgment on the fact that it was false and that it was reckless. Um now what they have to prove is that they lost money because of that tweet. And that's going to be a hard thing to do but I think there's probably pretty much evidence that the price of the stock was altered by that statement. It went up and then it crashed and when it proved untrue it just went down. Some of them lost money on options that went underwater because they had bought options either to buy at a certain price which was no longer going to be valid. Or they had promised to sell at a certain price and that was going to be a loss for them as well. So that's what the case is all about. As I mentioned that Elon Musk making a reckless comment on Twitter causing disastrous results. Wow, unusual. Um so Kim there was also already a lawsuit brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission against Elon Musk for this same statement. What is the SEC and what happened in that lawsuit and why doesn't that resolve all of this? So the SEC is an independent federal agency that is tasked with enforcing securities, federal securities laws particularly laws that protect against the state. That protect against securities market manipulation and they bring both civil actions in court as well as administrative enforcement actions against both companies and individuals that may violate these laws. So you're right. Musk was sued by the SEC and they accused him of knowingly making false and misleading statements and that case was settled and in that settlement must be read to step down as Tesla's chairman. But he remained the CEO and he also paid $2 million in a penalty and agreed to some compliance measures. But the one thing he did not do is admit or deny the allegations made against him in that. So that's what leads leads us to this current suit. Interesting. Joyce do you think that if there's a big jury verdict against Elon Musk in the Tesla case, it would teach him a lesson about how he should conduct himself on Twitter either as a user or or as its owner. So Barbara you asking me if the conventional wisdom applies to Elon Musk? Because I think right. That's like it's a conventional wisdom thing that the threat of a large jury verdict or an actual jury verdict will deter somebody from continuing to engage in misconduct and maybe hopefully will deter others to. And it's a tough call with Musk. Although he has lost a lot of money, he's still extremely wealthy and it may be that he will simply view that as a cost of doing business or perhaps his condition is now changed. And maybe he will take it more seriously. But ultimately it looks to me like it's really the SEC investigation that you and Kim talked about that's gotten under his skin a little bit more. He's actually back in court challenging the terms of the settlement there because he has to have his public statements reviewed by a lawyer. So he can't tweet about Tesla without having a lawyer look at it. That seems to really bother him perhaps even more than a large money judgment would. Well, then let me ask you the opposite question. What happens if he wins in this case? If he prevails against the Tesla investors, what effect could that have on Elon Musk? You know, it's like the little kid who gets away with doing something right? The little kid who comes up with the story. Oh no, Mommy. It wasn't me that was turning up the thermostat. You know, it was a ghost. It was the cold wind that turned up the thermostat. I think that that would be Elon Musk unleashed. So every week our listeners send us thought-provoking interesting questions that help to make this our favorite part of the podcast. Please email your questions for us to Sisters-in-law at politicon.com or tweet using hashtag Sisters-in-law. If we don't get to your questions during the show, keep an eye on our Twitter feeds throughout the week because we'll answer as many of your questions as we can there. But this week we have some really great questions. Jill, this first one has definitely got your name on it. It's from Janet and she says, I'd like to volunteer for worthwhile causes. How can I get involved in advancing the Equal Rights Amendment? I am so glad that Janet asked that question because there's a lot you can do and next week has a lot of anniversaries that involve the Equal Rights Amendment. So here's some of the things and I will post this on our show notes so that you can get the exact links. But first of all, you can contact your congressional representatives and senators and ask them to take action to have a resolution that says that the amendment is the law of the land. That no further action is necessary. And even if your congressman is a blue state person, they still need your support. You can write to the White House. You can write letters to the editor or write an opinion piece and share them widely. You can join groups that are supporting the Equal Rights Amendment such as vote equality, the ERA coalition. Now the AAUW, Zanta and the League of Women Voters. And then you can ask your state legislatures to pass resolutions. And there's one in Illinois right now filed by Representative Jennifer Gong Gershowitz. It affirms the ERA and asks the various branches of the national government to take action to do the same. So I'll post that on our show notes. Second question, Kim, I think is for you. Everyone is talking about the freshman member of Congress from New York, George Santos or whatever the heck his name is. What do you expect will happen to him? Can he be removed from the House? Could there be a do over vote in New York? Are we going to be stuck with him for a while? Yeah, we actually got a lot of questions about that, particularly about what voters who voted for him and feel duped can do. And the answer is, look, there's no recall mechanism for federal elections. So that is unlikely to happen. Really, the only recourse for voters is to, if he runs for re-election vote in that election and make your opinion known. Now, what happens within the Republican caucus is different. There are rules within that. He's been seated on committees, but Kevin McCarthy has hinted that it's unlikely that he'll get a security clearance. For example, but whatever happens to him, what have to be under the rules of the House as per the Republican caucus. And Kevin McCarthy has not indicated any willingness given his very slim majority that that is going to happen. So I think if George Santos wants to stay in all likelihood, he will stay at least for these two years. Mm-mm. Barb, last question is for you, and this is such an interesting one as long as we're on the subject of Kevin McCarthy and Congress. This is a very interesting house that seems intent on doing as much as it can do to help out the former president. And Sue asks whether it would be possible for them to expunge an impeachment of a president? Yeah, I think technically no, right? The Constitution describes what impeachment is. It doesn't say anything about expungement of an impeachment. And so I think technically no, but it probably doesn't stop Congress from passing some sort of resolution that says so. He was never convicted, and so you don't really need to expunge an accusation, so it doesn't have any effect. But I imagine as a PR stunt, I could imagine this Congress passing some sort of resolution to expunge because how do you ever challenge it? How could you, I mean, I'm sure there'll be members of the Democratic Party who challenged it, and then maybe the next time they take the house, they will pass a resolution to undo the expungement. But, Jill, do you have thoughts on this? You've been, you're an impeachment guru. I know, I guess, well, the one thing is had he been convicted, he could not be pardoned. That is in the presidential, in the Constitution, except in matters of impeachment comma. Yeah, so he could not be pardoned. And I agree with you, they could, it would be considered a special legislation, almost like a, you know, a rich, specifically targeting a person. And that is never allowed. I had that problem when I was General Counsel of the Army, and there was a need to help, actually, a soldier who had been injured. And it was very difficult to pass specific legislation to help a specific person. So I think you're right. But the political clown show will probably try to do something like that.

Y'all, Bob wants to make fried chicken. And he was, you know, he wanted to like put it in a really deep pan, you know, like a soup pot and fry it. And I said, honey, I don't think that that's how Kim did it. So I texted Kim and I was like, tell me what pan you use to fried chicken in. And she graciously sent a photo. So we're all ready. But you know, I'm a good Jewish girl. I cannot fried chicken like I don't deep fry. But I'm hoping that Bob can. His dad used to make fabulous fried chicken. And he used to make fabulous fried okra. So I'm hoping it's kinetic and Bob can do it. Yeah, it's not a deep fry. It's a, like I said, I use a cast iron pan. So you put it in and you turn it. It's not deep frying. It's just frying. Yeah, he thought it was going to like go in some big thing full of oil that was going to make a huge mess in my kitchen. And top of it at first will be outside of the oil. That's okay. You turn it. It's okay. He got it. Thank you, Kim. Kim tips from Kim. Everyone needs them. It's a new podcast. Hashtag sisters-in-law cookbook. I'm just saying. That would be so much fun. We could get a message to send in recipes. Jill, don't you have a recipe for cauliflower soup? It's one head of cauliflower that you core, break up into flour, ets. You put it in four cups of boiling water with two teaspoons of salt. You boil it for about five minutes and it gets soft. And then you put all the cauliflower in your blender. Fill it halfway up with the water that you boiled it in and blend it. And you can add salt, pepper, butter, or olive oil or nothing. And that's it. It's just, and you can make it, I don't leave it pureed. I leave it with a little chunkiness in it. And it is just- So no broth, no other ingredients needed. Just the broth that you cook it in. So it's like when you have your blender filled this high, you fill it halfway with the water. Sometimes you need to add more. It depends on the texture of the cauliflower. I added a little more than half this time. And it was thick and perfect. It was delicious."
