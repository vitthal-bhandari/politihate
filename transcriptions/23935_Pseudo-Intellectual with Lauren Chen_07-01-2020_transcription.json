    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back. We've all been there. We're watching a new show with some friends or maybe some family members and it seems really good. It's got a well written story, good actors, but then bam. Boobs. What? Yep, that's right. Boobs. And oh yeah, it's awkward. You were not prepared for this when you recommended watching this show with your new roommates or your overprotective parents. You try to just ignore the nudity like it's no big deal, super casual, whatever, but oh no. The show has now descended into a full on uncomfortably long and explicit sex scene, so now you're just kinda watching actors' kunoodle with the fam bam. Cool, cool. That's right, today we're going to be discussing nudity in media and whether it can be empowering or exploitative or heck maybe even feminist. Who knows? Well, we'll get to the bottom of it together, but first I have a quick message from our awesome sponsor, Candid. Big news everyone, yep, it's finally happening.

And if you haven't checked it out yet, I recommend you do. I liked it quite a bit. And if you're someone who enjoys fantasy and guys with big swords killing monsters, then you might like it too. But something that I did notice about the show, which is kind of hard not to, is that there is a fair amount of nudity on it. And nudity, to me it's not enough to ruin a show, but at the same time, I usually don't like it. I think nudity can have a place in certain stories, but most of the time now when there's nudity in a show or movie, it probably doesn't actually need to be there. It doesn't serve the story in any way. It's just there. There are boobs because people like boobs. And nudity is so overused now that when there actually is a moment where nudity could be used for a type of shocking effect or to underscore something important happening, I feel like audiences have just become so desensitized to it that instead it's just like, yep, there's more nudity. Plus I do travel quite a bit and nudity can really make it hard to watch certain shows on planes without feeling like a total creeper. So yeah, those are my general feelings toward nudity in media. But what I want to talk about in this video are the feminist feelings toward nudity in media. Because if you pay any attention toward feminist activism, which if you're watching this channel, there's a good chance that you do, you'll know that a fair amount of feminist activism contains nudity. Body positivity activists love nudity. There's the free the nipple activists, the slut walk activists, the sex positive activists. There are just a lot of feminist activists out there who are like, you know what would make this activism even better? Being naked. So with all of that supposedly feminist approved nudity going on, you would think that when it comes to nudity like there is in the Witcher, feminists would be like, sounds good guys. But no, actually. Although the issue of nudity in film and TV is something feminists have been discussing for a while, when it comes to the nudity on the Witcher specifically, it seems like pretty much all the critics I've read were not impressed with it. And as an example of that, we have the article, How Not to Use Nudity for TV from the Mary Sue. In it, Jessica Mason writes that quote, There is nothing wrong with nudity. Let's be clear. Bodies are great and not shameful, but when a show uses women's naked bodies as mere decoration and simply for puree al titillation, that's bad. Especially when this tendency makes women feel forced into being naked. This objectification is also annoying because there are infinite ways to make a show adult and impressive without using sex as set design. Okay, so there are a couple things to unpack there. The first thing I want to address is the idea that the actors who participate in these nude scenes, particularly the women, may be doing so without really feeling comfortable with it. At the end of the day, I think it's important to realize that these actresses are adults capable of making their own decisions. And when actresses do do nude scenes, it usually is because there's some either financial or career incentive to do so. I don't want to make it seem like these actresses who I mean are often millionaires are being taken advantage of per se. But at the same time, I also don't think it should surprise anyone that these progressive Hollywood virtue signlors are also huge creeps and hypocrites. Recently, two different actresses have spoken out about not really being comfortable with the nude scenes that were expected of them on their shows. First off, as Global News reports, quote, a new report is offering insight into why actor Ruth Wilson abruptly left the television drama The Affair in summer 2018. According to a story from The Hollywood Reporter published on Monday, sources claim Wilson objected to filming frequent nude scenes on the show, including some situations in which those sources say it seemed unnecessary for her to be naked. In the new THR report, it is alleged that showrunner Sarah Treem praised the appearance of female actors, including Wilson, in a way that was perceived as inappropriate. Treem would allegedly say things like, you look beautiful or everyone is waiting for you, which a source told THR sounded like things you would think would be coming out of a man's mouth from the 1950s. The environment was very toxic. Treem would also allegedly try to control actors to get naked even if they were uncomfortable or not contractually obligated to. I am not familiar with either of that show or that actress, but Amelia Clark, who played Daenerys on Game of Thrones, has also spoken candidly and not too fondly about her experiences with nude scenes. As the national post wrote a few months ago, quote, I took the job and then they sent me the scripts and I was reading them and I was like, Oh, there's the catch, said Clark. But I'd come fresh from drama school and I approached it as a job. If it's in the script, then it's clearly needed. This is what this is and I'm going to make sense of it and that's what I'm going to do and everything's going to be cool. I've never been on a film set like this before and I'm now on a film set completely naked with all of these people and I don't know what I meant to do and I don't know what's expected of me and I don't know what you want and I don't know what I want. Regardless of their being nudity or not, I would have spent that first season thinking I'm not worthy of requiring anything. I'm not worthy of needing anything at all, she said. Since her time on Game of Thrones, Clark says she's grown to become a lot more savvy in making it clear what she's comfortable with along with the level of nudity that she believes is needed in a scene. I've had fights on set before where I'm like, no, the sheet stays up and they're like, you don't want to disappoint your Game of Thrones fans and I'm like, F you. So clearly there are some actresses out there who aren't exactly happy with how they were treated in regard to nudity, but to be fair, other actresses like Jennifer Lawrence who appeared nude in the film Red Sparrow have spoken positively of their experiences. By the way, I'm sure a bunch of you have all of a sudden become very interested in the film Red Sparrow. They really do an amazing job of clearing out the set and I was perfectly comfortable and afterwards I felt empowered. I still feel empowered and I can actually watch that scene. Tell me what you mean by empowered. I had just had a lot of insecurities when it came to sexuality and nudity and my body and I've just been carrying them around for years and I thought, you know, when I read the script I loved it so much and I thought if I don't do it and if I say no and I miss out on a chance of working with Francis again and doing this movie that I love, it's almost like all of these insecurities and fears win and so I felt like I got something back. This I'm Okay with the nudity mentality also seems to be the case for Anya Chilatra, the actress who plays Yennefer on the Witcher who, let's say, has the denarish share of nudity in the series. According to Inquisitor, quote, Anya Chilatra refused to use a body double for nude scenes even though one was offered. During season one of The Witcher, Yennefer starts off as a cripple but using a transformation is healed at a very high cost. This transformation included some partial nudity while other scenes of this kind mainly involved sex. The actor revealed that a body double, Flora, was available to use during these scenes but with the exception of the very first scene involving Yennefer, Chilatra decided not to use the body double on offer. I had a body double for the sex scenes and she was always there, Chilatra said. But I didn't. I only used her for the first sex scene because I realized very quickly in that first sex scene that actually I didn't feel comfortable anyone else portraying Yennefer because it's still acting, isn't it? While there is some obvious nudity involved with this character, Chilatra insists that the scenes definitely needed it in order to enhance the storyline. The only things that I had to get nude for were the scenes, the transformation scene, and other scenes which actually really did develop the story. Ultimately, the fact that these actors who appear nude on screen are real people and not just avatars that exist to appear as these characters adds another layer of complexity to the question of whether nudity in media is exploitative or empowering. And really, I don't have any answers here aside to hope that if any actors are doing nudity, regardless of their gender, that they're doing it because they want to as artists. And I guess I would also like to remind everybody that I may not be some intersectional feminist or whatever, but at the very least, I've never coerced anyone working for me to appear naked even though they didn't really want to. So I guess in your face as Hollywood, you rapey hypocritical pieces of garbage. And before we go any further, here is a quick message from Daily Harvest.

But anyway, back to the Mary Sue article, because as that author said apparently, quote, bodies are great and not shameful, but when a show uses women's naked bodies as mere decoration and simply for puree-al titillation, that's bad. Now at first glance, it kind of seems like this author shares a similar view about nudity in shows that I do, which is that the gratuitous nudity we see so often on TV now is getting tiresome. And that doesn't really make sense because that opinion of nudity, my opinion of nudity, is frankly, not a very feminist or sex positive one. The idea that decoration or titillation aren't valid enough reasons to have nudity in and of themselves is another area where the authoritarian feminists are, I think, accidentally finding themselves on the same side as the Christian Puritans. The notion that nudity or sex scenes can only be featured when they mean something, when you think about it, does fly in the face of the idea of free love. In a society where nudity, and in particular the female body is completely normalized, then you wouldn't need a reason to include it in the story any more than you would need a reason to include a hat or a sweater or a fully closed woman. The idea that sex and nudity are a bit too ubiquitous isn't something you hear feminists complain a lot about nowadays, but the reason we're hearing it now in regard to the witcher, and you guys can disagree with me if you want, but I'm pretty sure I'm right, is that the witcher showcases young, attractive women being naked, which is catering to the male gaze and is not feminist. You see, nudity and sex are all great except when it's done to appeal to males. And it's bad, which is also why nudity and sexiness in video games is bad, but nudity done by overweight feminists, people who nobody really wants to see naked, that's feminist. And it's kind of funny, because for the rest of this article, this author really lays into the witcher, like she does not like this series, and she tries to defend her attacking of the series nudity, but it doesn't really make sense because the nudity she criticizes for not being part of the story actually does contribute to the story. Of the ways that the witcher disappointed her, she writes quote, there's no queer characters, it deals with race in really bad ways, and it takes exploitative nudity to a whole new level. In just the first episode, a sorcerer named Stregobor is in hiding out a novella of some kind, and he's created illusions of naked women all over, just because. They serve no purpose other than to show the sky as a creep, but hey, he also arranged for the rape and murder of an innocent princess, so whatever. This nudity the author is referring to is actually one of the places where I thought it was kind of justified in the story. The fact that this mage has randomly decided to conjure up a bunch of naked women does kind of tell you about his character and that he's probably not the best guy. But this writer continues that quote, this goes on and on in the show, and the character that's most victimized is Yennefer, who is constantly naked for no reason except for when she's just hanging out at an orgy that has no relevance to the plot. She's naked for some brutal violent scenes too, and it's pretty uncomfortable. Nude bodies can definitely contribute to a story, so can sex. But things get bad when the goal of a show is just to show sex and nudity, and violence, instead of to use those things in service of a story and the characters. That's the definition of gratuitous nudity, and it's annoying that so many series still rely on it. It's also potentially harmful that shows keep doing this, not for the audience, but for the actresses that can be forced or coerced into scenes they're not comfortable with, as Ruth Wilson was, and as Amelia Clark was on Game of Thrones. Again, I would largely agree with what this writer is saying, but what she's failed to do is illustrate why gratuitous nudity is bad in the first place from her feminist and I'm assuming sex-positive lens. Because I mean, sure, I don't like all this nudity, but I'm not someone who's going off about how bodies are beautiful and don't be ashamed of your nudity and all that jazz. No, I fully believe people should be at least a little bit ashamed of their naked bodies, and Hollywood definitely more so than they currently are. I mean, put some clothes on you crazy devils. But the thing is, there's not really a way to say I don't like this nudity because the people who are naked are hot without sounding like a total jealous be-auched, so we're left with this article. And even though I do sympathize with the idea that some actresses might feel pressure to do nude scenes and might even be uncomfortable with them but feel like they have to do them for certain roles, that really doesn't seem to be the case for the actress playing Yennefer based on her interviews. So is this writer willing to attract what she said and the way she's almost made it seem like this series has screen-rape this poor actress? Probably not. And I know it might seem strange for me to take issue with an article criticizing nudity in media when I myself am not a huge fan of nudity in media, but this just seems like another instance of feminism attempting to eat its cake and have it too. Like they like nudity when it's making people feel uncomfortable and used for their activism, but they don't like nudity when it's something audiences and particularly male audiences might actually enjoy. They can try to justify it however they want, but it just seems hypocritical to me. Whereas I personally take the much more consistent, please keep your clothes on at all times because I don't want to see you naked ever approach. And this author pretty much confirms that she's only okay with nudity when it serves an intersectional agenda by signing off with quote, There is a right way and a wrong way to use nudity in television and in film. Women shouldn't be asked to strip down only to be objectified and nudity shouldn't just be women. The power at it, not just male body should be included, but all body types and races. That just seems so controlling and like such a double standard to me. Like the hairy legged overweight woman can choose that she wants to be naked and turn her body into a statement and it's brave and beautiful and empowering and feminist, but this actress getting paid tens or even hundreds of thousands of dollars can't do the same because then it's exploitation? I don't know. Things inconsistent, but as always, I would love to know what you guys think of all this. What do you think of nudity in media? Does it have a place? Is it being overdone lately and should actresses feel exploited or empowered by these roles? Let me know, but that's it for now. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and I'll see you next time."
