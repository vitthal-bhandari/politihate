Brought to you by Chors Light, Mountain Cold Refreshment, Made to Chill. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we start a brand new week, Monday edition Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. We have got a lot to discuss with you throughout the course of this program. Bill Maher, Elon Musk, interesting conversation. We've got another bank failure. I don't know how many people are paying attention to this, but two of the three biggest bank failures in American history have happened in the last six weeks. Bernie Sanders, I can't believe this is real, said he wants to confiscate every money, a piece of additional assets anyone has over $999 million. Justice Alito thinks he knows who leaked the Supreme Court opinion, really interesting conversation that he had with the Wall Street Journal. But I want to start with this. If I had told you in 2010, let's say we could go back in time, Buck. Let's say we go back in time all the way back to 2010, Obama's first administration. If I had told you that every single Democrat in the entire country would believe that men who decide that they want to identify as women should be able to compete and win women's athletics, you would have probably thought that I was crazy. Now, some of you might have been pressure enough, might have been good enough at forecasting predictive models to say this is where we were headed. But remember, at that time, gay marriage wasn't even legal. Obama ran in 2008, opposed to gay marriage. And now here we are 13 years later, and every single week, men are winning women's athletics. And it's important to recognize just how much of dogma this has become that even people like Chuck Todd, but Chuck Todd obviously pale, minuscule in terms of his impact compared to Tim Russard. I believe the man that he replaced, but I do know this. Chuck Todd is a monster sports fan. He understands the difference between men and women and their athletics. But on Meet the Press, the dogma of transgenderism has so taken over this country that even somebody like Chuck Todd is now priming questions on the idea that the concept of men and women is an artificial gender binary. He had Vivek Ramaswami on, and I give credit to Vivek Ramaswami for this. He's been going on as many different shows, left-wing or otherwise as he can. And he aided and abetted, I think, in some way, Don Lemon getting fired because we played the audio for all of you of Don Lemon kind of losing it when he was discussing race relations with Vivek. Well, here is Meet the Press. Vivek Ramaswami is in studio. And look, whatever you want to say about Vivek, he is a highly trained, very well educated man of a science background. He has been involved in biotech companies, and he gets pressed here by Chuck Todd on the idea that there are anything other than men or women. Listen, below the age of 18, I think it's perfectly legitimate to say that we won't allow genital mutilation or chemical castration through puberty blockers. You're calling it that transition. But how do you know it's that? Again, how do you know, are you confident that you know that gender is as binary as you're describing it? Are you confident that it isn't a spectrum? I am. You know this as a scientist? Well, there's two ex chromosomes. If you're a woman, an X and Y, that means there are lots of scientific research out there. There's a lot of scientific research out there that says gender is a spectrum. Chuck, I respectfully disagree. Gender dysphoria for most of our history, all the way through the DSM-5, has been characterized as a mental health disorder. And I don't think it's compassionate to affirm that. I think that's cruelty. You know, they've started to talk more openly now about what's going to be the position on body identity integrity disorder. People who think that they should be able to identify as not only disabled, but they should be able to disable themselves. There are people who very much believe and this is obviously an extreme mental illness. Right? As I say this, it's almost hard to imagine anybody would think this. There are people who think they should have a limb removed. There are people who think they should be paralyzed. That that is who they are as individuals. They identify that way. And we haven't been able to hear from the left any explanation for why that's all that different from somebody who says, you know, I'm actually a boy, remove my breasts and try to create a, you know, fake male genitalia for me. You remember for a while under the Trump administration, they were doing this thing. They were doing this thing where they would say, um, there's no evidence for that, right? Whenever they would talk about something that Trump would assert or if Trump had an opinion about something, the media would just start inserting and everything, you know, without evidence, without evidence. The people who are identifying as women are also doing so without evidence. Growing your hair long and putting lipstick on does not actually make you a woman. It makes you a man with lipstick on and long hair, but even this notion of being able to identify as what does that even really mean? And I think that we're seeing as well how important this is to the project of the left because they keep pushing this at the most in the most extreme ways, including in blue states now where they're creating these sanctuary jurisdictions for adolescents to run away. It is now the law in Washington and I believe also the law in Colorado that if you run away from your parents and you run to one of those states and you claim that you are a, uh, your transgender, there is a delay, if not a block in notification and no one will stand the way of you having a, a transgender, you know, surgery or puberty blockers. They're, they're focused on this on a policy level. And, and I think it's important. The reason I wanted to play that Chuck Todd clip is this is meet the press. So it is supposed to be the most august high end. This is their theory. I mean, not anymore, but right. I get it. But that is the theory. The premise under which Chuck Todd is acting there is now sort of the buy in. You know, if you sit down at a poker table, you have to be able to put a certain amount of money out on the table. You have a buy in the buy in now for anyone in media is to accept the premise that boys and girls, men and women is not an actual gender binary and that there is a long prism in the way that people identify themselves. And Buckwell, I was sitting, I was out in Vegas over the weekend, had a great time. One of my good buddies getting married. Um, congratulations to Todd Furman, uh, who I've worked with for a decade or so in media, sports media, uh, and he and his wife, Nicole, we had an awesome time, but on Sunday, I went out to lunch and I was sitting there with my wife, getting ready to head back. There was probably a 20 year old sitting at the table next to us. He was wearing a protect trans youth t-shirt and he wore still in Las Vegas in a casino, a mask to both walk to the table in between when he was drinking, like wearing a mask, clearly sort of deranged behavior in my mind, right? To still be wearing a mask to be 20 years old, otherwise young and relatively healthy. And he was wearing the protect trans youth t-shirt and I was sitting there thinking the buy in for Democrats every single day becomes crazier. Just think about it. What, what, why would there be a connection between wearing a protect trans youth t-shirt and wearing a mask? Logically, it doesn't even make any sense. It's all about signaling obedience. It's branding what I call the apparatus, but it's, and this is why it was so important for them during COVID. And when we all really saw this, uh, it was important no matter how stupid it was for people to do the dumb things that we all knew were dumb because you weren't doing it to protect yourself or because you even believed it. You were doing it because the good people, Fauci, et cetera, told you to. And so it's a signaling mechanism. And it's the same thing now with this focus on, you know, protecting trans youth or whatever the, the, on the t-shirt. And I would just say, Clay, to your point about the median Choctawd. Yeah. Let's understand that we're just a little ways away here from Choctawd. I mean, what does anyone think a Choctawd segment now? As you point out, it is an august platform that has basically been destroyed, but what would be his position if we were to show him some of the lives of TikTok, gyrating, uh, you know, transgender, um, you know, cross dressers in front of small children for the special drag queen story hours that they keep doing. They keep pushing that this is so important to them. I think most people would never even heard of this till a few moments ago. Choctawd would be required to say that he sees nothing wrong in this and that this is just trying to be more inclusive and he would fall back into the language that all the rest of the commies are supposed to use. What's more likely, Clay, 10 years ago, none of these people would have said that gender was a spectrum. Correct. None of them, right? Not a single one. Isn't it fascinating how if you were a Democrat in the media, 10 years ago, you would have all, you would have all been like, yeah, look, gender is not a spectrum. And somehow they have all transitioned, you could say to uniform 100% belief in this idea that changed so very rapidly based on no evidence whatsoever. Who is the big Democrat out there right now who's on one of these platforms who goes, guys, gender is not a spectrum at all. This is crazy. I mean, you may be able to find one or two, but they're no longer in good standing with the Democrat party. They are now apostates because it is like a religion. And that is what you are seeing happening right now in real time with this and a whole range of issues. The other thing I wonder, Buck is where are we going to be in 10 years? Because that's, that's what really I can't get past. Robert F Kennedy, Jr. to my knowledge is the only Democrat and we can question whether he even really classifies as a Democrat now, who has been willing to come out and say, women should not have to compete against men in women's sports. He's the only one. What are Democrats going to be required to say in a decade? Because whatever you think of Republicans and whatever you think of the right, there's actually a great deal of diversity of thought on a lot of different issues on the right. Democrats now enforce dogma in their party. Left us to in a way that frankly, I don't know has existed in any of our lives and that's scary and it's chilling. But it also makes you wonder, Buck. I mean, Barack Obama in 2010 and every other Democrat when they were in power would have laughed at the idea of what South Park made fun of, right? The macho man Randy Savage concept, which is so well and funny. We might have to play it again on the show. It makes me do need to play it again. But they would have all said, no, that's laughably absurd. Where are we going to be in 10 years? Think about it as crazy. Can I try to answer that by the way? Because I think it's worth it. We come back. That's a heck of a tease. What is next? Buck, tell us where we are headed and where this all goes. Because when I see that 20 year old who was sitting next to me in Las Vegas and the protect trans youth wearing his mask, my thought was what would that individual not be willing to do? Because those two things should be totally unconnected, right? 20 year old wearing a mask and also a protect trans youth shirt. They shouldn't be connected, but that that is the signaling. That is the social virtue necessity to be a left winger now. What's next? Is it in Creek? Buck's going to tell us.

We had just left you with a bit of a cliffhanger a moment ago. Where is it all going with the trans agenda, which as you know, stretches all the way up to Biden himself and the Biden White House. This is not fringe left-wing activists who are pushing all of this alone. This is now a central effort of the Democrat Party. If you're wondering, is there any sense of stepping back from this? Maybe Clay, we could talk about this 12-year-old who got in trouble for wearing a there-only two genders T-shirt in Massachusetts when we come back in a second. But first here, Dylan Mulvaney, who is the Bud Light Destructor, I think, fair to say. Dylan Mulvaney says that any journalist who misgenders him, well, I'll let Dylan say it. Play one. I feel like that should be illegal. I don't know. That's just bad journalism. It should be illegal to refer to. I want everyone to understand. This is someone that major corporations have made a millionaire have made nationally and globally famous. This person thinks it should be a crime to refer to him as a him. Now, we talked with this a moment ago. Where is all of this going? The focus on children here, Clay, is really instructive, I think, about what the next steps are supposed to be because any person who has not yet fallen victim to the mind virus here of wokeness as it pertains to transgenderism understands that the stuff they're doing with the kids at these drag shows just go in the libs of tiktok account, go watch the videos. No sane person could defend this stuff. Why do they keep doing it and why do they keep defending it? It's just a matter of time before they're going to try to pass laws that suggest that parents are engaged in child abuse if they don't gender affirm their child. And so then here's how the system will. And I've already said the other stuff, which is completely true, which is that eventually the left wing activists will say if you're not attracted, like if you're a straight guy who doesn't find Dylan Mulvaney, you know, hot, you're a bigot. That's already started. But the children thing is much more frightening, I think, to people that see what's coming. You're going to have a situation where the system, schools, media, tiktok, whatever, convinces your child that he or she is trans. And if you don't affirm it at home, Clay, as a parent, you're engaged in child abuse. Maybe your child has to be taken from you. That's where this is heading. That is where this is going. I almost feel like the only way to respond to this now is by aggressively applying the same logic to race. I was thinking about this over the weekend as I was sitting next to that, you know, protect trans youth mask wearing 20 year old and in a Las Vegas casino. And obviously that was the way that that person is virtue signaling that's going to be in his mind, attractive to somebody else. So you're the kind of guy who wears masks and wants to protect trans youth. I'm interested in you, right? What if we're all trans racial? Is that the way to destroy identity politics and really blow this thing up? Because no Democrat that I have heard from has been able, no left wing person can justify why agenda is a choice and it's a spectrum, but race is defined and you have to be a particular member of a race. Like if I decided today that I want to be Latino, doesn't everybody have to respect my choice? Well, what would happen if you had a lot of, you know, white kids applying to college who all of a sudden identified as Hispanic or black on their applications in large numbers? Yeah, how do they actually police that as and how do they determine who counts and who does it? I don't think you could. It's a fantastic question. We'll build on that a little bit more. Is this the way to destroy it by just ridiculing it? Increasing number of people out there are trying to save money because inflation's hitting everybody in the pocketbook. You know, one way to save a lot of money for just about everybody is by making a better decision when it comes to your cell phone service. Right now PureTalk has a $30 a month package for unlimited talk text, plenty of fast data. That's an incredible offer right now for everybody trying to save money. This is good old fashioned American company. They'll save you a lot more money than Verizon T-Mobile or AT&T will without the carriage expense that comes as well. They support our veteran CEO as a US veteran himself and you can switch that number in as little as a few minutes by dialing pound two 50 say clay and buck 50% off your first month. Dial pound two five zero say clay and bucks start saving now. Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show. I want to play a couple of different clips. But my wife who is let me give her a little credit to going to graduate next week from Vanderbilt Law School. So I didn't want to mention that she was finishing her law degree because I didn't want to blow it up and I maybe have a little bit early, but she is scheduled to graduate next week, but she just texted me. She's listening. What happens one day if Dylan Mulvaney decides to switch his gender back to he because gender is fluid. She's asking me, does everyone arrested for the crime of misidentifying him? Get out of jail. How do we keep up? Do we get flipped back and forth? I mean, this is pointing out the profound absurdity of this and ultimately Democrats recognize it, Buck, because if you try to apply the same rules of transgenderism to race and you just say, well, you should be able to be transracial. I'm a white guy, but if I want to identify as a Latino or a Latina Latin X, I guess they would say a woman. Why can I identify as a woman, but I can identify as Latin or black or Asian or whatever else, right? I'm a higher sort of Kabuki theater of this at collapses as soon as you start to apply the logic to basically anywhere other than gender. And as we've talked about on this program, Buck, gender is actually far more real than races, right? Because many people out there, they get their DNA analysis and they find out, uh oh, I thought my family was was all, you know, from Italy or I thought my family was all from Africa. And it turns out that that's not true at all. You're Elizabeth Warren and you're just pretending to be something that you aren't. And by the way, she was never really punished for that. She got away with the whole thing. So she's actually, I mean, she managed to elevate herself dramatically from where she would have been in academia all the way up to being not only a senator, but a presidential candidate without that without that X factor of a racial advantage that she created for herself. And Warren would not be a named it. Anybody knows. It's just obvious. It's quite clear. And your point about what we can do about this, I've thought for some time that the only way to end this madness. Now, the Supreme Court, I think in about six weeks or so is going to say that racial preferences in college admissions are unconstitutional, which is really the most obvious thing imaginable. Right? I mean, this is a straightforward a situation as you can find. Looking at somebody and saying, you know, you You are black. This other person is white or this person is Hispanic and this person is, uh, you know, Asian American and I'm going to give one of them something better than the other person. That is the definition of racism. They can try to change it a million in for ways. We all know this, right? But if you want what's going to happen is the private institutions are going to find ways around this. That's why they're dropping SATs. This is why, you know, they, they are already trying to figure out to make it such a holistic process. They're going to turn these universities into like a country club situation who gets in who doesn't, man, whatever we say. How do you know? It's kind of a feeling we get, right? Now the racial makeup of the schools will stay exactly the same, by the way, that so it won't be a quota, but the numbers will all stay the same. I can guarantee you this. Harvard, all these places. Now, how can you deal with this? Well, make them tell you that you don't count to your point about transracialism. You don't count as on what basis yourself identifying on all of these forms. And you know, write an essay about how, you know, you really feel like you've established, you know, your, your, your inuit or your, your Eskimo heritage in high school in a way that's profoundly affected your life. And you were now a Native American, like go with it, right? I mean, just run with it and see what happens. What are they going to do? They're going to say, I mean, only if they try to press you on this one, say, okay, let's look at my 23andMe, right? Find something that you got, you know, I think I'm, I'm like, you know, 2% says 2% African. I got a couple other things in there and low percentages. I think they're might have been wait, you're an African American. I mean, 2% time that I mean, look, I would you're an African American. I mean, I see this is my, like, are they going to say, sorry, you don't qualify because you have to be what you have to be what percentage? I know it's the drop of blood standard. I was making a joke about this recently. My sister got her 23andMe or whatever it is. And I don't know what exact, you know, replica I'll get. I need to get it done again. She was 1% Middle Eastern. So can I start saying, assuming the same thing is true for me, as a Middle Eastern man, I believe you could say as a black man. And if somebody pressed you on it, if somebody pressed you on it, how would you be able to prove if you said, hey, my great, great grandma was, was black? Like, at what it really does point to the absurdity of the diversity and inclusion myth, are they going to give you a blood test to determine whether you qualify as black or not? And if they're doing it based on skin color, there are people who identify as African American who are very light skin. Oh, so it can't just right? It can't 100%. So it can't just be, well, you're too, you know, what, what are they going to do? Right? I mean, how do they actually police this? It's super racist. What's up? It's super racist because they're going to be like, you're not dark skinned enough to classify as being black. And then you're like, well, do you need to hold my picture up next to somebody else who you are counting? I'm just going to say if one this is, it's by that's very Saul Alinsky. This is using the tactics of a linsky against the Alinskyites, because you over your overwhelming the system, you're finding the weaknesses, and then you're basically jamming up the gears. If you had enough people, you know, enough, you know, white and Asian kids applying to college, claim that they actually identify as a an advantageous race, which is the reality of college admissions in America today. I don't know how they would, you know, be able to change or intersift through this. I'm not really sure what would happen. That's the only way. And the reason that it doesn't happen, I think it's one people haven't really thought of it. But also they're afraid of like being shamed, I think, by their peers for gaming the system. The system's already worthy of shame. It's already being gained. It's just being gamed against you if you're one of these individuals. So go for it. I say, let it let it let it all rip. Well, and speaking of game systems, we'll play this 12 year old when we come back, which I think is really, really good and goes to the essence of what kids are being taught. And I give credit to this 12 year old. But first, gaming the system, if you have not heard this, this is South Park, they basically decided that the new greatest women's athlete of all time in a stroke of pure genius was going to sound just like the macho man Randy Savage. So if you have not seen these clips and you want to be entertained, South Park started ridiculing the idea that men could identify as women and become female champions years and years ago. It now has passed the point of satire. This is real life. Listen, as the macho man Randy Savage on and what percentage of our audience buck do you think knows who the macho man Randy Savage is? Maybe I need to even explain that. Oh, well, I mean, I think a lot, but if you know the guys who are our age for sure know who he is. So the macho man Randy Savage 1980s era w w e at the time w w f I think he was the second the second greatest wrestler of his era after Hulk Hogan. You think that's fair? I think that's fair. I think that's fair. Andre the giant fans rolling over in their grave to the Snake Roberts. They're there. They're a lot of a lot of superstars in that era, but macho man and Miss Elizabeth, his wife and manager. By the way, we dressed up as macho man and Miss Elizabeth, my wife and I did a couple of Halloween's ago. Fabulous costume idea by my wife, but listen to this as South Park ridicules what has now become Democrat dogma. If you're a man and you identify as a woman, you're a woman. You're a champion. Listen, Miss Swanson, how does it feel to be competing today? I can't tell you how free I feel. Now that I've started identifying as a woman, now that I can compete as female, I'm ready to smash the other girls. And is it correct? You just started identifying as female two weeks ago. I'm not here to talk about my transition. I'm here to kick some **** Let me tell you something, Dingleberry, David Perry. I'm going to rule up the other women here. And I'm going to smoke them. I am the strongest woman this state has ever seen. I mean, they made this before you had NCAA champion men who were competing against women. So South Park, life imitating art on that when we'll come back into this and we've we've also got to talk. We've got this 12 year old who got sent home from school for his gender's t-shirt. We'll discuss this in a moment. But you know, my friends, the heartbeat of an unborn baby can be heard within five weeks of conception.

state restrictions may apply so bill mar and elan musk had a chat on the bill mar show over the weekend and here we wanted to share with you where they think things stand here on for of course elan doing more i would argue for free speech online than any other single individual right now with twitter being a place where you can actually just say things and not have the entire game rigged bill mar is in somewhat of agreement i think on some of these issues with elan play for we must protect free speech um and free speech only matters it's only relevant when it's someone you don't like saying something of course like because obviously the speech that you like is uh yes it's easy um so it's uh and it's the thing about censorship is that sure for those who would advocate it just remember at some point that will be turned on you everything about the left is premise though on they think that they'll stay in power and therefore double standards won't fall back on them there won't be a downside for them but clay we had mentioned this as well a 12 year old massachusetts public school student here telling the board about the day that he was sent home from school because he wore a shirt that said there are only two genders play clip two i was told that people were complaining about the words on my shirt that my shirt was making some students feel unsafe yes reson a shirt made people feel unsafe i was told that i would need to remove my shirt before i could return to class when i nicely told them that i didn't want to do that they call my father thankfully my dad supported my decisions came to pick me up what did my shirt say five simple words there are only two genders i have been told that my shirt was targeting a protected class who is this protected class are their feelings more important than my rights i don't complain when i see pride flags and diversity posters hung throughout the school do you know why because others have a right to their beliefs just as i do he of course knowing more about free speech clay that apparently the entirety of the democrat media these days which is this to me perfectly buck epitomizes where we are now because think about this the 12 year old is the rebellious one it's not discussed enough all the 1960s during the era of the opposition to the vietnam war and the grow your hair long in the hippie era they were trying to fight against people in positions of power now all of these kids are actually being meek syncofants right but basically going out there and supporting whoever is in a position of power such that a kid who's 12 who wears a t-shirt that says there are only two genders that sent home easy question for all of you out there if the kid shows up in a rainbow flag t-shirt is there any school district in america that would have sent this kid home and said your shirt is inappropriate if you wore like i said when we were out in las vegas a protect trans children t-shirt like the 20 year old sitting next to us in a restaurant was wearing is there any way that that would have caused someone to be sent home of course not this kid is the actual rebel and it is rebellious think about how wild this is it's rebellious to say there are two genders which is among the most clear biological realities in life and let's remember if he had gone into that same school with a t-shirt on that said only women can get pregnant the exact same people would complain they would use that unsafe term right that's oh it makes me feel unsafe because that then creates this bs oh it's about safety and not about suppression of speech and censorship but these are the games that the left plays because they have no standards only double standards as we all know but clay this was uh so the kid obviously he gets it and we can see what's going on i i would just note they want you to say things that are on it's not about even you have to take an opinion you don't agree with now you have to say things that are objectively false to be in good standing this is the root of totalitarianism i know that may sound a little bit like you know hyperbole it's not the beginning of a totalitarian society is the forced embrace of lies all across the board you have to say things you know are not true some people are pushing back on this clay i just i don't even know about this hat tip uh to our team and uh and produce your uh produce your greg for finding this one do you know about this guy ryan web this was this is remarkable there is a white can now he doesn't identify as white anymore to be clear a white councilman in indiana this was the story of the daily mail just a few days ago sparks wait yeah it was just it was just uh it was like two days ago sparks outrage after proclaiming himself a quote lesbian woman of color who is living life as my true self here is a local indiana news report on this play it Delaware county councilman ryan web announced that he now identifies as an indian american woman since that announcement he's received some support but a lot of backlash many calling him childish despicable even calling for things like execution in a statement web gave to itmate he says quote it is unfortunate that i cannot simply be given the same space and respect to explore my identity that so many of those targeting me demand for themselves it's possible i may change my mind down the road the process of identity exploration is complex and oftentimes at the end of our personal journey we end right back where we started web goes on to tell it mate this is just his true authentic self on what basis on what basis can they tell him now clay i'm amazing what's the argument he by the way he also he put a facebook post up where he said i'm excited to bring some diversity to the council until today we didn't have any females of color or lgbtq i a p c plus on the council i i think this is the way you have to attack this because by their own logic this man is a hero as a lesbian indian woman i mean this you should have to say they should have to celebrate this why shouldn't they have to celebrate his his affirmation of his true self on what basis that i i honestly believe that this is what has to happen and by the way on that t-shirt there are only two genders your point change it to anything else in science what if you just started arguing water freezes at 36 degrees right if if if you can get people to denied biological and scientific reality you can get them to believe anything but congratulations that lesbian indian woman true hero ready to unwrap a
