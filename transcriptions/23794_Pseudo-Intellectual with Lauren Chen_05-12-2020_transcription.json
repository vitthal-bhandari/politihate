    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Hey guys, welcome back to the show and thank you so much for tuning in. If it's your first time here, hey, my name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. And as per usual, we have a lot to talk about today. So first off Star Trek Discovery has a new non binary character and it's very modern and very progressive, very brave and a UK court recently ruled that people, children really under 16 years old cannot consent to puberty blockers. Good news there. Next, I'm not so good news. The San Diego Unified School District recently started forcing its teachers to attend white privilege training. We have some excerpts of what they're being taught. It's crazy stuff. And finally, we're going to be finishing off the episode with a little chat about the great reset specifically. Market Watch publication is at the forefront of really just pushing the idea that capitalism must be reformed in light of, I guess, environmentalism and COVID and just everything in their opinion. Before we get to that though, Liam is back on the show. He was gone for a little bit. I saw a lot of conspiracies floating around conan sections that we were fighting. You weren't with just a bunch of things, but you are saying it has been like a month or something like that. It's been a different reason every week, I think that I've been missing. But yeah, we've had some great co-hosts in the internet. And I think a lot of people don't realize that 90% of Liam's work is not on camera. So every episode he still has to upload and do what does that like sales report thing. I don't even know half the stuff you do, which is amazing because it means I'm not having to do it. But yeah, so he's still been working on the show just not. Yeah, I know. We've all done every episode. But yeah, I like to be behind the scenes usually. So that works out for me. And so one of the weeks that you were gone, you were actually hunting with a traditional Native American storyteller. Would you care to Native Canadian? Native Canadian, that's true. Well, it's the continent of North America. Yeah, it is. Yeah, I guess. I don't know. I mean, that's that was an interesting experience. I guess I did tell people I would update them on that. They seemed interested on Twitter. So yeah, we had a little hunting experience with a traditional storyteller. And did he tell you stories? I don't even know what that is. Yeah, actually, he didn't tell me any stories. But it was a good time. I felt like I learned a lot. What was kind of cool too was rather than just hunting because we didn't have much luck, unfortunately. He would go around and show me a little bit of foraging techniques for flora, I guess. So that was kind of cool. Got into go around and looking at what kind of things you could harvest even at this time of year and, you know, at that time, mid-November. So that was a good experience. He did bring back two partridges. So now I've been Googling a partridge recipes and also b how to defethered a partridge. Never done that before. So that's going to be fun. Yes, we got something. Oh, and if you have any partridge recipes, you would like to share a sense of our way. Absolutely. And even yeah, we got I was gifted some moose meat too. So if you have any ideas what to do pair with moose meat, that's a good one as well. Yeah, do share. For sure. All right. So let's get into Star Trek. Okay. So if you're not familiar with the whole Star Trek canon, Star Trek Discovery is a show that's currently being aired on, I think CBS. And it is it's not been very well received among a lot of actual Star Trek fans, you know, people who are watching next generation and fans of the, I guess, original show. It's basically because it's very for lack of a better term woke. I mean, for a long time, people who've watched Star Trek Discovery have said, okay, so this is you can tell they're pushing a political agenda so much so that I actually have no interest in watching Star Trek Discovery, which is too bad because I'm a fan of sci-fi. And you know, if it were for just knowing I would have politics shoved down my throat, I might be interested in it. But recently it was revealed on social media to me since I don't again, watch the show that there is an actually non binary character on Star Trek. So we have some stills here of how that scene played out. This character says I've never felt like a she I would prefer they or them from now on. Then you can see later, they say no, no, no, let them sleep in reference to this character. So it's very modern. Yeah, it's very progressive. I just want to say very laudable. Very laudable. Yeah. So I just want to say I know that Star Trek, like a lot of, I mean, sci-fi shows have has always kind of incorporated politics and morality into the storylines. But I feel like this is just so on the nose. Like you're literally saying I want to use they them pronouns. Like that is such a 2020 specific thing. It's not even exploring the wider questions of what does it mean to be female? It's poor writing. It's like literally, it would be like if if someone on Star Trek also said like, oh yeah, you know, orange men bad in this one guy, you know, it's it's not layered. It's not nuanced. And they literally could have like they got literal aliens on the same ship as them. Yeah, they could have they could have done some kind of easy transition there like just talking with an alien about what it means to be gendered in there. Right. Exactly. So you could like that is literally me thinking about that for 10 seconds. Right. And actually they just came up with like a here's a here's a nail and I have a hammer. Yeah. If you've seen final space, which is an animated series, I quite enjoy. There actually is an alien character who like switches between genders because they're an alien and it's like weird and it's at least using the sci-fi. I don't remember that. It's in the season. It's in season two. You didn't get that far. But anyway, so at least you could kind of utilize the whole sci-fi aspect to help this discussion rather than just I use they then pronouns and also I like the the final still they include their no no no let them sleep. I think to me that really just enforces how for a lot of people this whole pronoun issue is about control. I mean, they want to control how you refer to them when they're not even there or in the room or conscious, which is really just the height of entitlement if you ask me. Yeah, I mean, I guess that's a good point. It also makes her look a little bit lazy, which I like. Yes. They actually according to Star Trek. So we have actually more news about Star Trek. Apparently there's also going to be a trans character in the show from now on before we get to that though. I want to thank our sponsor Headspace and this is actually a product that I'm really excited to talk about because I've been using it for a while and now we're sponsored by them. Pretty cool.

So we have this little press release from the actual Star Trek website and it says Star Trek Discovery introduces first transgender and non-binary characters. I mean, I know there's a lot of people who are going to say like, Oh, this isn't a move for publicity bubble buds. Like you have a press release ready to go on your website and you're saying that this is just organic story writing. I don't think so, but it says CBS I'll access via com CBS's subscription video on demand and live streaming service today announced that season three of Star Trek Discovery will introduce the Star Trek franchise's first non-binary and transgender characters. Furthering the Star Trek universe's ongoing commitment to Jean Ron and Barry's original vision of celebrating diversity and inclusion again, like I'm not going to doubt that Star Trek has always been about diversity and inclusion. If you even look the original series, I know there's there was like an interracial kiss that really made a lot of head. Yeah, I remember that. Yeah. But I don't know, like I feel like there was this focus on just general humanism back then and it's now become more and more political. I mean, like, again, the whole day then, like you said, it's just like nail on the head. It could not be more explicit. It's not a deeper question. It's not something that can be generalized. It's not even something that people outside of like coastal elite culture are going to understand, right? If you show this, this is not a universal thing. If you show this to someone, for example, in China, they're not going to know what you're talking about. And to me, like that's not good fiction if it can't be enjoyed by everybody. For me, one of the things that I don't know, I find myself asking is how do these corporations keep getting away with it? Like this is CBS, I believe in this case, right? But I mean, like the overwhelming majority of large mega corporation, multinational corporations, even they do push this kind of message, at least to American and European audiences. Yeah. Like what, what went wrong with our systems that allowed this to go into place? Like, I don't know, it, oh, seriously, well, I mean, people have started talking about it because I used to be someone who thought, okay, like, ultimately, if your company green is the bottom line, you're not going to keep it. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But we see in Hollywood, I think there are a lot of people where the message is more important. But I think, you know, the people who are investing aren't necessarily the people who are making these shows. So I think there is going to come a time where eventually the people who finance movies are going to say, you know what, you keep losing me money, I'm not going to do it. And all of these like artsy, fartsy social justice progressive types, they're going to be really upset. But you know, that's just the way it is. And I know there are going to be people saying, how can you criticize this show if you don't watch? And it's like, well, maybe that's the problem. Maybe I'm not watching it because of stuff like this. And Star Trek Discovery is not doing well. There's a lot of talk about how it might not even get renewed, you know, for another season, Star Trek franchise as a whole is just in the garbage at the moment. But I mean, this literally might be a publicity stunt in order to save the series. Yeah, which is stupid because you're pandering to the very niche audience you've already cultivated. Like you should be trying to invite new viewers, not circle jerk for the like five people who are already watching your show. I mean, to that end though, I was looking on social media, there are a lot of, you know, the usual suspects who were very happy with this like, Oh, that's amazing. Oh, I have no doubt. Yeah, how many of them actually watch this show? I don't know. But I also actually want to say that I think we need to be careful when we like consume media that we don't kind of get swept up in all of the progressive hype and stop pointing out stuff like this. Because I know after a certain point, you might just say, Oh, well, that's normal. Who cares? It's like, well, that's that's exactly what they're trying to get you to do to shift the over to the window. Right? No, it's it's strange. It's weird. It's hemp acid. And I actually, I'm going to call out some of you right now. And I've been thinking about this for a while. So the haunting of Hill House. Okay, great series. We watched it together, really enjoyed it. The last episode was very, I think it didn't end well. But overall, Yeah, I agree with that. It was a fun series. Yeah. So it's an anthology series. So the second season features new storyline and everything. And it's titled the haunting of fly manner. Now we watched like one episode of that. Yeah, I was bored. I wasn't really interested in. And I ended up watching some spoiler free reviews that said it wasn't good. So I was like, all right, I'll just look at the spoiler filled reviews since I'm not going to watch it anyway. And yeah, apparently it is a essentially like a woke romance. And I said as much on social media. And I had all these people saying, hang on, just because a show has a lesbian relationship doesn't mean it's woke just because a show has this interracial relationship doesn't make it woke. And it's like, well, you need to understand about the haunting of fly matters that it is based on turn of the screw, right? Which is a classic piece of like horror literature. And trust me, it does not involve any of the like the wokeness that the series has, right? So I think what we're seeing now is like, people don't even realize how media is changing because we're just so used to it. And I would for the most part agree just because there's an interracial relationship doesn't make it's woke. I mean, you know, that's what we are. I don't think this is woke. But when you're actually going back and revising stories to insert that, that absolutely is woke. And I was kind of disappointed how few people were actually familiar with the original work and how it can had kind of been twisted into Netflix to be something totally different. That's my rant. No, I agree. And it's I mean, at the same time, I do have to kind of throw you under the bus here because what I completely agree with everything you've said. And we did stop watching the series. Yes. But Lauren really loves movies. And she will go to movies that are woke sometime. Yeah, but also criticize it. And I'll still know that was also good reviews for work to be fair. But at the same time, my approach is what should be everybody's approach at this point is, you know, let people like Lauren sacrifice their free time and waste it watching these movies. And then the rest of us shouldn't watch them. Yes, I should. We should not watch them. Like, I agree. But he takes things to a whole other level. Like he's the hyper like he'll watch like Brother Baron be like, Oh, no, that's some hippie bear commune. Like he is next level with that stuff. I'm, I'm more flexible. Well, listen, I'm correct. That's what matters in this circumstance. It probably was it probably is a commune. Yeah, I don't know. But I assume it is. And therefore we should not watch it. Yeah. So I mean, like, I often see people asking why doesn't Liam do movie reviews with you? It's because he doesn't watch the movie with me. All right. But it wouldn't be a good movie review of House involved most of the time. Sometimes I think I'd be good. But I could get a good 30 second like grumpy section at the end. Yeah, that would be it. Yeah. The only movies I've ever really heard him speak positively about are from the 90s or like early 2000s. That's the golden age. Well, within my lifetime. Yeah, or or a quiet place. You thought that was okay. Yeah, I mean, that was okay. Yeah, it was good. It was a good movie. Yeah. But anyway, yeah, not the easiest one to watch movies with. All right. So next up, let's talk about a little bit of a white pill. Some good news coming out of the UK. Congratulations, Brett. I feel like it's Brits. It's been a while since we had good news from across the pond, but a judge recently ruled puberty blockers under 16s quote unlikely to be able to give informed consent. So you know, this relates to the whole idea of children transitioning. And we recently did a video about what is it? Transhood that HBO documentary. And a lot of people will say, Oh, well, you know, hormone blockers, beauty blockers. It's just temporary. You know, if a kid wants to later go through puberty, it'll be fine. There's nowhere near enough studies to say that that is correct. Like not at all. Of course not. Yeah. So the idea that it's it's just okay. It's something reversible. It's like, look, I wouldn't even let like my 14 year old choose what haircut they have or what they would eat for, you know, meals and stuff. It's the ball cut every time. Yeah. So letting them go on puberty blockers, I don't think so. So we're going to be getting into this article from BBC for we do though, I would like to give a thank you to lamps plus. So Liam and I are kind of in the process of starting to plan out our furniture for our first home together, which is really, really exciting. And when it came to lighting, we of course went to lamps plus it just it makes sense. Lamps plus is the nation's largest lighting retailer. So why would we go anywhere else?

And they also have a ton of variety for every type of taste or style. I like to feel cozy. Liam, I'm learning is more into the Gregorian monastery. It's not true. But I will say Brown and bronze with him. No, that's thick. But I will say that these guys have a tremendous selection. And we were able to find like literally a list of things that we both like.

So getting back to the BBC, they report that children under 16 with gender dysphoria are unlikely to be able to give informed consent to undergo treatment with puberty blocking drugs. Three high court judges have ruled the case was brought against Tavistock and Portman NHS trust, which said it was disappointed but immediately suspended such referrals for under 16s. The NHS said it welcomed the clarity the ruling would bring. All right, so Tavistock and Portman NHS trust from what I understand in the UK, there are several of these clinics that kind of are referred to or have patients referred to them who are underage and experiencing gender dysphoria and they were, it seems being a little bit willy nilly on putting these young people on puberty blockers without really kind of giving the time to figure out what's happening, what is the root of the gender dysphoria is transitioning the right like they it seems like they were just, you know, up and I'm full of hormone blockers. One of the claimants is actually someone who was given puberty blockers and then regretted it. And I would hate to be in that situation. And I think horrible for them. Oh, absolutely. I think they were failed by these doctors by the system. And you know, the idea that a 16 year old or you know, anyone under is able to understand what the long term consequences might be is able to really understand what they want as an adult. It's just it's not true. And that's why we have all these rules that say, if you're 15, you can't get a tattoo if you're 15, you know, you can't take out alone. It's because we like, I mean, kids, their minds aren't fully developed. And it's it's really sad. And I think, you know, the longer time goes on, we're going to have more and more of these people who are kind of coming out and detransitioning one of the claimants that says, Cara Bell said she was delighted by the judgment miss Bell, 23 from Cambridge had been referred to the Tavis talk center, which runs the UK's only gender identity development service. All right, so there's only one sorry, as a teenager and was prescribed puberty blockers age 16. She argued the clinic should have challenged her more over her decision to transition to a male as a teenager. I absolutely agree. I absolutely agree. It seems like a no brainer to me. No, for sure. It says in a ruling Dame Victoria Sharp sitting with Lord Justice Lewis on the bridge, they're so with their titles. Okay, and Mrs. Justice Levin said it is like it. I like that stuff. Yeah, it is highly unlikely that a child aged 13 or under would be competent to give consent to the administration of purity blockers. It is doubtful that a child aged 14 or 15 could understand and weigh the long term risks and consequences of the administration of purity blockers. They added in respect of young persons age 16 and over. The legal position is that there is a presumption that they have the ability to consent to medical treatment. Okay, so it seems like, you know, when when it comes to people who are 16, 17, 18 that they're saying, yeah, you can do that, I would even push back and say that is still too young. Yeah, absolutely. I agree. It should be minimum 18, probably even later if you're being realistic, but unrealistic one like, but 18 minimum. The more that we learn about the development of the human brain, the more I think we understand that like it's not just that we baby kids and that they're irresponsible. Like they actually are not mentally developed. They're not and I'm not for you know, trying to pamper them too much or delay adulthood and responsibilities. But I'm also for recognizing the fact that young people make really bad decisions for a reason, right? And we can't just kind of will them into that development. It doesn't work like that continues given the long term consequences of the clinical interventions at issue in this case. And given that the treatment is as yet innovative and experimental, I'm glad that they recognize that that it is like experimental. We recognize that clinicians may well regard these as cases where the authorization of the court should be sought prior to commencing the clinical treatment. A second claimant, not only as Mrs. A, is the mother of a 15 year old girl with autism who is awaiting treatment at the clinic. Speaking to the BBC, she said, my fear is it's not that she transitions it that it's that she gets it wrong. She said it was frightening. There was so little exploration of why a child might be feeling they were the wrong sex before puberty blockers were given terrifying. And I think, you know, a lot of parents right now, if you do have a child and maybe they are experiencing what you think is gender dysphoria, I think there might be that that instinct to just trust the doctors, right? Trust this specialist that they know what they're talking about. But I think more and more realizing that it's not that simple, right? It's so tough. It's so tough for me to say that. But I agree with you because like I'm someone that definitely believes in authority. And I think that a doctor will know more about the human body than than the average person is. But I also we can just see looking at the trends through academia and virtually every field that the knowledge upon which these doctors degrees are now based on is is just being subverted on a theoretical level. And the stuff that they're being passed down is no longer of the same high standard that it once was. And so it's really tough. You have to some things, I think, still no brainers if a doctor says, okay, this pill is good for you because blank the pressure of cholesterol, of course, that's terrific. But when these other things come in that are more involved, particularly anything that involves a social issue, that's when you have to get very skeptical and make your own decisions, I think. Right. And I think that the entire field of psychology really is at the forefront of this corruption. We're almost going back to like Freudian era level of psychology, right? Like where it's basically pseudoscience. That's what I think. Like we've we psychology peaked and now it's descending. Yeah, which is too bad because if we look at actual like quantifiable psychology, psychology can be as hard of science as any and actually Jordan Peterson, I really enjoy his work because he's like a psychologist who really does look at a hard data, things like intelligence and actual studies and things like that to determine things about the human mind. What there are psychologists out there who it's really I mean, it's just it's a cover for advancing, you know, this neo Marxism critical theory, which is too bad. And actually, if we look at the gender breakdown of psychologists, I'm just saying it is a overwhelmingly female dominated area. Yeah, something like 80%. Yeah. And I think this really is kind of what's at the root of why we see so many, you know, these these doctors just writing off. Yep. Sounds good. Pumpy full of purity blockers and actually in the future. I wouldn't be surprised if we see something that amounts to almost a class action lawsuit against some doctor or another for being just a little bit too keen to make these children transition. I hope so. And I also want to say that I'm very happy when I see these kinds of victories and there are they seem to be few and far between frankly, especially in the UK. But as someone living in Canada right now, you know, these laws in the UK, while they probably don't set any real legal precedent for Canadians, we are a Commonwealth country and we do operate on a very similar legislative system. Yeah. So it does have some kind of, you know, it's in the minds of our politicians now. And never mind that, but just like, even if I'm not in the UK, I still want British children to have those protections. Like I still want them to be able to go to a doctor and have a doctor thoroughly vet them out, not be politically motivated and understand that this child should not be making decisions for themselves. Yeah, I completely agree. But I just I think that this should be something that is adopted in all Western nations at the very least and probably further frankly, like I said, at least 18. Yeah. But I do, we don't want to get you guys too excited with all this good news. I do have like, actually, I just saw this before we started filming some bad news from Australia, trans teen taken into care after quote abusive parents refused to let him transition and live as a boy. This is the type of stuff that terrifies me. And this is a, you know, we're done that in Canada as well. And there's been a few cases in the States where they've had so much stuff too. Yeah. It's happening everywhere. And this is absolutely terrifying. This is the type of stuff that I would move for though, like on, I'm being 100% serious, we're starting to start the Herculean to ask a flat like, okay, where do we want to raise our kids and things like that. And this I would move countries to avoid this. I mean, if people think that they can come and take your child because you don't want to, you know, pump them full of puberty blockers and gender trends, it's like, no, I'm sorry, not acceptable. Particularly maybe like in a place like France where they're saying you might not even be allowed to homeschool your child. Yes. Yeah, there are places where you just need to get out of and kind of those facts become one of those Australia. That's a problem. They've got some good things going on in Australia, but you don't want to see that happening. No, it's too bad. And I just, my heart goes out to those parents. And I hope they don't give up fighting for their child. All right. So let's go on to something. This is again, I'm sorry, more bad news. But I just, this is happening. I feel we have a responsibility to let you know, even if it's not the most fun to hear about. So a school district, the San Diego Unified School District, they began making their teachers take white privilege training. And this is something that we're seeing really in so many different companies, school districts, colleges, I mean, it's, it's really everywhere. You know, Trump did put a stop to it at the federal level saying you're not allowed to like teach critical race theory in, you know, federal, with federal funds. I think that's something that Biden has said that if he is inaugurated as president, he would roll back the clock on though. But anyway, so this is from San Diego. And we have this person on Twitter, Christopher F. Rufo, who's kind of laying this all out for us. He says the training begins with a land acknowledgement in which the teachers are asked to accept that they are colonizers living on stolen Native American land. Then they are told they will experience guilt, anchor, apathy and close mindedness because of their quote white fragility. Yeah. So it says, and he has a little screenshot here, we acknowledge that we meet on stolen land taken from indigenous peoples. I am speaking to you from Kumbaya land. We must acknowledge the hidden history of violence against indigenous peoples in an effort to move toward justice. I'm actually I am, I am an indigenous person here in Canada. Not like Elizabeth Warren, like he actually has a little card in it. Yeah, I have status. I have mixed feelings about this kind of thing. Like for me, like, it's a total virtue signal to do what you do there. First, I want to acknowledge I've seen people send screenshots of like on on Tinder. Yeah. Tinder. That's the one that's the guy opens up a Tinder conversation and he starts off by acknowledging that. Yeah. That's like gross slimy male feminism. That's bad. That's bad. So that's all a virtue signaling. I do say that I have to acknowledge that if your government signed a treaty with another government in the past, it should be honored. Yeah. And if it's it and in these cases, there are legitimate treaties that weren't honored. And then in that case, the government, the government situation, they should they should figure that out for themselves. Like there should be a new agreement that comes into place, whatever that is. Well, actually, and I agree with Liam there. I'm someone who like I'm pro-balconization. I've said it before on the show. I'll say it again. I think, you know, the the giant countries and federal governments of like, especially the US and Canada, they're too bloated. They can't represent all of their citizens. So I think we should be breaking up. And I keep telling Liam, like we need to move to his reserve, we get him put in his chief and then we can start annexing, you know, some neighboring land. And if the federal government Canada says anything, we say like, well, this is, you know, the cultural, you know, cultural practice. This is the way this is the way. So back off, you white colonizers, Trudeau wouldn't say anything. He'd probably, and then, you know, and then we build a better society. It would be nice to build a better society with some sovereign land. However, everything we just said there is a complete joke. Definitely, you know, we can only aspire for these things. Yes. So yeah, let's keep going. It says norms of norms and agreements expect to experience discomfort, shared the air, take space and leave space, be brave, speak your truth, listen to others. Oh my gosh, be explicit about race and racism, avoid and point out coded language. I hate all of this stuff about like, yeah, well, they do this thing too. They're talking about it in the first slide where they're like, because you're white fragility, you're going to feel like you don't agree with this. Yeah. It's so they're trying to like, it's a catch 22, either I agree and write exactly it's it's completely ridiculous. And if someone showed me this stuff, honestly, like there's no point intellectually debating them. This is pseudo intellectualism 101. And they're just interested in controlling you really is what it is. So to me, there's no, there's like, you just get up, you know, if you want to say something, you know, use some, use some strong language, go ahead and then leave. Yeah, because there's no other, there's no other, you just can't, there's no other discussion that we had. We're at that point. This is being talked about, there's nothing positive that you could say that will actually be constructive for anybody there. Well, for sure. And you can tell that they're not looking for a conversation. Just looking at this, it says emotions, racial stress that are stirred when making white people consider racial realities is it's not a racial reality, though, like they are pushing propaganda. This is ideologues snake oil salesman. No, for sure. But they're not even willing to accept that. Yeah, they say guilt, anger, apathy, frustration, close mindedness, and defensiveness. It's ridiculous. I also want to say this is going to sound, I don't know, but the truth is, the only people in the world that have actually embraced like a very anti racism stance in modern history are pretty much Europeans living in the West. Yeah. They're the only group, even if you look at white progressives, they're the only group with a negative in group preference, statistically speaking. Yeah. So the opposite is actually true. When confronting racial stress, it seems like white people are way more likely to not get defensive about it. Yeah. But now they are. So that's telling sign that you're probably you're probably just full of hot air. Yeah, essentially. So we have more of this garbage to sort through. First, though, this is some lighter news. Let's talk about quip. So you know, quip by now we've talked about it many times the electric toothbrush you hear about. It's their sleek reusable floss pick that you're going to want to use next. So the durable handle is easy to guide restrinked with the click and comes with a compact mirror dispensing case for on the go plus a single refill pod replaces over 180 single use plastic flossers.

So you can save money and skip the store, bring delight to your everyday brushing and join the over five million mouths brushing with quip starting at just $25. So back to what Christopher tells us, he says, after watching clips of Robin D'Angelo and Imbram Kennedy, the trainers tell the teachers, you are racist. You are upholding racist ideas, structures and policies. And that must commit to becoming anti-racist in the classroom. They must submit to the new racial orthodoxy. Yeah, it just says here, you are racist. And then how would this make you feel? This really is like a religion now. And it's like, this is like the Mia Kulp, but you have to recognize your own sin as a white person. I'm happy to let them do that. If they, if you want to go out and admit to all the stuff, that's fine. But you're also my political enemy. So I'm happy that you are seeking this ground to me. But it's, it's frustrating because, you know, if someone does say, hang on, no, I'm not racist, they interpret that. Like you said, it's just a confirmation that they are racist. So it's an unfalsifiable kind of thing. Oh, yeah. Well, like I said earlier, there's no, there's something you could say here. Like there isn't anything you could say. There are some games that you can play. If you follow James Lindsey on, on Twitter, he's a great follow Christopher Rufle, who we got this thread from is also very good. He covers a lot of this stuff as well. But you can, you can use their own logic against them if you feel like it. James Lindsey's website, new discourses, that's a great one to learn about the stuff a little bit. So you can be better prepared if you do want to engage in discussions with these people. Yeah. That being said, I don't know if I want to say I don't recommend it, but they might not be fruitful. So you have to be really well prepared. Yeah, especially and this is such a hard position that a lot of people are being put into because if you have to do this as part of your job, you know, it's hard. You have to measure like, well, dude, is it worth pushing back and maybe making people, including perhaps your boss and HR uncomfortable? Is this going to alienate your employers? Like, are you going to potentially put your job at risk? Or, you know, if you're a student, a lot of students are afraid, are afraid to speak up because they don't want to be penalized by their professors or their teachers for having a different opinion. And it's like they're holding people hostage. Absolutely. It's disgusting. And the truth is you're going to find this stuff as as it's growing in popularity, because it's being asked or turf so hard. You're going to encounter more and more. It's going to be in your homes. We know when you're having family meetings during the holidays, you know, your niece, your cousin, your aunt, your brother, whatever it could be. They're going to be bringing this up. So, you know, you have to be prepared. It used to be like the stereotype was like the Republican uncle would be like this brute at these family dinners. But really now it's going to be the want to be tyrant there. Yeah, the blue hair, black rim glasses wearing like college students. Yeah, exactly. And soft forable to be around. All right. So, we got another post here. It says the teachers are told that they are part of an oppressive white power structure. The trainers claim that white people in America hold most of the power. And that white teachers have an ability to thrive that is being preserved at every level of power. This is from the actual content. It says white privilege and culture. Since white people in America hold most of the political institutional and economic power, they receive advantages that non white groups do not. The idea of white privilege is just it's such a such a meme at this point. And, you know, they never really provide coherent data that takes into account things like individual choices and, you know, different behaviors, right? It's just looking like it's the most surface level statistical interpretation you could possibly imagine, like with absolutely no confounding variables, just like, oh, white people are doing better. Therefore, you have privileges like, okay, come on. It says white culture and white radicalize identity refer to the way that white people their customs culture and beliefs operate as the standard by which all other groups are compared. But it's like, you're you're in a country that is mostly white people. Yeah, like, I don't know, I don't know what you what else you expect and not to mention that when white people do try to experience non white cultures, they get blamed for cultural appropriation. So it's like, literally is a white person just sit down, shut up, don't do anything. But even silence is violent. So I don't I don't know. Okay, it also says white privilege, my ability to thrive, not just survive in this country is being preserved at every level of power, without me having to do anything at all. Unless you are someone like Robin DiAngelo, no, you're your your position of power is not being preserved at every level by like this type of institutional advantage. All right, if you're in the opposite, the opposite's true. In fact, if you look at white males in particular, it seems that this is going to be the first generation in recent history that the sons will be less prosperous than their fathers. Yeah, it's I know so many people that are struggling right now to find jobs and what was theoretically something we don't have to work for. Meanwhile, we could we can all easily imagine a ton of people that we know that work like crazy and might not even get to see many rewards for it. Definitely. It says finally, teachers are told they must become anti racist activists. We did a we did actually a couple episodes talking about anti racism. They must confront and examine their white privilege, acknowledge when they feel white fragility and teach others to see their privilege. They must turn their schools into activist organizations homeschool your children homeschool or private school. And I know like both of those options are hard, but like it's at a point now where like if you can't homeschool, you can't afford private school. Honestly, I would move based on school district. Like if if I found out that my local school was teaching this kind of crap, I would pack up and say leave right it's not it's not worth your child being exposed to such a toxic cult ideology. It's just not worth it. You know, if you very few people, I think who grow up with this type of mentality, end up being like strong hardworking people of like strong moral fiber. I just don't see it happening. Yeah, it says anti racist one who is supporting an anti racist policy through their actions or expressing an anti racist idea versus racist one who is supporting a racist policy through their actions or inaction or expressing a racist idea. Like don't it's just literally that you're with us or against us. Yeah, type of attitude. Absolutely. So what can you commit to? They ask the teachers confront and examine your white privilege, acknowledge when you feel white fragility happening for you and slow down so you can listen, learn and act, be active, give to the community, teach others to see their privilege. Read and educate yourself, use your privilege, examine norms and policies in your school and classroom. Yeah, you know, what's what's also interesting about this is not how it's just hurting teachers who might not want to say this and the children, but it's actually it's influencing actual like school policies. I recently read an article about how giving things like detention is actually racist because black people are more likely to get detention. Therefore, schools should just not have detention, which I mean, I would have liked that. Yeah, he was a bad kid. He got detention in high school. I like I was shocked when I I thought you were a good kid. When the first I was a good kid, but she's she's got a different idea of what a good kid is. Okay, I'm sorry. It is not hard to never get attention in school. I feel like most of our viewers disagree with that. No, it's not. You guys know, you know how it is. Yeah, it's okay. I have a bad boy here getting detention and mouthing off to the teachers probably. I hope our kids are more like me. I was an angel, but yeah, so that's that's not helping the students, right? You know, if we're looking at kids who don't have any discipline at home, so they're acting out in school, the last thing they need is another place where they can get away with whatever they want, because that is not how the real world works. You can't just do whatever and expect to keep your job. So this is actually harming the students, the kids, the groups who I think these people like to pretend they're trying to help by reducing any standards of objectivity. I also feel horrible for the teachers that have to deal with that situation. I've been in classes where the teacher does feel powerless and knew when the students get a whiff of that, they quickly take advantage. They can smell fear. Yeah, exactly. So and it just becomes like, it just becomes a zoo, right? It must be awful for the teacher in that situation. And if you're allowed to give the attention that the students are going to you know, they're going to take advantage of that. Yeah. Also, I just want to apologize. If I've been sniffling, it's because I'm kind of always sniffling. I just have like a chronic runny nose. I'm sorry guys. But on I guess the flip side of this, we have some better news coming out of the Southern Baptist Convention. So a lot of you have asked like what my denomination is because we've talked about how your Catholic I am Baptist, although we've we've kind of gone to non denominational churches before, but I feel like with non denominational churches, you get a lot of that like, whoa, Christianity sometimes. Yeah, you can. Some are really biblical, but you got to be careful. You got to just screen it out. And we have experience with that too. We've found a pretty good one, I think. But we have had ones in the past that were like, okay, this is a this isn't for us. But at the same time, you know, you could get the same thing in the Catholic Church, you could probably get it just about anywhere. It's about finding the right pastor or priest and community around them. So we have this from Jamar Tizby. He's upset about this. I think this is great news. Basically, it's talking about how at the Southern Baptist Convention, they discussed things like critical race theory and they were like, no, thank you, not for us. So an excerpt from this piece that Jamar wrote and he was very upset. He says, by highlighting critical race theory as particularly acute threats to Southern Baptist orthodoxy, the seminary presidents take aim at virtually anyone who advocates for racial justice beyond hugs, handshakes, and symbolic statements. So and his whole article is about how Southern Baptist have chosen whiteness. So pretty much he's upset that they're not going to be, you know, like those United Methodist or whatever people getting down on their hands and knees and self flagellating because they're white. Good on you, Southern Baptist Convention. He also said, super happy to hear that to be honest. I'm not Southern Baptist, but that's why we need to hear more of that. You will be. Yeah. So he also writes within the Southern Baptist Convention, a far right group called the conservative Baptist network has formed in response to what it perceives as a liberal drift in the domination. Yes, thank you. It cites critical race theory and intersectionality as particular threats. The network rejects worldly ideologies infiltrating the Southern Baptist Convention, including critical race theory, intersectionality, and other unbiblical agendas, deceptively labeled as social justice music to my ears. Well done. Absolutely. Well done. Yeah. And it's just we have to take the good where we get it because there's there's not that that many inspiring stories, but I was really happy to read that. All right. So now let's talk about something that's a little bit controversial, unlike the rest of these segments, I guess, but that is the great reset. And I don't think it's something we've fully talked about before on the show. I don't overtly. Well, I mean, up until up until recently, like that kind of talk was considered very conspiratorial. Yeah. But thankfully, some things have happened recently. The maths are off totally off. Yeah. It's really weird, frankly. And it's kind of scary. But at least we feel like we can discuss it. And there's actual meat to point to them. Of course, some people are going to still call you a conspiracy theorist, even though that the previous day they were just advocating for the great reset openly. But yeah, I think more people are kind of waking up to this. And so if you're if you're not familiar with what the great reset is, it's kind of the idea that there is a concerted effort by the globalist elites to revamp the world economy and political structures, using the crisis of COVID or environmentalism or whatever it may be to kind of more closely resemble this communist globalist, like utopia, authoritarian utopia. And you know, for a long time, it's true people have called that a conspiracy theory. But more and more, we are seeing that, no, this is real. And actually, we have a clip here of Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, kind of just like openly talking about how COVID is kind of a it's a situation where you can take advantage of it and have this little reset. We have a clip here. This pandemic has provided an opportunity for a reset. This is our chance to accelerate our pre pandemic efforts to reimagine economic systems that actually address global challenges like extreme poverty, inequality, and climate change. And then of course, literally, the day after whenever it was that people started reporting on that clip, Justin Trudeau turns around and says, Oh, what great reset. That's a conspiracy theory. It's like from your own mouth, right? You were talking about my boy, Justin isn't very smart. And you know, I'm super, super depressed when this guy got reelected, but it's also great. Because I don't, I don't think he's a smart man. And him saying things like this openly, like he and he does this kind of thing fairly regularly where he just says the quiet part out loud. Yeah, exactly. So I do thank him for that, because it really lends some credibility to this, the people that are wary of globalism. Mm hmm. No, for sure. And I mean, it's not just, Justin Trudeau, even before, if we look at things like Extinction Rebellion and just the whole idea with the Green New Deal, there are people, you know, kind of authoritarian socialists who are just waiting to use any type of crisis, whether that's environmentalism. Now it's COVID or whatever our recession, in order to overhaul the entire, I guess, structure of how Western countries operate. It's they're talking about the economy. They're talking about, you know, policy, they're talking about just politics in general, and how we live our day to day lives. And actually, there was this piece from MarketWatch that I thought just greatly encapsulated and displayed everything we're talking about. So it says, we need to act boldly now if we tour up, if we are to avoid economy wide lockdowns to halt climate change. Again, they always use like, oh, it's this, you know, this crisis. That's why we need to make all these changes that kind of reminds me of what is it, the Roman Republic, where you look, you seize power in a time of crisis that you just never give it back, which, by the way, is exactly what's going to happen with all these liberties we're losing to COVID. And I also thought it was ironic that this is from MarketWatch, which is like, you would assume that they would have some sort of fondness for markets, but apparently not, they're watching it in kind of like the way that a hunter watches spray. That's what I'm getting from this. But it talks about how, you know, COVID lockdowns have been widely adopted across different countries. And now they're saying, well, you know, why not a climate lockdown? That's the premise of this piece. And it says under a climate lockdown, governments would limit private vehicle use, ban consumption of red meat and impose extreme energy saving measures, while fossil fuel companies would have to stop drilling to avoid such a scenario. We must overhaul our economic structures and do capitalism differently. So they're essentially presenting you with two choices, either you give us a lot of control to restrict your everyday life, or you give us a lot of control to restrict your everyday life. I mean, those are kind of, or you die from climate change, I guess. That's what they're going to infer. But yeah, and I, I, you were someone, I've taken classes on climate change. I've, you know, I've, I've done it all. And I'm someone that, you know, takes care of my part for the environment at least, you know, to a reasonable level. Except, okay, listen, she said about the, she's about to start saying about how I always leave the water running. Okay, I leave the water running. I live in a water-rich area. This is an LA. And he also like, he doesn't turn off the lights when he leaves and he'll like leave the air conditioning on when you're on. Yeah, but still, you're supposed, you're going to be the father. That's your realm. You're the one who has to be turning on lights. They're not incandescent lights, Lauren. You could, you could run LEDs. They're nothing. It's no problem. If I leave the room for a few minutes, it's not a big deal to come back. The air conditioning, that is a human necessity. You can't live without it. Like in the summer, you need it. So you come back in the house, you need some, sometimes it takes too long for the house to cool down and it's been known. It's been known that it could be lethal. So those are, those are, I'm pretty good with that stuff. Yeah. But on a serious note, I do. No, we, we do both care for the environment. Yeah, we don't, we try to do our part. Yeah, we always clean up after ourselves. We result that we, you know, we, I, we don't drive very much either of us. You know, we, we do what we can because polluting, I think, is, is, is wrong. Yeah. It's not, it's not a good thing, right? Right. Regardless of how you feel about catastrophic climate change, do we have 10 years or 15 years or 20 years, it's still not good to pollute. We still want clean water, fresh air. You something I'm more and more concerned about is the state of like the, the fisheries and things like that. Something actually, you know, shop for seafood. I'm concerned about. Yeah. So I mean, none of this is to say that the environment shouldn't matter or that COVID people shouldn't look after themselves, especially if they're immunocompromised, but it's just that we're saying that we are wary of a power play by the same people that are, that are advocating for exactly that for COVID. Yes, for sure. And I think that's a very legitimate concern. And I'm, I'm happy to make certain amends, but I'm not happy to give them power because I think they will abuse it. I think they absolutely will. And if you, if you don't believe that, just look what's happening right now. People are being arrested for things like opening their business, right? You have people being in current neighbors being encouraged to rat out their neighbors who are having their family over. I mean, we had, we had a one reporter from, I think, the CBC filming people going to church and, and trying to get the RCMP involved to, to rat on them. Like this is, I mean, it's Orwellian. It's nothing short of Orwellian. In fact, here in Quebec, they just recently announced that we're not going to be allowed to have families over for Christmas. Yeah. But they generously did say if you live in a loan, you can have one guest over. Nice. So yeah, it's, it's clearly an abuse of power. And, and the same thing will happen for, for climate change, if you let it go that way. So I think that, yeah, don't be, don't be an idiot. Like, don't be just throwing trash and leaving it all over the place. I see it. I see it. You're an arms, you know, on the flip side of that. Yeah. But I do see people leave trash everywhere. I'm out in the wild. Yeah, that's frustrating. That's really annoying. And I try, we do try to like eat clean beef and stuff like that. So yeah, there's stuff you could do, but we don't have to give them this kind of power. Yeah, you don't need to say like, Oh, well, people are polluting might as well just embrace communism. And actually, yeah, this article continues addressing this triple crisis. I think they're referring to a climate crisis, economic crisis and public health crisis. It says require requires reorienting corporate governance, finance, policy and energy systems toward a green economic transformation. To achieve this, three obstacles must be removed. Businesses that is a business that is shareholder driven instead of stakeholder driven finance that is used in inadequate and inappropriate ways and government that is based on outdated economic thinking and faulty assumptions. I was recently watching a video by Sargon of a cod Carl Benjamin, who has like this new platform, the Lotus eaters. And he was saying like, there this, the great reset isn't a conspiracy theory. They're openly saying it. This is just a plan. Like, this is just a plan. There's no like tin foil hat. They're pretty open about it. And actually, if you listen to people like AOC or get a tin book for any extended amount of time, you'll see this is exactly what they're advocating for. Like, it's not, it's not crazy. And anything from the UN is kind of in the same vein. I think that's pretty much all we have to say for an hour. I want to say one last thing. And that is that I have to thank our more right wing American viewers because I think that America is probably the only country that has been able to kind of resist a lot of the stuff. And it's probably thanks to you guys who frustrate me sometimes. But everything else. I know people are going to ask that. So I'm asking you. Oh, because well, because there's some major boomer mentality there at the same time. The boomer. Yeah. There's some boomers there. But at the same time, everything else has proven to be a slippery slope. So we have to, we have to definitely appreciate you guys have been right a lot of the time. Yeah, for sure. And even actually, Stephen Crowder, fellow Blaze hosts, he did a segment talking about it. I think it was specifically freedom of speech and like liberties. And it's how the rest of the world does look to the US for stuff like that. Because, you know, even in Canada, we don't have something like the Constitution where your rights are enshrined. All any Canadian right is like subject to the whims of the government, pretty much. Which in practice means it's non-existent. So you really have to hold that line because, you know, we start thinking, well, okay, if something happens in Canada, which already is, well, we could, you know, go there. But it's like, if the US, which I think is the western country, was fighting back against this the most in addition to some eastern European countries, like if you guys lose to these kind of neo-Marxists, what then? Like, where's where, what place is going to be like the shining city on a hill? I don't know. But on that, Cherry Note, thank you so much for tuning in. And we will see you next time."
