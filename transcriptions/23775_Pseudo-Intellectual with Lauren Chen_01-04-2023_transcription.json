    "text": " God made me in her image. God made me transgender. Do you believe that a male can become a woman? Do you believe that little kids belong at drag shows? Well, if the answer to either of those questions is no, then apparently, at least according to one trans activist, you are going against Jesus. Yeah. So it's no secret that since the right has finally gotten its act together and has begun effectively combating the progressive agenda, specifically when it comes to the LGBT community, the media who if you guys have been paying attention are basically progressive activists. At this point, they have been doubling down really going hard on the offense, trying to convince their audience that actually, if you don't think that biological sex is meaningless, that people are whatever gender they identify as, that penises belong in ladies locker rooms. Well, and you are a bigot. And it's interesting, even though a trans shooter recently, just a few days ago attacked a Christian school and killed Christian children, it seems that they've actually increased their desire to push the trans ideology onto us, which, you know, if it were conservatives, I know it's kind of clich\u00e9 at this point to say well, if the shoe was on the other foot, but I mean, think anytime any attack happens, and there's even a remote whiff of right wing politics, right wingers are essentially expected to, I guess, change all of their beliefs immediately, or at the very least, not talk about them publicly for a few weeks, you know, to avoid the appearance of bad taste. But apparently that rule doesn't apply to progressives because they've just been doubling down on the trans rhetoric so much so that MSNBC's Joy Reid recently had noted trans activist Charlotte climber on to, I mean, push the trans agenda and also sprinkle in a little heresy because why not? Because people don't have an understanding people, even if they're not mean or not angry, don't have an understanding. Is there a way to sort of disentangle people's not lack of understanding from this, this small panic is now getting drag shows bad, even though that isn't trans. No, no, and I think children are only unsafe at drag shows when a shooter shows up to kill them. That's right. That's where the threat is. I would challenge anyone just to get to know trans people. We are a vibrant, diverse community as diverse as anyone else. Okay, here's the thing. Joy Reid is right in that a lot of drag queens aren't even trans. They don't identify as women. A lot of them are just men who like to dress up as women, formerly known as cross dressing. But the question is, if it's, if they're not trans, then why do I always get transphobic for saying that I don't think little kids should be exposed to that? I mean, does does the left just call everybody transphobic regardless of whether it relates to trans people? I mean, we certainly saw that was the case with racist and racism, but maybe the new racism is transphobia. What's Charlotte's point? And to anyone watching this who's not previously familiar with Charlotte, yes, the individual on screen with a jaw so sharp it could cut steel identifies as Charlotte clearly a male who just thinks of himself as a woman. But according to Charlotte, actually the only danger to children is when someone gets shot at a drag show because obviously there can be no harm to children unless it's physical, right? I mean, sexual abuse, emotional abuse, that doesn't matter. The only standard we're keeping here is whether someone gets shot, which I mean, by the way, also did just happen. I don't know if you remember Charlotte by a trans person. But yeah, that's a pretty low bar for child welfare we're talking about here. And the thing is what really bothers me about people like Charlotte is they are exactly the type to say that, well, unless you recognize me as the gender I identify as, then you're pretty much saying you hate me as a person, which is absolutely not true. I'm sure there are a lot of people out there who are males who identify as women who are, you know, fine people who are just confused and should maybe go see a doctor and I by no means hate them simply because they are trans. That's not what the right is talking about here is because I don't believe that you magically become a woman just because you say you are doesn't mean that I don't see you as a person that I don't think you should have the rights that anyone else has. The only reason that Charlotte is pushing this get to know trans people argument is because he is pushing the idea that the only reason why conservatives would possibly not want children to transition is because they hate trans people, which is clearly not the case. If if conservatives actually hated trans people, then they would be for children transitioning and potentially ruining their lives. The fact that we are trying to protect these children who for the moment at least think they're trans, that shows that we actually do care about them. And we are trying to do what is best for them when their parents, when their schools, when even the medical profession seem to be looking the other way in the name of ideology. I'm from the great state of Texas. I served in the military. I go to church every Sunday. My faith is very important to me. But God made me in her image. God made me transgender. And to see these people so cynically weaponize this and exploit these children's debts and their teacher's debts, it breaks my heart. I wonder what those families are thinking right now. Oh, that was such a short clip, but there's so much to talk about. First thing is that Charlotte claims he goes to church every Sunday, but that also God made him transgender. So, you know, there's nothing wrong with being trans. I don't know what Bible you have to be reading to believe that the message God has for us is that you are perfect the way you are made. That's not in my Bible. In fact, I would say the main takeaway Bible is the opposite of what people like Charlotte progressive Christians try to push that. Oh, yeah, God made us perfect. No, actually, we are fallen. Man is in a state of sin and in order to reconcile ourselves with the Father, we need Christ. So the concept of, Oh, well, God made me like this. And also God made me in his image. Therefore, it must be good. It's like what? I mean, we're all liars, cheaters, covetous. If we say, Oh, well, God made us in his image. Does that mean that it's okay to be those things? No, of course not. And also, let's be real transgenderism is a mental illness as someone who has another mental illness anxiety. I know different levels here, but bear with me. It wouldn't make sense for me to say, well, God made me with anxiety. Therefore, it's okay for me to have anxiety. And I should just embrace anxiety. It's like, no, yes, God made me. But if there were a cure for anxiety, you know, I should still work toward getting rid of it. And I think the same should apply with gender dysphoria. Yeah, I mean, God made you, but you have gender dysphoria, which is not a healthy thing. Therefore, you should work to resolve it. And no, I don't just mean by chopping off body parts. And that brings us to the, the pronoun issue Charlotte Charlotte did refer to God as a her because of, of course, why wouldn't a trans activist who professes to be a Christian think that God is a woman? This is a red flag right here. If you weren't sure that this person is in no way spouting biblical Christianity. And it's funny for a group that is so obsessed with pronouns, you would think that they would respect God's pronouns. That's right. God who constantly, consistently throughout the Bible refers to himself as he, him, father, king, but I guess throwing away your own concept of preferred pronouns is worth it if you get to virtue signal by saying, yeah, God's a woman, because feminism. What do you mean if it feel when you have somebody like Michael knows that CPAC, we need to eradicate transgenderism. And when somebody like Tucker Carlson says that transgender people are at war with Christians, I can't see Christ in their words. That's for damn sure. I can't see where the biblical principles of loving your neighbor and walk in the walk with Christ that they can see. I can't see what they're seeing right now, because that's not of Christ. It's not. Yeah. And I'll be the last word. I'll be stronger. This is anti Christ. Yeah. This is anti gospel anti Christ. And so this is a false worship. We're confronting here. We got to confront it theologically. Yeah. And not just politically. Amen. But now here it is. According to this trans activist and this reverend, apparently, opposing transgenderism is anti Christ. And it's not what Jesus would have wanted. And in order to support this, Charlotte brings out the whole, Oh, well, you know, love thy neighbor. But here's the thing. Loving your neighbor is much more than just going along with whatever your neighbor says. If my neighbor were to come up to me and say, Hey, I think I'm a chicken. Click, click, click, click, click, it wouldn't be loving them to simply throw bird seed at them. The actual right thing to do if I wanted to show them that I cared about them would be to sit them down and say, Hey, actually, you're not a chicken. You're a person. It seems like you're going through some sort of mental health crisis. So let's get you some professional help in order to work this out. Okay. There's a difference between being nice and being kind, being nice is overrated. If you ask me, Jesus wasn't nice. He wasn't afraid of doubling out harsh truth. If it meant that someone ultimately would bring themselves closer to God and it might hurt trans people's feelings when we say, no, no, you're you're actually not a woman. You are a man, but it's not helping people to lie to them. And as Christians, we are called toward the truth way more than we are called to placate people in falsehoods. If a family member comes up to you and says that, Hey, actually, I'm trans. I was born a man, but I'm now a woman. It's not love to lie to them and say, you're right, you are a woman, you're a beautiful, it's not love to allow them to pump their bodies full of hormones with unknown long term side effects. And it's certainly not love to allow them to chop off an appendage. By the way, the person appearing next to Charlotte is someone named Jim Wallace who before this I wasn't familiar with, but he apparently is the chair and faith and justice at Georgetown. It is one thing to have some random trans activists spouting utter nonsense on national TV. It is another to have someone do it who at least professes to be a reverend. And if this is not a wake up call to a lot of people watching this that, Hey, Christianity has been infested at least in certain parts by this social justice nonsense. Well, then here it is. And I'm sorry, but I also don't know how people like Charlotte can sit on TV and profess with a straight face that actually Jesus would be in favor of things like little kids at drag shows. I mean, Jesus had some things to say about sexual immorality. Jesus had some things to say about pride and adultery. And Jesus definitely had a lot to say about leading little children astray. I'm talking about Matthew 18, six. If anyone causes one of these little ones, those who believe in me to stumble, it would be better for them to have a large millstone hung around their neck and to be drowned in the depths of the sea. The Bible is clear on sex and gender, man and woman. The Bible is clear on what sexual morality looks like. Bible is also very clear about how we should be treating children. But Charlotte and the reverend don't want to talk about that. No one said they would rather talk about the amorphous, non judgmental things like loving your neighbor and things like that, which have essentially turned Christianity into just this, I don't know this greeting card religion for a lot of people where they think all it takes to be a Christian is to go to church on Sunday and just to be nice. Yeah, because tolerance and openness, that's what we're judged upon as Christians, which ironic actually, because tolerance is is not a virtue in the Bible. Yeah, let people do whatever. Again, I don't know what other Bible these people are reading, but that's not in there. I'm going to stop myself before I get even more upset.
