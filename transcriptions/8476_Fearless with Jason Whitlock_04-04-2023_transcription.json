    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blaisetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host, Happy Tuesday. Isn't it good? It's Tuesday. You're settling into your work week. You got me to listen to on your drive home. It's going to be an awesome Tuesday. It's going to be an awesome show. You're going to right now start pounding that like button and giving this show the 5,000 likes that it deserves. If you're listening over Apple, you're going to start pounding that 5 star review. We got spammed on Apple with one star reviews as people that don't like me and don't like what we represent continue to work against us. They dropped our rating from a 4.8 to a 4.9 with the spamming of our Apple. I need you guys to spam back. We got to fight this algorithm. We got to fight the forces against us. Hit that 5 star review over Apple. The other side is working trying to diminish this show. Write a review. If you're watching over YouTube again, make sure you hit the notifications and you're getting the alerts. Make sure you hit that like button. Make sure you're writing comments on all of our content. That's your way of helping to push back and fight back so that I can continue to deliver you this awesome content that I'm going to deliver to you today. We have a awesome show before I get into it because I'm circling back in on Caitlin Clark and this whole women's basketball thing. This thing is so much bigger, so much broader than many of you realize that's why you have me to unpack it and explain it to you. Going to do it again today. Before I do that, I want to tell you about my good friends at Cozy Earth. As I've told you guys, I have Cozy Earth betting at home. I have one bed. I have two bedrooms in my apartment. One of them has Cozy Earth betting. One of them does not. Cozy Earth makes a huge difference. Going to bed at a decent hour didn't always mean I got enough sleep. Oftentimes, I was either too hot or too cold or it's just not comfortable. But when I get on those Cozy Earth seats, I'm temperature controlled. I'm always cool, calm and collected. It's much easier for me to sleep. I'm a weirdo. My sleeping pattern is completely off. I tend to kind of sleep in two different bedrooms, sometimes even in the same night. And it's always a gigantic difference from my bedding and my bedroom that has Cozy Earth. I sleep longer. I sleep better. I sleep more coolly there. That's a queen bed. The other bedroom has a California king. Sometimes I like more space and room. It's just the feeling. But I'm always better off on my Cozy Earth sheets and bedding. They're so confident that you'll love their product. Like I love their product, they'll offer you a 100 night sleep free trial, which means you have 100 nights to sleep on it. Wash it, try it out.

That ain't Cozy Earth. They're with us. Plus, you're just going to sleep better on Cozy Earth. So use my promo code Fearless. All right. Let's get to the fire starter. One of this show, this fire starter is going to be amazing in a different way than yesterday's was. Delano Squires is going to be here to talk about this fire starter and his column that he wrote today for the blaze that has perfect synergy with the topic I'm about to unpack. I need you guys to sit back, get ready to have your head explode, get ready to have your whole outlook and perspective on what's going on in women's basketball and why Jill Biden and the Biden family care about what's going on in women's basketball. I'm about to break it all down. So last night, a friend sent me an angry text. He was upset that First Lady Jill Biden wants the Iowa women's basketball team to accompany national champion LSU to the White House. This text read this. This is effing ridiculous. So the all white team loses and gets an invite to the White House for sportsmanship. It's a friend of mine. Good guy. Trust me. It's former athlete, married father of three, has daughters, passionate sports fan. Like many black Americans, my friend sees issues through a racial lens first, first, not exclusively, but first. Social norms have programmed us to see the world in stark black and white contrast. Jill Biden's Jill Biden's interest in Kaitlyn Clark in the Iowa Hawkeyes must be tied to race. There could be no other explanation. Well, actually, there is another explanation. Politics. Politics are at the root of Biden's interest in the Hawkeyes. Jill Biden is conducting outreach to the state that hosts the first presidential primary slash caucus of the 2024 election cycle. Perhaps more important, Jill Biden's recruiting Kaitlyn Clark. Democrats control culture. They dictate what is broadcast on television, showcase the movie theaters, popular on the radio, and who has the most influence via Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Well, guess what? Kaitlyn Clark appears to be the next big thing in sports. She feels like Tiger Woods and Steph Curry rolled into the same package. She's the biggest star in all of college sports. Stick with me here. I mean, that sounds incredible. Some woman basketball player that she hadn't heard up two weeks ago. She's the biggest star in college sports. All right, name another college athlete, male or female with as much name recognition as Kaitlyn Clark. You can't do it. No one can name anyone who played in last night's men's championship. I think that was San Diego State versus Yukon. Did anybody watch? Did anybody really care that game was awful? Who the Danny Hurley and Brian Dutcher? I know them because I'm a hardcore sports journalist. You don't. Those were the coaches. The only player that I can name is I think a dude named Lamont Frazier hit the shot for San Diego State that put them into the championship game. I mean, hardcore sports writer sports fan. Lamont Frazier, if he walked in here right now, I wouldn't know him. I know his name because he hit a shot. But if he walked in here other than being tall, I wouldn't bat an eye. I wouldn't know. So let's move over to football because that's where college, that's where the stars are really at in basketball. We know that's been ruined by the one and done. They all run to the NBA and no one knows who they are unless they're involved in some murder investigation like Brandon Miller at Alabama. But Brandon Miller is from Nashville, Tennessee. If he walked in here right now, I might recognize him because he's really tall and it would make me think. But if not for that murder investigation, who knows who Brandon Miller is and he's probably going to be the number one pick in the NBA draft. But Caitlyn Clark, she dwarfs everybody including Caleb Williams, the USC quarterback. That dude won the high placement trophy last year. I love college football. I played college football. If Williams walked into this studio right now, he would have to introduce himself to me. He'd just be another little six foot guy walking into this office. If Caitlyn Clark walked in here, I'd recognize her instantly. I'd probably even be a little bit starstruck and I've only seen two of her games. She's different. Her style of play is unique. It's must see TV. Caitlyn Williams plays exactly like every other six foot quarterback. Lincoln Riley has coached to the Heisman Trophy. Caitlyn Williams is a gimmick. Caitlyn Clark is a force of nature. She drove women's basketball to new heights. The Iowa LSU game recorded the highest television ratings in the history of women's basketball. Nearly 10 million Americans watched Clark take on the Tigers. Next season, I'll follow Caitlyn Clark from start to finish. Next season, if the right teens make it to the women's final four, they'll do better ratings than the men. That's my prediction. If Caitlyn Clark is in the final four next year and there's some woman named Paige that plays for Yukon that they say she's pretty good too. And then if LSU with Angel Reese and her loud mouth and Don Staley's whining South Carolina team, they make it to the final four. Holy cow. Those ratings will dwarf the men. So you know what? Democrats want Caitlyn Clark on their team because Democrats are smart like that. They control the culture. They want to use Caitlyn Clark to reach sports fans and moderate conservatives. Democrats are praying that Clark is a member of their most important constituency. The alphabet mafia. Yep. Let's deal with the elephant in the room. Joe Biden does not care about upsetting the LSU Tigers or black voters. LSU star Angel Reese called Biden's dual White House invitation a joke. Reese's teammate Alexis Morris tweeted, Michelle Obama, can we LSU national champs come celebrate our win at your house? Joe Biden and Democrat strategists are laughing with joy. Iowa at the White House with the Biden's and LSU at the Black House with the Obamas is the dream scenario. Both houses serve the same God, agenda and constituency. The BLM LGBTQ plus silent P alphabet mafia. The alleged race war is clever camouflage for the real culture war taking place in America. The real war is over gender and sexuality. It's a proxy war initiated by Satan to dislodge America from Christian values. Democrats have sent black people to the front lines of this gender war under the false belief they're fighting the KKK except the Democrats they call them the proud boys or the old keepers or whatever name they come up with. Whatever group the FBI has infiltrated to be the face of white supremacy and you got all these black people on the front lines. Oh I'm fighting the KKK. This is just like the 1960s. Oh my god I'm reliving. Oh I'm marching on Selma. The Edmund Pettus Bridge. Oh I'm in this race war and everybody standing around them has purple hair and has convinced themselves that there are men living in a woman's body and no one can shake up shake themselves and spot the real. Why am I surrounded by the alphabet mafia? I thought this was a race war because it's not a race war. That's the dumb do-do they sell you and you believe and buy to go fight in their sexuality war. LeBron James he's the uncle Sam of the Democrat party. He's plastered on posters telling black people we want you for the Black Lives Matter Army which is just a front group for the alphabet mafia. The Bidens want to recruit Caitlyn Clark for a more explicit alphabet mafia propaganda campaign. Guess who the number one demographic is for women's basketball? Who does that appeal to most lesbians and drag queens? When the WNBA Finals are going on in your city you can't buy a strap on anywhere in that city they're sold out. Caitlyn Clark is the first women's basketball star to reach an audience outside the base. She's not Anna Corner Coven the Soul Tree pin-up tennis star. Clark is all baller the attraction is Clark's game not her sex appeal she's relatable. She's not an overly muscle giant she's not tattered she's not Brittany Grinden. Clark is skilled and yes she's white and homegrown. When the national anthem played Clark and the Hawkeyes looked like the song meant something to them LSU did not take the court for Sunday's national anthem. The Bidens want to groom Clark for leadership. No one needs to groom Angel Reese and Alexis Moore's or even Don Staley the South Carolina coach. Their entire identities are tied to the Democratic Party from abortion to same-sex marriage to transgenderism. There's no Democrat policy black women or men will object to over religious or moral principle nothing. There's nothing we won't do for the privilege of writing books giving speeches and pontificating on TV about white racism and a corporate job in a diversity equity and inclusion department black elites pledge unconditional loyalty to the Democratic Party. You toss in an autograph picture of Barack and Michelle Obama and most black voters will volunteer as entertainment at a same-sex party on Epstein Island. Yeah we're that cheap. I'm sorry if you don't like it. I'm it repulses me how cheap we are and how easy we are to throw out our values to fight in this gender and sexuality war. What we lie to ourselves and pretend like we're fighting in some sort of racial war and we're fighting for our racial survival. We're that cheap that simple-minded that easy. We're blow-up dolls for the Democratic Party. That's why Jill Biden would go to that game watch the predominantly black team beat the all-white team and say this is what she basically did to LSU. I need this little white girl because y'all y'all don't care about yourself you don't respect yourself you'll do anything I tell you to do. If we pulled Jeffrey Epstein up out of the grave right now and I told you to drop to your knees and pleasure this man you all would do it. She don't care about Angel Reese, Alexis Morris or any of them. You're taken for granted. That's why she feels comfortable inviting Iowa to LSU's White House Party. Angel Reese ain't going nowhere. The Bidens don't know what Caitlin Clark is going to do. They want to secure her support in the support of all the sports fans who love her. It's a smart play in a game of chess. Caitlin Clark can reach far more independent voters than LeBron James. They got LeBron. LeBron's a soldier in that army. He's the poster child the useful idiot in their army. They're recruiting Caitlin Clark. Her support is up for grabs. Who knows what team she plays on. This is all political. You have to take the racial blinders off and deal with reality. The race thing is settled. Let me break some news to you. Black folks. We lost. Our families are destroyed and in total chaos. Joe Biden, LBJ, the whole Democratic Party ran through us. Ain't no race war. Ain't nobody care about uh ain't nobody making decisions based on race. We're taken for granted. There's no we've been destroyed by their policies and keep signing up for more and more of their policies. We keep pretending. Oh, we're the most you know black people we conservative. We're religious. Except on anything that matters. Yes. You know what? Hey, throw your religious beliefs out the window and support transgenderism. Done. Throw your religious beliefs out the window and support abortion. Done. Throw your religious beliefs out the window and support same-sex marriage. Sign me up. Give me a man to marry. That's how obedient we are. While sitting around pretending like some proud boys that ain't none of us never seen, don't know, ain't in our neighborhoods, have no impact on our lives. We only hear about them on TV. Oh, the proud boys in Charlottesville. Oh my God. Crypts and bloods are one thing in their neighborhood and shoot up everybody. You won't utter or say a word, but you want to look out for the proud boys. It's embarrassing. The shove it in your face. Literally. There was a picture. I wish I had asked y'all to grab this picture. Maybe you can look it up while I'm talking. But there's a picture of Jill Biden at that women's national championship game. She's sitting up in the audience, Billie Jean King's off the one side. And she surrounded by all these female lieutenants in the alphabet army. And y'all think Jill Biden is thinking about y'all. There, yeah, there's the picture right there. Yeah. That those are lieutenants in the alphabet army. I don't dislike these women. I get, they're playing for a team. I don't play for. I don't dislike them, but Jill Biden's letting you know who she's down with and what this is all about. Give a damn about black people, black women. We're taken for granted. We will support anything they tell us. We're pet animals, dogs for the Democrat party. They don't have to recruit us. She's reaching out to Caitlin Clark and Iowa because they have to be recruited. They have to be groomed. They have to be offered real tangible things for their support. There's no racist play. Even, you know, even again, I don't know that I think Jill Biden is any friend of ours, but they're doing business. This is politics. Take the racial blinders off and look at the big picture. Quit playing one D chess or even half D chess. Again, as Roy said, this is a game of 12 D. This thing is so layered and so deep and we can't afford to have this simplistic mindset of everything is about race, particularly when that has been settled. We bought all of their policies and adopted them and we're paying the consequences for them. Our kids can barely read at a high school level. Our men don't work. Our women have no use for men. And y'all think they sitting around worried about us? We're an afterthought. The alphabet people are the priority. It's their war now. We've been conquered. We signed up to be alphabet soldiers. And many of us have no idea that that's the team we're fighting for. What it is. That came off a bit more angry than I anticipated, but I guess I'm angry. I apologize. I want to invite those of you that actually want to fight in a different world war, actually want to fight on God's team. I want to invite you all to Nashville in 11 days, April 15th. There's still time for you to sign up. We're very close to selling out, but I want you all to go to fearlessarmyrollcall.com. I want you to join us here in Nashville so you can get an explanation about what team you're supposed to be on. Who you're supposed to be fighting for. God, His will, His vision. Come up out of this little foolish racial idolatry war that they have you trapped in. Come up off Satan's team and again, I don't have everything figured out. I'm not the smartest person on the planet in this room at this event, but I do have good instincts. I do have common sense. I'm not going to play for the team that wants to murder our babies in the womb, that want to sanction the mutilation of young children as they cut their penises off, destroy their vaginas, cut their breasts off in some kind of gender confusion war that they have going on. I'm not going to debate whether men can get pregnant. I'm not going to be hostile to truths that are spelled out in the first chapters of Genesis. Y'all can debate that dumps or play on the team that wants to debate that. I'm not. And you shouldn't come up out of it, come accept the challenge and responsibility of being men and leaders. The last thing I want to say because I want to get to Delano, but I need go to fearlessarmyrollcall.com. Delano will be speaking there. We got music, fun, the whole deal. But I lost my train of thought sucks getting old. I'm too hyped up to angry and I don't want to speak out of anger. But I do want you to come up out of the delusion that oh, this was the point I wanted to make that this is, but I would I need to get into it with Royce or TJ Mo or Steve Kim or whatever. But are we watching what's going on in the sports world in terms of, and I don't want to give you too much to think about. I've already unpacked the Caitlin Clark in one way and I don't want anybody to think I got a problem with Caitlin Clark or Iowa or any of these. But I can just see what's going on and this whole elevation of women's sports. And it's not and I enjoy the games. I'm going to follow women's college basketball next season. But I can see where this is going. They're trying to unseat and they're having success. They're going to unseat men in the sports world. This plan is coming together beautifully because of the neglect of men. We have neglected institutions and entertainment options that have served men well. We've neglected and we've destroyed men's college basketball with the one and done and all these kids must be allowed to go straight to the NBA or else it's racially exploitive. Everything is always explained. It's racism. They won't let them go to the NBA because of racism. We have to let them do it. And we just go for that. When I was saying for years, hey, there's a way that the NBA can pay in conjunction with the television networks can pay these men to stay in college basketball, develop their brands, become big stars in the college game, and then take that to the NBA. That's the best process for the NBA and for men's college basketball. Instead, David Stern and the other secular Jewish elites decided to go a different direction with the NBA. They're going to destroy college basketball and they've done it and they've done it and you know what's replacing them now? Women's college basketball and you know why they want women at the head of that because they know women's college basketball. What's the demographic? Who will they be installing as big stars in brand influences? Who? Will it be young heterosexual women who want to be wives and mothers? Or will it be young Billie Jean Kings? Not to demonize Billie Jean King but she plays for a different team. She's part of the feminist matriarchal alphabet mafia movement and that's what they're going to make college sports about. Empowering the next batch of Billie Jean Kings. We've allowed it. We've neglected men's sports and that's why no one cares about San Diego State UConn and everybody cares about Iowa and LSU and we're going to see more and more and more of that and those of you with kids and young sons are going to be watching them displaced at the high school and college level by the next generation of Billie Jean Kings. Good luck with it. You did that. Congratulations. A lot of us choirs next. The atheist, the secular world, the culture uses our imperfection, our sins to shut up. You can't stand on truth and if all it was was imperfection it eliminated us from standing on truth. This would be a very quiet place. I'm trying to be as loud as I can and as transparent as I can to try to inspire other men. We know you're imperfect. You know you're imperfect. God's grace and mercy gives you the right to stand on his truth and to speak that loudly into the culture. We have to do it. You can look around and say these guys have taken over everything. They own the CDC, the NIH. They got the president, his transgender surgery for children. Colleges today are nothing but leftist indoctrination centers working fully against the Bible. What's the alternative? So you're going to stop fighting today and you're going to let the government raise your kids and you're going to turn around and let them chop off your 12-year-old daughter's breasts and let them sterilize your son and tell him that he's a girl and you're going to let him make the Bible hate speech. You're the last line of defense here because nobody else is going to do it and God's going to walk with you. This is literally worth dying for. I'm telling you so it's like everybody that's a nice little metaphor. This is it. If there's a hill to die on this is it. The over the window has been moved right in front of our children's bedrooms and there are all types of people that are trying to climb up in the ladder and every good father should be on his post so that when they peek their head up over the window sill you kick the ladder back down let them know you move on to the other house because we're not playing that around here. Sometimes just standing up just saying no we're not going to do that. Not my marriage not my kids not my family not my community not my church not my city. Just declaring that that's victory enough in prepping his disciples he tells Peter he's like listen Satan desires to sift you as wheat but I've prayed for you. We're going to face some ups and downs in life and we're not going to always get it together but if we stay on the path if we stay chasing after running after Jesus running after his way he's even praying for us. Now I like it when you pray for me Jason and TJ I appreciate that but to have Jesus pray for me that makes me feel pretty good when you make it through this sifting process go back and strengthen your brothers. So we all have a responsibility as men once he's delivered me through this I have a responsibility to go back and bring some other folk out. You do a roll call to just let people know you're not alone be confident in your positions and we're going to inspire you. We're on e- fellowship listen to some music it's going to be the first of many roll calls that we do so we're looking for soldiers we're going to put out our best recruiting pitches for soldiers. After years of battling Big Tech we're no longer willing to play their game and watch them stifle our reach cutting us off from you. It's time to make a big change go to the blaze.com for some exciting updates and join the fight against Big Tech censorship. All right welcome back before we get to Delano I want to tell you about a new movie coming out. Pretty sure it's something you're going to want to see. I've already seen it it's by the same people who made gods not dead and unplanned movies called nefarious. You've seen the poster of the trailer it looks great but it looks a little scary. I've seen it it is a little scary it's a bit of a horror film but it's more of a psychological thriller it's based on a book by my good friend friend of the show the blazer's own Steve Dase it's more like a CS Lewis book Screwtape letters. I like to call it interview with a demon a psychiatrist is called into a prison and meet with a convicted killer who's about to be executed. The killer says he's a demon named nefarious and the psychiatrist who doesn't believe in God or demons has to decide if the man is insane pretending to be insane or ah I won't give it away but let's just say that the psychiatrist he's a little bit out of his death. This supernatural thriller is perfect for your friends who love scary films but more than that they love going to church. You're going to have some great conversations afterwards nefarious opens nationwide the weekend of April 14th mark the date and get your tickets now at who is nefarious dot com that is who is nefarious dot com. I've already seen the movie I can authentically uh recommend the movie to you it is good you guys know I'm very very hard critic on movies I walk out of most most movies if I don't walk out I fall asleep in movies I would say 50% of movies I walk out on another 20% I'm bored with and then there's that 30% that I actually enjoy did I do that math right 50% 20% yeah I think I did that math right there's about 30% of movies I actually enjoy and can wholeheartedly recommend if I like a movie you'll love a movie if I love a movie you'll actually think it's one of the greatest things you've ever seen this movie gets my full endorsement this ain't because of me and Steve days of friends I've tweeted about this when I saw the movie a couple of months ago movies great go see it all right now we can get to uh my main man Delano Squires get a little smarter with this conversation Delano has written a column today that I think has uh synergy with uh what I was talking about today as it relates to uh Caitlin Clark Delano has written this Delano's column is a little bit personal for me just because he's writing about William C. Rodin longtime sports columnist was with the New York Times for a long time he now writes for ESPN's website called landscape that used to be uh the undefeated he's writing about the transgender issue as it relates to women's college basketball William Rodin's most known for writing a book called uh 40 million dollar slaves uh Delano describes a man who has turned into the uh 40,000 dollar rainbow overseer uh Delano unpack your column and what William Rodin is is talking about and and then you and I are going to dive into this sure so Jason when I when I saw the column on landscape um it talked about title line and how quote unquote trans athletes which always means men who think they are women um how those athletes are going to be you know accommodated in in college basketball and from the from the beginning you could tell that you know William Rodin is taking a sympathetic stance on this particular issue so he he talks to Kim Monk he talks to Dawn Staley he talks to the coach at Virginia Tech I'm uh coach Brooks and it is clear from readingness that everyone involved in this piece particularly the adults are completely scared of offending the trans lobby right of offending the the the pry power movement and my piece basically makes the point that William Rodin a man who as you said is most famous for writing about 40 million slaves and arguing that black athletes have sort of lost their revolutionary streak because they've been handcuffed by all the money that they've amassed um he now is the official scribe of of the rainbow brigade and he picks up his pen puts his hand to the plow every day without question um while being watched by overseas at ESPN rainbow whip in hand and and while he has passed his prime the primary role that William Rodin and men like him Kevin Blackestone to a lesser extent my will bond the primary role that they play in today's social landscape is to keep other men like them in line and I made the point they are so well trained Jason that they will go after a free man and and make him think that he's a slave so when Tony Dungy says you know he he supports biblical sexual ethics marriage between one man one woman you know biblical definitions of man and woman um his pro-life sort of advocacy here comes Kevin Blackestone right right to the plow Tony Dungy is basically a white supremacist and you know an eraser's in a bigot and and then in jumps Dr. Harry Edwards again another man of you know faux revolutionary right who might have been radical in the 60s but now he's part of the status quo and he's calling Tony Dungy a bigot so my my entire point is that that entire generation of men have been defanged there is nothing in them that's revolutionary anymore and that's because the revolution has been corporatized and and Bill Rodin Harry Edwards Kevin Blackestone and and the people like them and the journalists that come underneath them the Jamel Hills the the Bomani Jones is the Ryan Clark's have no problem saying Donald Trump is a racist have no problem criticizing you know any white player who they feel has made a racial microaggression but if you ask them to to to define the word woman or to comment on whether men should be in woman sports then it's going to be fumbling and stubbling the tip toeing all around so and I and I say this as someone who I respect my elders and I respect people who've come before me but if you're going to paint yourself as a revolutionary as someone who speaks truth to power then I'm going to need you to at least be able to say that that a man is not a woman and a woman is not a man and and here's where I and and you know this Jason a lot of Black folk get online talk about what what they would have done if there was a civil rights movement man if they did police put them dogs on me I ain't finna take that I'll be I'll be out on the streets and I'll be doing this and I burn it down but it's hard for me to think that someone is going with a stood against the color line in 1963 when they can't even can't even affirm the sex binary in 2023 and that's where all of these people find themselves so you just rattled off names of guys that I know them all I mean and these are my peers these are people many of them I used to be close with how do I I once when Bill Rodin had the book out 40 million dollar slave I introduced him in Kansas City when he hosted a book signing there and a conversation and I think I hosted that conversation was the moderator that conversation Bill is someone I've known many many same with Kevin Blackestone you through Mike Wilbon in there someone I certainly greatly respected I'm it's like man and and obviously I've at one time I had a relationship with Jamel Hill and trying to had a relationship with Beaumani Jones and and what is fascinating where I think the synergy and what we're talking about is what has blown my mind away is how supportive they all are on this LGBTQ plus IA silent P transgender deal it's like that is their master and and it's our master as I'm not talking about me and you I'm just talking about us as black people it it this racial dynamic is like a little fake war that we're found here fighting the race war it's the 1960s and that's what Bill Rodin's really about and what you are exposing is like no what he's really fighting is the transgender war look at this column he's endorsing this without any shame he knows that's his job and you have every right to question whether like does he really believe this the bill Rodin I was reading in the 90s and 2000s was he really just a alphabet soldier in hiding that whole time or is he doing this because they told him to do this and he has no choice and if that is the case quit pretending that you're a revolutionary you're just a hired mercenary in the alphabet war absolutely and to be fair I'm not going to assume how anyone lives their personal life because I don't know these people personally I don't know what people do and you know the sort of the privacy of their own home but here's what I do know the last thing that someone who has built their identity on oppression wants to be seen as as is as the oppressor of someone else and the the pry power movement understands this very well so not only have they hijacked the language of the civil rights movement they have taken the rhetoric and basically turned it around on black folk and are using it like a weapon and holding people like bill Rodin and you know all the other people that I'm talking about they're holding them at gunpoint and and it's not just it's not just him because I talk about in the piece when he asked the LSU coach and then dawned staley about their views on this topic and and kudos to him for at least asking it because most people don't even want to touch it both of them started out by saying well I want to be sensitive I don't want to offend anybody now these are women who hyper competitive you know top of their game last two national champions right have have have built a career I'm sure they would say fighting against the patriarchy fighting to have women included fighting for title nine Kim mokey fighting against sexism dawned staley fighting against the intersection of sexism and racism and bill bill Rodin asked them hey do you think we should make juan a man turn it from a comedy into a docu drama and they and well I don't I don't I don't I don't want to say anything so what's clear to me if this is to your point is that one phobia beats two isms that's that's the way the hand gets dealt nowadays and these women who will say that they've been fighting sexism and sexism plus racism are now have been backed into the corner for fear of being called transphobic and bigoted and as I've said before in other in other appearances the most powerful and influential women in America oftentimes feminists of one stripe or another have finally found a group of men they willing to submit to because it's easy for dawn staley to take a stance about you know against playing at BYU because that's a university in utah's 80 white 95 Mormon it's easy for her to take that stance and and play you know woman king of you know the nc women's college basketball it's easy for her to do that but when you ask her hey should should if if LeBron James or brawny james all of a sudden say you know what competition is a little tight you know on the men's circuit I'm going to identify alaziah weighed for the next two years as a woman and I'm going to go and play college basketball if you ask her whether that's a good thing she moonwalk in like Michael Jackson so I don't listen to any of these people who beat their chest and talk about how brave they are how revolutionary they are or any other nonsense if you cannot speak timeless truth because Jason this is not even about you know same-sex mirage this is not about whether two men or two women should be able to get married this is this is about affirming truth if you cannot do that if you are too scared or too ignorant to do that you should not be in a position of leadership because cowards make terrible leaders because all that stands between you and selling out everyone and everything that everyone you know and everything you believe in is having the political pressure turned up high enough and that's what you're seeing now so that's why I'm saying all these these chirpy women and and and and the dudes that you know think that they were comic-capping it back in the day they had the full length leather they had the dashi key they had the fists in the air they're toothless because because when them overseas as a ESPN start cracking that rainbow whip it's oh man listen we we loved Tony Dungy 10 years ago he was an icon he was a trendsetter he was a barrier breaker but now he's a bigot in a white supremacist please it's it's really sad and I think it it it this conversation what you wrote about has great synergy with what in my view what I wrote about in terms of people are trying to figure out Jill Biden why is she offering up Iowa hey you guys come to the White House too she knows that that's going to sound offensive to the LSU players she knows that some black people are going to be offended by that but she doesn't care the Biden administration doesn't care because their real agenda is Iowa and the caucus in Iowa that could end up being important if if her husband gets challenged for the democratic nomination and then more than anything it's it's about the LGBTQ deal and women's basketball is something that appeals to the alphabet crowd and and LSU with Kim Mulkey and again I know Kim Mulkey Kim Mulkey flaw person like anybody else but is a believer caught some heat because she wouldn't let Brittany Griner just go full bull what it bull what I'm not gonna say but wouldn't let her just live her lifestyle out in the open wallet dealer didn't support Brittany Griner's whole little incarceration gimmick or whatever that was over in Russia and and so Kim Mulkey is a woman I think the Bidens want to know where the Iowa basketball team stands where Caitlin Clark stands and and and and one because they know that Caitlin Clark's going to be important and potentially the most important woman in college sports or in sports I mean she could you know she could end up replacing Serena now that Serena has retired and so they're out recruiting Caitlin Clark in my view to be a spokesman for the Democratic Party that they want to get their hooks in her early that's what I think this is clearly about so so Jason you you made me think about this in a different way because I hadn't seen that aspect I just thought you know Dr. Jill Biden was you know speaking in the moment a little tone deaf not reading the room obviously she probably has you know some black surrogates around her who got in her ear and told her how this was playing out in social media and particularly on Twitter and that's why you see that they've since pulled back and tried to clean up the statement but but I definitely think you're onto something and and the one part that I whole hardly agree on is that Democrats know that black voters particularly black women are not going anywhere they're not going anywhere these are women who spent almost two years calling Joe Biden uncle Joe allowing him to sniff their hair when when he was out at different events you know cheering on when Cardi B interviewed him so they they know that that that you know these these women I don't go anywhere they may get a little bit upset and want to run to the Obamas and you know go to their house and celebrate with you know Barack and Michelle but they but they know that they're not going anywhere um but that's welcome there exactly exactly so but but to the larger point I do agree that the pride power movement has completely colonized and supplanted the civil rights movement the civil rights movement as as we knew it right the struggle for as people some people may say black liberation racial justice is over it is over it's done now in some ways that's that's a in many ways this is a great thing I just sure it shows that you know this is a country a large country opportunities are wide open and and if you work hard and and you know particularly if you have support from your family you got a great faith foundation you can you can do great things and even if you don't have those things some people are just so supremely talented that they can just make it work but right now the the democrats clearly prioritize all things related to pride sex sexuality and gender identity over anything related to race they will throw black folks a few a few scraps but they understand something that we don't politics is a business businesses incurrence expenses in order to sell products a good entrepreneur understands the difference between those two things so they will they will pay you know some of money for electricity for water you know for the delivery of products for merchandise in order to to sell something now the expenses are all the racial justice stuff they're willing to pay those expenses because they they know that we think that that's their main product but it's not they're willing to pay lip service to racial justice they want to pay lip service to unions they want to play pay lip service to fighting gun violence all that other stuff in order to sell their main products and right now it's pride it's abortion and then in a more distant third it's climate change those are the main products of the national democratic party and the lgbt stuff appeals to them because it's a growth market they've they've spent the last 60 years convincing uh well i say 30 years convincing black women to kill later on off spring so we we are a population that's that's frozen at 13 and 20 of gen z americans identifies lgbt so you're right you know this is a smart political play for the bidens and if they can recruit katlin clark and i i don't i don't know her background i hope she has a strong base i hope she has a strong faith and that she can actually be a champion for women's sports but you know they're gonna try to recruit her and it's just like you know some girls you grew up in a city you know in the inapolis new york field llphia there's that one girl's high school where you know if you go there they're gonna turn you out and you know a lot of girls come back with with horror stories and in many respects there's an aspect a segment of uh women's basketball that's like that actually i remember a wmba star spoke out a couple years ago talking about how hostile the league was to straight women so yeah i i see the play and i think your analysis of it is is spot on everything today is about pride and and they know that to your point there there is a large segment of the black political population who do not mind playing the harlot to the democratic parties priorities and as you said we will we will completely discard the faith that we claim to have and make up excuses as to why you know we've abandoned our definitions of marriage and why we now think that men can get pregnant here's the deal that i feel like has been cut and you know combining the two topics together your column in mind it feels like to me for William Rodden and uh michael eric dyson and just uh jimel hill and um bo mani and for all of them the deal that's cut is like hey we're gonna give you a job you don't have to really develop your craft because you're just gonna be a one trick pony go on tv and write columns about racism just go your job put a batter in your back and you can say is anything you want about race you can say anything you want about white people and christians related to race you'll never face any resistance we won't let anyone challenge you we've got social media rigged up that you know there won't be much challenge and it'll all be framed as well those are racist people but but so take this deal you can have this platform you can have this job but there's these critical issues we're going to need you to be allies on and the number one issue is it's when you sign on that dotted line it's like so lgbtq i8 plus silent p you're going to sell all of that we're going to let you screen racism and blah blah but you got to sell all these other letters in the alphabet and and that to me when i when i read the piece you sent me a bill road that i was like man this dude took the incomplete deal he's out here selling the transgender thing and it's like that's the deal that's being cut because i look at people say just really ill logical things about race and and they face no resistance no pushback for it but trust me if they step out of line on this transgender issue watch all that change and watch them all get silenced just like you said they got a rainbow whip they will whip that's that's the one thing they'll bring out and get at nick road 20 lashes with the rainbow whip he didn't sell it hard enough but that's the deal that all these people seem to have cut joy read is it you know that say as much illogical stupid racist stuff as you want we'll cover for it we'll pay you for it but because think of joy read go back to her blogs this woman was raised in the church she had a biblical worldview she gave it all away for a paycheck yep this this is the 20 pieces of silver they talk about it she took it and and you know and and anybody that doesn't take the deal is called an idiot or or a sellout the people that turn down the deal are the sellouts the the irony is is so rich there um a couple things you said one and and and i i say this and i think this will resonate with you and it's resonating with me more as people who are dedicating themselves and have been dedicated to a particular craft um the quality of writing and thinking particularly as it relates to publications focused on black folk has i mean gone straight into the toilet i'd say over the last 10 years i mean for whatever people may you know whatever disagreements people may have with tana hossey coals in his analysis tana hossey coals was a good writer now he went into a blue period where he became to me sort of fatalistic and it was it was predictable writing but he has a way with words these other people jason the one thing that i look forward to with the emergence of chat gpt and ai is that all of these jokers gonna be out of a job because their columns are basically some version of insert white man doing something bad to black people insert you know some media phony controversy they trying to ban black history um they're trying to do it because they're afraid white people's powers are being threatened and they respond by insert racism sexism homophobia transfer bazina phobia exomaphobia so on and so on and so forth insert this is what happened 60 years ago so on and so on and so forth and this is why we need to fight again like it was you know 1964 and and peace submit it's garbage the root is garbage the grille is garbage because all the and you named all these different people and and all of them i would put under the banner of the afrostocracy the black progressive politicians pundits professors preachers and performance the black ruling class has completely sold its soul and that's a i responded to uh ture right i i have one his books at home who's afraid of post blackness i remember when he had some funny clips when he interviewed our kelly this guy you know he used to be an actual journalist and now he posted a picture of a drag queen reading to kids and and somebody asked him hey are you different gonna defend this and he was like i'm gonna defend this all day long and i'm saying to myself what kind of grown man defends some other grown man dressing like a caricature of a woman and being around somebody's children what kind of weirdo is this but the back of the day Jason the freaks came out at night and now they come out on twitter and they don't mind displaying who they are you know all day long so yeah this this is only going to get worse this right now we're at about a uh 99.9 fever and i've and i've seen my kids get up to 102 103 maybe 104 so it's it's gonna get worse because this is how an entire generation of young people are being trained they have no thoughts they have no way of explaining the world they have no worldview outside of racism systemic racism which is always the definition is always morphing and changing right it's it's not the same as it used to be it's secret now it's more pernicious so it's unfortunate because the the sad fact is that many of us even black folks who you know may describe ourselves as center right we have loved ones who we know are not you know not down for this pride stuff who they feed at the trough of MSNBC CNN, Joy Reed, Don Lamont, Jonathan Capehart all these people and there heads are being pumped full of this stuff all the time it's hate Trump it's it's we need bigger government better white people in order for black people to succeed and every single problem in our communities is explained through the lens of systemic racism everything everything um that that has a disproportionate impact on black folk is described with systemic racism except abortion so that that's that's the big that's the big exception and and this is the difference between them and us right on this show we regularly make the argument that a man and in this case let's say a black man but a man in general needs to find him a good thing a wife and create a family he's willing to die for and the message from the Afro-stocracy handed down by their white overseers is that black folk need to kill they own offspring and that is the central difference between them and us thank you Delano I gotta move on I got a bone I want to pick with uh Shamika she's done something that's really irritated me uh so Shamika Michelle hit the lights hit the lights Shamika Michelle next all right welcome back we're gonna roll out to North Carolina uh bring in Shamika Michelle I think Shamika is trolling me you guys I'm not sure how many of you guys know but some guys in Kansas City developed this app the approval rating app we've been showing it to you on screen these guys were fans of my show speak for yourself followed me over to the blaze and and the approval rating app is not like everybody can rate celebrities movies music whatever you can download the app in the app store apple google whatever but Shamika is on here and and I want you to look at her Caitlin Clark approval rating she's got Caitlin Clark at a 68 she she she rates her job performance at 22 her character at 15 I'm not gonna gripe about that uh worth the dollars she's got her at a 19 but here's what irritate it factor it factor at a 12 or overall total of 68 in a grease fire Shamika how can the woman who just created the highest rated women's basketball game in history all by herself what nobody tuned in to watch LSU they wanted to see this little white girl who because she's a baller 10 million people watch she's got the whole country Jill Biden's trying to invite her to the White House even though she didn't win how you gonna tell me this little white girl and got it it's the who's got more it right now than Caitlin Clark how well how is this possible well I gave you angel Reese a higher it factor score than Caitlin Clark how okay so I gave her a 12 for all of those reasons that you described yes I do think people too D and yes I do think she is the reason it was the highest rating that's why she got a 12 but I had to not give her as many points because when I do it factors a lot of times I include appearance and I'm not pepai or Brutus so 12 with as high as I could go for those reasons you stated same with angel Reese I thought she's a little bit better looking but I had to take off points for the eyelashes and the hair hat so she only got three more points for actually being built more like a woman Jamaica I'm that hold on there's descriptions here I want to go hold on yeah it factor well dang it I was gonna say oh I'm looking at the description of it factor and it does say charisma looks and star power I was gonna say I was gonna criticize you for taking looks into an account and it's for so okay but it says charisma looks and star power to star power off the charts charisma off the charts so two of the three categories she's off the charts a 12 makes no sense well you know appearance is a lot for some of us and I am one of those people but I don't I don't know about star power being that much or charisma I haven't really seen her you know be that charismatic so she doesn't get that much for me for charisma did you watch the game I watched bits and pieces of it Jason in between good conversation I wasn't like locked though game do you know how hard it is for women to get 10 million people to watch a basketball game because again there'll be 10 women on the court and only two or three of them actually have any skill at all and angel Reese ain't one of them she's just tall them two guards for LSU are actually skilled and and Caitlin is skilled it's hard to get 10 million people to watch women's basketball and this woman did it all by herself I just this was outrageous to me this isn't I don't want people to think oh this is just to give me with like just one people to download that app no no when I looked at this because I get a notification on my every time Shamika does some sort of update or whatever I get a notification I look oh what does she do with Caitlin Clark and I saw this 12 I'm like stop the cap and then when I saw you had angel Reese rated higher than her you got angel Reese ahead of her in job performance no no no the little white girl is national player of the year no I don't have her head of her in job performance are you sure uh-huh Caitlin has a 22 in job performance I gave angel a 18 in job performance so I gave a little white girl yeah I gave her points even though she lost and almost doesn't count but I gave her a few points because now you gave angel a 21 in job performance busted you gave her a 21 18 I'm looking at the app me too oh mine has I need to refresh huh you got her oh oh no you know what I'm looking at my own rating I'm looking at my own my bad all right I'm looking at my own I gave her 21 huh I said I was fair although I feel like I could have taken Caitlin down some for not finishing that always get you a few points taken away but not finishing they they called a bogus technical foul owner and took her out of the game they ruined the reps ruined it anyway all right that's all I got that's listen you can join this app and I can argue with you as well you put some rating in here that I don't like we may call you up and put you on the show so that I can berate you and get you right so join the approval rating app get at the app store on apple the google store wherever if you got one of them android phones anyway that's it that's all for us place them tomorrow we'll see you tomorrow i have freedom sitting on a corner never been on a wrecking my back for free bless we are living it back we are receiving all the seed when we are on the beat for you we're on freedom i just want i want to be i just want i want to be i just want i want to be i just want"
