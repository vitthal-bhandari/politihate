    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome in the Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show, our number two Tuesday edition. Encourage all of you go subscribe to the podcast. Appreciate wherever you are listening all over this country. Nearly 500 affiliate stations, tens of millions of podcast downloads, one of the biggest audio networks anywhere in the world. And we are happy to be with you guys here today discussing so many different stories. Right off the top, the Nashville Police Department has got a press conference scheduled about nine minutes from now that May, and I stress May, go into discussing the manifesto and the particular motivations behind this deranged trans killer who entered into a religious elementary school, killed three kids, nine years old, and three adults as well. All of that, we will continue to follow that maybe what they are going to discuss in this press conference that starts about nine minutes will be rolling on it will be paying attention. But as we have continued to talk about the bravery of the Nashville Police Department, and I'd encourage all of you again, as we said in the first hour, to make sure you go watch these videos that have been released by the Nashville Police Department of the individual police body cameras, six minute clip to me in particular, just takes you into the worldview, literally, of these police officers as they are responding to an active school shooter situation all the way up through, to be fair, the violent ending where they take down this shooter. Encourage all of you to go watch that. I think it is incredibly important for for great police work to be shared as widely as police poor work as potentially criminal work or as the cowardice that we saw in you all day. I think it's important to share this clinical takedown of this killer. Now, I mentioned that this is a trans killer. This is a biological woman, 28 years old, who was identifying as a man. And Buck, there are a couple of messages that I screenshot it that I wanted to read to you. This is a message that has now been written about one of the final messages shared by this killer. And I try, and I know you do too, Buck, to avoid using the names of mass killers because the data reflects that the more you make these people famous and share their names and their images widely, the more likely they are to engage in these heinous behaviors going all the way back to Columbine when it started. So this is a message from this killer. And the post reads as follows. So basically that post I made on here about you, that was basically a suicide note. I'm planning to die today. This is not a joke. You'll probably hear about me on the news after I die. This is my last goodbye. I love you. See you again in another life signed with the female name and the male name underneath in a parenthetical. And the person responds, you have so much more life to live. I pray God keeps and covers you. And the response is, I know, but I don't want to live. I'm so sorry. I'm not trying to upset you or get attention. This is chilling. I just need to die. I wanted to tell you first because you're the most beautiful person I've ever seen and known all my life. My family doesn't know what I'm about to do. One day this will make more sense. I've left more than enough evidence behind, but something bad is about to happen. Buck, this is incredibly chilling. And again, we may get official news of what this person has left behind. This manifesto. I don't think it was a coincidence that a religious elementary school was targeted by this trans person. And I do believe who committed this crime is significant and a huge part of this story, because as you said, Buck, this is a domestic terror incident. And on CNN last night, we had mentioned this clip before there was immediately this effort to focus on certain things and create a narrative of this event that would be less ideologically troublesome for a lot of the Democrat viewers in the CNN audience. Because as we know, when there's an incident that can be in any way attributed to the right, and this is a very, it's a very important phenomenon to understand, especially with regard to the media, but it has enormous implications for politics. When someone does something that can be attributed to the right, the media, not only amplify that they focus on it, they amplify it, and they attach, meaning it's all about that thing that happened. Usually it's, you know, MAGA, this like, it's a white guy who's somehow affiliated with Trump, and that person, and even if it's very vaguely, right? I mean, the guy they think he's right wing, or he's a traditionalist views, whatever it may be, they'll then focus on it. They will then go beyond just that focus to amplification, saying that this is indicative of a much bigger trend than it is. And then they'll attach other people to it. So your rhetoric is responsible for this as well. This is the media playbook, whenever there is an incident that they can create that narrative with, right? So we all understand how that goes. The opposite effect happens when there is a incident, a mass casualty incident, a domestic terror attack like this, where the perpetrator and the ideology of the person, and also the specific mental health reality of the shooter, is something that the Democrat base in the left just doesn't want to hear doesn't want to understand, explore, or know about in any way. It does not fit their preconceived narrative about who we have to be cautious about and what the realities of America are. And so this is CNN's national security analyst, whom I know from my time at CNN. And she's just a political hack masquerading as a national security expert. Here she is saying that pronouns, you know what, I'll just let her say it. Play three. I sort of think now, like, we don't own guns in this country, guns own us at this stage. And this is where we have to now focus on an important part of an agenda, which includes mental health, protecting our kids, fortifying schools, but also the connectivity, which is a certain kind of gun. Look, pronouns do not kill children, right? People with guns kill children. And it's going to be a distraction in our coverage and keep us from what we now know, which is each of these cases has a similarity of more than any difference. Okay, it's a distraction. That's really the that's really the keyword here. A distraction, according to CNN's probably most cited or most, you know, most booked national security analyst to talk about the fact that this was a transgender individual, just no one saying pronouns kill anybody. That that's a that's a total that is a distraction. That's a total, you know, red herring has nothing to do with anything. But the ideology of this person, it's interesting that this comes at a time when you know, Tucker calls and just did last week. Remember this on his show, there were there's a trans or LGBTQ plus and trans specific group that is taking up arms and did this whole segment on his show, because they're so scared about what people are, you know, targeting them. Okay, well, is there a narrative that is being pushed by Democrats that makes people who are trans think that they should be more fearful than reality actually, you know, indicates? Are there parts of a discussion here nationally that should be looked at for why is it that this happened in Colorado Springs? There are a number of other shootings as well involving trans individuals who are a tiny percentage of the population. So when you start to link a few of these mass shootings together, you say, what's going what's going on here? And when you look at the rhetoric that the Democrats use clay about how there is a quote genocide, that is a word that has been used by prominent Democrats or a systematic erasure, another term they use of trans people. Well, how do they think that individuals are going to respond to that? I also would point out and I would venture that this doesn't exist at all. Has this same CNN commentator said that it's a distraction to focus on whether a shooter is a Trump supporter? I bet there is not audio of anybody who's ever gone on CNN saying, look, really, the story is not who the shooter is. It's what exactly is going on with guns, right? If this school shooter was a locked and loaded Donald Trump supporting January 6th protesting right wing zealot, it would be the number one story in America. And I'm not kidding. I think that Merrick Garland would already be on the ground in Nashville. But I'll just point this out. Remember a couple of years ago when I went and spoke out against kids having to wear masks in school, in particular, my own kids at the local school board, Joe Biden's Department of Justice opened an investigation into parents going to school boards and arguing against their kids being forced to be masked because they said that we were potential domestic terrorists. Do all of you remember that? I bet there's a lot of you out there who also went and spoke out at your school boards as I did, not as the host of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show alongside of you, Buck. But it's just a dad who didn't want his own kids to have to wear a mask in school because it was worthless. The Biden administration, Merrick Garland, opened an investigation into the speakers of that at those school board meetings. Did they open any investigations at all into this mass killer? Have they done any sort of investigation into, as you mentioned out, mentioned this idea of a transgender act of violence to try to protect themselves? I think all of that is part and parcel of the narrative overwhelming the facts because I hope Joe Biden comes to Nashville and tries to provide some condolences to the lost people who lost loved ones, assuming those people would prefer that he be here. Maybe they don't. But certainly, if this was a Buffalo, black majority supermarket shooting, they can't get there fast enough. They can't blame the shooter fast enough for his domestic terrorism. They're running from now there being any causation link at all to this person's background. Well, also, we talk about when we try to have discussions, they're the bad faith, entirely bad faith gun grabbers out there, which is most Democrats, most Democrat politicians. But occasionally, they'll want to have a somewhat more serious conversation about stopping violent crime that involves that involves a firearm, right? A cage that will happen and you'll even have some Republicans will say, well, let's talk about, you know, red flag laws, or let's talk about things. And some Republicans will go along with that. There are a lot of people that get very angry. But at least that's an attempt, I think, to try to look at realistic pro for example, we prohibit felons from having firearms. That's not a, oh, what about the second amendment? It's, well, if you're a convicted felon, by the way, I think it should be fair to say you should be violent convicted felon. But if you're a convicted felon, you know, there's not no one's pushing for, OK, if somebody's out on, you know, out of prison after serving a 10 year sentence for armed robbery, they should go out and bypass. Right. There's some understanding we have there's some agreement that we have. There are a lot of gun laws already in place, which always gets left out of the discussion. Tons of too many of them. I mean, here in Florida, I have to go five day waiting period. What? What does that do for anybody? But anyway, there's a lot of a lot of rules out there about all of this. If we're looking at mental health, though, when looking at mental health as it pertains to firearms, you know, the this is where people want to start to look at, OK, if somebody it used to be that if somebody came in somebody approached, you know, transgenderism, it was considered to be something that there should be mental health resources devoted to helping somebody with, right? There seems to be no discussion whatsoever right now of any kind about what we could actually do that would be useful in this circumstance with regard to they'll talk about mental health. But what does that mean? Like how? You know, they won't even really talk about mental health as it pertains to transgender people, Buck, because it's considered to be transphobic to suggest that anybody who is transgender might have mental health issues when the reality is a huge monstrous percentage of people who decide to cut off their genitals and or totally change their gender have major mental health issues. That's not that's not crazy. It's not crazy. Most people don't make that choice. And we can talk more about this because I think there's a fear to even raise the question. Was this shooter on medication that made her more violent? As we said, most women don't go in and try to commit mass murder. Was this person loaded down with all sorts of testosterone mixed with other sorts of drugs because they might have mental health? I think that's a real conversation that an intelligent country would have surrounding this.

Breaking news Nashville police chief John Drake speaking about the mass shooting yesterday. The latest here is actual target. I can't confirm that at this time. Chief, can we talk about your body damage footage? Do you feel like your officers didn't everything right? One of the times. Sorry. Just about the six victims who were killed. Where exactly were they? You know, when they walked home through the hallways with this happened, and I also heard correctly that perhaps the head of the school may have ran towards the the guy who issued her. It's very possible the head of the school could have done that. I can't confirm that one. What other? I do know she was in the hallway by herself. There was a confrontation. I'm sure he can tell the way she was landing the hallway. There was the custodian, African-American, as she shot through the door to enter. She sprayed rounds through the glass, striking him. You can see where where he came to rest. As far as the others, they will just spread out in different locations. Chief, you mentioned it. I can't say it was a confrontation, but they were met. She met the head person in the hallway. This man right here. Yeah. Thank you. Chief, you mentioned the guns, the multiple guns, and that the shooter was under the care of a doctor. Is there any law in this state that would have allowed police to take those guns away from this person? Had it been reported? If it had been reported, that's not a law for that, but had it been reported that she was suicidal, or that she was going to kill someone and had been made known to us, then we would have tried to get those weapons. But as it stands, we had absolutely no idea. But actually, who this person was if she even existed. Chief, can you talk a little bit about the time? What else does the parents say? Does the inspection be like this happen? So we know yesterday the Miss Hill was leaving out of the residence. She had a red bag. They asked her what was in the red bag, and I think she just dismissed it because it was a motherly thing, and I didn't look in the bag. At the time, she didn't know that her daughter had any weapons and didn't think any differently. Again, they lost a child, so it was very traumatic for them. So, Chief, what do you think the buddy can? I think you would first. Yeah. Could you talk about the police? We'll continue to monitor this and bring you the latest on this press conference. The manifesto has not been released yet, and they have not ascribed motive yet. We'll come back to this.

The Metro Nashville Police Department currently having a press conference to discuss more of the details surrounding this shooting. This is Chief Drake discussing some aspects of this shooting right off the top of his statement just happened moments ago. Listen, we've interviewed the parents of Audrey Hale and we've determined that Audrey bought seven firearms from five different local gun stores here legally. They were legally purchased. Three of those weapons were used yesterday during this horrific tragedy that happened. We know that they felt that she had one weapon and that she sold it. She was under care, doctors care for an emotional disorder. Law enforcement knew nothing about the treatment she was receiving but her parents felt that she should not own weapons. They were under the impression that when she sold the one weapon that she did not own anymore. As it turned out, she had been hiding several weapons within the house. We also don't have a motive at this time. We feel that the students that were targeted were randomly targeted. There was not any particular student that they were that she was looking for at the time of the incident. Okay, Buck, so there's a lot there. This is again the Nashville Police Department, seven firearms. And she was under emotional care. This comes back to a question that I'm sorry, I'm just going to put it out there. If you have a child that is not psychologically well, I don't understand how you could hide seven firearms in the house she lived in with her parents, like the parents knew she had one gun and she told them she sold it. And somehow she managed to go buy seven more. Where does she get the money? What was her job? And again, I I'm saying this is a parent of three kids. Okay, I understand that kids can try to hide things from you. But if you knew you had an emotionally unwell child and you did not want them to have weapons, how in the world are there seven guns hidden in your own home that you don't know about? I mean, I again, I'm speaking to this as a parent. I find it inconceivable that any of my kids could hide seven weapons to say nothing of where they would get the money to buy seven weapons without me being aware of it. And if your child has got psychological issues, the police didn't know according to this, she wouldn't have been able to get guns. Why would you not notify the police if you knew that your child had one gun was suicidal, shouldn't have it? Again, this seems like a failure of parenting. Am I crazy? You don't have kids yet, Buck. But when I when I hear these things it makes me furious as a parent, because there are now three kids that are dead. And there are three moms and dads and grandmas and grandpas out there that are not going to be going home. Because these parents didn't want to wear their kid had seven guns. This is this is also where I would want to know. And I'm not a psychiatrist or a psychologist. I'm not a practitioner at a clinic dealing with mental health issues. But we have and it's just in the last really the last five years, but particularly the last, you know, you could expand at the last 10 years, decided that transgenderism is not a mental health issue that needs attention and assistance, but is actually something to be celebrated. Yes. And and that this is the new civil rights struggle. That is what we are told. That is the absolute mandate of of the Democrat party of the left of the media in this country and of the commies very broadly. They demand this that you call somebody who's a man, a woman, somebody who's a woman, a man, depending on their emotional state. And you're not supposed to think there's something wrong here. You're not allowed to that that has changed the American psychiatric association. You look at the different, you know, the DSM and the different manuals out there. They have changed this very rapidly and very recently. And so when you're talking about things like a red flag law, when you're talking about mental health issues, as it pertains to who can get a firearm, does to somebody who is transgender, that is no that is no longer to be considered a part of a mental health issue. That is not treated as a mental she was seeing somebody because she chose to I assume and she wanted to talk about different mental health, depression, anxiety, whatever it may be. But the severity of the mental illness, I think can be harder for people to really understand or for people even around it to really gauge because the transgender issue is not to be taken as a sign of instability of emotional instability. It is treated as the affirmation of the self and the affirmation of gender. Well, what does that really mean? Like, how can we, you know, if that's if you're a practitioner, if you're a psychiatrist, you sit down with somebody and they're saying, you know, I was born a woman, I've been a woman for 20 years or whatever it is in this person's case. But now I think that I'm a man. Oh, and by the way, I'm having, you know, thoughts of violence and oh, by the way, I'm having, you know, do you see what I'm saying? Like, like, yeah, I totally, I totally get it because we're told. And this is the question that I'm asking Buck. I mean, we don't even know how these different drugs might interplay to make whatever psychosis she might have had worse, right? In theory, if you're suddenly pumping somebody full of testosterone, if she was, and simultaneously, you're also giving them antidepressants or all sorts of other mental health drugs. Does that lead to more of a psychotic breakdown? I think that's a legitimate question that we should be asking. If somebody wanted to see a psychiatrist, and they said that they have, they're they're severely by, they have severe bipolar disorder, let's say, or a severe personality disorder of any kind. And then they also added some, I'm having some thoughts about either self harm or harming others or whatever. There would be this sense of the totality of the psychiatric damage and risk and look, those people need help. People should go see people. And but for, you know, they were saying this was never relayed to law enforcement, nobody. Well, were they able to see the issue clearly because one part of the psychological duress that this person was under was not to be treated as instability and a sign that this person may be troubled. It's to be treated as a celebration of identity that is the new civil rights struggle. And so how can a practitioner, in all honesty, be asked to make a real, because if you see any psychiatrist, they will tell you this and they look, they make people, I don't know what they do on the military side, you come back from CIA, you come back from overseas, you're going to sit down with somebody and say, you know, you saw some stuff for you. Okay, so you know, mental health treatment is physical health treatment. People should view it as as two sides of the same coin. But if you're asking people to be able to make threat assessments like a psychiatrist, this point, I mean, you're talking about the parents, right? The parents obviously, you know, I mean, there's a lot of challenges here for them and, and you know, looks like they missed this. But this is where I can't get passed as a parent. And I would say this to anybody out there. If you believe your kid has serious psychological issues and you are concerned about them doing harm to themselves or someone else and you are not checking regularly what they are spending money on, whether they have weapons. I mean, we're not talking about her having one gun buck. She bought seven guns. Seven guns are not cheap from five different firearms dealers. And she hid them in the house and the parents had no idea. So, right, there's there's the parent component of it. And I think you've, you've spoken to that that well, I just think also, you know, the police specifically mentioned, well, if we had been told she was under psychiatric care, can a psychiatrist, here's one, one aspect of the psychiatrist even, yeah, be honest about what we're dealing with here and what the reality of the mental health risks are of this person bottom line. People died here. What happened? We have to be able to be honest about this. If you're a psychiatrist, though, and you get on the wrong side of this, you're a transphobe. Your license is gone. You're a bigot. You're not to be talked to. You're a horrible human being. Oh, historically, you're so right, Buck, because I bet historically, one of the top signs of mental instability was the idea that you're in the wrong body, right? In 1994, if you went to a psychiatrist and you said, well, I'm a guy, but I actually feel like a girl, that would not be a sign of you being incredibly brave and proactive and courageous. It would be a sign that your biochemistry may well be off. It, Clay, if I walked into a psychiatrist's office and I said, hi, I speak to people who are not there. I speak to people in the room who are not actually present in the room. That is an objectively false reality that I am projecting. And then if I said on top of that, I also want to seek out, I'm going to go buy some firearms for whatever reason. Yeah, that psychiatrist would be highly concerned and may inform law enforcement. If I walk in and say, I'm actually a woman, and by the way, I'm going to go buy some firearms for whatever we don't know. We haven't seen the manifesto, but I'm going to go buy some firearms. I don't know how the psychiatrist feels about that, necessarily, because well, I need to affirm your gender. Buck, what if you just came in and said, hey, I don't like my right arm. I want to chop it off. And which is a real psychiatric condition for anybody who's wondering. And also, I am deeply disturbed and I have seven guns. I'd be like, I don't know that I want this person to have weapons. I believe it's called body, body identity integrity disorder. And these are real question. I mean, probably the only place you're going to hear almost in all of America, a conversation like this is here, because the idea that you would ever question anything about a transgender person is considered to be so transphobic that it's unacceptable to do. Well, there's six people dead. And this person was clearly mentally disturbed. I think figuring out how this happened so we can hopefully not ever have it happen again is a big part of figuring out how to respond to this in general. Look, it's a challenge right now. Everybody out there, you probably have car insurance, probably have home insurance, health insurance, all sorts of things take care of your family in case something bad happens in that respect. Do you have food insurance? Would you have ever believed you're going to go out to the grocery store and not be able to find baby formula, not be able to find toilet paper, not be able to find your chosen products to be able to buy on the grocery shelves? Most of you would have found that staggering to ever happen in America. Well, it happened. And with all the different issues that are going on these days, wouldn't you like to have food insurance just for a little while? I've got it. Three month emergency food for my house. Got three boys, wife. All five of us are taken care of. Thanks to mypatriotsupply.com. Right now you can save $200 per kit.

I'm going to be talking about the fact that you're not going to be able to buy law enforcement, but also remember motive is always something that is open to analysis, at least generally, speaking open to some degree of analysis. When there's a manifesto, it tends to make it pretty clear. But even in those cases, you've had individuals that on the outside analyzing will try to push one or another version of why something happened, society pushed a person to do it or there was an assessment of what we've seen so far. We also, by the way, have our friend Tudor Dixon, who is now on the Clan Buck Podcast Network. She'll be joining us here in the next hour. We'll ask her about this and also we'll talk some politics. I want to take this call. It's Katherine in California works in the health care industry, has some thoughts on psychiatric care to share given our conversation a few minutes ago. Thanks for calling in Katherine. Hello, Megaditos. I'm old school rush. Megaditos, yes, thank you. Anyway, so I call on psychiatrists. One of the things I've noticed, they did a very good job prior to COVID of threading the virtual remote, helping patients and facilities and things. But two things. First of all, there's no places for some of these people to go anymore. Unfortunately, Ronald Reagan kind of spearheaded and I was a big fan, closing some of the mental institutions. But the virtual aspect of this has become a huge component. And these people are not being seen in the office. They're being seen over videos on phone calls. And I think that there are very few practitioners. I know several of them that do a very good job of still treating their patients. But I think that most of these people are not even being seen anymore in the psychiatric site. It's extremely... Well, I do know from just from New York City and the NYPD, they would talk about the acronym was EDP, emotionally disturbed person, which are when you get calls that someone is being crazy out in the streets, running around naked with a butcher knife or something, they call it an EDP. And I just remember from talking to some of the longtime officers, the mental health resources in large communities all across the country are really insufficient. Really not what they should be. And I want to be very clear, I think people getting mental health treatment is every bit as important and valid as getting treatment for a broken leg. And I've felt that way my entire adult life, knowing what I know, I mean, anybody who has spent time around, for example, and this usually puts it in a context for people clay, veterans with PTSD, they deserve the absolute support, support treatment, assistance, and respect through all of that. Of course they do, right? Because they served our country and many of them have brought back psychic wounds that need to be healed and it's incumbent upon us to help them. Mental health treatment is critical for individuals. It's not something... It's not just for people that feel like, oh, why aren't I more successful and they pay some guy $400 an hour, whatever to sit there while they're lying on a couch? And we don't have the resources we need in a lot of these communities. I'd like to hear from other parents because, Buck, I don't remember the Buffalo shooting, I believe it was, certainly back in the day at Sandy Hook, the Uvalda shooting, all of these people were crazy, right? Let's be honest, they were crazy. How in the world are parents relatives allowing these people to get access to all of this? You have a call in Wisconsin who wants to address that right now. Rachel in Wisconsin, you have some thoughts on the parents involved here, go for it. Well, the parents are kind of in the dark because of the laws that are in some states. The law in Wisconsin states a 14 year old child can determine their medical decision. So when I had a daughter spiraling out of control, I couldn't get medical treatment because they put it into her hands. I actually had a kid nap by child out of the state and moved them to another state to get medical treatment. So for a parent, it's very hard sometimes. Thank you, thank you for the call and certainly that's an awful situation. Um, seven guns. How in the world could your kid who was getting mental health treatment? Well, the individual is 28. I think they lived in the house with the parents though. That's what I'm saying. Seven guns that you're hiding inside of your, your, the parents inside of your own home. I mean, this is just very strange. We need to have this manifesto released. Nashville police have done a fantastic job so far. Tutor Dickson next."
