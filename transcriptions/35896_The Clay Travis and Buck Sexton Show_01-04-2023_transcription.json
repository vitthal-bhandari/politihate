    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome then Wednesday edition clay Travis Buck Sexton show we hope wherever you may be across the world around the country that you are having a fantastic midpoint of your week And that you are ready to hang out with us for the next three hours and hopefully have some fun while also being entertained We've got a ton of different topics to dive into with you the latest on the Nashville school shooting and the continued fallout surrounding that DeSantis versus Trump polling data continues to come out Maybe the dumbest opinion in sunny hosstens career on the view We've got dr. Fauci being rewarded with a multi million dollar book advance and also Uh, when you consider all of the cities in america right now It's possible the washington dc district attorney is prosecuting the fewest Of all of the crimes that are occurring in the nation's capital. I was there yesterday back home in nashville today Uh, and how does that compare to jans sixth also is the trump indictment? In new york city falling apart. They are not hearing anymore Reportedly on the trump indictment this week. Maybe not also next week. We'll break all that down for you. But buck We wait now in nashville For the release of the trans shooters manifesto I am told that it is going to be released When exactly it will be released remains unclear I think it should happen today The nashville police did a phenomenal job responding to the shooting at the school We played and talked about the videos from inside of that school How heroic so many of those officers were the nashville police have been very forthcoming with all the details of this investigation on a fairly rapid fashion Now is the time to share that manifesto because in the absence of That manifesto coming out Many people are trying to fill this void so to speak and argue i'm sure you're seeing all the same headlines that I am buck Where for instance nbc nbc news put up a headline Yesterday that said fear pervades tennessee's trans community amid focus on nashville's shooters gender identity We were already fearing for our lives now. It's even worse. That's a quote No, it's worse for the kids that were killed by the trans woman Or by the woman who was a trans man, whatever you want to say it's definitely worse For them yet their suffering is not being covered and I wanted to play this for you buck They're now arguing. Oh The victims would be alive if they had it passed the trans bills in tennessee This is a tiktoker Red a hern that is sharing an opinion that has been widely discussed in the trans community in the wake of this shooting listen to cut one I wonder if The parents of the victims of the nashville shooting today would still have their children If these trans bills in tennessee, whatever thing I'm not a parent, but if I were I'd be real real mad at the government I'd be real real mad at the government Must be very clear clay that here you have people on the left. We just played audio that was from the lives of tiktok account who are Explicitly saying that if there are more of these bills to prevent the mutilation of the gender mutilation of children Uh that there will be more School shootings that there'll be more people killed. There'll be more violence essentially It's it's an implicit threat. This is what terrorists do. This is what terrorists do It's you know nice Nice society you have there be a shame if something happened to it It'd be a shame if something crumbled the civilization that you think you live in and and the media I have to say It is remarkable to me that I expect that in the aftermath of something like this When the perpetrator is someone that is first of all always Uh elevated generally by the left, right? The trans community in general is constantly elevated So this is they're they're taught telling us all the time the trans community is marginalized and victimized and we hear all these stats about the uh the Murder of the people within the trans community. They try to call them the stats They try to say this Saturday. They're having an event about the trans genocide When you actually look at the stats, there are very few trans people who are murdered in part because they're very few trans people and the trans people who are killed Are overwhelmingly killed as either they're involved in the sex trade. There's some Situation that there are not hate crimes where trans people are being murdered all over the country That's just not true. It doesn't happen. It doesn't happen So this notion that there is this great fear and by the way, of course Everybody should live in safety security and decency. We are That's being told on this show. We're very anti murder We're very anti murder on the show But there's a lie that is being told that there's this constant threat this constant fear That the trans community lives under for their safety When this is very similar what the left does on other arguments too. This is not about safety This is about policy This is about whether or not people will be forced by government power to celebrate What many more people are starting to see now is a Severe mental illness is actually not something that should be elevated and treated as an affirmation of identity and all the rest of it All the stuff that we hear and use the different pronouns and all of this What they're doing is what the left always does if you don't agree with me. You are literally committing violence against me That's what they say if you don't agree with me on go down any range of issues This is why they shout down speakers in schools This is why they don't allow conservatives to even have a voice that they will hear from whether it's a fit circuit judge as we saw recently At stanford university Law school So they're doing this purposefully so that people won't have an honest conversation about it and the media by the way is Going I thought they would be horrible, but they find new levels of horribleness I mean there is something ghoulish and demonic in the soul of the democrat aligned media This was from roighters. I'm not even picking the crazy far left stuff. I mean, that's we just had a little lives of tiktok clay former christian student Kills three children three staff in Nashville student. Did you see that headline that is the road? This headline former christian student kills three Oh gee I wonder are we all supposed to be so stupid that we don't see the politics the victims here Christian children christian adults a christian school But because the trans left wing lunatic perpetrator attended the school 20 years ago That's what they lead with clay gee And we played for you. I believe it was yesterday CNN saying look the the fact that the shooter was trans is a major distraction from the real story here, which is guns Yesterday msnbc also climbing on that argument focusing on the transgender identity msnbc. This is alie velshy They're saying here in this conversation. It's actually uniquely dangerous to the trans community to point out that someone in the trans community Committed cold-blooded murder of six innocent people. Listen. We have no idea if the shooter was undergoing hormone therapy But in the words of congressman green quote everyone can stop blaming guns now Which is really code for focusing on the shooters identity something conservatives don't seem overly concerned about when the shooter is a white man Which is often trans people are already more likely to experience violence simply because they are trans people So the right focusing on that is uniquely dangerous and we have to respond to that But it is also a distraction because there are plenty of trans people in plenty of countries all over the world But once again america is the only nation where shootings like this happen over and over again So maybe it's not mental health or video games or hormones. Maybe it's the guns Okay, the guns the guns the guns the guns are not going anywhere I wish somebody would just follow down the rabbit hole randy wine garden zed an imbecile buck But she at least came out and said we need to go collect everybody's guns Did you see that clip of her basically saying at least whether you agree or disagree with her? And certainly I think almost everyone listening to us right now disagrees with her At least she's not pretending away what she wants to do. Which is I think this isn't goal here period I think you're making I think this is an important point that that you're making here Which is that the only honest argument on the left the honest argument Would be we're taking all of your guns We're sending Agents of the state with guns to take your guns. Yes, and they will shoot you if you don't give your guns up That is it right that that is the only honest argument about gun control taken to its extreme taken to where it would actually yes That's what they want. That's where there will be fewer shootings, right? Yes, this is there's the reality of the nobody had a gun and if the government took all your guns away That's randy wine gardens argument because the other side of this is when they say, okay We're gonna ban AR-15s. I say well the this this individual went into a went into a grammar school with three guns A pistol would have been just as deadly under the circumstances Multiple and anyone who wants to argue with this first of all they sound like idiots because you just go and look at fort hood two pistols Virginia tech shooting pistols So this notion that some kind of restriction on the cosmetics or the magazine or any of that stuff would stop a shooting Is is just ignorance. That's why the art that this is why people in the second amendment community get so frustrated It's let's have the real talk you want no second amendment libs You want no guns in civilian hands period And you know what's amazing is they talk about australia and they'll say look at the australia and buyback program Look at what a huge success it was Australia has more guns in private hands now than it did before the buyback program Just putting that out there too people have no idea what they are talking about But they never actually go to the extreme and the argument because clay when joe biden comes out and says you know we're gonna We're gonna ban the salt right, you know after he talks about the ice cream flavors The whole point is to give emotional validation to democrat voters who think people who own guns are bad and stupid and wrong That's it It's it's sticking a finger in the eye of the people on the other side of politics that you don't like no serious person who knows the data Who knows history and who knows reality things that making a change like this Uh, we know that's all rifle ban Well, it's going to at best you might if you could eliminate every single rifle shooting in the country You might bring down the violence rate by 1% and of course that's not gonna happen because people are gonna have illegal guns Because that's who kills people buck are you when this happened? We were talking off air And I said based on these details before we didn't say it publicly on the air But I was like this feels like it's probably gonna be a trans shooter to me. That was my prediction And you I didn't know if you want me should just you all know trate Clay said this to me And I will confirm this because you just said it on air. Yeah, right when this happened based on what's going on in tennessee And I looked at them and you know, we just of course we would never say anything in the air We couldn't You know provide factual basis for and don't want to speculate speculate but the two of us talking about where this was going privately Clay thought this was what was gonna happen And then I said and if it if i'm right This story will vanish Because the cnns and the msnbc's will not want to talk about a trans shooter if this were A trump supporting right winger joe biden would already be on the ground in nashville Just like joe biden didn't go to east palestine, ohio buck Why is the president not here president traveled to buffalo president traveled um to uh basically anywhere where he can sell the narrative of Right-wing extremism try to tie it into january 6th everything else I don't think he's gonna come to nashville at all over the shooting And look I understand there are a lot of people out there listening to me in nashville So yeah, we don't want him here. We don't want him in the state of tennessee i understand but where the president travels sends a message about what the president thinks is important and joe biden said i'm here to restore the soul of the nation Wouldn't that include pointing out when crazy trans people are It appears attacking religious people that seems like a direct threat to the soul of the nation what could be a more obvious and ghoulish and and horrific evil then an adult walking into A school like this and seeing a nine-year-old girl and shooting that nine-year-old girl and then doing it again and again There is nothing there is nothing more evil than this and every person certainly every parent in the country knows that Why joe biden has not already flown to this part of nashville and is not hugging the parents and telling them we'll do everything We are so sorry as a nation. I would lul I would like to hear some democrat try to explain why that has not happened yet He's too busy has to go has to go you know go for day number 400 out at the beach house really too busy for this unacceptable unacceptable And if it were a trump individual trump supporter he would have already been here. I really do believe that Three years ago at this time we were all grappling with the shutdowns put in place by our government For covid you might remember run at the grocery store when you couldn't find things empty shelves A lot of people then decided you know what I need to take care of the food security in my household And many of you have already done this but a lot of you still haven't check out my patreon supply.com you can get a three-month Emergency food kit right now you'll save 200 per kit We've got five of them in the travis household one for each of my boys myself and laura my wife Each kit will give you a wide variety of delicious breakfast lunches dinners drink snacks 2000 calories a day for optimum strength and energy for each of these kits three months long Emergency kits make a big difference buck has them too act now and claim your 200 dollar savings per kit Here's how you do it go to my patreon supply dot com and you'll enjoy free shipping too That's my patreon supply Dot com the torch of truth past and still lit every day The clay Travis and buck sexton show welcome back to clay and buck We've gotten a little bit of breaking news This coming from zero hedge citing political reporting Uh that the trump grand jury you got it. Yep. Yeah, I read i'll read this story just broke eight minutes ago Buck um and the headline is Manhattan trump grand jury set to break for a month a Previously pant plan this says hiatus would put pushback a potential indictment Uh, and here's the opening paragraph the man hatton grand jury examining donald trump's alleged role in a hush money payment Uh will not it was an isn't expected to hear evidence in the case for the next month Uh due to a previously scheduled hiatus The break would push any indictment to late april at the earliest um again, look It doesn't sound like something's coming based on that. I I think I think this is all gonna collapse like every other Just maniacal effort take to get trump on some Trumped up charge. There's nothing flimsier of all of the investigations and all the all the theoretical Criminal prosecutions of trump. I mean this is honestly the most absurd and the weakest So it looks like they won't be able to just push it through Um, I I think that the the month long delay here. They'll just use this to let let this fade out You know, then brag will tell his people you know brag will tell his office and and the narrative will be that he took it to the brink but in the in the interest of not not of justice but in the interest of you know of um Uh national reconciliation and not having trump supporters get violent. He decided not to they'll come up with some story I really don't think they're gonna do it now I just because think about this right. I mean they're gonna come back It's so much easier to dismiss this and walk away when no one's talked about it for a month But in the meantime it creates this oh no we haven't we haven't bailed out where this was planned We're just doing this if it was planned why did everybody think that this was gonna come down a few days ago? right I think you're right and and again if they're not going to hear this case until late april You run basically into summer very quickly and then it gets hard to justify when you're only a few months out from iowa voting Many small business owners are getting a refund of their taxes from the irs It's part of a program congress passed to help small businesses get through the pandemic It's called the employee retention credit or erc And this is completely different than the ppp the company that really understands this is get refunds.com and they've helped businesses get $3 billion in refunds to date Unless then eight minutes you can see if your business qualifies for erc assistance your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund of up to $26,000 per employee kept on payroll during covid 19 There's no upfront charge either. They don't get paid unless your business gets its refund Many businesses believe they won't qualify based off incomplete or outdated information So don't let this opportunity pass you by because this payroll tax refund is only available for a limited time Go to get refunds dot com. That's get refunds dot com Play Travis and bucks exon on the front lines of truth Welcome back in i hope all of you are having a fantastic Wednesday Clay Travis bucks exon rolling through our friends at the view Buck we had a relatively short-lived. I would say kumbaya moment When whoopi Goldberg had like two takes in a row that we agreed with And we said hey, maybe the view is turning a corner. We thought maybe invite invite the two of us on the clay and buck extra special Maybe that maybe the view isn't the dumbest show in america that are heirs on a daily basis Now they've continued joy bahars falling apart, but sunny hoston sometimes escapes Our ridicule as also a uniquely dumb individual It's like joy bahars joe biden and sunny hoston might be her kamala harris That the duo is so awful. Sometimes it's hard to know which is worse Sunny hoston said She doesn't care at all about china imprisoning muslims Because black people are put in jail in america This is really what she said listen And so as a woman of color With a six foot two black kid in college and a five foot seven five foot eight black kid in high school I don't see that part of american exceptionalism. I'm sorry. I think this country has a lot of problems There could be solved. Yes, maybe they're putting Muslims in jail in afghanistan. I think you mentioned in china. They're putting a lot of black more black people in jail here Okay, okay What do we think of the chances that any of the ladies of the view First of all know what a weager is or would be able to spell it I don't know that to be fair. I'm not sure that I could spell weir So it is tough to be fair to be fair. That is that is a really hard one to spell So, but that is a group that she is what she's saying muslim She's talking about the turkic weigers of western china in shinjang province Who are in literal and I use that word appropriately because people overuse it all the time. Yes literal concentration camps Yes Because they are the wrong ethnicity and religious group. Yes for the chinese communist party She is comparing that to people going to prison for rape murder drugs every serious felony every serious crime In the country and act like there's a similar Yes, this is important because she would probably get fired on its face if she said Something like that about the holocaust, right? Oh, I don't really care about the holocaust because we put a lot of black men in jail in america today And why don't why does the height of her kids matter? This is really weird like she said i've got a six foot two black sun in college and then i've got a five seven or five eight black sun in high school like why does that why why does anybody care what height your kids are It doesn't make any sense at all um But it's weird That she would I think she has a law degree Look up sunny hoston. It's yes, no, she does she was so fun fun fact. I was uh, I was on a Pilot for a cnn show where they ran a bunch of different people and if I remember correctly She was one of the people on the panel and she was supposed to be the legal expert I mean that's funny. It's like itself. Yeah, how could you be so unaware? And that's what i'm saying about the holocaust idea When you're in a concentration camp, i'm sorry. I'm sorry there This is important because I swear to god clay. I'm i didn't interrupt you. I'm sorry. I swear that I was going to say I better son that she's so worried about goes to harvard Where do you think her son goes to school clay? If you want guests Uh parvard i'm guessing that parvard Student and I am sure that it is light, you know It's very hard to go to the number one university on the planet because your mom is a famous person and you know Amazing right dad is their dad. She's married to an orthopedic surgeon So if you want to talk about privileged Offspring in america today Mom who is on a daily television show dad who is an orthopedic surgeon And the mom is going to sit on television and say I don't care about what goes on in china Because there are black people in jail in america. Well concentration camps You get put there because of your identity Not because of something that you did right and for her to not be smart enough To understand the difference and she also said afghanistan the the this is this is I mean, did you get so much wrong far far away place, you know all the same door with muzzlums like who cares this is This is to me evidence of the cover that elites elites in america Often give to china because they try to falsely equivocate for errors that May not be like our small imperfections They use this is what the mba does. This is what so many people this what msnbc What what what cnn do they cover for china by pointing out that america is imperfect And they point out our imperfections as a way to justify Not caring about the blatant human rights violations of china I think also this comparison with china is particularly interesting because here is a multi-millionaire sunny hoston Who is essentially saying I I don't I don't care about what's going on in the force labor camps with the forced sterilization of women With over a million people confirmed and the numbers probably much higher than that going through this Were also subject to extreme brutality Execution and torture for speaking out against the state I can't focus on that because I have a son who's at harvard and it's like really hard and dangerous to be at harvard be six cuba I mean Her six foot two son. I mean the racism that her son must be experiencing at harvard compared to the racism That is going on in communist china in the concentration camps I can imagine why she really you know, she can't focus on number two can only think about number one how often Is our stupid thing said on the view? I mean, can I tell you honestly the problem that they couldn't have us on the view because if we actually went there and got to They would try to shout us down but The the people on that set are so stupid and so ignorant But I I know people don't like name-calling here. Sorry. They're so lacking in knowledge wisdom context I don't I don't mind the name-calling by the way. I think they are stupid and ignorant Well, I'm just saying no it would be impossible to have a conversation with them Where and that's also why by the way they have like joy behar there so they can always revert back to they want to speak about serious issues This has been described and it was actually john steward that I initially think was written about this way clown nose on clown nose off Like sometimes joy behar wants to be serious Sometimes joy behar when she gets it's not it's not that she can make jokes and do political analysis It's when her political analysis shows she has no idea what she's talking about has never read anything Nor has any knowledge of the subject matter then it's just oh, we're all just making jokes Yeah as this constant excuses as a scape valve as a cover And also I you know this and I know this but I think a lot of our listeners may not There's a behind the scenes staff Probably of 30 people or more working on the view So it's not only that people like sunny hosden are really woefully misinformed And ignorant about many of the topics that upon which they're speaking It's that they're willfully Doing that in many respects because if you were on that show and you wanted to be surrounded by super smart people Who could inform you to make sure that you get facts right and don't sound like such an imbecile They would be able to have that staff right like this isn't some situation where it's a youtube show and they don't make much money And sometimes people are going to screw up. This is a highly produced Incredibly lucrative daytime television show which has all the resources it needs to make its hosts as intelligent as they can be And they still look like idiots every day. I will say I actually think that they their service to the democrat party Is to make democrat voters feel more comfortable in their ignorance It's it's like hanging out with the dumb kids in the class But they're the cool kids in the class and so you feel okay not doing your homework too Because the cool kids aren't doing their homework. So i'm going to go, you know smoked cigarettes after class with them and fail That's that's the purpose of the view to make people who don't want to do the work to learn anything Feel okay with that and by the way if you think these shows don't matter These are overwhelmingly consumed by women that air during the day suburban moms And grandmas and those are the people that are going to be deciding this election That's the reality Men overwhelmingly vote for republican candidates. That's the truth Can we increase the number of men who vote for republican candidates? Probably But women are the true swing voters by and large in the suburbs and they're listening to these imbeciles For families with high school seniors graduating this spring topic at the dinner table all too often is what college you're going to go to It's one of the great privileges in this nation the availability and access we all have to education Few people appreciate the process as much as the faculty and administration at hills dill college They won't say it, but I will the college provides their students with the best classical liberal arts education in america When these students graduate they've studied the great books the history of western civilization in america the meaning and history of the constitution Hillsdale was founded in 1844 to offer the kind of education needed to preserve civil and religious liberty 180 years later it holds true to that mission today While refusing to accept one penny of taxpayer funding and that includes not even Indirectly in the form of student grants and loans even if you've never stuck foot on the campus in michigan You can learn from hills dill for free through imprimus Their monthly newsletter and by taking online courses on american history the constitution and other subjects See for yourself learn more about hills dill at clay and buck for hills dill dot com That's clay and buck for hills dill dot com More clay and buck that you didn't hear on the show Get podcast extras in the clay and buck podcast feed find it on the iHeart app or wherever you get your podcast somebody just got a big Payday clay Five million big ones for the fouch Five million dollars for little tony fauci for his Memoir and by the way, that is how you pronounce it if you're going to be a fauciite a memoir How many people want to buy i mean i i have a theory about a little bit. What do you think's going on here? i have a theory about this Anthony fauci could just put his little face on a book And have whatever title he wants and he will sell at least Hundreds of thousands of copies and he would sell it even if every single page was blank Because the purpose of the fauci book is like the purpose of still masking Which is to show where everybody how smart and sciency and liberal you are So this is a this is the ultimate Will be coffee table social justice 100 book per cent can i tell you something? You know i've i've played a looked at uh looked at houses with with kerry Uh, you know just a little little house shopping looking around seeing things and she always laughs because i'm always just curious I always want to take a look at the books. Oh, yeah, because i know right away I always could tell right away what we know who not that i mean i mean i live in a house that Lib said soul of you it doesn't really matter But i just think it's kind of funny I can tell who the person is and then with instagram you could figure it out right away too And i'm never wrong but i can look at the books in someone's home and i basically know who i'm dealing with Even with that and i do think you're right I think that the fauci book probably will be right up there with like michaelle obamas becoming or whatever the name of that book Was that sold like three million copies? How many people actually ever opened that book? I think less than five percent of the people that that bought michael obama's book I would bet less than five percent of them read the whole book That's my i don't think i don't think that's a crazy perspective right? They just i mean you can never check these numbers But if you actually if you got if you got a hundred Michelle obama book purchasers in a room and gave them the most basic reading comprehension test on that book Five of the hundred would pass that would be such a good that would be such a fun television It would be amazing, but you know it is would that would be a great television quiz um, you know I think you're probably right. I would bet michael obama's book is the single most purchased So you can look good for purchasing it book of the 21st century that would be my guess Now there are other ones hillory clinton's memoir Barack obama. I tend to think that left wingers Would be way more impressed by the idea that you read a book, which is why i'm citing those in particular um But i just even with that in context I don't think that fauci is Enough of an icon That even that many people will buy his book this reminds me buck Um years and years ago, and I can't even remember the guy's name was the first athlete to come out as gay Uh basketball player one of our staff can look it up esp and I believe published the book They turned it into like it was the biggest reveal that you could ever imagine Oh my goodness this former mba player is gay and now he's written a memoir about it And they you couldn't have given more publicity to this book It's sold like 7 000 copies And it was probably the most promoted sports book of the year because most people didn't care about the guy And they all said he didn't care about it being gay right like so what? Okay, so you're gay and you played basketball that doesn't really most people don't care unless you're really good at the sport too And then you might be like, okay, this sounds like an interesting book to read Um totally fell flat on its face. I feel like this fauci book is going to be the same way Because I think everybody on the planet he'll come out and do his usual interviews everywhere But I don't think it's like I don't think he's as beloved as michaelle obama I think it's even faker that people claim that they like him Well, I mean michael obama probably got like 15 or 20 million for her book all in right? I mean it's more than five than five million But to Michelle obama's credit the number of copies of her book that sold the publisher made money This fell if you're a democrat. Yeah, if you're a democrat you bought the michelle obama book pretty much I mean that's that's the way I think that a lot of people would would view that one on the book I think they're gonna lose millions of dollars on oh, I don't think they're being interested. I don't think so I think that there when does the book come out? Do we know? I don't even think it's been I mean, it's gonna be ghost written obviously I don't even know when it's supposed to come out But the fauci book is I think it's this one will table this one I think it's going to sell pretty well because clay there are I'm telling you when I came back from honeymoon. Whatever that was six weeks ago now a month ago. I can't even remember um The number of people in the lax airport That were you know, I'm gonna be in new york this week coming up Next week the number of people in the lax airport with masks on and not saying it was a super high percentage But they were all over the place it was like Five to ten percent of everybody in that airport at this stage of the game All of those people will buy the fauci book because it's it's like a it's like the you know, it'll be the Security bible of fauciism. I don't know what else to say it'll be their religious text I just you know, I flew back from dc early this morning and This is where I just can't get past every time i'm flying now young kids in masks What are their parents doing? Child is you if you got a four-year-old And you're in an airport in 2023 and your kid is still wearing a mask That is to me so clearly child abuse I just feel bad for the kid because I can only imagine how hellish The last three years of that kid's life has to pass to have been if they're still apparent demanding They wear a mask after three years of covid Imagine what restrictions were put on those kids how few of them got to go outside and live normal lives And unfortunately, I think their immune systems are going to bear the brunt of that over protectiveness for years and years to come Totally agree. Uh coming up here in a few moments. We're gonna talk about New democrats really have an idea of how to bring down crime if you look in dc and what's going on there Go blow your mind how lawless it's becoming"
