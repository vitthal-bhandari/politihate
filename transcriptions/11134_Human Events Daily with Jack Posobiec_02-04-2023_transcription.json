    "text": " Ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard to the Human Events Sunday Special. Now, we know everything that's going on with President Trump right now in the indictment, but we also have this issue that's been going on in this country for years now and come to a head. The militant trans movement. We had a shooting that took place earlier this week in a manifesto that the FBI is trying to get us to forget about. So today I wanted to sit down and tell the truth about gender identity disorder and we've got two fantastic guests, Ollie London and Chloe Cole to explain it all to us. You're gonna love this. So, share this out with everybody. Make sure you listen to the whole thing. All right, well, ladies and gentlemen, welcome aboard. This is the Sunday Special here for Human Events Daily. We are very excited to welcome for the first time to Human Events Ollie London. Now, you may know Ollie, you may have read the book, but Ollie, if you can, please introduce yourself up to the Human Events audience. Hey, well, thank you so much for having me first, Jack. So, my name's Ollie London. I'm an author of the upcoming book, Gender Madness. I was also previously struggling for many years with identity issues. I was transgender and then I later transitioned and now I've become an ambassador for gays against groomers fighting against the gender ideology that's tearing so many communities apart. Well, I mean, that's incredible because it's you've been working on all this. You've been doing gays against groomers. You've got the book coming out and then this week, all of a sudden, and I think this issue had been something that a lot of people knew about. There was a lot of interest in, there's been a lot of discussion about, but suddenly this week here in the United States, we have this horrific act down in Nashville, Tennessee. And for Christians and just for Americans in general, and I think everyone in the West, they're trying to make make some sense of how could something like this happen? How could someone become so radicalized to commit an act like going after children? And there are people questioning as to whether or not this ideology played a role in this attack in Nashville. So, let me let me ask you this first off. Do you think it's possible? Do you think it's possible that this ideology led to that? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, we of course need to see the manifesto, but I really do believe that the Nashville police chief said there was a double substance to the claim that this was motivated by radicalized gender ideology. We also need to note as well, this individual only transitioned became transgender within the last couple of years. So, their friends at high school, they describe them as normal, as shy, as sweet. So, something has happened within the last couple of years that has really pushed this person to become so extreme and so radicalized that they would do that to a Christian community. So, I definitely think gender ideology, we look at the rhetoric now, you know, we have so many trans organizations calling for retaliation in Tennessee based on the law that's banning gender affirming care that just went in to law just a few weeks ago. So, we're seeing this increased hate and rhetoric coming from the trans activist community, not all of them, but there's a growing portion of people in that community that are calling for violence and more extreme measures. So, I really believe that has played a significant part, if not the leading factor in what happened here. Well, that's right. And in fact, it wasn't even anyone on the right or conservatives that started saying we had ABC News and mainstream media here in the United States that in the wake of this before we even really knew all the facts that were clearly pointing out that this obviously took place in Tennessee just a few weeks after this law was passed. And so, the heat seemed to have been on. Now, we also know there's some connection. She went to the school. She may or may not have known the pastor of the school, pastors, and just since we're talking about the investigation, the pastor's own daughter who attended the school was one of the victims. And so, it certainly appears that there's also a this personal element to the entire thing. So, if you can, because you know this story from your own story, can you walk us through this process of how does someone first get involved in this ideology, you know, coming to it from the first place? Because we've seen some of the photos of this Audrey Hale, and she seems to be just a sweet young girl from, again, from middle Tennessee, a pretty traditional family, go into a Christian school. How do you go from that to being involved in this ideology? Right, and absolutely, like most of her school friends, when she went to school, you know, they all had good things to say about her. They said, you know, she was shy. They did say she was an outcast and she was always different though. But the real issue is this kind of ideology has become a very recent phenomenon. We weren't having these issues 10 years ago. You know, nobody had even heard of no kids being medically transitioned. This is a very recent phenomenon that spurred on within the last five years. We've had an increase in the pediatric clinics in America. There's now 60, 60 plus, there were none a decade ago. So there's an increased rise. There's schools teaching now this ideology telling kids about sex education, telling kids about changing their gender, and oftentimes doing it behind their parents' backs. So there's a real cultural shift and there's a push to try and normalise this. And, you know, many people didn't have a problem with anyone being trans, you know, five, ten years ago, it wasn't until they started medically transitioning kids, tearing families apart, taking away parental rights that this became an issue. So, you know, when it comes to someone wanting to change, I think there are so many factors. There are a very small minority of people that do generally feel that way their whole life, no since they were born. But we have to look at the fact the majority of kids these days are going with a trend, they're going with what's being pushed on them. And there are also many of these kids that they may just as a teenager, they're just struggling with an identity, you know, they might be, you know, might be to do with their sexuality, they might be gay, lesbian or bi. And they're being told by adults, by teachers, that they are in the wrong gender, so they must be affirmed immediately. So this is what's causing real harm. And then when you're putting young people on high doses of testosterone or estrogen, when you're giving them surgeries, you know, this has a severe effect on the body. It leads to bone density issues, heart attack increases. It also changes the chemical imbalance in the brain. So what will be interesting to see with the natural investigation, was this individual on a high dose of testosterone, because that can lead to severe anger issues. And that could have played a factor in this person becoming radicalised and violent. We know the fact that this Audrey Hell was under the care of a doctor for an unspecified emotional disorder. We need to find out was that related to them being transgender and where they've been pumped with abnormally high doses of testosterone. Because of course, you know, given the age here, this, I mean, we keep talking about her as a, as a girl, but she does 28 years old. She's she's an adult young woman. So if those indeed procedures were going on under the current Tennessee law, her parents would not have been required to be informed of this because again, she's 28 years old. She's a 20 year old woman, still living with the parents. So they, they may have known some things, but apparently she was able to hide these guns, hide this arsenal of guns that she had from them. So I don't know exactly what, what level of scrutiny it's certainly possible that all of that could have been done without the parents knowledge whatsoever at 28. I mean, she could easily be able to walk into any doctor and do this. But so that that's also kind of my question, I guess, because, you know, we, we talk about the targeting of children, but this wasn't a child. This is someone who was an adult, yet somehow targeted children. So it seems as though there's an angle of that, right? And yet this person herself was not a child. So somehow she was, she fell through. And I personally believe that it's it that social media that the internet and specifically read it. There's been some discussion that she may have had a Reddit account. They found some accounts that have similar profile names to some of the screen names that she used on other platforms. So you can't say for sure whether or not it was her. But you we do know that that certainly there's a lot of these out there. It started with, you know, certainly Tumblr, but then with Reddit and TikTok, I think these sub communities online have become a sort of a sort of echo chamber for this type of ideology. Would you agree with that? Yeah, absolutely. I mean, you know, before we had social media, before we had TikTok, we didn't really have so many problems. You know, kids, you know, always struggle with identity, but we didn't have such a severe problem like we have today. Of course, this person Audrey Hill was 28, but no, we need to find out what were they looking at online because there is an increased radicalization in the trans activist community. There's constant cause of violence. So when the Tennessee law was passed, there were multiple organizations that are well known that were pushing for retaliation in Tennessee. So no, that's what needs to come out in the investigation because we need to see who were these who was this person communicating with online? Were they in these communities that were changing their mind and almost brainwashing them into having hate? Because unfortunately, there's so much hate happening right now. You know, we tend to see in the news the mainstream media, we see the extremes, you know, one extreme to the other. We don't see, you know, what else is going on. So I think these people in these communities, they're seeing the extremes going on. They think all trans rights are being taken away. We're under attack. There's a trans genocide. But really, it's not nobody had an issue until they started doing this to children. No, sexualizing children. You know, we just had Libby Evans on the other day, talking about this, this this trans genocide. And it's you can go to wikipedia.com right now. And there's a whole article with paragraph chapter after chapter of the trans genocide. And you know, I'm sitting here thinking, is the trans genocide in the room with us right now? Where is the trans genocide? I was, I was completely unaware that this was going on. Are there other, you know, the anti trans death squad storming the nation right now? I mean, what, what exactly are they talking about? I mean, they tend to use that word all the time. They keep saying, you know, their rights have been take away. There's a trans genocide. But there's really not because if you look at any protests that involves trans activists, and you know, against women or people that are Christian or conservative, it's always the trans activists that use the violence. It's never the other side. So there's no trans genocide going on. Of course, trans people struggle. There are people that, you know, do get assaulted in any community. No, we saw the rise in Asian hate crimes since COVID. So any community has violence. Most of the violence in the trans community is actually sexual based violence. So it's nothing to do with someone because of their identity. So, you know, when they're saying about this non-existent genocide and suddenly, you know, six people from the Christian community had their lives taken by a trans gender person, you know, we have to kind of, you know, stop that rhetoric because it's not helping the trans community either going on about the genocide when other people are being killed because likely of this ideology. No, that's exactly right. We are coming up on a break. Ali London, make sure to go to the site, check out the book. I want to hold you on because I want to get more into, we can speculate what Audrey Hale's story is. But you know your story, you can tell your story. And when we come back here on Human Events, I'd like to ask you to tell your story because it might shed some light into these questions, these burning questions that so many people are asking that when we have, look, and as a Christian, as a father of two little boys, when I see a little girl lying dead at the foot of the cross in a school, I, I, it's very emotional and it's very spiritual. Stay tuned. Come back. Ali London. And we're back with Ali London, the author of the forthcoming book, gender madness about this ideology, the radicalization, and your own personal story. Now we don't know the story yet of Audrey Hale, it has yet to be written. And yet your story has been written. So I was hoping that you could share that with us for our audience to understand and see if we can find any points of overlap between what's going on here. Yeah, so I wrote gender madness, basically to help a variety of people. So I want to help people that struggle with identity, particularly young people, because this is one of the most pressing issues of our time right now. We're seeing, no, thousands and thousands of young people question their identity and want to change themselves when really they should try to focus on finding happiness from within. So, you know, part of my book covers my struggle with identity. I've had so many, you know, struggles over the years. What led to that? So we look at, you know, these kids, many kids get bullied, many kids want to fit in. Many of the kids that have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria have underlying issues. A lot of them have autism, a lot of them have bipolar, severe depression. So we're looking at the correlation. So my book explores all of those subjects. It's also exploring what is driving this growing number of young people to want to transition. So I've got multiple chapters on the influence of TikTok, how that suddenly came about in 2018. And then that's when we really started to see a huge rise in the numbers of kids wanting to transition. It's almost become a trend. So I also discussed that the social media implications, how the education system is changing as well. In particularly, a lot of my book is about America. I've spent a lot of time in America. No, a lot of these schools now in the Woke School Districts are pushing gender ideology on kids. And the parents have no idea. So they're basically encouraging these kids to change their gender before the child even really has a concept of gender. So the book explores all of that. I also have chapters on the different state laws, the current legislation being passed, either banning gender affirming care or trying to not ban it. So I'm looking at all those different laws and how we as a society can stop this happening to children, how we can protect women's rights, protect parents rights, while also being compassionate. You know, it's important to understand that many of these people, these young people, they're really struggling with their mental health, they're struggling to fit in. But you know, gender affirming care is not the solution. They're putting these kids on hormones, it's only going to amplify the problems they face. So the book covers all those issues. It's also about my faith journey, how, you know, I got to a point in life, I was so obsessed with trying to look a certain way and become a different person. I really lost my identity. So it's about finding identity and how we as a society can come together to fight this gender ideology that's harming so many people across America. Well, can you can you tease that out for us a little bit? So you say you say you lost your identity. And then you went on a faith journey. What does that mean? Can you walk us through that? So since I was a teenager, I really did struggle with myself. So I used to get severely bullied. And that was all related to my looks. I was always a lot more feminine. I used to prefer doing girls things like playing with Barbie dolls. So I used to get bullied a lot because of my femininity. And as an adult, I started having plastic surgery to just to try and improve myself. And that kind of became an addiction because I was using that as an outlet to try and deal with my past traumas. When instead I should have gone to therapy, I should have tackled these things face on. I resorted to, you know, going through this surgical journey, which, and now I've realized was like self harming, you know, I was enjoying at the time the pain I was going through because I felt I deserved it. So I went through that journey. I got to a certain same that's that's that's fascinating. So that that you you just equated this, this using plastic surgery as an outlet to self harm the same way we might consider, you know, cutting that that goes on for teens and pre teens. That for you, though, because they both require or they both include this this this pain element to it. So that's so interesting to me that you draw a parallel between essentially between the two. Yeah, I mean, it was an outlet to deal with pain. And I think that's what many young people do these days. You know, when you see young teenage girls having double mastectomies and then proudly showing their scars on TikTok, I really think, you know, they must be struggling with a lot of mental health struggles and no doctors have a responsibility not to do that to them, you know, because if somebody was anorexic, you wouldn't give them liposuction. So why on earth would you give a child that's struggling with their mental health? You know, a double mastectomy, it just doesn't make sense. So I really believe, you know, these kids, it's an outlet they want to almost self harm and flip pain on themselves because they don't fit in, they maybe get bullied and they're just trying to, you know, be included in this kind of very harmful trend of, you know, self harming and body mutilation in the name of gender. Well, and that's right, you know, because, you know, I mean, like there, there've been so many fads that go through everyone knows that that when you're in teenage years, fads are the most highly susceptible. So that's, you know, I remember when, for me, when I was going through high school, you know, you had, you had the Goths and you had, or you were flannel, you know, in the 90s, because Kurt Cobain wore flannel and you were, you were doing the grunge thing and everything was, you know, baggy jeans. And that was, those are actually coming back a little bit now. If you've noticed that the zoomers kind of have this sort of like retro 90s thing going on, the same way that in the 90s, there was a retro 70s thing going on. And yet that didn't include these extremes of behavior that we're starting to see now. But let me ask you as well, because with social media, it, it, it, it almost serves to validate those types of behaviors, doesn't it? And in fact, reward them to some extent. Absolutely. I mean, I've talked about this in my book. So basically what's happening now is these kids that are struggling with loneliness, they're struggling to accept themselves. Maybe they're getting bullied. They desperately want to fit in. So they go on to apps like Tiptog, they see very successful influences like Dylan Mulvaney, that gets millions of views that gets praise. And they want that to, you know, what child doesn't want to fit in? What child does it get related to the White House? I know right. And all those brand deals as well. So, you know, so, you know, these kids want to get validated. So when they see someone that's sharing their transition journey online, I guarantee you all those videos get so many likes, they get so many views. It's all praise. It's all positivity. So the kids that are questioning themselves, who have been indoctrinated to question themselves, they want that too. They want to be validated. So they start to slowly change. Maybe they grow their hair, they put on some makeup, suddenly they get praise. That's positive reinforcement. So they continue doing more and more extreme. And it's, you know, these days, it's all about likes and views to feel good about yourself. When really, we should be, you know, switching off the social media for kids, let them go play outdoors, let them go to church, you know, let them go do soccer or outdoor activities instead of spending all the time on Tiptog, trying to seek validation because it's only going to amplify the problems they already have. No, that you're exactly right. This, this is what they're doing is they're short circuiting the dopamine cycle in the brain. And they're creating, it's people refer to this as love bombing, people, it can be, it can be used to manipulate people in many ways. And certainly with children, you're already dealing with undeveloped brains, developing brains. This idea that, you know, you're going to flood so much of this at them. I mean, this, this, these types of techniques work on adults too, by the way. But when you're kids, you have no defenses whatsoever to it. So the idea that, that we're pushing this with kids and then rewarding it for kids, it's, it's completely dangerous. So how did you, and, and, and, and, and, and I asked this question, it might be a little sensitive, but you know, tell me what you think. How did you pull back? How did you begin to change, you know, was there a moment? Was there a pivot point? What was it for you that led you to that inflection? So I basically felt like I got to the end of the road. I've been doing so many surgeries over a number of years. I really struggled to accept myself and I still wasn't happy. And I thought, you know, I've done all this surgery. I've had facial feminization. I had all my bones shaved down. I've had six nose surgeries, three eye surgeries, three facelifts. So I've basically done so much extreme and I was thinking, what else can I do to, you know, make myself feel better? And I was thinking, okay, I can either do more surgery, or, you know, I was reaching a point where I was maturing and I was actually taking some time out from life and I was thinking, what am I actually doing? You know, I can either, you know, the famous Robert Frost poem, two roads less traveled. Yeah, neither take one road that leads to something that is unexpected, or you can take the path you're already on. I decided to go down the road that was unexpected. Take a step back, go to church and just reflect on what I was doing to myself because I was harming myself. But I was also harming people that watched me on TikTok and watched me on Instagram, because I get a lot of views on there. And no, I had a duty to be a good role model for these people. So it really made me reflect and want to actually realize I need to find the real me that's been trapped inside all these years. That's actually incredible. Wow. So you just now for for church was was that part of your family life when you were younger? Was there someone that that was calling you there or was it just sort of more a an internal decision? So I'd always been spiritual, but what's interesting, I was actually atheist most of my life. When I was the kid, I did used to go to a church school in England. So I've been to church many times as a kid, I had very familiar memories. But you know, as an adult, I just kind of lost touch with that and just kind of didn't really believe in anything. And I think, you know, the fact that I didn't believe in anything really was why I was so misguided, why I was so lost. I was lost in the wilderness. So it wasn't until I started going to church again that I really found some sense of purpose. And it made me think about life more, you know, life is more than just getting surgery. Life is more than just trying to change who you are. It's actually better to accept who you are to feel good about yourself and then to try and help other people. That's much more important.

All right, folks, welcome back here. Human events on day special. Someone that I've been meaning to have on the show for the longest time is Chloe Cole, our next guest. She is one of the most outspoken D transitioners in the country. She's currently suing Kaiser Permanente, which I completely support and please go and support that fundraiser. If you can, Chloe, thank you so much for joining us here on Human Events. Thank you for having me. So before we get into that, I do want to get into that, but I've got to ask you about this, this week we're sitting and we're watching this, so much going on, which seems like with this trans movement is hitting all at once. And we were told this was the trans week of visibility, the trans day of vengeance. There's a shooting conducted by a transgender woman in Nashville, Tennessee, attacking a Christian school. They're storming the capitals in Kentucky, in Tennessee. They stormed the Capitol in Oklahoma last month. What is going on with this movement? How has this become such a force in America? Right. So a lot of people are making it stop to either be a gun issue or a transgender issue. They're saying that either guns or this entire group of people are inherently dangerous. But I think that's, I think both of those arguments are pretty disingenuous. And I think that it's really a mental health issue. This is a group of people that is being strongly misled and they're being failed by people who should be sorry. People should know better. Right. They're being fed the idea that not only they can actually transition something that they're not that they can become the opposite sex or another sex entirely, but that they're oppressed. They're in a press group and they should fight tooth and nail for the rights. It's like, and you hear this and you, it seems like it's happening more in conservative states, right? And because these bills are being passed and they're being told not that, not that, oh, this is a new, but they're actually being told that this is a genocide, that this is the stripping of rights, that this is the taking away of health care. And what, what, what kind of emotion does that elicit from a person who's told those things and believes them? Right. I think their lives are being threatened because they're being told that the rights are being taken away, that their health care is being stripped of them, stripped from them. And obviously this is not true. Chloe, we have to understand that there's something driving all of these events that we're seeing, whether it's in Tennessee at a Christian school or the Tennessee Capitol or in Kentucky or in Oklahoma last month, that there is a movement behind this. And, and we're trying, we're struggling to understand what is this movement? Who is behind it? Where are the people benefiting from it? Right, it's very ideologically driven. They push transition as the only means of treating gender dysphoria and anything else is conversion therapy, it's genocide. And because legislators, especially in these red states, are trying to stop the practice of childhood transition and improve the model of care for these kids, they are painting it as something, as a human rights issue that these kids are having their livelihood, their health care stripped away from them. And I have one thing that I've noticed, I travel along the road and I travel around a lot. And I just filed legislature across the US. And a lot of these, in a lot of these red states that I've testified in, the activists during these hearings are a lot more desperate, they're a lot more vocal. They're, they often interrupt the hearing by, by making a show themselves by shouting, by laughing. And I often get shouted out when I'm leaving the room. And I think part of that is because they're more, they're more desperate. Their ideology is, is losing. No, when, when they, when they target you in these events, have, what about your, are, have you been personally threatened by this movement? Have they, have they passed threats like credible threats to you in any way? Yeah, I actually hosted a rally, um, earlier this month at the, at the, the California Capitol. California, right? It wasn't, yeah, it wasn't, it wasn't political in any way. It was just about people like me who have been harmed by the affirmative care model and detransitioned. But of course, Antifa had to step in and make it a political thing. And, um, I got dozens of threats over Twitter and, um, luckily, police kept the, uh, the riots away from the actual event, but they showed up at a local park and they actually, um, they destroyed, um, they destroyed media equipment and assaulted several people. And, um, outside of that, I've gotten, I can't even count the number of threats that I've, that I've gotten online, um, threats of a physical assault of, of rape. And I've, I've been docked. Chloe, we're coming up on a break right now, but I'd like if we can for in the next segment, because we do have you for one more segment, I'd love for you to share that story with us and to tell our audience your story, because I think, as we look into what happened with Nashville, we don't know all the details, but your story might be able to show and shine some light on it. Stay tuned folks. We'll be right back with more of Chloe Cole. And we're back with Chloe Cole, Chloe. And our last segment, you know, you, you shared with us some very powerful testimony. And I wouldn't say that that was testimony about what this movement is doing to this country, the radicalization of the youth in many cases, but also other members of society. I like this, uh, Audrey Hale down in Tennessee, but, but I wanted if you can, to share with us your story for the audience, uh, you, we, we know about the law that you're suing Kaiser Permanente now, but, but take us back to when you yourself first encountered, uh, the transgender movement, transgender ism online as an ideology and walk us through what that was like for you. So my first exposure to it was through the internet, through social media. Um, I got my first phone when I was 11 and the first social media app that I really used was Instagram. And, um, I'd say that I was a pretty vulnerable kid in a lot of ways because I was a little bit more on the gender nonconforming side. I was, I was more of a tomboy and I had some body image issues. I started puberty pretty early and I became pretty conscious of, of that from a very young age. And I was being fed a lot of these images of women that I just, I felt like I couldn't match up to and on top of that, I was in the communities that, um, that I would browse, um, on things like video games and shows that I watched. There were a lot of other kids and young adults who identified as either gay, lesbian, bisexual or overwhelmingly transgender. A lot of them were non-binary or they identified as the opposite sex. And I started seeing a lot of posts that were specifically about transitioning and gender and sexuality. And because I was at a pretty, I was at an age where naturally I would start to wonder like, about myself, where I stood in the world where I was attracted to and what's role I would fill in the world. And after being exposed to, after being exposed to the stuff for so long, I started wondering about my own sexuality and gender identity. And after a while, it just made sense that as a very masculine girl who never fit in, never really felt very pretty, it just, it just made sense that this whole time I was a boy. And I started to to change myself in pursuit of that. I, I started to cut my hair short. I started to, um, to wear different clothing. And I tried to act more like the boys at school and even changed my name. And, um, I came out to my parents when I was 12, going on 13. And their reaction was to take me to a therapist because they didn't know how to handle this. They didn't know anything about this. And they thought that it would be best to get a professional involved. But what ended up happening was that my delusion of actually being the opposite sex was affirmed. I was treated as a fibro-reboy. They only referred to me by, by my preferred name, by my preferred pronouns. And they didn't go by anything else. They never even went into the underlying issues that I had. And what they knew of, they didn't address. It was treated as a completely standalone issue from my gender dysphoria. And they told my parents later that in an appointment they had, I don't think I was there for this actually. So I couldn't really refute anything that was, that was said and I didn't know what they were, what they were telling my parents at the time. But they told my parents that if I wasn't allowed to try this shit, then it was very likely that I would kill myself. And this was when, at the time I was, I was starting to ask my parents to take me to an appointment to put me on hormones because I thought that that was the natural progression of things, that it was the only means of treating gender dysphoria. And that I should be on these treatments, ideally as early as possible. Because that was how the trans community represented things. That was how the research that I did, both from the community and from official medical resources seemed to point to this as the only way of treating my condition. Would your, did your parents question the doctors at all? Did they ever have a time where they pushed back and said, does this, this seems extreme? You know, you know, and of course you want to trust your doctor, but obviously some of the things that you're talking about here are quite, quite extreme. And certainly, shall we say not, not exactly commonly, you know, commonly understood. I mean, I don't think people are used to, and certainly at that age, these types of procedures going on. So was there any, was there any level of pushback like that? Yeah, there, there was actually they, they were okay with me changing the way I addressed and they tried to go along with my name change, but they didn't want to, they didn't want me to be making any permanent decisions. They didn't want that on their hands. They didn't want me to make any choices that I very well could regret as an adult. And they told us the doctors, they voiced their concerns and they were, they were just ignored. And so at that point did, and I know at some point, and obviously you, you've told the story before, at what point did, does it, do they go from not just blockers and hormones, but to actual surgery? Right. So just about half a year after I was, I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria, was when I was put on blockers and a month after that was when I was, I was put on testosterone. And they actually broke their, their protocol for gender dysphoric children. That seems so fast. That's, I'm sorry. That's just, that's shocking to me. That seems so fast. Instead seems extremely aggressive. Yeah, it was, it was actually pretty, pretty similar with surgery even. I started treatment at, at 13 and two years later, after my sophomore year was when, I underwent surgery. And my first appointment for that was roughly around the same time period. It was about half a year before that went. So it's half a year, it's half a year. And then, so at this point, you know, you've, you've, you've undergone all this. Are you, are you feeling though, at some point, you, you talked about the feelings that you had when you, and when you were online, you were interacting with, with this content online, other users and that you're feeling these, these feelings of not fitting in. At any point, did you feel those feelings go away? Did you start to feel like you fit in? Did you start to feel like you were actually, you know, becoming your true self as supposedly they, you know, they, they say is a way you're supposed to feel. Yeah, it was more like, with each treatment, there was like a honeymoon period. Once I started on testosterone, which I was, I was in my eighth grade year and I hadn't really come out to anybody yet. I wasn't initially accepted by, by my peers when I started transitioning because, I mean, I mostly attribute it to the fact that I was in middle school and people just aren't nice, especially towards kids who present differently. But once I was in high school, I was on testosterone for long enough that, my voice was fairly deep, deeper than most boys, my age at the time actually. The, the, the testosterone was, was very effective, but I looked, I appeared to be just like any other boy on my age and nobody other than people who I went to L. Manchin Middle School with knew that I, that I even was a biological female. And there were a few instances when I was outed behind my back, but for the post, for the most part, nobody knew and they just saw me as another one on the boys. And there was kind of that comfort of being able to, to make male friends and be as part of a group and seemingly be accepted for who at the time, who I thought I was. But that went away after a while. I, um, we all started setting in and my relationships weren't as close anymore. I didn't really have a lot of room to talk about my feelings or my personal struggles and my, my dating, um, my dating pool was really severely limited by this. I mean, everybody, a lot of my other friends were getting into relationships and getting girlfriends and boyfriends, but I was somebody who appeared to outwardly be male, but I was still attracted to males. And this proved very difficult. There were, there were a few people, there were a few guys who expressed interest in me, but it often felt like if anything, I was just an object of a fetish, mostly for these people. And I was just a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a little bit of a, a fetish, mostly for these people. And I was, it was very, it was very lonely. Yeah. It's like, it's like, it's like a, like a, like a, like a gimmick or a, you know, something special, but it's not, it's more about the, you know, the objectification in a sense, not, not you, you know, this, this, you, you mentioned being on testosterone. What, what, what did that feel like? What, what changes did you notice when you're on testosterone? Yeah. So. I was, I was done with blockers first. And I was already about like three or four years in a peer B before I started on them. And I'd already been having my period for almost two years by that point. So it basically sent me to a state of menopause. I was, I had pretty much no sex hormones in my body. My, my sex drive went all the way down. I was very lethargic. And I was getting hot flashes and edging all over my body. And I felt pretty depressed. I just wanted to, to move on to the next step. And so once I started on testosterone, naturally I felt great. All my energy was back and I had a massive spike in my sex drive. And I felt, I started to develop the competitive streak. And I became more confident. But at the same time it was a little, a little bit more difficult to regulate my, my emotions, particularly my anger. And you mentioned this, this aggression. They, and they, they've said, and they showed, study after study shows this, that testosterone of course increases aggression. And then something, by the way, that men deal with at an early age, that we, you know, we, we are prone to anger a lot more. And because of men's physical, you know, stature, even, even when you're young, right? Either that's why there's a lot of fistfights that go on. I've got two little boys, you know, I've got to pull them apart from time to time when they want to, they're both going for the same toy or something. And then even that continues on into, you mentioned middle school, then even high school to some extent. And, and you learn that you have to, you have to regulate that yourself, right? Because you don't want to just go through life answering everything with aggression and anger and physical, you know, physical, you know, violence in some cases. But, but we also, and I think Jordan Peterson even mentions this, that he talks about how all, all male to male relations have this sort of underlying subtext of, you know, we could do this another way. But we're going to, you know, we're going to, we're going to do this through, through talk and, and speech. But, but I can't even imagine that if you're, if you're just being, you're given this by some doctor at some point in an aggressive way, very, sounds like very ramped up and straight to surgery, that there's, there's no explanation whatsoever about how to deal with these things or what changes to expect or how you should act because there's no playbook whatsoever. So, yeah, I didn't grow up with that. Yeah. It was very abrupt. Yeah, completely abrupt. So, you know, how would you know, because I'm sure are they, are they sitting there talking to you explaining to you that this is how you have to deal with it. Um, I mean, they, in these appointments, they focus more on like the physical side effects and even then it was very vague, but. Everything that they, that they talked about with me was in very vague terms and. Of course, I was being given to me. It was the. The prescription for these things were given to me by a female. So she wouldn't understand. I mean, I laugh, I'm just saying, of course, right? Cause that's ridiculous because someone who has no idea what any of these hormones even feel like. So you've got to the point where you've launched this lawsuit and apologize for, because we're, you know, we're coming up on time, but tell us a little bit about the lawsuit. Where is what is, what specifically are you seeking here and how can people get involved? Yeah, so I'm. I'm going to deal in with a center for American Liberty. Um, is, is my attorney and. We filed the suit recently. Just a few weeks ago. And we, the parties that were suing are. My surgeon, um, the hospital that I had surgery at my gender specialist who referred me to surgery and an endocrinologist who put me on hormones as well as. Kaiser Permanente, which is both my health care provider and my insurance provider. So it's, it's a pretty huge undertaking, but. My. My hope in. And this lawsuit is that. Not only that I can get justice for myself and get the care that I need because, um, I haven't gotten any help with them. With any of the complications that I've had with transitioning or even with. Was going through the transition. But I also want to. I hope that I can create a precedent for other teachers and other people who. Have been harmed to be treatments to. Be able to get justice for themselves as well. That's absolutely great. Where can people go to find out more about that and where to follow you. So. My lawsuit. The information and the fundraiser for my lawsuit is available on the center for American Liberty website. And I. I'm active on Twitter and Instagram at ch triple low. C. Oh. Chloe Cole God bless you. Thank you. Seriously. Thank you so much for sharing so much of your story with us. That was incredible. And I know for the folks back home who want to get involved, please go follow Chloe. Please donate to her lawsuit. We need. To share this story with as many people as possible so we can understand what's going on and help. Other people that are caught in the same situation again. God bless you. Go bless your family. Thank you. Thank you. Gender identity disorder all the way up into the latest issue of DSM five was listed as a mental illness. Yet it was taken out for political reasons, not medical, not psychological. Are we following the science or are we telling the science what it should be.
