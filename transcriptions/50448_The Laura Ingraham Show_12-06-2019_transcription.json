It's really upsetting to think that People can be excluded because of who they are or Because of what they wear It's it's nothing more than that. It's just somebody coming in a fancy outfit to read stories to little kids Is that really what it's about? Really so is that the way Transgendered persons or drag queens would describe themselves just people who wear funny costumes. I think that's wrong Actually, they certainly don't describe themselves that way. It's a lot more complex than that But do you see how? The left and these progressive parents. I mean, I don't know how they found like they found one person who would be so excited about this But that's how they have to sell it. Oh, don't worry. It's just for the kids It's just a nice story hour. This is so cute isn't this fun. It's just a clown dressed like a dress like someone else We like costumes. We use them on Halloween and in masquerade parties What is this really all about though? Well, the Washington Post has a piece and it's you know typical bias clap trap from the Washington Post But it has a piece about this Drag Queen storytime issue, which is it's kind of you know what I described as this is the new Challenge to the Christian Baker story You wonder well why you know a gay couple can go anywhere for cake. Why do they seek a You know some type of controversy with the one baker they know Who is like I don't know born-again Christian doesn't want to make like why are they pushing this? It's just a coincidence and Why is this happening in other? forums a flower or a ranger, you know, is it just this is just random stuff that's happened. No, it's not random This is a concerted effort on the part in the Washington Post makes this point It's a concerted effort on the part of San Francisco activists to spread the Tolerance this is what they call the tolerance what it really is is I think foisting San Francisco values on the rest of the country That you parents are going to get numb to this everyone will and especially kids This is just this is just this is just like everybody you know the drag queens just like everybody else So don't this if you don't like the drag queen then you don't like Anything you are not a tolerant good person So you must love the drag queen in story time You must bring your child if you object to this in any way shape or form you're part of the Trump Atmosphere of intolerance and hatred toward people who aren't like you the other as the left likes to call the other But what you really find when you dig down into these types of stories is that They're being foisted upon the country with a clear agenda This is a gender-driven cultural politics here And it's wrapped up as all this is just for the kids isn't this nice. It's done for the kids Well, this is done to change The kids and the perhaps even in some cases the parents perceptions of gender and traditional norms of gender and Understanding of gender and so forth and so by the time the kid gets into high school or college there's been a long period of of You know becoming You know a climatized acclimated I should say to this Understanding of the fluidity of gender and and the idea of man and woman and masculine and feminine That's not the window. No, no, no, no, that's old. That's yesterday. No, no, no This is this is part of the new atmosphere the new environment in which you must You must embrace it in order to be truly compassionate. I should say human being otherwise You're just one of these religious Intolerant holier-than-thou-pious narrow-minded Traglodyte types Who don't like their kids who claim that they don't like their kids to be sexualized at a young age and exposed to new sexual understandings even though The parents who think well, why are you doing this in a public library? Why is why do little kids? Have to be introduced to these Yeah, these visions of the changing fluid world of gender Why why are you going after the kids this way? That's what a lot of the parents are saying in these comments, but those parents are treated like complete pariahs in the Dominant media culture someone the Washington Post The story is always framed as well the intolerant Christian right Stands up and says no to the poor drag queens. How dare they? But then you there's also some tidbits buried in the story the organization drag queen story hour. It's actually an organization's name Started in late 2015 in San Francisco ready. This is the Washington Post piece Just this is the rise of Trump, right? Just as the country's Reinvigorated right wing was coming to form But it has found many fans With chapters in areas outside traditionally liberal cities It now has outposts. I mean they have an office In places like Milwaukee, New Orleans Charlotte, Mobile, Alabama and San Marcos, Texas its founders Have described it as a reaction to the harsh political landscape of the past few years in which painful debates about issues like identity Sexuality and race Have animated the country's politics think about just that writing that sense in other words If anyone disagrees with what the left is doing on issues of gender race or anything else for that matter This is a painful environment that must be confronted directly face to face by The drag queens and others and anyone on the other side is a horrible awful rotten person. That's just it That's that's what this is but what the real goal here And I'm you know reading all these message boards on this the real goal here is the kids If you if you get the kids whether they're in a public school and suddenly you have you know a day Or a six-year-old Who was John the day before comes to school as Jane or Jeanette and you have to call the boy now Jeanette because of that's what the boy identifies That's the new introduction at a young age to children who You know they they don't understand they're just little kids They just want to be kids and what I would say to all of this is why are you doing this to the children? Why do you feel like you have to subject children to adult themes and These are adult themes don't don't say it's just a costume and ain't a cost a drag queen is a nightclub performance is a nightclub performer. Thank you very much and it's been popularized because of RuPaul and You know everyone loves RuPaul's miss but this is just what it's you know This is what it what it's all about and don't don't disabuse yourself of the notion that this is about Oh, you know these these are just volunteers. I want to read stories to kids No, no the Washington Post makes it clear that the founders started this in a reaction to Trump That's what it is like as if Trump talks about like gay or any other issues I didn't talk about that silly absolutely ridiculous, but that's where we are. It's very very disturbing and I Think what we're going to continue to see is this effort to sexualize Young people if adults want to you know dress up or call themselves different names I don't I don't care what you do But don't tell me that my children have to get up and and you know give you a high-five for it because guess what everyone can believe what they want to believe and What we intend to do on this podcast is to demonstrate how the left and It's clear at this point are is the most completely intolerant group of folks Because of the way that they they require you to bow down and if you don't bow down to this You're an intolerant bigoted horrible awful rotten person Except them by the way the the church that they said saved this story hour is the United Church of Christ Which is as you know the the most left-wing church in the United States is pushed a lot of these types of issues over the years So that's just that's just where we are on that, but drag Queen's story hour So it's just it's a new Christian Baker challenge to the Christian Baker story.

This has been long Anticipated and long awaited a lot of people have problems with Pope Francis think he's too liberal We're concerned that this was going to be opening the door to a reconsideration of time I never thought that but a lot of people did and they came down with basically a very traditional document about the understanding of male versus female And so we'll get into that in just a moment with Bill Donahue from the Catholic League and what does all this mean? but first well now they're not only Welcoming kids to drag queen story hours They're encouraging kids to themselves become drag queens I'm Desmond. I'm 11 years old and I like pizza Trains and drinking root beers and it's tapping free. I Also do drag and I love to put on makeup dresses and wigs and of course jewelry is necessary My full drag name is Desmond is amazing I love doing drag because it makes me feel amazing and self-expressive It just feels amazing to know that people love what I do my one big message would be three words be yourself always Wow Joining us now is built on a here from the Catholic League Bill there's a piece of Nash review by Madeline Kern's about this little boy and the title is Desmond is amazing needs saving About this this little boy and what's happened to our youth their innocence before puberty even trying to change kids understanding of just or you know basic concepts or sexualize them and Destroy their innocence. What's happening here? Well, this is child abuse. Let's go for what it is And the people behind this I want to make it clear the average gay person is probably no more interested in this In the average straight person and you're having got enough gays in this country If they lined up single file to pull this kind of a lot of cessation of our society Together now you couldn't do it without the help of an awful lot of straight people almost all of them are straight people They may be guided by gay activists and there's a difference for the gay activists and a person is not an activist obviously Those are the ones I'm talking about but this is an attempt basically. It's an assault on nature and our nature is gone That's what it's really about. It's about the family of course and everything else And they're using radical individualism as their spear But it's basically in a salt on nature They're trying to deny the existence of nature that there are fundamental profound differences between men and woman rooted not in culture But in nature and and that's what we're up against Well, I think when you look at this new You know again contrived Controversy and it's started as a group of activists in San Francisco in 2015 Who decided how do we? sell this gender fluidity concept and Get publicity and grow this movement They grow it by starting this drag queen story hour Organization in San Francisco in 2015 happens to coincide with the rise of Donald Trump they start this organization and then they Export it across the United States and get all these liberal reporters to write pieces about these intolerant Christian conservatives and Catholic groups who are Expressing outrage that even the public libraries are turning into these little political and social transformation instruments Well a number of years ago. I wrote about the public libraries hosting NAMBLA. That's right the North American Manboy Love Association Which believes? If he's eighties too late If they're organized for one purpose to sexually molest little boys and girls mostly boys And they are they organized and meet for the purpose of molesting molesting kids in Public libraries at public expense and defended by the American Civil Liberties Union So it's not it's not a great leap now you talk about intolerance The Vatican puts out a document which simply restates the obvious that there are fundamental difference between men and women and last night The most filthy-mounted comedian on television today Trevor Noah goes off and says things which I cannot we're gonna play some of it podcast. Yeah, well, we're gonna play some absolutely astonishing Yeah, let's play some of it the stuff that we can play Let's listen. Oh and get this dance together part of the Vatican's rationale is that transgender people go against its belief that God made men and women to reproduce Which first of all transgender people can reproduce and secondly again? Why do you care? Right you don't even let your people reproduce right? Nums aren't allowed to have sex right priests can't get little boys pregnant. Yeah Horrific person Some of the people at Viacom before but I just before I went on the air here with you Laura Mobilizing this day if we've contact we're going to contact we have the names. I'm gonna put out a statement on Trevor Noah shortly Following our victory in Michigan with this Trump nominee who was terribly flawed But this thing here is amazing. We've got the names and and the address is now all the top people who work at Viacom They've got to do something about this and I don't want to be lectured by one more person on the left That the people who are you don't agree with civility and the people who are in college are Conservatives Nobody would put this guy on television if he attacked homosexuals As much as he taxed the Catholic church and the and of course he misrepresents the church's teachings Which that's all deliberate to either that or just they're displaying fools But this is what we're up against in my lifetime I've never seen such an all-out frontal assault by moral nihilists who are morally bankrupt on the traditional values that this country was rooted in again so much of this comes down to advancing an agenda by using children and Manipulating the thoughts and the natural understanding of children. That's where I have a real Real concern and I you know, I'm not alone Yeah, they want to get the hands of the kids. There's no question about that and this whole idea of changing your sex Uh, they're not changing your gender. That's social A role that I learned from nature Changing your sex this started in john's hopkins university in the medical school back in the 1960s And it was started by people who not some of whom I think had good intentions other zoom I don't think I know quite a bit about this subject and it but forget about the mode of there They started back in the 1960s at john's hopkins and after about two or three decades They came to the conclusion most of them at least that not only does it not work in the sense of making somebody happy But approximately nine years after the people make the sex change. There's a big spike in the suicide rate Now, this is not only true in the United States. It's true in places like sweden Well, yeah, well palma q who is the leading researcher at john's hopkins on and has been for decades on this gender fluidity movement the medical Research behind it Sex reassignment this idea of sex reassignment. It doesn't work It's impossible to reassign someone sex physically and attempting to do so doesn't produce good outcomes psychosocially and this this was written initially as a Synopsis by ryan anderson as a phd also in this focuses on this area uh for the heritage foundation, but mccue is the distinguished service professor of psychiatry at john's hopkins and he said transgendered men Do not become women nor do transgendered women become men all including people like bruce bruce Jenner become feminized men or masculineized women Counterfeits or impersonators of the sex with which they quote identify In that lies their problematic future And that's you know, I have a lot of trouble sex equality In a new book called common sense Catholicism. Oh great. This issue and in fact, I mentioned Jenner and I said he can't menstruate Okay, can people get that through their head? He can't menstruate. He will never be a woman. He will always be a male You can't change your chromosomal makeup I mean, this is madness on stilts and the idea that it's coming from the academy doesn't surprise me That's where the lunes are they used to be in the asylum now. They get now they have tenure And they're teaching this stuff. It bubbles down percolate down into into the culture itself What really is amazing to me though, laura more than anything else the one second of the population that I most really Disheartened with because they've totally dropped their guard altogether. That's the corporate elite of america They are on board from amazon and the silicon valley to Goldman Sachs here in the wall street area Kellogg Macy's has has on ronlai to quest street from macy's the big big one here in hell square in new york city I was walking down the street. You have a dead get to a doctor's appointment On 34th street and I see they have all the rainbow colors out into the sidewalk I guess new york city allows them to do that all over pride pride pride Look, I don't care whether somebody's gay or not. I know people were discriminated against in the past I understand that a lot of times unjustly, but the idea of people being pride and by the way, how did this turn out to be a month? I thought it was a day We can have st. Patrick's day month or i make it make march irish month or I don't know where do we go with this? I'm kind of over all the months. I mean, I mean people like because I was a breast cancer You know, I had breast cancer, but if you like breast cancer month I said it seems like for people who've had breast cancer for us We're always we're always being very vigilant about our health and trying so it's kind of all the time for us So i'm not really understanding the month, but I guess it's just a time to have awareness about issues and so forth But this is being done on the on this on the gender reassignment And then the drag queen is you know, it's kind of is different because not all drag queens are transgender persons are seeking Sexory assignment surgery there are lots of different topics here But my point is why are we dragging? Children into this debate if you want to debate this as an adult and debate paul mckew and the the guardian of in britain did this piece that Looked at a hundred follow-up studies of post-operative Transsexuals by Birmingham universities research intelligence facility And they found some really interesting things about post-operative transsexuals And it was not at all conclusive that this was a good thing to encourage people to get this surgery Uh, and so if we wanted to bait that then that would be interesting among adults But why do I have to drag the children into this that is my concern? Well, it fits in with the left agenda. They're always driven by one word power And so what you try to do is to indoctrinate and why not start it in in the kindergarten's Go go go to the preschool if you can Try to get kids when they're young and try to get get to get them Their their minds molded that this is acceptable That's what they're teaching in schools now and there's every kind of sex is all equal What is not more dangerous than the other even though that's obviously not true They're trying to teach these kids that a boy can become a girl and so Sally can become Sam and Sam can become Sally Has as dr. McEw's uh pointed out as you mentioned him before These people are mentally ill that is his considered judgment after dealing with this for decades And we were to treat these people Treat them as human beings for the maladies that they suffer from and not trying to proselytize Others and then when people rightly object as parents that I don't want my kids subjected to this kind of indoctrination This kind of perverse Understandative sexuality that we're called in tolerance Yet they're the ones trying to shove their radical secular gender down the throats of people and they won't allow to you opt out We've seen this in california what's going on right now There's no opt out clause for any of this kind of stuff And that's what they are teaching in the textbooks and unfortunately California is the gold standard of textbook that sets the standard for textbooks of course the other 49 states That's where they where they get their lead from so no they don't want to allow choice for that To that extent obviously the only choice they like is what is the choice to abort? But when it comes to parent parental choice, that's just simply that's something the left will never tolerate Yeah, i'm looking at the um american psychiatric diagnostic manual um in the dsm it's called and they have the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria and Transsexualism gender identity disorder and so forth there's been a lot of political pressure put on the psychiatric um community to destigmatize uh these You know these what they called maladies Uh and to say this is not though. No, this is not a condition. This is not a psychiatric condition This is just a state of being so they're under pressure and have been and that's why someone like paul mccue You'll rarely see him do an interview because this is a man who's dealt in facts and long-term studies follow-up studies of individuals And so they can't really debate someone like mccue on the facts Uh bill instead they go straight to the politics Love is love you're a horrible person if you don't embrace this and parents who don't bring their kids to this, you know drag queen's story time They're also part of the right wing white nationalist movement. I mean so it's just a complete tiring of anyone Who calls into question this uh, and I think sexualization of our kids And this actually began around 1970. It was 1973 the american psychological association Uh decided that uh that homosexuality was not a mental illness Um, and that's that's fine if they want to come to that conclusion based on scientific evidence But starting three years before that around 1970 Gay activists showed up at the at the convention the american psychological association every year to intimidate and call them nazis and got the home phone numbers and addresses This was all uh Pressure politics coming from the left. There was no scientific evidence to suggest that they should change the diagnostic Statistical manual whatsoever and they did so they gave they caved in out out of intimidation This has pretty well been recounted and now of course they got the psychiatric community on board as well You get the corporations on board you even have some of the church as you mentioned united church of christ That was berry lins church From the americans united for separation of church and state so You we really got our hands full on this the average american of course does want to protect his kid But those who have parents unfortunately, we're not reproducing the way we should But those so the single people don't seem to care But those who have those of us who have parent or parents and have kids They're the ones who care about this stuff and unless we we can get to them and mobilize them Uh, the left will simply uh take over altogether. Yeah, just so ed though everyone understands what bill is referencing here I think it's important to read it right from uh, the research gate dot net which publishes the american psychiatric diagnostic manual And you can read through all the changes over the years and you know look things change and we understand that but let's just listen to this It's very very interesting in 1980 the american psychiatric association recognized transsexuality as a quote mental disorder Revising this designation more specifically in 1994 as a quote gender identity disorder Then in in 2013 the term for diagnosis was changed to quote gender dysphoria in order to make it sound less pathological And that's uh zucker the guy who wrote this for the manual another term that has been used in order to depathologize the diagnosis Of trans identities is quote gender incongruence. So you see how the language has changed over time and it's meant to ease it into the you know the common parlance and also ease it into the common understanding and acceptance But that's interesting for so 1980 From a mental disorder and today it's gender incongruence which signed it. This sounds fine. I mean it sounds well It's kind of incongruent, but what isn't? Well, you know, it's interesting. I I still hold on to some of my textbooks that I used to sign to my students in sociology In in social problem and now of course everything's changed, but again it changed not for scientific reasons There was no empirical evidence that came out which said no previous ideas were wrong It was all a matter of the politicization Of the academy as robert nismith a great sociologist said a long time ago We don't have any more social sciences the role political sciences And it's on that basis that kids are just being told what what to think on this And and of course the the the media hollywood the autistic community now the corporate world They're all lining up single file and they've decided who's oppressed and who isn't oppressed And that's why trump and no one can go ahead with this filthy mouth ripping the catholic church with impunity Because they simply don't care. That's how that's how much the moral destitution of some segments of the media has collapsed to such an extent That they would allow this kind of vile language used against any religion. It's uh It's part and parcel of the madness of our society today Uh build on a hue. Uh, thank you so much for joining us. We really appreciate it and remember our fantastic conversation that we've been having about your skin in the summer now Summertime is tough on the skin you got to put on the spf and stay out of the sun as much as you can Uh, we're a big hat and you know, we i'm trying to drill this into my kids But at the time you get older Your skin's been through a lot so it needs more care and give it some tlc With my friends at chamomony who make the great genia cell line of products And robin from lubbock texas loves a particular product which i've been using now for way over well probably 12 13 months now It's called the genu cell jawline cream And you use it you'll see it as she uses it She's blown away And after two or three days you see the difference in the skin along your jawline and your neck And it has this thing called the mdl technology Which targets that delicate skin in your neck on your neck area to help it look tighter and healthier looking now You'll see the results Quickly and if you don't 100 percent money back guarantee always no questions asked they're not going to hassle you you'll get your money back But i promise you you're going to love these products Remember it's very easy you text eyes one to seven seven four five three Eyes one to seven seven four five three or just go to genu cell dot com now Remember you're going to receive the free under eye for bags and puffiness that classic genia cell cream You'll receive that free with your order of the jawline and neck treatment again It's very easy text eyes one to seven seven four five three or just go to genu cell dot com And you also get free shipping, which is very cool genu cell dot com You Hi, i'm jia and i am transgender at the end of middle school like eighth grade I decided to come out to my friends and like tell them that I was transgender And like this how i've been feeling for like the past 13 years of my life So I decided to write a letter to my whole entire school to let like everyone know what was going on The letter just said that this is how i've been feeling for the past 13 years And that I will be coming to school and like I guess like what society says like girls close and i'll be like Identifying like with she her pronouns Well, we've had a lot of Changes in our schools over the years and this one Really is one of the most profound Where children Are just sua sponte that means seemingly out of nowhere beginning to say no They're not wanting to be called a girl or a boy anymore This is my new name and this is who i am and this is how I quote identify It's been documented in britain and in some towns there's been a 900 percent increase And the incidence of individuals young people calling themselves quote Transgendered what's going on here and is there any concern and it seems to be building Of children going down this road some wanting attention some having other problems then Inextrably altering their body their development and perhaps endangering their psychological futures Uh, let alone their physical futures Uh, and what of this do we need to have a conversation about this? We are talking about children here joining us now was wall tire. He's the founder of the website sex change regret And it's a site for people Who of course regret trying to change? Their genders he joins us now. Um, waltz we've been talking about a lot of topics today I mean I love all people and I always say i'm i'm the most flawed person out there So i'm i really try not to I'm not going to judge people condemn people. That's not my job. My job is to ask questions and And I hope to try to be fair as I do that, but there really seems to be a building consensus uh solidified in the popular culture in the mainstream media that These types of quote reassignment surgeries and gender blockers For children that they're fine no problem And it's just a in it's just a logical choice for kids who are who you know feel like they're not in the right bodies What what is your experience and how can you inform us with it? Yeah, working with the people who are thanks for app me on uh working with the people who've been through this of all ages Uh, what we find is that somewhere between Three and 15 years after they transition sometimes 20 years Uh, they find that it's um not what they thought it was going to be they regretted deeply they found that their body has been Transformed beyond repair. They become even more deeply depressed After Than they were before and so what we're really dealing with for is what we call a social contagion. This is exploding as you pointed out Only because other people are doing it. So this is this effect of people joining other people It's a way to gain attention many of these young people who are identifying as transgender Have had difficulty being uh accepted socially and as soon as you identify as a transgender you can suck all the Air out of the room and become recognized in you're a hero and so um we're dealing with Uh, what people have identified is rapid onset of gender dysphoria What that really means is they don't have gender dysphoria. It's just a social Idea boy. I can become popular immediately if I come out people will recognize me Uh, I'll become the center of attention and so it's it's really Uh very destructive the long-term harm that comes from hormone blockers and engaging in cross-gender hormones and surgeries Um are we see very high rates of suicide 19 Times more likely to have a successful suicide by the people who've transitioned than the people who haven't Well What can be done? You know, what what can be done about this in a culture where if you even raise the issue now, I know a lot of people who won't even talk about this because they're afraid of of the backlash and I just don't you know, I just I just say look if you're if you're honest about Children and what children? Need and want and what? You know what the science is if you're honest about it Then you have to ask questions You know, they they're always accusing of christians and serivatives and people who try to be You know traditional Catholics and just traditional people period they always accuse them of being anti-science Yeah, and so so now we're saying okay the world renowned experts on this issue like paul mckue And paul hruz These people have actually done the work peer reviewed studies actually done the long-term work And their their their findings are disturbing yep disturbing Very disturbing and and laura what can be done? And I recently wrote a book that's been released is called trans life survivors And this is probably one of the ways that we can impact it because it's very hard to come out publicly Or have an effect in schools and say you shouldn't be doing this But I found that people are grabbing this book They're beginning to understand the destructive because it talks about the destruction There's 30 stories in there people who've been through this of all ages And it talks about their suicides it talks about their attempted suicides and the destructive components Of attempting to change genders and so what we realize is nobody actually changes Uh, they they make themselves look different But after a period of time they realized that this is a masquerade that they really didn't change that they were affirmed in this by You know, their psychological help or from school or whatever And and then it fades away And and they don't have this desire to change genders anymore and that's why my website Gets hundreds of thousands of views and that's why i'm working with people every single day of the week Who are struggling to now be transitioned back and and find peace After having gone through this so it's very destructive While it looks really good and there's a lot of people pushing for this at the outset The downside Is horrible and that's why like paul ruse and the cube where friends of mine Have got the data they've done the research and it's destructive and we shouldn't be promoting transgender ideology even in the summary of the diagnostic changes of how they Diagnosed excuse me people individuals with gender dysphoria, which is the new way they refer to this It's been a changing nomenclature since 1980 And I just I just documented that reading from the diagnostic manuals is not a conservative website uh, they're even Concerned about the gender. This is part. This is like a footnote five. I'm into the footnotes This is how geeky I am the gender dysphoria criteria for children are potentially more conservative than they were In the dsm for t.r. Because the current Criterion and its eight symptoms is now a necessary symptom for the diagnosis um And in total the the criterion pertains to the child's strong desire To be the other gender or some alternate gender different from one's assigned gender The tightening of the requirement for caseness Will likely sharpen the distinction between a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and normative variation. I think I think more people Are concerned now than ever more than ever that children respond to the power of suggestion And that in in many of these cases the children are seeing through the power of suggestion And glamorization in the popular culture that this is a way to be accepted and they might be Suffering in many ways of of things going on at home or they might just they might be upset about various things in their lives um, but It's very very important that Children are not improperly diagnosed and then put on a track for Procedures or medication whose long-term effect we do not know Is that correctly stated? Absolutely correct and keep in mind that the diagnosis for gender dysphoria is consistent Insistent and persistent but also those three components. That's all it takes to be diagnosed as a child with gender dysphoria That also is the same way and criteria used for mental disorders if they if they're struggling from depression Or bipolar disorder anything else consistent persistent and insistent that it's continued These are all the same things you use to diagnose mental disorders. So We're diagnosing children and and putting them on a path. It's very destructive for them and um, it's just way too easy for them to say I feel like i'm a girl If they're a guy and then for mom to say oh well, you're probably transgender and you should change your name and get a different pronouns and this is Absolutely what happened to me. It was very destructive. I've been dealing with this now for 74 years. There is nothing good about it Except my detransition in 1990 and i've been speaking about it ever since and that's why I mentioned again my book trans live survivors It has the stories in there about children and why it's important preparing to read this book before they affirm and guide their children down to transgender path Just so people understand your own story in 1990. I mean, I didn't even know this was a thing in 1990 What what happened to you specifically and briefly? Well, I was a four-year-old kid who today would be considered a transgender kid who was cross-dressing And I was affirmed as a young child and began to have that seed of and we didn't have the word dysphoria then but to be the idea that I should have been a girl went on until I had surgery at age 42 And lived eight years as a female until I began to study psychology and realized this is a psychologically disordered Then so if we spend the time to understand how they got there and sometimes it's a disorder of being affirmed and guided and supported in a cross-gender identity because This is where the dysphoria begins is in the affirmation process and how destructive is child abuse to affirm a child in a cross-gender identity So, um, I came out of this in 1990 and we've been helping people we've helped hundreds of people Now find their way back and that part of what's in the book And so but there are a lot of people who will say there you know, I've met some transgender folks over the last few years And they seem really happy. I've got to say I'm just I'm just trying to play devil's advocate They seem really happy and they're and they're and they're living, you know, their own truth and they're living their own experience and and You know, they're I mean, I really I mean I really like them a great people and I just have to have met them through friends or through work And you know, so they would say Well, I'm sorry you had a bad experience, but that's not our experience and we have a lot of friends who don't have that bad experience at all So what do you say to them? Yeah? Well, I say that I was one of those people that they interviewed who had a good experience during the eight-year period And so you know, the what what we know is it's a temporary reprieve at some point between Three and 20 years that experience may not happen now if it goes beyond that and what we found out is that people Most likely are not transgender, but they're actually suffering from auto-gainathuria And so the auto-gain of people who are auto-gainathiliacs Will continue to persist in this cross-gender identity because of What auto-gainathuria is is not really transgenderism. So being able to pull these things apart and begin to understand what auto-gainathuria is and what transgenderism is and what being a Drag Queen is or Transvestic fetish is really important and that's why the book Transly survivors will help people pull this stuff apart All right, we really appreciate your story paul higher founder of the website sex change regret Here on the laura ingram podcast And let's go to liz and pennsylvania liz go ahead. Oh, hi. I just wanted to say that You know, I do think that this is affecting my children. I have fourth and sixth grade daughters Yesterday my daughter at school was told by many other kids By leaving stickies on their death to make sure you wear a gay pride shirt tomorrow in support of their, you know agenda My daughter said that I don't support that because that's how she was raised and They kind of really gave her a hard time. They bully her. I bet they bullied her They definitely bullied her. They they said what is wrong with you? Why do you hate gays and my daughter is very strong Fourth grader and said I don't hate anybody. I just don't support this lifestyle and You know, they really came out of her and bullied her so I did call the school and thank god the school did do something about it I will give them that But it's being pushed so much in the town with picketing in the libraries with drag queens It's just pushed that all i'm asking is can can we stop pushing it on our children? No, they can't i'm raising my child not to think that way. I'm not Raising them to hate them just that we should be able to have our beliefs also No, that's not the The You know what you have to understand is no they will not allow you to have your beliefs. They will Try to run you out of town. They'll try to Demonize you. They'll try to run people off the air who disagree with the prevailing Wisdom They want to shut down debate because the debate takes them to an uncomfortable place actual debate where it's not imbued with all sorts of slogans that Sound nice with you know with colors that look nice Um a real debate about the science and the facts. It's very different, isn't it? I mean it's a different We you end up in a different place or you just say look I love all people I'm not judging anybody, but this is not what we believe So why why do they get to have their truth, but you don't get to have your truth That's my My question when I know the answer to is because they believe You and your daughter and all traditional americans are an existential threat to their continued advancement That's what they believe and they believe america's history in this traditional Christian heritage Is itself um deeply flawed and in fact in many ways evil. So that's what they believe um A stand hold Liz because I want to find out more about what's happening in in that particular school of a stand hold We're going to uh I talked you off air. Uh, let's go to trent in alabama Trent's a middle school teacher. Trent. Yes, ma'am. Thank you for having me And I just want to encourage you to keep doing what you're doing. We thank you for doing it. Thank you um I teach children. I've been doing it for about 23 years now. I have a daughter myself And it's just Deable and these kids are impressionable Uh, let a kid be a kid Let these parents be able to opt out of programs with before just Putting them in places and environments where they're going to hear things like this It's crazy. Well, again, they need the kids though. Don't they? They need the kids They without without indoctrinating children On a whole variety of issues whether it's abortion or any of these other issues Without that the the movement kind of dies out So they need the kids. They need to turn the kids into their own little community organizers activists Across the board on a whole host of issues and this is just one of the more I think Uh, potentially destructive issues, which is trying to get little children sexualized So they become sexual beings And I think a lot of this is geared toward lowering the age of consent for children too Uh in other words, if you can change your gender and say I'm changing my gender at age seven Why couldn't you say well? How who are you to say children can't have sexual intercourse? You see what I'm saying? Like if you can if you as a child can make a decision that would lead to perhaps permanently altering your existence as you know as someone who can reproduce or uh your body or If that's the case then why can't you do what you want with your body Including half sex There I mean, I'm not the first one to say this. This is this has been written about for many many years Uh, I appreciate the call. Hey everybody.

Ordinary jones what chance do we have? Well, this was a horrific horrific Situation in upper northwest washington close to where i used to live And also heartbreaking completely heartbreaking Megan clority and jack moor are award-winning wto p reporters Megan and jack host the new podcast called 22 hours an american nightmare And this particular Story of course from 2015 is one that uh, we in washington I think we we go through a lot and dc with politics and the news and the news business But this was particularly horrific A little boy was also involved and i happen to know a mom and his son was in his class and what the little children had to Be told about that child's death in its aftermath and both jack and megan join us now to tell us more Uh guys thanks so much for being on with us and i'm kind of reliving the days Around this horrible triple murder. Uh, tell us what the podcast is going to uncover Sure. Thanks for having us laura So just to kind of recap you heard a little bit in that introduction, but um, you know this As the prosecutor said when this case finally came to trial last fall. This is a case that nightmares are made of Um, it a wealthy dc businessman his wife his 10 year old son And the family's housekeeper were held hostage in their own home for 22 hours, which is where the title comes from Um, then brutally killed and the first inkling that we had of anything that had gone wrong And this house was when firefighters showed up because the house had been set on fire and the firefighters raced in there at the middle of the day You know, typically you think a day fire might not be all that concerning maybe a chimney fire or something And they make this horrifying discovery and that was the beginning of this case that captivated and horrified Um, not only the region but the country and then so what was also interesting about this case was as you mentioned It happened in may of 2015 on a seemingly completely normal day for the subopolis family in vira figuroa And it was three years until darren went who was convicted in the crime went to trial And so jack and i went to every day of that six week Trial and there was just so many details coming out that You know in the in the 24 hour news cycle that we're in anymore. We had trouble covering everything We wanted to cover let alone, you know, the big days where where people really are tuning in to see what happened So we just thought it was a crime, you know, not only just because of how horrible it was but because of how many questions we had and Just the defense. Oh, there were a lot of things to this that made it interesting and and worth retelling And we should also state that the housekeeper was also ended up losing her life Later on in the hospital. So this was You know, this is beyond comprehension. And again, it was just hundreds of yards from the vice president's Residents on massachusetts avenue in washington dc. So it's a very very expensive neighborhood right across from st albin school. Um, let's talk about his business The father's business mr. saveropolis i heard a lot of you know, and i don't know what's true and what's not but there was concern about His own, you know business dealings in the past and whether some of that might have come into play Yeah, we talked with a homicide investigators and they said of course when something like this happens you immediately look to any Possibility to find a lead but saver's avopilis. Um was the ceo of american iron works, which was a metalworks company And work, you know, essentially construction and worked in a lot of cash um, which actually ended up being a part of the the crime because He helped facilitate the ransom that was dropped off at his house and left in his $700,000 sports car in the garage. I mean as you said, this wasn't really um a normal family as far as the the socio-economic class there they're very wealthy but Yes, one of the first things that police looked to was does this have anything to do with his business dealings? Was there a deal that went bad and it turns out it did but not in the way Maybe you might suspect the the killer worked for saver's saveropolis as a welder 10 years earlier which to me kind of There was a lot of questions there too. I mean, why would you you know, why would you wait 10 years or hold a grudge for 10 years? It it didn't really all match up to me, but that's the connection as he used to work for mr. saverpless So he wanted a $40,000 ransom uh correct And and how did that you know how did that come into play and the prosecution said they were that went was trying to destroy the evidence by setting the house on fire uh and with the you know with the uh parents Sveropolis his wife and the little boy inside right and that's one of the kind of really haunting things about this case I mean there are many but the fact that while the family and vire figaro were being held Many of the victims were making calls to the outside world So that's how the $40,000 ransom was was arranged savers of opolis was calling People at his company calling his assistant and for the most part Um those calls were not raising any red flags now after the fact in hindsight Um people at the business thought well, you know what the request for that amount of money in cash was a little odd He'd never done that before but the amount really wasn't because he because he would frequently go to Um auctions to get this really kind of specialized Metalworking equipment and you know that would run, you know many thousands Yeah, but I got to say guys. I mean when when this case first Exploded in dc, you know so many of my friends and I again we lived right near there Um, we're saying wait a second Can you imagine if it's like one of us called like I need 40,000 I know it's a little it's you know, it also makes you us all think when something is strikes you as odd Don't just let it go. You know And it just I know it's like you can look back and behind site is 2020 But that was that that same thought came into the mind of that woman in main I think she was in main who saw mohammed aata or in boston. I can't remember it was main or boston Who saw mohammed aata's eyes? So he checked in for that that ill-fated flight on 9-11 And she's and and I think it was she I believe it was she who said This has haunted me ever since because I thought he looked like an evil like he was there were evil eyes And of course he's end end up being the mastermind of 9-11 But I'm just saying when something seems odd to you It's usually usually your inner sense and it's usually correct. Yeah, don't enjoy and don't ignore your gut instinct Um, what was really weird though was one of the people he called was his sister So we're not even talking about family or um business of colleagues. We're talking about family members He was able to I mean, I also think you have to remember Prosecutors said, you know, he's sabbas and any any misopoples are doing absolutely Everything they can to get out of there with their son alive save their son And who knows if the boy the boy was being tortured normal as possible Yeah to do that you're gonna do that and I think that's a huge, you know It's a huge part of the strategy huge part of the case. So will you be doing this on the podcast on Crimes not just obviously in the dc area, but crimes across the country No, it's just this crime and when we we um our local news reporters We've never done a podcast before and we put this together based on our reporting So it ended up being very fantastic Yeah, it ended up being all evidence based. Um a lot of it A lot of the evidence from the us attorney's office here in dc There's um, we're making an appeal to the dc superior court here to release audio tapes that they don't consider Um, uh public record, which we we have challenged that Um, there's there's a lot to the podcast and and as we go through it, you know, it really is jack and I Going through with the listener because we're we presented in chronological order So a lot of it as we are revealing, you know these details and how they fit we're questioning them with the listener Well, I have a feeling that beyond this horrific situation with these murders That This storytelling is going to be so compelling that you're going to do more of them. That's my sense Um because I people this is why people love podcasts is because they love listening to the story and there's nothing like the audio format for Getting people to focus and especially well produced Stories about america the good the bad and the ugly and and certainly the riveting And we appreciate both of you so much.
