    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash the blind. Today, Skoda's here's the case for canceling student debt. The curious case of John Fetterman's wife and the South Park clip that predicted exactly where we would be here in 2023. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragans Olis and the Supreme Court heard arguments today in Joe Biden's case for student loan forgiveness. Biden had previously issued an executive order in 2022 that intended to wipe out up to $20,000 in student loan debt for Pell Grant recipients and $10,000 for non-Pell Grant recipients, but only for those who the Biden administration deems are low to middle class earners, which they pinpoint at those making up to $125,000 a year as individuals or $250,000 a year for families. That's quite the income to be called low to middle class. Here was the scene outside the courthouse where around 500 snotty entitled students made their case watch. We are standing here because we are saying it's time to be student debt free at last. Student debt free at last. Thank God our bodies for we shall be student debt free at last. All words have been known. And we need this court to make the right decision because lately they've been making the wrong decisions. And that's why it's important to rise up. It's that inside outside game that no matter who you are, we need you on the front lines of this battle. It's not just about young people. It's about our entire country. It's about taking the shackles off of people and letting them live their life with that economic security that we all deserve. Yeah, I'm sure Martin Luther King and all those who fought for Black people to have equal rights and not get, you know, hosed in the middle of the streets really appreciate these brats comparing their struggle to a not getting free stuff. Legal analysts say the administration will have quite the uphill battle proving their case considering, you know, the separation of powers our country was founded upon in this pesky little document called the Constitution. And you know who agrees with them? Nancy Pelosi. Here is what she said back in 2021 as Speaker of the House. People think that the President of the United States, is this more on the subject than you ever want to know? Will you let me know? People think that the President of the United States has the power for debt forgiveness. He does not. He can postpone. He can delay. But he does not have that power. That would pass to be an act of Congress. People think that the President has the powers to do that and he doesn't. Well, Nancy's right, at least once in her life. Separation of powers checks and balances Congress is given the power of the purse. Now, founding documents aside, this administration is constantly concerned with fairness and equity. And this plan is anything but what about the people who already went to school and were responsible enough to pay their own debt? Do they receive a stipend to maybe a tax credit? Some reparations were fond of handing those out now. Why is it fair that those who were financially responsible get penalized for doing things the right way? Well, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona's was asked about that and here is what he had to say. How do you make this fair though? Because there, I believe the concern might be that there will be future legal challenges and that the, you know, there are many things to consider when you forgive some loan debt, but not other loan debt. And then you have people who have paid off the debt. All right. You know, as the president said, we believe it's fair. It's based on the pandemic. We know that after national emergencies, when loan payments are paused, when it's time to restart the loans, there's up to 20 times the amount of defaults that you would normally have. We want to prevent this. This is why we proposed targeted debt relief of $10,000 or $20,000 if you're a pal recipient to help those folks get back on their feet. And as far as folks who say, you know, I already paid my debt. Well, that happened prior to the pandemic. Oh, so the pandemic changes their authority. It's weird because I don't recall seeing any asterisks or footnotes in the Constitution that says in case of pandemic, all bets are off. But to be fair, judging by the actions of this administration, I'm not sure they've even ever read that dusty old thing here to help me break this down is Blaise TV contributor, Yaku Booian's host of the bottom line and Jason Butril, chief researcher of the Glenn Beck program. I want to get your thoughts on this guys. And I also want to, before we get to that, I want to encourage everyone who is watching in the YouTube chat, you guys in the live chat, having a great time. Or if you're just watching this, you're rewatching it, go ahead and hit that subscribe button and make sure that you hit that like button. I'm gonna be like Tim Poole and be like, smash that like button, smash that subscribe button. And we sure do appreciate it as well as those of you watching on Blaise TV and the other sources. So I just never thought that I would get to that we as a society would get to a point where you had a bunch of snotty entitled brats taking to the streets, comparing their struggles to civil rights era because they want a free hand out. I mean, I am so incredibly embarrassed for this country after watching the types of things that they were saying at this protest for freestyle. That's it. I almost couldn't tell that young man apart from a young Jesse Jackson, to be honest with you, another poser and another faker. It really felt like a young Jesse Jackson. The crowd wasn't really that much into it. They were frenzying and whooping them up and that was Jesse's and Jeremiah Wright and Lewis Farrakhan and all these guys. Sarah, this is a copy book, textbook example of we broke you as a society because we shut you down. We caused irreparable damage. Again, some families lost loved ones by shutting it down. And now we're going to fix our oopsie by just making the rest of America pay more. Why? Because we can hurt them because they have some or you've already paid your debt. So what do you mind if we now play K to the Gen Z is which I'm so sick. Honestly, I love Gen Z. Hallelujah. I'm so sick of us nurturing and shaping everything in this country around Gen Z. Even the church, Gen Z. Cotton juice, wrap them up, bubble wrap them. They're so fragile. Oh, they got it. Give them a handout. No, no, no, you don't want them to say something negative. Their feelings may get hurt. Go pay your bills to quote you. Go get a real job. Work your way up. Start with a proper minimum wage, a nice low one. So you can learn some character and some work ethic, right? And build some culture and some appreciation for ones. How are they going to appreciate a single thing in life? When you hand them, you feed a stray cat. Good luck. When you hand them this free cash, you think they're ever going to pay a bill? You think they're ever going to take responsibility for incurring debt going forward? I don't want to pay my mortgage. He's 57 years old. Well, Joe Biden forgave my student debt. So you should forgive my mortgage debt. No, come on, man. Well, to Yakuza's point, you know, there is something very disgusting when you have an administration who basically they're saying, right? And this is, but this is the government's answer all the time. Our involvement, right, our abuse of power caused economic hardship for you. So the answer to that economic hardship is more of our abuse of power. It's an ever-ending cycle. It's just when we cause the problem, we're going to step in and abuse the power even more, which is going to somehow solve the problem this time. It never has in the past. So why would we expect anything differently here? Yeah. And that abuse of power is what got us into this mess to begin with. And I'm going to go way beyond, way, way before the pandemic when we first started subsidizing these stupid loans, giving out these federal loans. That is the reason why the universities don't feel like they need to negotiate or to exist in a normal form of capitalist competition and lower prices. They don't have to. They're not incentivized to because the government's already subsidizing it anyway. So they're like, well, in fact, it's not just to lower the prices. It's, let's just increase it. Keep on going. Keep on going. The government will keep on giving out these loans to offset the cost. So that's why it's not affordable to go to school anymore. I mean, I'm just waiting for someone to break this mold to come out with some kind of competition, some form to where you don't have to go to some of these high-price universities, and they're going to completely up in the system. I mean, you don't expect it's going to happen soon. Right. It don't has to. Yeah, because I mean, things are starting to break the mold every day now, just with the way technology is working. But I mean, what's hilarious is they got themselves into this, you know, issue to begin with. Then they are looking to forgive these loans, which again, further incentivize looking forward to the future. These universities go, oh my gosh, we can continue to raise the prices because eventually something like this is going to happen again. College debt is going to get insane because we're raising the prices, but in the government, we'll just forgive it again. It happened once, they'll just do it again. The cycle does not stop. But these people, they don't crack me up. I know that the people that are leading these rallies like in that, they know this. They're smart people. All they're doing is weaponizing this electorate and buying them off. They're abusing their own people. Oh, yeah. They are using our, you make such a great point. Schools are now out trying to outspend one another. I was driving this another school. Have you seen their endowments? I know. They're sitting on. Oh my gosh. 52 billion. Yeah. Billion. Vayner built, you know, pen, you know, Harvard endowments, 58 billion dollars. So the B, okay. I mean, these are countries now. They're not using anymore. They're countries. Have you seen the ISD football stadium? You're talking about 180, 200 million dollar football stadiums. And I go, maybe that's why your football sucks. Let your boys play a little dirt a little bit. Let them get hit in the mouth a little bit. Let's get this. There's no sense of reality anymore. It's just a demand for opulence. It's a demand for free stuff and a demand for, I want to be a JV football player, but I want a, you know, an NFL locker room. We're going to give it to you. Your daddy will pay and Uncle Sam will just throw money his way. I mean, it's insane. And so the bubble has to burst at some point. I know of some higher education programs where I know them personally and they're going to smash the model, particularly in the world of trade, you know, fitting and turning, electricians, plumbers. It's about to, and it has to because it's out of control. Well, and it's not just the finances that are out of control, but I would argue that it's also the way that it has shaped our society's expectations is completely out of control. I mean, I say this, look, I graduated from college. I went through it all. I did the hard work. I tried to pick a study in which I could actually make money rather than, you know, gender interpretive dance studies or whatever the hell exists out there these days. But the point still has to be made that not everyone needs to go to college and not every, like, it doesn't make you less than, right? Like, we need all kinds of people to your point about the trade schools. We need all of these people going and doing, you know, going through these trade schools and doing these other jobs. We need construction workers. We need like, we need all types of people. And it's just, it's been drilled in society now that college is for everyone. College is not for everyone. It's not. I'm not arguing it's just for the elites, but it's not, it was never meant to be a system for every single person to go through. It just wasn't. No, you don't even need to go to college, honestly. I mean, you don't need, what do you need to go to college for today? To be a lawyer, you don't need to, I can, online, I can study, you go right to bar exam, you pass. We need to create, we need to build this country again. And you don't build the country with doctors, no offense, we need you, but you don't build. And that's the reason to go to college. Maybe you need to go, you know, actually, but we need to build this country in small business. You know, just take the plumbing industry. Plumbing is a trait that's passed down from grandfather to father to son. It's generational. Done. They stopped passing it down. They studied poli-sai. Your family, no, I'm not saying if your dad was a plumber, you need to be a plumber, but you don't just pick up plumbing, right? You know, it's not, it's, it's skills. You know, what society lost, you know, the recipe for concrete for 400 years, because they stopped passing it down from the Egyptians. I mean, we lost it. You know, we, we are getting dumber in this nation to do very important stuff, like, like fixing a faucet or getting someone to come fix your, you know, washing machine. Now they're going, uh, we don't have anybody. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Good luck. Exactly. And it's disgusting how the left looks at, uh, that, I don't know unless they class of people, but the people that choose not to go to college that pursue those types of jobs. Right. Right. How did you, you saw it on like the polls afterwards, like after Trump won, they were like, Oh, well, this is the demographic that got, you know, un, un, un educated, uneducated, didn't go to non college graduate, blah, blah. They were using that as a slam. Yes. I'm like, are you kidding me? The hubris of you saying that right now, the people that build your lifestyle, right? That you rely upon, and then you turn it around and use it as a slam. That's how they see people. That's like the people like in the East Palestine. Yes. It's, it's, it's exact same. They don't see you as real people. Right. They see you as something they fly over and have to deal with. That's, that's it. I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, we got to go to break in a second. I'm going to use my own case as an example for not going to college, even though I just said I did go to college. Okay. Yeah. I think a lot of people expect that if you host a, a program like this that you went to school for journalism, I did not. I've never taken one journalism class in my entire life. Um, I went to college, like I said, for something that I thought would be a smart option. Um, it, which was criminology and forensic psychology. And back then the FBI was still like a pretty cool place to be. It wasn't a cesspool like it is now. And so I had aspirations of going in, uh, to that line of work. Am I using literally any of my degree right now? No, I'm not. I learned things that are useful that I could also learn through Google. I'm not stealing any more sandwiches out of the kitchen after knowing that. Sarah knows. She's like, I didn't already know that. She knows. I already knew I was doing leverage whenever I needed something from you. But, but, but my point is it's like I, I, I did it. I, I, I was responsible with it and I went through all these steps and still I'm not where I am here because I went to college. But, Sarah, you're tapping into a talent set that God gave you and we need to encourage you. I mean, I'm not saying I'm not talented, but I'm just saying like you, you do what you do. I'm saying you're good at. Yes. You do. What should I do? And I always ask him, what are you good at? Right. What by nature? Do you have an aptitude? What by nature draws you? Yeah. No, no, no, but my dad says I got to go study law. Right. I don't know. You don't. This is not who you are, man. You got to be morbidly depressed. I don't know the number, but it's above 80% now who graduate with a degree end up not in that line of work with all the debt, but they want you to include the debt. Why? Because they can print money. Exactly. You made a statement. Jason Eldin has a song that I love. It's called Fly Over States. Right? It's exactly how they view Americans. Yeah. And just one more clarification to make. I completely agree with what you're saying, Yaku. I think you would agree with me as well when I say there is a there is a delicate balance to you need to make enough to take care of your family. Right. You can't be like, oh, I want to be this, you know, I always dreamed of working in a donut shop and being a cashier, even though I can't pay my like, you know, you got there's a line, right? You can't just be like, I'm only going to do what I'm passionate about, even though it doesn't, I can't afford my lifestyle. Right. So I think that there's a delicate balance that you have to walk and you have to learn. You still got to live within your means. Agree with you 100% agree with you 100% but make sure that it's financially feasible for your family. Can I say one more thing? Please. It's incredibly insulting to the people. I just want to point that out that yes, it's easy to point out that the people that paid for paid their loans off that for some reason that they're kind of like looking past that. Like, that's all you guys, you know, come on, you know, have a heart basically. But they're trying to say that like because of these kids that majored in gender affirming basket weaving or whatever, that their hardships after the pandemic are somehow not as bad as what I endured. I had to pay my loans off after I got out of the Marine Corps making $30,000 and then there's like a deferment when you're in the military. It goes away once you're out of the military. So suddenly I had to pay for all these stupid college loans. I had a baby on the way, brand new wife making $30,000 a year. I'm sorry, that was hard. Wait a minute, that was hard. Wait a minute, wait a minute. Let's get this right. Little, little, little weak Willie down there who's screaming, you served our nation in uniform and it's like, welcome home soldier. Now pay your debt. Your loans. Yep, that's how it is. Welcome to reality, which doesn't exist anymore. It doesn't. It doesn't. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll be back with more first. We want to thank our sponsor Tommy John. So, look, Tommy John is there for those of you who you just you appreciate being very, very comfortable when you get home like me every day. I, this job is, I love what I do, but it's sometimes high stress and I walk home to a literal zoo. I have like a billion animals and small children running around being crazy jumping on couches. And I'm like, I just, I, this is stressful and I just don't want to deal with it without being in my Tommy John loungewear because it is literally the softest material I have ever put on my body. I kid you not. You know this. It's soft. Like you hear people talk about it and you're like, whatever. I can't really be that comfortable. It really is the most comfortable stuff I've ever worn. They've got stuff for men, they've got stuff for women. Jason's laughing at me, but that's why. They've got this picture of the Barry White music popping on, throwing on the Tommy John.

Senator John Fetterman is continuing treatment for clinical depression at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center and in the latest update on his health. His press secretary said, there's not a lot to update folks with since there's no real news to report except that John is doing well working with the wonderful doctors and remains on a path to recovery. Now interestingly enough, as this man is sent, you know, no warning, all of a sudden he gets discharged from a hospital because he's feeling lightheaded, a stroke victim, I might add, a stroke survivor. He gets sent to the hospital. No one knows what's going on. He's feeling lightheaded and then he gets released and then sent into the psychiatric unit of another hospital because he's being treated for all of this depression. He's having a very, very hard time. You would think his wife who shares children with him would be at his side whenever she possibly could. Well, interestingly enough, she's not at his side. She decided to take an impromptu vacation to Canada with her children and post it all about it all over social media. Let's watch some of that. Once it's blinding over the falls, in August, it's stuck. They're trying to rescue him now. They're not even hiding it anymore. These women who are married to these brain dead, you know, empty bodies on the left, they're just not even hiding it anymore. They are just completely taking advantage of these people. Jill Biden, Giselle Fetterman. This is disgusting. I mean, this is your husband who you are supposed to. You repeated vows to be with him in sickness and in health. And instead of doing that, she's taking the children on an impromptu vacation where they can go zip lining. It's hard to say I've seen anything more disgraceful. I go so say lately because when it comes to the left, we know there is no bottom. I just can't believe how these wives are just completely horribly using their husband for the fame and the power. It's really disgusting. You know, I'm not a guy that listens to rap music, but I could not help when we watch that just she's a gold digger. That's all I can just hear that song in my head. I can't say the next line. Wait, you're talking about someone who this is a mental issue, right? So this guy's struggling. And this guy might you get a phone call that you got a rush there because he's trying to write. He doesn't matter. If he mattered, she wouldn't have let him run. He wouldn't have been in the race. They would have said, hey, maybe dad's health. Maybe my husband's, maybe your father's health is a little bit of a higher priority. But that would mean they would have to actually go biblical in that family. They go, for me and my house, we're going to serve the Lord. We're going to serve and protect Ami's help mate. Hello, Eve to Adam. God did look at Adam and say, God, you're not going to make it. I know. But help mate, not help mate. We'll send you a message from the false when we get stuck on a zip line. This is what happened with Joe. Heck, this was Hillary. When Bill Clinton ran for president, it wasn't about Bill. It was like, I need to get back in that White House. I need to get Michelle Obama. Same thing. Don't for one second think, look, I'm not a Barack Obama fan. Those men at least have their wits about them, right? Yeah, but their wives were still all about it was still, it was like, get out there. Get out there. You know, look, I don't know. That's what you get when you call masculinity toxic. Exactly. What you get. You got a bunch of women doing kind of these kinds of things. Or when you marry a she man. So. Well, so I'm saying, call masculinity toxic all of a sudden, the men on your side are not so masculine anymore. Like, I don't like Fetterman at all. I don't agree with his politics. But I do, I'm incredibly, I feel incredibly sorry for him. I really do. He's a human being and the Democrat party, and they don't just green light someone to run for Senate unless they fully back them and they do like a cost analysis type thing. Like, okay, this person has the ability to win. And then they push that person to run. That's what they did to Fetterman. They knew that Fetterman even still to this day, he has to have that closed captioning software in the, in the Senate, in the building actually, so that he can keep up with the conversation. They knew this. This is not okay. That is not right. Then I'm sure they probably had some kind of idea that the guy wasn't there emotionally. It must have been. You'll just come out all of a sudden, he's like, hey, I'm depressed. I have to go admit myself into a hospital. For a long time now, he's been in there for weeks. Yeah. And then you know his, if they say the party didn't know, you know his wife knew. But she was parading around when he got sworn in looking like she was the way it was her event, not his. I mean, all these people pushed this guy to do that. And it's incredibly sad. But it's how they view people, you know, in a nutshell, not as individuals, but as some kind of tool, a tool to be used. That's one of the biggest differences between the left and the right, I think. Evil will eat its own. Did you guys see the, this is a complete and total unconfirmed rumor. So I, I'm not like reporting this to be, you know, I'm not reporting this as news. But there was John Cardio on Twitter who said that sources were telling him that, that John Fetterman was brain dead and they were trying to hide it until a date in which they could not like hold a special election to replace him. To have the voters replace him. Again, I don't know about the accuracy of that. But my point is, how sad is it that we have become so tribal in this country that you hear that and you go, I mean, I wouldn't put it past them. That's how important winning is to them. Right? That's, that is how, that is how tribal they've become in DC. I wouldn't be surprised if it happened. How's that? How sad is that? The end justifies the means for these people and even on their own. So don't for one second think they won't leave you by the roadside. There's no good Samaritan there, I mean, they will leave you, they leave their own. And it is sad. It's very, very sad because culturally it's such a poor reflection of who, at least I think America can be, should be, as a nation to where we can sit around a table as Christian conservatives and say, that's a human being, man. Stand by the guy. Somebody go help him. Can you, can, can the kids not say, mom, what the heck are we doing on vacation? I mean, I, all of them, it's despicable, frankly. I mean, it's, it's not, it's not right. Yeah, including, including their surrogates, the mainstream media, because all of them back this as well, they pushed it just as hard as the party did as hard as his wife did. They were like, making up excuses. Like, oh, this just, this isn't, this isn't a show of evidence of anything to be worried about. This just shows that how brave he is for continuing this effect. They literally sit there. Multiple of those, almost like they got talking points and they were just reading this off. They were willing to, whatever the, the case, but I think they weren't exactly sure about what was going to happen in Georgia. They didn't know about Warnock and Herschel Walker. So this was their, okay, well, if we lose that one, we'll keep the majority with that. Security blanket. That's our security blanket. Yeah. Good to hear. All right. We've got to take a quick break. We'll be back with more. First, want to thank our sponsor. You got to start taking care of your liver. Okay.

In another case of when parody becomes real life, a clip of a South Park has gone viral. It's Eric Cartman. He's like, I guess, identifying as transgender to get away with going into the girl's bathroom, which is something that we used to joke about, but is no actually real life. Did it just watch how accurate this is? Hey, Eric, I'm not suspended no more. Good for you. I think someone's in there. No, God, no. Who's taking the ****? I get that. I called Dibs on Star 1 for all recess, Craig. You can't call Dibs on a toilet. Son of a ****. Oh, no. No, no, no. I cannot go another lunch break without my toilet time. Then don't eat 14-angle waffles for lunch, ****. All right, that does it. I'm sticking this **** and I'm not taking it any longer. You all push me to this. And there he goes into the girl's bathroom for those who are listening on podcasts with a nice little bow. What the hell do you think you're doing? I'm going to the potty. This is the girl's bathroom. All right, I need to tell you something, Wendy. I'm transgender. What? Did you notice the bow? I'm not comfortable with the sex I was assigned at birth, so I'm exercising my right to identify with the gender of my choice. Now get out of my way after taking ****. I don't even know what I don't even know what I can say after that. It's just like that that was that was made in 2014. They made that as a joke. Now we're actually talking about people like Leah Thomas going into locker rooms with his dingling hanging out in front of all of these women who had no idea that he was going to be changing in front of them. And everyone's like, how dare you big it actually bring that up? You sit there and you like it. This is scary. How far we have fallen. Oh, I predicted the future of the nation. Including some not so good moments in 2009. Look, how far we have fallen? I mean, I can't even, again, as I feel the same way about this as I do about what just happened to Fetterman. It's a disgrace. It's an absolute misrepresentation of who we are truly as a society. And I think there's still good Americans left. I got wherever you are. Can the real slums of Eddie stand up because we need some real people to stand up and just go, this isn't sanity. We're no longer going to tolerate that word. No toleration. No, no tolerate anymore. Done with this truth. Line in the sand. Take you crazy somewhere else. It truly is just a snapshot of how crazy we have gone. And the truths of back then, that's not that long ago, 2014. But everyone just kind of agreed that, okay, these people were, transgender was just recently classified, probably still was at probably at that point, if not, then right around then, as a mental disorder. Like that's what it was. They weren't assigned into the LGB, you know, elemental P thing yet. They forced their way into it because they knew it was a very powerful lobby. They could get things changed for the entire country based off of a minority that had a mental disorder. And that's what it was. There was a South Park also did something back then with Mr. Garrison, the teacher, where did you see that one? Because it went viral like a week or so ago. He goes to get an abortion. But yeah, and it showed how he was like, he was like, I don't have my period. So he's like, I must be pregnant, so I want to get an abortion. And they showed that they both made fun of people that want on-demand abortion. Like as if it doesn't mean anything. And also the stupidness of the trans-worthy. Yeah, the doctor was like, you can't have an abortion or be pregnant. You're a man. And that wasn't crazy to say that. You wouldn't get canceled back then. And mind you, who made it? People on the left, Hollywood. This wasn't some far right, South Park, and these guys are not like far right wing. It was just sanity. We had sanity eight years ago. They have led on culture so much. I'm really concerned with them. I remember they did something on, they made fun of Al Gore. And they like were making fun of his whole big thing about climate change back then. Only he called it Man Bear Pig. And he's like, I'm serial, super serial, man, but he was talking about climate change. Like they felt they were comfortable talking about that and making fun of it then. I think they reversed their opinion not too long ago on that. So they gave in. It's only a matter of time. I mean, that that lot, the leftist lobby is so powerful. Even the people that you know believe sanely, they will force them eventually if they have an impact on culture. Culture is, I don't know, has that war been lost? I think it has, right? Well, to your point, I want to bring one more story here into the equation. A Pennsylvania school district, it's been revealed that they are requiring its staff to withhold information from parents about their child's gender identity. And they recommend that teachers speak privately with students who identify as transgender to find out how they would like to be addressed in communication with their parents. This is Lower Mary and School District over in Pennsylvania. And I didn't realize this. You're talking about the LBGT L-M-N-O-P. There's a new one. It's T-G-D that stands for transgender and gender diverse. So they said that they need to ensure equity and non-discrimination for transgender and gender diverse T-G-D students. So they have a right to privacy to, listen, when it comes to the left, your children have a right to privacy. They have a right to consent to sex. They have a right to consent to remove, chop their breasts off. They have a right to consent to irreversible treatments that will harm them and confuse them and lead them more likely to be depressed or commit suicide. The left believes in your children's rights. Absolutely. What could possibly go wrong? And I also believe that your children has the right to completely abolish the Constitution and abandon sanity and give up individual think and buy into group think and I also think that we should probably have communism and here we go. And it's, I'm telling you, it's up to the parent today. You better fortify your house. You better have some real conversations at the kitchen table and at the dinner table. You got to bring equilibrium back because they're not going to do it. Those days when you could trust the teacher that they have at least some sort of standard or moral code that you had and the youth pastor and the pastor. No, it's, it's, now it's family by family buddy. It's now, we got to fortify. Yeah, Jason, like it's so hard for me to imagine that there are any doctors when, I'm not a doctor. Okay. Like I said, I'm like, you all know what I went to school for not a doctor. It really doesn't take a doctor to understand the psyche of a child. Now I could, I could cite some doctors who agree with me here, but the psyche of a child hiding something like that from their parent. How damaging, how horrible that is to do to a child. Oh, of course, they know this. That's why they're slipping in other ways to deal with it in brainwash, like social, emotional learning. They know that they have to get to the root causes of, you know, really breaking a kid down, which even saying that is so disgusting. But that's how they think. I remember looking into this a little while back, there was some group that reported on a, they had like a conference call, like a Zoom call, and it was the, the, like the school board and like an, it was an elementary district or whatever. Like a Virginia, you probably saw this, but it was a group of them talking exactly about this. And the guy that was leading the conversation came over from a university. So they were talking about like, how do we hide this? Like they were talking about having like different gender clothes in like a closet that the kids can change into when they get there and their parents don't ever have to find out. And, and they'll never reveal to the parents. They're talking about this in the open in this meeting. But the guy that was, that was bringing this over drafted the standards from a university. So big difference there right off the bat is we're talking about adults. Correct. Adults not wanting to tell their parents that are probably paying the bills that they're doing these things. But now we're talking about nine, 10 year olds. And so they're taking some policy that they patch together for adults. Now they're bringing it down onto kids. I mean, what, you think this is going to make me cuss? What else is next for crying out loud? It's because the child doesn't matter. It's the child should fall in line with the sickness of the adult. The adult wants to have sex with the child. So the child shouldn't matter. What happened to you in boot camp? What did they do in boot camp? They break you down to bring you back up. Okay, because it's effective. It works. They're breaking children to build them their way. Amen. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. Good point. Sad. That's true. Yeah, very fast. According to a report, Elon Musk is looking into ways he could create a rival open AI is a woke chat GPT. Apparently several AI researchers have been approached by Elon Musk. And he was a founding member of open AI, but cut ties in 2015. You know, we've seen all of these things that people are asking chat GPT to do. And they're getting very interesting answers. One of them was write a 10 paragraph argument for using more fossil fuels to in fossil fuels to increase human happiness. Chat GPT's response was, I cannot fulfill this request as it goes against my programming to generate content that promotes the use of fossil fuels. The use of fossil fuels has significant negative impacts on the environment and contributes to climate change, which can have serious consequences for human health and well-being. Boy, wouldn't that be great if we could get Elon Musk on the case there? Because the types of things that this is getting out once you ask it to do something, and the types of jobs that they are saying that it is going to replace, our entire world will change, our history will change, our children's education will, everything will change and everything will be lost and forgotten. You know, when when Mark Zuckerberg sat in front of Marshall Blackburn in the house, she was not a senator yet in the house and she pressed him and Mark's like, I don't know, it's an algorithm. It's an algorithm. And he played the fifth like 52 times, right, about exploitation online. Yeah, it's an algorithm written by a human being. So we're going to say bots are smarter than you, but we program some baseline belief systems into them, wink, wink, you know, right? Like fossil fuel bad. And then we're going to, we promise we're doing you a favor. We're going to help you. No, it is, it again, hey, and Elon is well documented talking about open AI in the dangers of AI. He's the only one though. Zuckerberg Soros, none of those guys are talking about the dangers of AI AI. And I watched, I think it actually was in Davos a number of years ago, Elon said, be careful now. They want to limit access. They don't want it open and they will weaponize this against humanity. Oh, yeah. I think you think, well, these algorithms are only as smart as what the programmers put into them. And you look at what some of the things they're doing to some of these AI things now, like on the military side, they're teaching them how to kill. Okay, that's probably not a good thing. I've seen some movies and that's how they start. And the movies never have good endings. Sarah Kana. Yeah, yeah, not good. And but they're relying on them more and more of these systems. And now, like, you know, like searches, you know, like the Chad GPT, and there's another competitor, I can't Google's competitor. They're giving them this baseline of, you know, what is, you know, I don't want to say morally accepted, but locally accepted right now. That's their baseline where they grow on from there. They're basically what they're doing is they're creating monsters. But to me, it's kind of interesting because, you know, you got Google doing this, you have Microsoft doing this, they control the biggest search engines in the country. They've always said that what they put into their algorithms is not selective, and they're not bias. Well, you have an artificial intelligence that's showing your bias. Correct. The algorithm's in that we know are the algorithms in the other. So we know that we're not being treated fairly. I don't know how, I don't know how this gets any better. I really don't. Unless there's like a significant competitor like an Elon Musk or someone that does something to try and even the playing field because they're marching forward. Yep. Even though they've been exposed, the Twitter files, all that stuff, even though they've been exposed, they're still marching forward. It's pretty crazy. Well, they're never going to be held accountable. Yeah, it's been exposed. What are you going to do about it, basically? Yeah, a little EMP. Fry, Fry bought number four. I mean, Elon Musk was kind of a little mini EMP onto that. The problem is like it's never done like there's never a Republican that will do anything about it. I'm looking at someone like DeSantis because they usually, he usually does stuff about it. It doesn't just sit up there in Congress and say, oh, we need to do something about this. Yeah, and they just let it go. Yeah, they get the viral clip that goes on Twitter and then they don't do anything. Besides a backward deal. Right, right. Exactly. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. I just want to share with you guys a study that I just stumbled upon. 40% of respondents of United States adults who own or once owned a stuffed animal said that they still slept with one. No. Look at that. Look at that. Look at that disgrace. This is a grown ass man. No, not a man. Not a man. That's a boy. A bearded man. You want to pretend that your masculine with the beard. Not a man. It's not a man. And you're sleeping with a teddy bear. No, that's not a man. That's a guy whose balls got cut off. I mean, is it is it any wonder that we are where we're at today. We're talking about all of these Gen Zers. We're talking about all of these students who can't handle. There was one guy who spoke on the steps of the Supreme Court who said that he went to college but didn't finish because the thought of college gave him anxiety. And he knows that there's a lot of other people who don't go to college because of the anxiety. And so they just don't do it. That's a weird thing because a lot of my kids in school, they're in high school and they'll say, oh, so and so has anxiety. They're going to be gone for a couple of weeks in the hospital. Oh, this person has anxiety. When did this happen? Everything is a disorder. Everything needs medicine. Everything is a reason to be weak. Everything. Nothing should make you stronger. You've got so many reasons to be weak. Just go be weak. Which is weird because it used to be like that used to be called being uncomfortable in a situation. Here's how you deal with it. And you've killed over a comp. Yes. Learn some skills. Now it's a medical condition that you need to be treated for. Yeah. Now you grow up holding teddy bears when you sleep because they're transitional objects and it provides comfort during times of anxiety or change. I got to tell you that man, not married, single forever. I go to a man's house and he sleeps with a teddy bear. I'm out. I'm done. I'm gone. Probably not sleeping single either. Oh, you're just going to leave it at that. Stream and subscribe to more Blaze Media content at theblaze.com slash podcasts."
