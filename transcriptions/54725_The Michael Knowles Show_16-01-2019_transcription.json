    "text": " misgendering white privilege and transphobia to quote Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez today we run train on the progressive agenda then what should be done about Steve King we analyze congressional Democrat hypocrisy finally the left is furious that Karen Pence is starting to work at a Christian school heaven for a friend I'm Michael Knowles and this is the Michael Knowles show all right before we run train on today's program we got a run train on some new sponsors I want to thank a wonderful new sponsor spear spear is this terrific product I've now just started using it because I didn't know it existed you have got to try it too most people hate writing especially me it took me the 27 years to not write a book though it did become a bestseller most people hate writing because word processors are not designed to help you organize your thoughts they're word processors but they're not thought processors if you've ever had writers block if you ever stared at that blank screen if you want to write podcasts or blogs or diary entries or books or whatever you want to do spear is a thought processor that helps you organize your ideas as you write you can write your thoughts in any order you want you can move your thoughts around you can make changes without the fear of losing your original idea you will be able to articulate your ideas faster and easier because it's the most flexible tool for writing and thinking most people are not in the know they just use a word processor this is so much better the possibilities are infinite it is like working with Legos this week my listeners can get spear for just $3.75 per month for the first year of service that's a 25% discount off the regular price sign up today by going to spear SPE a R E you know like the writer Shakespeare spear dot com slash no else can I W L E S that is spear with me like Shakespeare speaking of people who are not great with their words speaking of people who could probably use a thought processor herself Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez our gaff prone Congresswoman from upstate New York she's really done it again this was probably the funniest one she's done yet she was doing an interview with a newspaper and she said quote I'm six days into the term and you already used all your ammo she's referring to the right wing so enjoy being exhausted for the next two years while we run train on the progressive agenda so for those of you who don't know what running train means running train is when a man and a man and a man and a man and another man and like 10 or 20 other men and a woman don't love each other very much but they all get together and they do that thing that men and women do when they do love each other that is running train it's a very graphic sexual act and and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez apparently thought oh running train means succeed in implementing I don't know does that what she thought it meant you can check out urban dictionary if you don't believe me although I do warn you about putting that phrase into your Google searches you will get some results that probably you don't want to say this is just a lovely gaff it doesn't have much to do with her policy proposals it's not a major news story the reason though that I really like this one is it this is what happens when a nice girl from the suburbs all of a sudden at the age of 28 decides to pretend that she's Jenny from the block this is what happens is you have this girl who grew up in this lovely little place where the the doughs are jumping and the little rabbits are there you know and it's so so lovely you go to the community festivals whatever and she's pretending now that she's from the Bronx that she's from the south Bronx the mean streets of the boroughs and she's not and so she's trying to use slang terms you know vulgar expressions as though she grew up in those areas and she didn't and she doesn't know what they mean and it's really funny this this is an authenticity authenticity issue for her she has a lot of things going for her in the media she's likable she's bubbly she's relatively attractive she is young so she's got all those things going for this authenticity thing though is an issue because pretty soon you're gonna see her like misquoting big e-smalls or something it doesn't she has all of the trappings of of of people who are from really privileged areas she's a socialist she's kind of ditzy she has a very expensive education even though it didn't teach her very much and she she is pretending to use urban language or vulgar language in a way that that doesn't quite work Donald Trump you know knock him if you will the guy really did grow up in Queens and he really talks like he grew up in Queens and I bet he knows what that phrase means moving on to a more important story but equally frivolous on CNN a CNN analyst Areva Martin went on a radio show with conservative radio host David Webb whereupon she accused David Webb of white privilege there's only one problem David Webb is a black guy here's the exchange I never considered my color the issue I considered my qualifications the issue well David you know that that's a whole another long conversation about white privilege and things that you have the privilege of doing that people of color don't have the privilege of how do I have the privilege of white privilege David by virtue of being a white male you have white privilege hold on conversation I don't have time to be a river I hate to break it to you but you should have been better prepped I'm black okay then I said you went to white privilege this is the falsehood in this do you hear what she started to say is Areva I hate to break it to you I'm black and then there's that moment of silence she says well okay I can either apologize for just being a race hustling ignorant cynical politician or I stand by mine then he starts to cut her off there this is obviously hilarious one of the best media moments of the year in a year full of them already but this is the problem with the left right now is I identify this in left-wing rhetoric when you're debating a leftist when they go on television when they're in the halls of Congress or wherever they use so many logical fallacies and specifically they use these ad hominem fallacies they can't argue with the points that you're making so they just start attacking the person who's making them and I've just identified a few of these you got to look out for it because whenever the left throws one of these at you you know that you've won the argument the first one you saw it right here is privilege privilege I mean the way this woman did it from CNN she went in she felt I don't need to look up who this guy is I don't need to look up what this guy thinks all I'm gonna do I'm assuming he's a conservative I'm gonna assume he's a white guy and I'm gonna assume that he has all of this privilege and she didn't take a second to even second guess this notion and then he tells her I'm a black guy I you you've done no homework you know nothing about me but imagine if that host were a white guy what could he have said it would have convinced half the country at least if he'd been a white guy and she'd say ah but you have white privilege and even though she can't explain how that manifests it still would be convincing this privilege thing is obviously an ad hominem attack and it means that arguments are not as important as the argue were that you should judge a person's argument based on the color of his skin or who he is or where he is rather than the quality and content of his arguments the thing that's funny about privilege though is that no privilege disqualifies anyone from conversation what privilege would disqualify anyone from debate in fact privilege should over qualify you for debate shouldn't it if I I've had the privilege of maybe a few extra brain cells than the average Joe on the street maybe if I'm lucky I've had the privilege of a good education from kindergarten all the way through college those are privileges which have actually prepared me better to think about certain things and to discuss certain ideas that's a privilege of education that's a good thing that's not a disqualification from debate the left as we talk about a lot gets reality backwards so what is a privilege a privilege is a special advantage for one person or one group that's a privilege it's an advantage what the left has turned privilege into is a disadvantage they're saying that if you are privileged you are now to disadvantage you can't give your opinion your opinion is invalid at your your political work is invalid and your vision is invalid it's it's it's as the left always does it's perverting the thing into the opposite of the thing the advantage into the disadvantage and by the way everybody has different privileges I'm not suggesting that nobody has privilege I'm not suggesting that everybody has privilege if that were true there'd be no such thing as privilege but some people have different privileges some people are more athletically gifted I'm not an Adonis of a man they have more of a natural privilege in that regard than I do some people are more mathematically gifted they have a privilege in that way some people are financially gifted they're born into money I met a lot of people in my life who were born into money I was not but many people are that's a privilege that's an advantage I'm not going to demonize that I'm not going to vilify that if you're born into money good for you I'm I'm hope that helps your life and you get a good education and you you have you can enjoy all the pleasures in the world some people have other privileges there is a privilege to not being born into money and the privilege of that is you learn a little bit how the world really works you you can see more how most people are living you can go through a little bit of suffering maybe that suffering helps to form your character makes you stronger makes you more courageous maybe it makes you more daring or more ambitious I've seen plenty of people born into wealth who become waste rules and I've seen plenty of people who had nothing growing up really make something of themselves succeed at the highest level privilege is really hard to quantify in some hierarchy of victimhood which is exactly what the left wants to do we all to varying degrees can have a privilege of reason some people are unreasonable and some people have a very low privilege of reason but but if one has the privilege of reason then you shouldn't say you have privilege so you're not allowed to speak you should say you have that wonderful privilege of reason please use it please enlighten me and and describe the world as you see it the next one which is very closely related is man-splaining this is also obviously an ad hominem attack this is also an attack that says that the argue were is more important than the argument what what man-splaining does the funniest thing about that stupid word is it's like man-spreading man-spreading is when men sit but instead if they're sitting these are their two legs instead of sitting with their legs crossed over one another really tight they're sitting so that their legs are a little bit apart the reason they do this in case you didn't take high school biology class is that they're making way for certain anatomical privileges that that only men have and women do not have so there's a reason for this it's a commonplace occurrence half of the population does it the same thing with man-splaining man-splaining is when a man explains something now we all explain things to each other the reason we do it is because we're human beings with the faculties of speech so we use speech and speech is politics speech is civilization we speak to one another we don't grunt like the brutes most of the time so we just talk and we persuade each other and we try to get each other to come around to our points of view and we learn and we instruct and we're curious and we ask questions so that's just men explaining what the term man-splaining does is it portrays as bizarre or strange when half of the population does the most basic human thing that's supposed to be really weird and strange so you're talking to a girl who's not girl understanding to use Andrew Cleven's term and she says you're man-splaining you say damn right I'm man-splaining what else can I do I can't woman-splain I don't identify as a woman I'm sorry about that the way that they use this of course on the left is that it's a way of shutting up half of the population all it means these phrases check your privilege these phrases man-splaining it just means shut up and the reason that they go after men is men are more likely to be conservative obviously there are a lot of conservative women there are a lot of very sad left-wing men but generally men trend more conservative certainly in America so they use it to shut up half the population the other one they use is the phrases safety and comfort and safe space and that sort of thing this is a little bit different but it's playing on the same idea it still means shut up it's still a logical fallacy or a discursive fallacy but what it does is when they say your ideas are making me feel unsafe the things you're saying are making me feel threatened they're making me I'm not in a place of comfort anymore I hear this all the time when I go around to colleges we speak at these colleges we'll get protested they'll have there have been student groups that have tried to shut us down with the administration and they'll say the things that Michael is saying are unsafe they make they threaten us but of course what are they threatened what am I talking about Edmund Burke and that threatens them or something of course not what they do is they conflate speech with violence and so when the left if you're having a conversation when they accuse you of this of threatening them of making them feel unsafe of making them not feel comfortable what they are essentially doing is accusing your speaking as physically assaulting and battering them you're saying your words are punches your words are hurting me it says when you when you couple that with mansplaining it's that if you're speaking to a woman and you're disagreeing with her you're the equivalent of a wife beat her because you're threatening her you're making her unsafe you're making her uncomfortable that's that's the third one and then just one other this is a broader observation in the culture of it's being led by the left it's being weaponized by the left is mental illness mental illness is all the rage these days it's all anybody can talk about it's used as an excuse to excuse terrible behavior and it comes from a real place young people are much more likely today to be anxious to be stressed to be depressed an ASU study found that a quarter of college students are suffering PTSD because Donald Trump won the presidential election in 2016 there are rates of suicide are increasing and especially among young people teen suicide is up 70 percent now and rates of being prescribed these depression drugs all of these SSRIs and those sorts of things are way out they're also through the roof so everybody thinks they have a mental problem everybody is on depression drugs constantly talking about mental illness what it's really about is not the people the few people who really could benefit from taking drugs all the time not the few people who have worked through their psychological problems and actually have a physical problem that requires medication what this is about is relativism this is what it's all about you see it all the time on everyday feminism on all the really far left wing websites and podcasts they all say that they have mental illness and we need to talk about mental illness and we need to describe mental illness and the reason that they talk about mental illness all the time is because it brings to the four different visions of reality but not different visions of reality using right reasons specifically different insane visions of reality to say well this person views things this way and their their mind is inaccessible to you because when people are saying when they have mental health we can use our faculties of reason to communicate with one another and we're speaking about an objective outside world but if everybody is a little crazy if everybody's a little kooky nobody's really accessing the objective world in the right way then we don't have access to objectivity anymore we don't have access to reality anymore we're back in the tyranny of subjectivism we're back in the tyranny of our feelings we can talk about facts as we say here on the daily wire a lot we have to talk about feelings and nobody can be wrong and nobody can be right every opinion is valid everything is your truth or my truth or this truth or that truth this is why the left is focused on that this is why not necessarily on CNN or the Washington Post when you go to the really more fringy more radical left wing websites blogs podcasts that's what they're focusing on it is not out of compassion for people who have psychological problems very often by the way people who have psychological problems have philosophical problems the issue isn't the synapses in their brain the issue is how they're living their lives and how they view the world and how they view themselves in relation not only to their creator but the the rest of the creation and so they talk about that not out of compassion for those people but they do it as a way of advancing their base agenda which they've had now for at least 50 or 60 years which is radical subjectivism speaking of mental illness and speaking of radical subjectivism this video first cropped up on the internet I guess really between Christmas and New Year's but because everybody was shut down in the commentary we haven't gotten a chance to talk about it we have to talk about it this is a transgender guy so a guy who dresses as a woman goes into some store and starts losing his mind because losing what's left of his mind because he thinks that somebody has referred to him a six foot two giant man as a man take a look excuse me it's ma'am it is ma'am I can call you like me please you need to settle down you need to settle down to find your business okay man once again man I said both of you no you said sir once again it's man I said both of you guys right beforehand you said sir sir motherf*** take it outside you want to call me sir again I will show you a f***ing sir motherf*** I need your corporate number because I'm gonna talk call them and talk about how it's misgendered several times in the store I need your corporate number now get it for me now give me a number well I'm gonna ask you for the fifth time to stop calling me a man because quite clearly I am not yes the giant person screaming shouting six-foot-tall knocking over products screaming that he's gonna go take the kid outside and beat him up that person is clearly not a man giant Adam's Apple I assume down below well I don't know maybe let's not assume that guy is a man obviously he has a psychological condition one imagines he also has a philosophical condition which is being indulged and encouraged by our mentally insane society which is that he thinks that a man can be a woman and a woman can be a man just because he puts on lipstick if you put on lipstick then you're a woman but of course that's not what makes a woman growing your hair a little longer is not what makes a woman I know plenty of scraggly-haired hippies out in LA who have long hair and don't think that they're women this thing that we've just watched here the kid I guess he said okay guys calm down I think he was using guys in a gender neutral way and this guy who thinks he's a woman loses his mind starts screaming and this kid backs down it says I'm sorry ma'am I'm sorry lady it's okay you know and the reason I bring this up is this guy's obviously lost his mind and what's unfortunate for him is that the society is even crazier than he is so they're going to encourage him and let him continue down this path of self-degradation but the reason I bring this up to is because it shows where the rubber meets the road between various schools of conservative thought if you look at this guy this guy is a man who wants to be a woman and if you find your political views are rooted really in individualism self-definition I can do whatever I want to do absolutely at any time I own my life I can define myself however I want to define myself then he actually makes a pretty good case for always making other people call him ma'am or call him a woman the line from individualism to collectivism is actually pretty direct I think sometimes among conservative circles we want to pretend that the big dichotomy in the world is between conservative or rather is between individualism and collectivism one prioritizes the individual is the absolute most important thing in society the other prioritizes the collective all of those individuals together there are two sides of the same coin there's a direct line between them if you say that the individual is the most important atomic fundamental building block of society that in a state of nature individuals are just floating around in free space without any ties of loyalty to family or friends or tribe or country or whatever if you believe that then the government's job is first and foremost to protect individualism that's the purpose of it is to protect individual liberty to the point of individualism but if the government is there to protect individualism and our corporate society decides that they're not going to recognize somebody's own self-definition then that corporation is infringing on individualism if this guy says I am a woman and corporate America or or the government state government or whatever says that he's not a woman they're not going to call him a woman they're infringing on his radical individual self-definition and so it makes perfect sense for there to be regulations over how businesses can treat people how schools have to refer to people how to use pronouns and they use the phrase misgendered obviously the only person who is misgendered this guy is himself he is misgendering himself because he thinks that he's a woman but they've inverted this phrase and it does make sense there is a reason why in the thinking of all of those early what we would call classical liberals or even libertarians if you look at Thomas Payne for instance the guy who wrote common sense force in the American Revolution or the writings of Thomas Jefferson or people who come after that throughout the Enlightenment and onward you can see a line from exulting the individual as the be-all-and-end-all at atomic unit of society and protecting the collective of individuals the actual difference here the actual different worldviews is between liberalism or modernism or individualism or collectivism or everything that goes along with it and the conservative worldview which says there is a reality you cannot self- define you cannot by yourself define reality there is an objective reality you are a man no law passed by any government will change the fact that that guy's a man no surgery that is cosmetic and makes and alters his cheek bones or his Adam's apple will make that guy not a man no corporate code of conduct will make that guy not a man no market no free market which is now getting all of these corporations to start playing into the social justice warrior handbook we saw this with Gillette we've seen this with Nike we've seen corporate America leading the way on liberalism and leftism no free market is going to change the fact that this guy is a guy and it's where we have to appeal to something deeper more profound more transcendent rather than the individual or the free market or certain documents the constitution or state constitutions or laws or whatever we have to appeal to something which is transcendent which is the natural law and the natural law maker the natural law giver and the institutions and the traditions that have transported these metaphysical realities into our modern age that is what we've got to talk about the question is not about rights it's not about the rights of the guy who thinks he's a woman it's not about the rights of the guy working at the store it's not about the rights of a democratic republic to pass laws changing the definition of men and women it's about reality and we have to recognize reality we have to prioritize reality above any of the various ideologies left wing or right wing that everybody is so crazy about today we've got to talk about Steve King we haven't had to we've run out of time in the last few days we got to talk about him we've got to talk about those cackling hens on the view to quote Norm McDonald we've got to talk about different kinds of bigotry not just racial bigotry but also religious bigotry and if we have time we'll talk about why we can't run our own countries after the British Parliament runs train on Theresa May's Brexit deal but first go to dailywire.com if you're already there thank you very much you help keep the lights on you keep kofefe in my cup if you're not it's ten bucks a month one hundred dollars for an annual membership but Michael what do I get what do you get what don't you get you get me you get the Andrew Cleven show Ben Shapiro show Matt Walsh show you get to ask questions backstage get to ask questions in the mailbag get them in that'll be tomorrow you get to ask questions you get to watch all the backstage that are coming up now you get to see another kingdom we've got two seasons up there now and none of that matters because you get this you get the leftist tears tumblr this is very important because you know now when we when you take airplanes when you get on modes of transportation you're not always allowed to take water bottles or certain little bottles of perfume or whatever but when you are running train on the progressive agenda you are allowed the FDA the FAA the FT the FAT the FTA I don't know they allow you to bring on the leftist tears tumblr that's the only way to do it because when you're running train on the progressive agenda you're there there are gonna be a lot of leftist tears as Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was describing today you're gonna want this it is the only safe way to dispose of those leftist tears to hold them and then obviously dispose of them down your gullet go to dailywire.com we'll be right back with Steve King Steve King we've all talked about it but we haven't had time to address it fully on this show which is Steve King longtime congressman he made these comments allegedly though he hasn't really denied them in an interview with the New York Times where he said white nationalism white supremacy Western civilization when did these things become offensive now obviously that that is offensive to a great many people and just as a simple matter of fact just as a simple matter of language being offensive white supremacy has always been offensive to a very large number of people some people didn't find it offensive in the past now more people find it offensive but it has always been offensive to some people I think we can safely say white supremacy has always carried offense to some people now he has apologized for this there were calls for him to step down from Congress he looks like he's certainly going to be primary he looks very politically weak he'll probably be beaten next election but there were calls to do this to do that he came out and apologized immediately and he condemned white supremacy as an evil ideology here's that I reject those labels and the evil ideology that they define under any fair political definition I am simply an American nationalist okay the evil ideology he he rejects them he disavows them okay good I'm glad he did that I think he felt that was the right thing to do a lot of his colleagues felt that was the right thing to do then the Congress went out and they voted to condemn or rebuke Steve King it's a little unclear what the effect of this is as a matter of terminology was it a rebuke was it a condemnation was it a reprimand what okay what the effect of it though is he's already been stripped of his committee assignments he won't sit on any committees he's basically powerless in the Congress now a pretty harsh action was taken against him and I'll point out harsh action was taken against him for speaking to a reporter the things he said nobody's defending the things he said I haven't seen one conservative defend the things that he said but it is a little scary as far as a precedent goes that when you say things to a reporter you can lose everything in your political career not by the people who elect you but from other people in the government nevertheless okay that's fine they took a vote to condemn King in his remarks and Steve King actually voted in favor of that bill here is King on his own condemnation so I want to compliment the gentleman from South Carolina for bringing this resolution and I've carefully studied every word in this resolution and even though I'd add some more that are stronger language I agree with the language in it so I want to ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle let's vote for this resolution I'm putting up a yes on the board here because what you stay here is right and it's true and it's just and so is what I have stated here on the floor of the House of Representatives thank you Madam Speaker now you'll back to balance my time okay so he stripped of his committee seats which means he's doing nothing in Congress essentially he is condemned by the Congress he voted for his own condemnation he's called those remarks which he says were misinterpreted he's called them an evil ideology which he disavows what more do they want from him is the question here is his defense of the remarks that he made or rather I'm not he's not defending them but he is excusing them because he says that they were misinterpreted so I'm gonna tell you that the words are likely what I said but I want to read it to you the way I believe I said it and that's this white nationalist white supremacist Western civilization how did that language become offensive why did I sit in classes teaching me about the merits of our history and civilization that's the end of the quote just to watch Western civilization become a derogatory term in political discourse today okay so do you buy it do you buy that he would they were separate thoughts he said white supremacist white nationalist beat beat beat beat Western civilization how did that become offensive because of course the phrase Western civilization is not offensive the left finds it offensive but there's nothing wrong Western civilization is the greatest political achievement in the history of the world now do you buy that excuse I don't really buy it it's even the way he's describing it it's a little mealy mouth he's I don't know it's a little too clever by half so let's say that Steve King said it he conflated Western civilization with white supremacy he said remarks that have been universally condemned across the political aisle by his own party by his own colleagues he's been condemned rebuked or reprimanded he voted for his own condemnation he's off of all the committees okay okay that's all fine I'm with you so far but what about the Democrats what about what about what about Michigan first term representative Rashida Tlaib was pictured just recently just within the last couple weeks with a Palestinian activist named Abes Hamide who regularly praises Hezbollah Hezbollah a terrorist organization and has called Jews Zionist terrorists Rashida Tlaib that same person right when she got into the Congress took a sticky note to the map of the world in her office wrote in Palestine and covered up Israel Israel the only state for Jews in the world plenty of states for Arabs plenty of states for Muslims one state in the entire world in all of history for Jews she symbolically wipes it off the face of the map where is her condemnation where is her apology I didn't ever saw her Steve King apologized he called it an evil ideology where's her calling it an evil ideology Minnesota representative Elan Omar another Democrat freshman wrote on Twitter quote Israel has hypnotized the world may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel hashtag Gaza hashtag Palestine hashtag Israel now this Steve King referred to white supremacy he was conflated with neo-Nazis these types in his speech condemning that evil ideology he said it was the evil ideology that led Hitler to wipe six that six million Jews off of the face of the earth that anti-Jewish ideology is an ideology being embraced by Elan Omar and Rashida Tlaib openly embraced not in an off not in a an unrecorded interview with the New York Times where we don't have the tape to listen to it but publicly on Twitter they defend it still and the Democrats defend it still where is that apology where is that vote of condemnation Barack Obama former president two-term president hope and change took a smiling photo with Lewis Farrakhan the head of the nation of Islam he's called Jews termites he refers to every other race as awful and terrible white devils a minister truly a minister of racial bigotry and hatred and there's Barack Obama smiling with him couldn't be happier and you know what happened the mainstream media had that photo before the 2008 election they hit it they didn't want it to come out it has since come out where's Barack Obama's apology where's Barack Obama calling that an evil ideology I just see smiles I don't see him calling it an evil ideology where is the vote to condemn and rebuke and reprimand Barack Obama you might say Michael this is what aboutism what aboutism is when you we're talking about one topic one person one act and then you point out hypocrisy by saying well what about this other person or this other act that hasn't been equally condemned and really what aboutism compares apples to oranges when the phrase became popular during the Cold War it was about comparing apples to oranges I'm comparing apples to apples here I'm compiling comparing contemporary politician to contemporary politician on both sides of the aisle the only difference of course is that Steve King has been remorseful and has apologized and Democrats are still proud of it all they're still smiling and they're still championing these these almost identical ideologies and if it's what aboutism well what about what about it what about it I would vote along with Steve King for that rebuke for that condemnation of Steve King in his remarks but before I did that I would insert an amendment if I were in Congress and I would also include a rebuke of Rashida Tlaib and Ilana Omar and Barack Obama for smiling with Louis Farrakhan I would insist on that being included in the condemnation and the rebuke and we should have done that as well I think Republicans they want to get rid of Steve King because he's politically poisonous at this point and he's passed his political usefulness and he's been in the career for a long time and he's probably gonna lose his primary next go around they just want to stop talking about it fine I get the political expedience of that but I would insist on including those condemnations of Omar Tlaib and Barack Obama because without those condemnations also in the condemnation of Steve King it is very clear that Democrats have no interest whatsoever in condemning racial bigotry they're only interested in attacking the GOP and they're not even just interested in attacking the GOP they're interested in using Steve King as a proxy to attack Donald Trump they don't care about Steve King Steve King is just some congressman one of over 400 people just doesn't who cares what he's you know he doesn't affect the country in the way that the president does and they want to call the president racist and bigoted and this ist and that ist they want to tie the issue of illegal immigration to racism somehow that's all they want to do and they are unwilling to deal with it in their own party Linda Sarsour another anti-Semite was given an award by Barack Obama in the White House as she has had close ties to the Democratic Party and to the Women's March the list goes on and on and on if they want to condemn Steve King by all means go for it if they want to condemn racial bigotry and hatred please great more power to you but do it on both sides otherwise you're a fake you're a fraud you're a cynical politician that's what the Democrats are on this issue let's see what those cackling hints to use Norm McDonald's phrase had to say at the view about this issue will Republicans now step up to the plate with Donald Trump because he has been using I think the border wall as sort of this dog whistle for racism the government is still shut down and I think it's all about let's not let all these brown people in right unless they're working for farmers unless they're working in agriculture so now will the Republican Party step up to him and say we don't want this anymore there's 42% of this country that's the worth the wall are they all racist that's a good question I'm asking you that I don't think so I don't think so I think a lot of people that believe in I don't know okay so it goes on got a love Abby Huntsman my old pal she just does it right there she says what do you think half the country is racist and this woman whose name I don't know says well that's a good question and whenever someone says well that's a good question it means they just have no idea what they're gonna say they have nothing to say you always I would always on whether I'm conducting an interview or I'm on a panel with somebody and we're doing interviews you say what do you think about this they'll say that's a good question say no it's a good question I thought it up I'm thank you for the compliment answer the question but she thinks of this woman clearly thinks that half of the country is racist and Republicans are is Steve King racist is the wall racist they ask okay our Barack Obama and Ilana Omar and Rashida it's leave racist are they are Democrat analysts on CNN racist for trying to shut up white people by using these ad hominem attacks white privilege ironically against a black guy doesn't work every time but do your research next time what about other kinds of bigotry because we're just focusing on racism but I don't only want to run train on racism I want to run train on all sorts of bigotry and the biggest one that's cropping up in the news cycle is religious bigotry this is far more prevalent obviously Christians around the world are the most persecuted religious group on earth right now and it's reached a record high certainly in modern history that the left doesn't get this the left doesn't get religious bigotry whether it's Islamic militants abusing Christians in the Middle East or whether it's leftists in a different way in a more legal way or rather a legislative way or a regulative way trying to attack Christians in the United States the left doesn't get this because the left doesn't take religion seriously the left takes race very seriously the left takes race too seriously they think that everything is about race so much so that a CNN analyst will accuse a black political commentator of having white privilege that's how obsessed they are about race they take race too seriously they don't take religion seriously enough so Karen Pence who is the wife of Vice President Mike Pence she was a school teacher it was just announced she's going to take a job as a school teacher she's going to teach at this Christian school and continue her career I think she got tired of hanging around the Naval Observatory and so she's going to do this wonderful for her great opportunity for the students had at NBC News reported they said quote Karen Pence to teach at school that bans LGBTQ employees and students what what school does that let's look a little more closely here the school which is a Christian school in reality this is quoting from later on in the NBC article bars its employees from engaging in or condoning homosexual or lesbian sexual activity and transgender identity so it's not banning people who are attracted to members of the same sex it's not banning people who identify or think that they are members of the opposite sex it's just saying you can't engage in that sort of activity which what that really means is that a Christian school expects its teachers to agree with Christian sexual teaching which is not just Christian sexual teaching but it's Jewish sexual teaching it's in the extremist world it would be Muslim sexual teaching Christian sexual teaching is pretty Lucy Gucci compared to other religions traditional moral teachings on sex the basis of a Christian education which is what these kids are going to this school for is to teach the Christian view of the world and then a lot of atheist or secularist or whatever humanist modernist people now they want to say oh well what do they want to learn that stupid Christian view of the world what do you think people were walking around with dinosaurs what are those big dumb idiots the Christian view of the world as a basis for education is the only basis for education just historically speaking if you enjoy all of the advancements over the last twelve or thirteen hundred years in math or science or literature or history historiography or philosophy or anything like that you can thank the Christian view of the world and the Christian basis of education education as we know it would not exist anywhere in the world if it were not invented by the Catholic Church in the mid to late Middle Ages it would not exist all of the universities all of the cathedral schools all of our all of the metaphysical basis of education itself that we have in our modern world it comes from Christianity and it comes from specifically the Catholic Church so she wants to teach it this Christian school that's fine the Christian school wants its students and employees to agree to a Christian morality the left of course hates Christianity so it's very upset about this what if it were announced what if we had a president whose first lady was Muslim and it was announced that this woman was going to teach in a madrassa a Muslim school do you think that madrassa would celebrate homosexual activity sexual activity do you think it would celebrate the transgender movement transgenderism ah something tells me it wouldn't and what would happen then NBC news would be thrilled they would be all how brave how brave and beautiful this first lady she's teaching she loves children and she loves education and she oh she's at a Muslim school this is so wonderful but because it's a Christian school they hate it and this is why NBC news in the left they don't care about the LGBTQ elemento P employees or students they don't care about that whatsoever they are using them as they always use the ever multiplying victim groups as an instrument as a tool with which to clobber conservatives and the tradition that's all it's about I I would love it if Karen Pence went on sabbatical at the Christian school went to teach in a madrassa we'd see how the news covered that probably very differently because they are they are unlike us they are unwilling in the progressive agenda to run train on bigotry and hatred and racism and all of those other nefarious ideologies that's our show we got a lot more to get to but too bad
