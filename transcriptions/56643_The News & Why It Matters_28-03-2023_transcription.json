    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today, more details are released about the transgender shooter in Nashville, including the body cam footage from Nashville police and, as expected, the left wants you to feel sorry for the killer. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Saragans Aalas and today, I want you to remember these names. Cynthia Peake, Catherine Coons, Mike Hill, Evelyn Deakhouse, Halley Scruggs, and William Kinney. Those last three names that I just read are three nine year olds who are never coming home. We'll never have another birthday party, never laugh again, never tell their parents I love you. At least not until they're all reunited one day with our Heavenly Father because six parents are now picking up caskets for their children. Why? Because society has decided to allow rampant mental illness and pretend that it's tolerance. The LGBT community and really the left in general have been ramping up to this, haven't they? It's something that we see every day. We talk about it on this program every day. They firebomb pregnancy clinics when they lose the right to kill children. They threaten the lives of Supreme Court justices and lawmakers. They casually suggest murder to deal with people they disagree with. They burn down cities when they don't get their way. They assault those who disagree with them in broad daylight with no worry of consequences whatsoever. We just saw Alex Stein over the weekend get assaulted multiple times by the LGBT community. We just saw Posey Parker over the weekend get assaulted by the LGBT community for daring say that women are women and men are men. Billboard Chris, a friend of the program, has had his arm broken. He has had bones broken for standing on the street corner holding a sign. These people have been telling on themselves for a while now. If you don't affirm their delusions they want you dead. In just days there will be a planned transgender day of vengeance in DC. We want more more than visibility they say in their flyer, more than visibility. Every day is trans day of vengeance they say trans rights or else they have a t-shirt that says trans rights or else with a bunch of guns on the t-shirt. These people think that they are immune to the rules of a civil society because for the most part people look the other way. Ooh don't want to be called intolerant. Affirm the delusion don't want to be called a bigot. Shoot them up full of hormones in an unprecedented way which by the way can cause horrible side effects like mood swings and rage but don't want to be labeled a transphobe so we better not. You have posts like this from the trans community saying kill Christ cucks. Behead Christ cucks. Roundhouse kick a Christ cuck into the concrete. Slam dunk a Christ cuck baby into the trash can. Crucify filthy Christ cucks. Deficate in a Christ cuck's food. Launch Christ cucks into the sun. Now this person is coddled, enabled, emboldened in society. Affirmed. No repercussions but don't worry the FBI I'm sure has you on a domestic terrorist list for showing up at a freaking school board meeting. These people are mentally ill and half of society refuses to treat the mental illness head on all while saying you're the problem. You're a religious extremist if you don't believe in chopping children's breasts off. You're a far right wing nut job if you acknowledge basic biology but it's not just mental illness. It is something so much further deeper than that. As someone who has faced this issue head on in the lion's den who has stared these people in the eyes and seen the dead decaying eyes staring back at me. This is without a doubt spiritual warfare. We are in the battle of good versus evil. Well evil will be called good and good evil. Darkness will be called light and light will be called darkness. We're here guys we are here because there is nothing else to call the murder of innocent children but evil. And the left is so depraved, so soulless, so sick that when these mentally ill demonically possessed creatures do something as heinous as kill three innocent children murder them in cold blood target these babies. What did they do? They did exactly what I told you they would do. It's your fault. If you just accepted trans ideology these poor trans people wouldn't have to slaughter your children. No. No. No. No. Absolutely not. I want to bring in my guest today to discuss this and more. I have Chad Prather, host of the Chad Prather Show and Yaku Buoyan's host of the bottom line also believes TV contributor. To say I am angry would be an understatement because as I mentioned we have been talking about this for a very long time. We have been talking about the rage. We have been talking about the violence. We have been talking about the fact that these people seem to think that they can get away with whatever they want if you don't affirm their delusions. I just had this conversation with Alex Stein who I know both of you know, Blaze to be host and friend of all of us and he's getting assaulted multiple times. Any time he goes out there he's having water thrown on him. He's having coffee thrown on him and he doesn't want to press charges and I'm like I know that like you're doing what you do and you know it's you kind of have fun with it and that's great but these people it's not a game to them. It's not a game to them and they do want to harm you and they will not stop until there are severe consequences for them thinking that they have we have a two-tiered society where the LGBT community has no consequences for any of their actions. When does it stop? Well you're right we've been calling it out for a long time right? I mean this is literally years that we have said that we cannot continue to normalize mental illness and say that in the name of acceptance and inclusion and diversity that this is supposed to be okay. We've laundered this to the general public. We know that these are people who quite literally hate themselves so if they perceive you to hate them as well. See these people operate in hate. Love is not in them. They have no concept of love. They can't love themselves in this idea that I need you to accept me and validate me whether it's a pronoun or a gender affirming surgery or some kind of support I'm supposed to get because of their rejection that they have that they feel internally of themselves that even if you were to give them those things they're not going to be okay with it either because again they have they they lack the complete they have a complete inability to love themselves and accept themselves. So we've been calling this out the fact that they hate themselves so much they now have got to go out and find others to hate too. And this is what we're going to see played out. Now this is the most and I'm going to belabor the point just for another minute. This is the most that I think that other than you've all been shooting I think this is the most that I've ever spent time on my own program. We actually aired early yesterday in order to get ahead of a lot of the stuff that was coming out and tonight on my show we go really really deep into this issue and we deal more with the shooter than I would care to do ever in it because I want to keep the name out. I don't want to glorify this person but I think it's relevant with this because we're about to see a trend and that's what's scary because now they have been it's not about acceptance now they've been emboldened and they can justify the threats of violence and now as we saw yesterday in Nashville, Tennessee the kinetic action of violence being carried out. We are going to see more and more of that these trans organizations as a quote collective have now come out making the statement that it's people like us sitting around this table who are at fault therefore I somehow feel targeted it's all of a sudden and I forget the emails and the messages that I get in the DMs that are threatening me but but now I know that I'm being targeted and I'm not going I'm not that guy who's going to sit back and just let you do that. Nope. I don't give a damn if you want a D platform me come at me call me names call me a person of hate no the fact of the matter is I actually do care about you and I love you enough to tell you the truth your collective isn't doing that. So to Chad's point I just I had a conversation with Jason Whitlock on his show earlier today and I it's like it's like you were listening in on my conversation because because Jason was talking to me about this and you know we get called I get called anti-trans all the time I'm just anti-trans and I'm like you know what I'm sick and tired of being called anti-trans I care about these freaking people more than any of the doctors who are pushing them into this for profit by the way I care more about these people than anyone else does who tries to affirm their delusions and push them further and further into a place where they're more prone for depression more prone for suicide more prone to having bad things happen in their lives leading them to do things like this I care about them more than any of those people. A hundred percent look the look we're in that hour and we can sit here and I I'm sitting here processing how much scripture do I want to quote right now because I can quote I can quote and you know sexual immorality is an abomination to God that's scripture and I quote sexual immorality is a sin against your own body which God speaks about it as a sin against the temple which results in a human condition that Chad is talking about a human being that's incapable of loving themselves that's why God says love your neighbor as what as you love yourself you've got to be able to love yourself first because Sarah Gonzalez I can witness that she truly does love herself not in a narcissistic way in who God created her to be a mother a wife right she's capable of loving others they're incapable but it's funny because their movement is the love movement they're incapable of love that's why those relationships fall apart they live in bitterness and a self-fulfilling prophecy which is a demonic prophecy which drives them to the gates of hell and human life has zero value and you saw it in the Me Too movement I said it's not a Me Too movement it's a Me movement this is why my pronouns how you need to announce me and acknowledge me and tomorrow it may change because they're so empty they're such a void and a chasm yes it's a mental illness but let's go further it's demonic possession to slaughter children as not just a mental illness it is a cocktail of Satan having a foothold celebrated by society by pastors that are now saying trans is holy no it's not you had it on the show sure and this is the result Sarah so here's what happened yesterday children died because of the LBGTQ trans crazy movement you did this you drive your own people off a cliff because if you love them you would get them help you would not ostracize them and you wouldn't make it all about you you would actually make it about them but they do not and that's where the penny drops here and society is complicit by standing by going don't want to be canceled so I'm with you you can't cancel me I'm a son of god sorry and you come from me I'm gonna put I'm gonna put a hurting on you in ways that you can't measure okay because I'm gonna defend me and mine and so that school has some answers to give and bring and we know the school well our family knows the school well why there wasn't security but Chad is right more of this same until the dog starts wagging the tail again so I want to before we have to go to break I want to provide a few more updates that police have just given this afternoon on the shooter whose name we will not mention on this program but what they have revealed is that she was receiving care for what they call an undisclosed emotional disorder under a doctor's care he said law enforcement knew nothing about this treatment and apparently it has been reported that the shooter was autistic but high functioning that's a whole nother that's a whole nother thing to get into when you're talking about the amount of autistic people who now identify as trans because they're getting pushed into it because they are a vulnerable a vulnerable subset of society to be pushed into it but here we have another autistic person who identifies as trans the shooter legally purchased seven guns from five different stores her parents who said they did not want her to own any guns acknowledge that they knew she had previously sold a firearm but did not know she owned others and they say that she was hiding the weapons in her parents home here you can see the three weapons that were used in the attack yesterday and I do want to on this topic you know I think that these events this violence from the left is happening so frequently that we forget we forget that this actually is a this is a this is a pattern here we have let's pull up this this tweet here the Colorado Springs shooter identified as non-binary the Denver shooter identified as trans the Aberdeen shooter identified as trans the Nashville shooter now we have identified as trans any attention yet you waking up yet you aren't doing anything about that yet I'm ready I've been ready I'll I'm I'm doing it but we need everyone to do it all right so when we come back let's get into how the legacy media has been treating this particular story but I would say if you have blood pressure issues make sure you take your blood pressure medications before we get into that I want to thank our sponsor quickly Birch Gold so if you want to buy gold now's the time to do it because you're going to get a free safe to store it in from Birch Gold on qualifying purchases from Birch Gold Group they will go ahead and send you that safe directly to your door now through March 31st you're going to text the word why to 9898 to get you know what they're going to send you a free information kit on gold and you're going to claim eligibility for that safe and you're going to need it because the Fed keeps raising rates because they think like hey let's just raise rates and that's going to keep inflation under control but it's just that you can't spend your way out of inflation which I think you've seen right now the impact on the stock market the impact on your savings on your retirement accounts that you're this is like your nest egg that you're trying to take into retirement and live off of yeah you're going to need to head against inflation by owning gold so it can be physical gold or through an IRA in precious metals but just make sure that you check it out you can do that by texting the word why to 9898 to get that free information kit on gold and to claim you're free safe hey those of you who are watching on youtube this is the time of the program where I ask you if you would just gently tap that like button and subscribe and comment let us know your thoughts on the craziness going on in the world we would love to hear it and I do I know people tell me not to read the comments but I do read the comments so make sure and leave us one so I want to get to the media reaction to this which is just so despicable you know I sat here on this program yesterday and I said just wait just wait just wait they're going like it's it's going to be but why would you evil white christian male make a trans person feel like they had to go out and do something like that oh poor trans person they're so oppressed think about all the rights that they don't have that we okay well no actually they do have all of the rights that you and I have but but we're teaching them that they're oppressed and so of course they did they did just that legacy media outlets they were actually you know this person just killed six innocent people three of whom were children and the most innocent among us but legacy media outlets really upset that the police misgendered this girl so let's look at USA Today first they were doing a tweet thread update and they said update in addition to the the three students those staff members three students three staff members were fatally shot the female shooter appears to be in her teens and was armed with at least two assault type rifles and handgun according to Nashville police spokesman they updated again said police have identified the shooter as a 28 year old Nashville woman she was shot and killed and then the next update police on Monday afternoon said that the shooter was a transgender man officials had initially misidentified the gender of the shooter oh no we can't have that and it wasn't just them let's look at the New York times female assailants in mass shootings in the US like the one that occurred on Monday in Nashville are extremely rare according to the violence project which maintains a national database of mass shootings dating back to 19 what is that 66 and then of course the follow-up tweet there was confusion later on Monday about the gender identity of the assailant in the Nashville shooting officials had used the she and her pronouns to refer to the suspect who according to a social media post and LinkedIn profile appear to identify as a man in recent months how dare the Nashville police misgender this cold-blooded killer so I was watching the ABC News anchor who was trying to describe the shooter and it was like watching someone walk a tight rope yeah where do I put my foot how do I step as I'm describing this person did I give the right gender the right pronoun did I say he him and then all of a sudden they got into the aspect of the how the news media and all of this was is the ones who are really to blame and then he had he was fine with that you know he was like oh well let's just coast on through casting the blame but when he was talking about who a trans person was because it because you know what he you know what in his mind in in his mind and his stupid demented mind he has been so programmed it's almost like he's about to say the N word and he's scared he's going to do it yeah yeah because he knows he'll lose his job if he misgenders a murderer I just got through I'm gonna sound like Glenn back here for a minute I just got done taping my special for Thursday night it may be the most important special that I've ever done on Blaze TV and I'm going to talk to you about chalkboard and everything about how the media not only lies to you manipulate you but teaches you to believe a reality that's just not even there this is a perfect example of what what we're seeing played out in front of us so I want to I'm not sure if this is the one this is the one okay all right so let's play that ABC News watch how watch the trepidation in the first 15 seconds of this very much so she's a former student of the school and confirmed that was a identified herself as a transgender person at state of Tennessee earlier this month passed in the governor signed a bill that banned transgender medical care for minors as well as a law that prohibited adult entertainment including male and female and personators after a series of drag show controversies in that state and also why would you also why would you bring that up what does that have to do with any of you right right right oh well I mean if you guys wouldn't have banned the drag shows for kids maybe she wouldn't have slaughtered innocent children if they're having been you know a ban or some kind of you know speaking out against the you know the chemical castration or gender mutilization of children on the age of 18 we wouldn't have had any of this it's your fault it's your fault for trying to protect kids look at this man does the flip side of the coin count does it count you harm you harm me kill you harming people you're harming children so could we who love children now say hey you did it you made us do it where does where does that is that should be a bit of that sword cut both ways it should right but either way you're to blame no but i'm telling you this country has lost its balls Sarah completely as a nation it lost its balls it's leading the point zero four percent of a sick demented culture tell them what a child is what i'm men in this country that guy doesn't know he's a man even if he doesn't identify or doesn't know if he gets these lost these balls he identifies as a butthole pucker is what he does not know jack you had an accurate depiction this morning on twitter i'm sorry you got kicked off of twitter for just speaking to truth okay thank you about a president yeah beside himself i said he's a brain dead sock puppet which is nice or nice originally tight yeah where you're on come on buddy come on where's the lie come on where is the lie this is this is so this is so infuriating to me how to conversation this weekend with a pastor who said so glad you do the work we do because we just can't have these conversations and they go excuse me you cannot have these conversations in the church well you lost your balls do not why you can't have these conversations in the church this is ridiculous it's because you're not having these conversations that men are neutered in this country they're silent can't do anything and and you know you let you let the little little remnant the little squeaky wheel not just get the grease but murder the children um i uh so i want to show one more statement here that's like oh boo hoo poor trans person was so oppressed before she went on to murder a bunch of innocent people this is the trans resistance network who released a statement saying we do not claim to know the individual or have access to their inner thoughts and feelings we do know that life for transgender people is very difficult and made more difficult in the preceding months by a virtual avalanche of anti-trans legislation and public callouts by right-wing personalities and political figures for nothing less than the genocidal eradication of trans people from society we remind the news media to respect the self-identified pro pronouns of transgender individuals who come across your desk uh this person identified with he-him pronouns on forward-facing sites we also urge to avoid pandering to those individuals on the right who will use this double tragedy to torment or to torment fear and terror of transgender people in order to advance a political agenda of transgender elimination um well real men shot her full of holes so now she identifies as was were and the thing about that is real men took care of business. Real men took care of business if that pisses you off tough and you know you can issue all the statements you want all the voices in your head and apparently they are a legion know you're lying they're all testifying to one thing inside of that warp schizophrenic brain of yours you know you're lying yeah Chad who's really unstable here the group that's justifying murder right of children let let in that statement they literally say in the third paragraph they say they say there's two victims here right right right a double tragedy and then and then let's go to that last line too because i think it's very important uh the second and more complex more complex tragedy more complex tragedy is that this person uh felt he had it's not a he it's a she had no other effective way to be seen than to lash out by taking the lives of others and by consequence himself more complex more complex than nine year olds than nine year olds dying that that there that is the agenda and felt they had no other effective way to be seen right right but no but don't listen to us we're those bias right wing nut jobs we're going to tell you it was a freaking chick a crazy bitch who wanted to commit suicide by cop and decided to take the innocent the most innocent among us because she is sick and evil so so yeah let me go on record is saying yeah i don't advocate for violence but you need to be significantly marginalized from society and put in a damn a phylum where you can get help yes yes sick yes sick and and and who man i love this show i'll tell you this though uh yeah if you don't

truly independent from big tech have a look for yourself and learn what you can do to help join the fight against big tech censorship visit the blaze dot com today i want to have the the conversation here about you know you hear from the left there of course calling to take everyone's guns because that's somehow gonna solve the problem it wasn't the crazy person the evil person behind the gun it was definitely just the gun that decided to go off and kill all of these innocent people will police held a press conference um yesterday and they discussed you know people were asking reporters were asking um was this a targeted attack was this was it clear that this was intentionally the church the kids uh the police chief said yes and then he discussed how you know um this woman decided to pursue the school specifically because the other places had too much security watch we can give you that at a later time there is uh some theory to that we're investigating all the leads and once we know exactly we'll let you know so was this a targeted attack it was it was the only school that was targeted there was another location that was mentioned but because of a threat assessment by the suspect too much security they decided not to in that area hmm it's almost like when you have a gun-free zone such as a school uh you just make your children sitting ducks it's almost like the criminals know if they want to get away with killing people they will go to the place where nobody has any freaking security and i'm just wondering you know we spend billions of dollars making sure that Ukrainian citizens can arm themselves right we spend billions of dollars in our education system we spend all of this money so that our children can come out not knowing how to read not knowing how to write not knowing how to do math but definitely indoctrinated into radical gender ideology we spend all of this money on children's education for them to also not get educated and not be safe and you're telling me we don't have the funds to put a flipping security officer in every single school in this country i find that very hard to believe there's a lot of uh ready to go retired military they're ready to get up and and go and uh be armed to the teeth and you don't take but one of those trained men put them at the door of that school and take they take care of business and you pay them 75 80 000 dollars a year to do that they'd love to do it um i think the it look that ends it right there you know you know it's over with ten billion dollars a year arms every school with with a man and yeah a man i'm saying a man um because i'm done playing this unless you want to play his gender game i'll tell you want you want to fix society we need men we need men i'm not saying there's not a place for when there is a place for women is for women being women but i want men to step up and we need to put men armed men at our schools pay them 80 000 dollars a year ten billion dollars a year is what it would cost to put them in every single school in america and another thing let me say this to you parents and grandparents out there stop letting your kids go to places where they can be influenced by mentally ill people whether that's a shooter or a teacher or or an administrator or a drag show or a strip tease or a bar just stop taking your kids where people are mentally ill don't bring them to my house including disney stop taking him to disney yeah i'll take him to disney yeah stop it just stop it i'm sorry guys do you do you like where society is do you like where society is stop doing the same thing over and over again expecting the same results and simple and stop allowing the left to control the narrative of we have to do something right you heard korean john p.r. say it we want to grab your guns but we have to do something right now let's have an emotional knee jerk reaction right now and take the guns we have to set down with all of my guns last night and i had to talk with them uh oh and i said guys are you unhappy are you miserable are you not taking care of here you're not getting the right kind of oil the care the rub down are you getting exercise are you getting the use that you need they all affirmed that they were good in my home and i said do you anybody have a need to go out and do anything to an innocent person none of them answered like they maybe they were lying but not a single one of the inanimate objects in my home told me that they wanted to go out and harm an innocent person and so you know i took care of my home you take care of your home you know yes targeted attack she had knowledge of the school which is part of covenant Presbyterian church established in green hills an amazing community i i love there for ten years but you must ask questions of the administration of that school because it's not a cheap school they pay real money but there's no security and the police chief says she targeted school where there was no security it was death by cop but because she's in agreement with satan it's not just let me go let her go kill herself under the bridge you want to die die go die she wrote in her tweets just want to die no no got to take christian kids because it's satanic then go to muslim school not that i want anybody to die i want no life to be lost what the police said it the police said it they asked was this a targeted attack he said yes targeted to a christian school targeted to very young children who cannot fight back who doesn't have the ability targeted to a place where there's no security so that woman was a coward an absolute coward and i can't stand it um so josh holly actually sent a letter calling on fbi director chris ray and uh homeland security secretary my orchus to open up a federal hate crime investigation into uh this national shooting because for what you just mentioned yaku this was clearly targeting a christian school i can't imagine that this is going to get any traction within the fbi or the uh homeland security um primarily because as i mentioned at the top of the show they're too busy uh you know trying to find grandma's who waved their flags at the united states capital or uh you know trying to find those those really scary mama bears who spoke up against mask mandates at school board meetings and you know if you're a white christian male boy i bet they've got you on a list but uh they probably don't have time to uh investigate this as a hate crime priorities priorities sir they told you there there are certain things that happen in our country and in our lives that impact me in a spiritual way to the point where it's like i feel like there has been a cosmic shift and something has adjusted itself like i felt that on 9-11 on the day after 9-11 i can remember that feeling i said our world has fundamentally changed i feel that i feel we're in that shift right now and it is that important we're we're these are these are dangerous dangerous times because we've let lunacy be normalized and and as you said as you started the show it's celebrated it's not only celebrated but this is demonic this is spiritual warfare when you are saying okay yes someone who is created in the image of god with with divinity built within them who who is an eternal being who has eternal consequences to the way they live their life and the decisions they make and you're going to fundamentally change that alter that alter your name alter your essence try to alter everything that god created you you are you are thumbing your nose at god and i'm sorry that that you are going through this but i promise you the spiritual consequences that are being unleashed in our world today are going to lead to more and more death and destruction yeah we're all going to be impacted by it yeah um all right so let's go ahead and take a break and when we come back i want to i want to discuss the police response because i think this is something that deserves to have a a light uh shined on it we'll do that after the break so Chad you mentioned uh real men and how we are in so desperate need for it well i can give you several real men which are uh members of the metro nashville police department who took down this shooter um i want to play some of this body cam footage now obviously this so the whole video is six minutes i we obviously don't have six you know we can't show the whole six minute video i've posted it on my twitter the full video six minutes long from the time they pulled up got out grabbed their gear out of the truck and got upstairs i mean they were hustling and hustle i mean it was incredible alarms going off blaring now i do want to say you know if you were discretion is advised um just because of the nature of you know what they're doing um it's very anxiety producing but let's watch some of that let's go let's go police they sure did they need to travel the country training other officers looking to do you baldly door see bathroom bathroom slow bathroom clear that's the way you clear a room in the fact that there's no kids there i mean obviously they this place is have some training teacher they did a good job the teachers saved lunch and and that's them of course engaging with the shooter who was pretty swiftly taken down um so i just listen six minutes uh since they from the time they arrived to engaging and killing the shooter you've all done an hour and 14 minutes an hour and 14 minutes where you heard their excuses well we did i mean that he was locked in the in the room and we could have been injured these men had no clue where this person was not a clue and they still went in there they were a couple in there with reckless abandon because of the duty you signed up for yes yes to serve and protect and defend and that's how you clear a room yeah yeah if you watch the full video and you see that i mean i it's kind of nerve-wracking because you there's a few times where he says rifle blue shirt in now you can see there's like what am i stepping into but they didn't hesitate they went into it yeah i just i so i'm like let's show the show their pictures again these two men rex angelbert and michael colazzo uh a four-year veteran and nine-year veteran of the force and you know you just you hear all this talk about defund the police and all that and you know i've had my my issues with police forces that are not run properly but this is the gold standard this is the prime example of how to properly run a police department and train your officers i was just so i watched this video and i was like i want to thank these men like i want i want i wish i could do something for them i want to do something for them i can't so i just called national pd headquarters and i just talked to the operator and said can you just tell them thank you i was i responded to very well very well um and she said that she would definitely you know let them know and um i said you know tell them they've got a lot of people praying for them because you know you you look at these men who courageously risked their lives not like the cowards over in uvaldi um and you know i think people say wow they're heroes and we they are but think about the emotional damage that they're going that they just endured that they're going to have to process and work through that this is going to stick with them i mean there's i don't think we showed it in this but there's one part of the video where they're literally like walking around one of the children's dead bodies it doesn't end with in the ground it doesn't end on the ground shooting the shooter right then goes into the forensic the debrief all that they're going to be dealing with this for a very long time you know what makes my heart happy in this situation there's actually more of them in this country than this nation wanted us to believe and they represented the blue well uh we have an incredible nation with men and women who serve who are always spat on and mistreated from the v a all the way down to the courthouse right and this time around thank god for body cam so that people can actually see and well done national uh pd um jen i just got to say something please allow me and it may be off topic here you know the original sin in the garden of eden is in fact sate and against god and it's a sin of pride funny what their movement is called mmm mmm pride mmm mmm it was fascinating too because i you know i when i posted the the full body cam footage on twitter um understandably there's been a very large response and in going through some of the responses um someone responded well three children are dead and then he said um i mean yeah you're right it was it was a great it was a great response but it like it was only after three children died and i'm like yes that's you're making the perfect argument for an armed citizenry yes you're not making the point that you think you are because my point is police response will always be delayed which is why we have to protect ourselves and have them on site right well right it's like well what did you expect them to do like report right that's a teleport there like and you heard the you heard the officers say where is he they weren't expecting a woman they don't know if they're walking into one or ten shooters right i'm relation apologist for misgendering i mean they should not rather you know potentially being shot at they should not right well well they they thought they were you know philipa wrote the film i'm not ashamed which was on the call of mind shooting my wife wrote the film on dylan and eric and the call of mind shooting and they were two teenagers again and we've looked at response time this only so much police can do from afar other than getting the note hey i'm going to show up there meet me this was phenomenal yeah yeah it really was well as a reminder that these aren't the first responders you and i the citizens are the first responders yes yes that we've gotten that wrong for a long time yes all right we got to take a break we'll be right back to shake yes all right we've got a little over a minute here yaku you have a new movie out thank you so much yeah thank you the film is sex nation and you did such a great job in it i wish we could put it for hours you looked amazing at the red carpet so did your hubby you
