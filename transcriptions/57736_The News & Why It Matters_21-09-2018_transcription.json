It's almost like you're not from California With promo code news at i target pro Glenn Well your top your top story. Oh, yes. So my top story is The lies crime the lies that we tell ourselves about crime and being safe here in America Everybody, you know, I said to my wife the other day because I had read the coddling of the American mind by Jonathan Hi, did you read that yet? I have It's fantastic and his his recommendations at the end are the best But you're kid on a bike and tell them to ride their bike to school as early as possible And and I love that and it's it's just the common sense thing so I talked to my wife and I said You know these seven suggestions, you know, and I remember when I'd be in seven years old, you know I was like 1934 18 And my mom just given me, you know money for gallon of milk and saying go up to store and get a gallon of milk And that was like two blocks away. I Think I may have been six. I couldn't have been older than seven and And nobody thought twice of it now It's crazy and so I'm talking to my wife and she said Oh, I don't know. I just I don't you know, I'm like kids are 25 honey They can go get the milk And she said, you know kidnapping and all this stuff and I said it's not true and Even showing all the statistics you don't believe the statistics well here are the new statistics Crime is now down again in the year of the gun The crime is down 8% 8% at the same time Great Britain crime has gone up was a 22% and knife crime up 11% No 22 increase in knife crime and 11% right in gun crime They don't have guns apparently they saw this stupid stupid BBC show. I'm trying to remember what it is It's this police show and I don't know I kind of like I like watching police shows from Different countries because then I could go that country's riddled with crime I think it's to do with us like in Britain like excuse me. So please don't commit that crime Please I would ask you sir. So so they have this they're trying to catch this serial killer, okay, and he's like torturing Young girls and killing them and they've got him in they know they can see him walking back and forth And they can hear the whimpering of a girl, okay in there and they come down the stairs and there He's behind this door and one of them says, you know Peter Lord and he's like alright me blokes And he goes in right before he kicks down the door The other officer and him they both Pull out their flashlight I swear to God they pulled out a flashlight blind him and then That's what they did. That's what they did. He came in. Yeah, he came with a machete, you know Knife crime the knife crime, right? Yeah, so he comes at him with a machete and they both have their flashlights In America the show ends quickly boom you're dead. They don't even have to open the door Yeah, you don't need the court case. You don't need anything. He's got a machete. There's a girl boom No questions. I don't think that things are gonna change Culturally even though the statistics are very plainly obvious I'm definitely a person that I just like show me the facts. Maybe that's why I'm here at daily wear I don't know why But there's an element of I've been mommy shamed before for doing basic things like Nursing my youngest on a park bench and watching my five and nine-year-old play at the at the fly 10 feet away Like I and or you know, hey babe watch the kid I'm running to the ladies room and then the husband lets her go watch the airplanes at DFW airport and that old lady comes over and says Is that your child? She's being you know, she's unaccounted for and it's so it I think that I can try to get your wife on board with the You know not being a helicopter parent because statistically also I think it does so much especially for young girls to be able to experience the Independence of being able to do their own thing and the self-confidence and the smarts to figure out their way with other people in certain Situations while you're observing while you're treating them and teaching them what they need to know, but it's culturally especially dear lord here in LA you have like a citizen Behind every corner, you know, it's like calling child control on you. I tell you something though They're only doing that in in places until it gets insane and then they stop one of the reasons why I moved from Manhattan is We lived in Manhattan and I thought it was great because I'm right in the center of every University, yeah, and I've got you know I'm going here and there and the house is right around the corner and so you could do so much my life I hated it and she's like there's no place to play. I was like see that right in the center of the central park play and She said you take them to central park and I and so Saturday was coming and I'm like I will this Saturday We moved shortly after Here's why we I went to central park. I had the kids. They were very young at the time, you know five and seven maybe and I Take them to central park and all these kids are playing and as I'm standing there all the parents are standing around and I see under the monkey bars these three girls and they're probably six or seven and I'm watching them and I'm watching my kids is they're playing real close and these girls start calling the other other friends over and then they drop their pants and they Crap not pee Crap under the monkey bars and they're encouraging the other kids to crap under the monkey bars and I I'm standing there and and I'm seeing this and then I look like The parents this must have been the Dinkins era of New York. Yes And I'm like I'm like where which which one of you and the parent next to me who was talking to the other parent of one of the kids They just looked and they said oh geez Susan I told you don't do that. She does that all the time. I said kids Come on. We're going back to the apartment and we're calling you whole We're going to Texas. I that that I'm not surprised having lived in New York a lot of my life It's get mayor de Blasio is returning everyone to doing that now, but when you look at there There's another interesting statistic here the crime violent crime is down since 93 Tremendously and yet public opinion polls find people constantly think crime has increased year over year Oh, maybe like keep increase First have a new cycle anyone is it is it also to do with all of the Politicians that want to convince us we need them. That's right, but there's a real irony I find when you look at those crimes decreasing that we're constantly being told we need to let criminals at a prism We're constantly be it was like the Fox Butterfield headline yet. You remember the crime rate continues to decrease despite prisons filling so Maybe maybe those have something to do with one another. Maybe that isn't a contradiction. I don't it's uh, it's interesting for me Elisha, you are probably a much more hands-off mom than I am and I try really it's a conscious decision that I have to make because I Know these statistics I mean I work in this industry We talk about it on the show and yet the thought of sending my son outside to play by himself still terrifies me But I think that it's more of a What if I am that statistic only because we hear about the bad and we don't hear about the good So while I know that it's still you know statistically speaking It's it's much less likely to happen to me I that's all that I see in the news and that's all that I see when I look anywhere And so I worry that I don't want to be that statistic still does that make sense so I I You know I and I don't want to get into it here again, but on my broadcast on September 10th this year I talked about my son who was In my home the Approached if you will by a pedophile online and only by the grace of God did we catch it and and only because you know of the security we have the way and my wife being very attentive and Found out about it at two o'clock in the morning and I will tell you You know I have literally a million dollars of security equipment in my house that the police call my house the compound I have servers upstairs with all kinds of stuff on them and if that can happen to me Right biggest danger is not in the street. The biggest danger is online. That's right. All right So Glenn I know that you have to run to a meeting so you're not going to be joining us But before you go yes before you go we wanted to highlight You're gonna give me a cake no, I don't have a cake for you. No, but we okay we the kale salad from We are in California We wanted to highlight some of your finer moments in California watch they remain puppets Puppets and they do not have sexual orientation Actually found a video of someone else of notoriety who was making the race a sign. Let's watch Oh, it's so bad here. Nobody can afford anything because of capitalism There's at one point I'm talking about you know leader hoes and in singing Adelweiss and I said so you know I dress up you know and leader hoes and then I sing Adelweiss Adelweiss which makes it kind of humorous the producers in New York, can you do that again and not sing? No Get this back on the plane I believe the person who was threatening you with that was Anthony Wiener right and I was like oh, yeah Unleash me on the wiener. There's a woman has come out on Santa. Oh, no. Yeah when Santa was in high school Oh, no, yeah, what did you rape dirt? All right, well, he was young he was athletic you know He was you know, okay. This is before he started to drink and get fat. I swear to you I swear to you dolly was raped by that fat man And I know because I'm a Charlie in the box. We are too stupid to run a country. We really we should we should just give up We really should we really should you know what America puts your tools down I think we're done as a country just just walk away I don't know if you're working the band saw you probably shouldn't be working that just put the tools down turn off the machine Let's go home Glenn back is coming live to talk about the right path forward and to make fun of the people standing in the way He might not be able to save the country But at least we can all go down laughing Glenn back live be addicted to outrage tour on tour this fall I Got a lot more to get into but before we do that I want to thank our sponsor mercury real estate Glenn actually founded mercury real estate with real estate agent side trust calm because he found that you know they were working with their realtor and They weren't really getting what they wanted. So we talk a lot about you know, I thought to myself Okay, I'm buying a home It's the biggest investment I'm ever going to make and I mean I've done this before and I for the life of me cannot remember my realtor's name Right, right. Yeah, you you use realtors you see realtors on like bus stops, right? And you sit on them and but you have no idea There's all these realtors. You could just go take a phone book and Yeah, and pick one let's say send you junk mail all the time. Yes, it's so annoying So this way Glenn actually has a team and they they fully vet all of these realtors They hand pick them. They're all people who do this full-time. It's not just like oh my sister's cousins Husbands son actually does that on the side so you should contact them out here in LA I can't tell you how many realtor actor writer producer. Yes, I know there are a lot of those because they all want the bravo show That's why they have the agent Behind their name, but yeah, so yeah, so they're fully vetted and they're listeners of the show So they share your values you can go to real estate agents. I trust calm find you your realtor today All right. Oh do we have to get into this we have to get into this. This is very important We're a really serious culture now, and that's why we have added a word to the dictionary Mary and Webster added a word It used to be for Hispanic people you'd say Latina you're a Latina Yes, if I I'm swarthy enough I could be a Latino no no more no more because that's sexist You the new word is latinx with an X and this is funny for a few reasons one the Spanish language is gendered It is the gendered Yeah, they're okay the whole thing, but the other one is it's all of these social justice warriors pushing latinx latinx And yet by inserting this Americanized Anglicized word this is cultural imperialism. We are re conquering these people yet again It is a total how to talk. Yeah, you also you're not allowed to know that's right No, you're I'm sorry your primitive little language. No, no, no, sir. It's a latinx. It also sounds so hideous That's a if someone called me a latinx. He's getting a he's cruising for a bruise. Oh, your sister latinx. Oh, don't you? Yeah, that's it that's like if somebody said that to No, I'd be like excuse you but it is it is this quest I mean, it's it's such a stupid word, but it is this quest in this culture to completely obliterate gender differences We've now been told sexual difference has nothing to do with marriage sexual difference has nothing to do with jobs That you can do even combat even being a fireman even trying to change the sexual difference has nothing to do with a You know whether or not you can have a child. That's right last I checked Even if you have a member that you weren't born with the inside still count That's right and but it's a bizarre thing in a culture where all we care about is sex I mean everyone is just talking about sex all the time transgender bathrooms this and that so we're told on the one hand sex Is the big difference that matters you should mutilate yourself if you feel like a different sex and then on the other hand All the sexes are the same. We're equally pretty aren't we the three of us? We're all I'm a beautiful beautiful young woman, aren't I? Mmm I mean I have seen you cross dress that's true many times true story Really there have been numerous times that my daughters have come to see us here at the daily wire headquarters because we have an open door policy to adorable cross house children and There have been Costumes or dresses I might have had to go on as Elizabeth Warren on occasion here and makeup Pocahontas my five-year-old Isn't it oh there's another kid here? We're the other little girl mommy because of Moana costume with hanging This man finds every excuse possible to dress up like a woman I okay, but on a especially if it's a Disney princess on a more serious note Speaking of that exposing children to that and and whatnot I and I think I told you this off air that at my child's elementary school that I just it Tore me up inside that I was gonna have to send him to public school just with my schedule And I was like it doesn't make sense to pay that much money to send him to private first grade There are two children at his elementary school who apparently are males dressing as Females this is child in elementary school. It absolutely is a poor child abuse. It's amazing You know we got rid of Custrotty the singer is you know who'd be castrated and when they were little kids We got rid of that a hundred years ago because it's it's wrong and immoral and and abusive to kids and now we're bringing it back They are shooting kids with hormones to prevent puberty. They're encouraging these sorts of delusions when I was four years old I went around my birthday party as Batman. I had the cape. I was fighting crime People didn't people indulged this for my birthday. They didn't indulge this at the elementary school This is this really does constitute child abuse It's really dangerous because where does it stop and I think I think the thing that bothers me the most is you're literally Shooting in potentially dangerous levels of hormones into pre-pubescent boys and girls It to me seems to go against everything that the Hippocratic oaths to me and we write because we don't know the long-term repercussions of that But as I mean unfortunately we do know that that one in two Transgender high school students attempts to yes Absolutely that it doesn't have to be long-term that studies that we're seeing right now and that to me one in two a heck One in one hundred is something that the scientific community in the medical community needs to take a pause Yeah, step back and say what really needs to be done here and what is the root cause of this issue Yeah, and I mean aside from that, you know what the hormones can do to your body just putting them in your body That's not from such a young age We've seen we've even seen studies that have come out that are showing that there's higher suicidal rates higher Like breast cancer risk with hormonal birth control Mm-hmm, and that's typically taken by girls in the United States depending on their situation from the ages of 15 and up And I'll just take it as a recreational drug So what would you say to your daughter let's say if she came home, right and Your middle daughter is how old five okay, so she comes in and says she goes to a Catholic School, so this is not a problem not at school, right? Okay, not at school. We are not in a better position than I am You're not even an athlete Michael wants to recruit her to the Catholicism All of us actually but let's say that it happened at a playground, you know And she starts asking questions because I find myself trying to figure out One of these days he's gonna ask me what's going on and I honestly don't know what the right answer is to tell him I think the biggest thing is it has to like with faith, right? I'm gonna talk to her about the Catholicism and how we can respect it as a religion and view those classes as kind of world history of sorts, correct? Yeah, but then if she's more detailed questions about well Why don't we believe in the Pope? I can delve into that and I think the big thing with a five-year-old is you have to talk to them at that level Yes, telling a talking to a five-year-old about somebody that's in the process of changing genders is gonna be very different than speaking to a 15 Year old about it and I think the biggest thing that has helped me in some situations because at her previous preschool there were a couple little boys that would often come dressed in a girl Disney Princess attire and Their mother did have a Hillary sticker still on her And it was well, why did they dress like that boys aren't supposed to dress like that five-year-olds? No, like they innately know that's a boy. That's a girl. This is how boys and girls dress And I just say well some people don't believe and and live their life the way that mommy and daddy do yeah Absolutely good answer.

He's coming to LA Oh my god Not only is he gonna be a Laker and I have to like full caveat The only reason we're talking about this is because I'm not a sports fan and because it involves entertainment I didn't even know who the Lakers were until I moved to Los Angeles five years. That's funny I'm like I'm what's really not like that's it. Okay, so you do like some sports. It's not NBA Boomer sooner. So no, I know now she's gonna kick me out of the studio I'm let's just cut so LeBron is coming to LA There was this big hub of where his kids gonna go to school What part of the city is he gonna live in well now not only does he want to act more in films because he's had a couple You know bit parts in rom-coms He's saying that he wants to like be acting and directing and producing oh and yesterday we all found out and Twitter was a flutter because they're going to be remaking a childhood fave of mine Space Jam Wow, oh that's a childhood the match made it happen. Oh, it's a good time to because every other executive in Hollywood is now in prison So now Family man seems to be right I do know enough about sports to know that there's always the comparison between him and Michael Jordan I'm like man. He just wants to dominate everything. He's got the fashion line. He's got the acting Isn't made that switch but now he's legitimately trying to play Michael Jordan in a seat a remake of the original I'm skeptical of how it'll go. They've apparently hired the director that directed Marvel's Black Panther, which I was a fan of the movie So it's gonna be interesting especially because he is taking numerous kind of areas by storm Obviously he's dominated in sports. I think he's been He'd be interested in politics in a way I could feel like he's kind of paving that way for himself and now the entertainment world Well if Kobe Bryant can win an Academy Award, then I guess LeBron could do perfectly well in showbiz Did you see that you know Kobe won an Academy Award last year? I saw him perform his poem that he won the Academy Award for I saw him do it live at the Hollywood Bowl a Seventh grader right I mean I not I don't want to be too mean to coat the poems that was like dear basketball I really like you basketball Love Kobe you think like all right well, I don't know LeBron is gonna be a haiku. Yeah, he's gonna be Orson Welles compared to that You know oh my gosh well See we'll see. Okay. Did you like space jam? I oh yes I love space jam and you know have you ever gone to the space jam website? No the space jam website is a hidden gem of the internet because they never updated it so on the Warner Brothers it's still the same website from the 90s Better not change that when LeBron does the remake right before we move on I just have to say I'm gonna have that song stuck in my head literally all day now. You're welcome. Oh my gosh All right, I wanted to get y'all's take on this an intersex person sued the Trump administration because passports only allow mail and female on the application and This intersex person said I I'm neither male nor female and I believe that it you know this is not fair for me and The judge ruled on it Do either of you want a guess on? What the judge? Oh, we have more can we have more clues like which state? I Have a guess I have a guess are we now gonna have? 57 options on our passports is that were 700 options it appears. That's where we're headed. Well here we go appears That's where we're headed the night circuit I know it was not I don't think but so yeah, so the judge actually ruled the in favor of this intersex person Shem you know and said that it was it was unfair because Scientifically, you know this this person is saying that They are not male or female and they would actually be lying on their passport if they had to pick one So as the person on this panel who is the man that most resembles Rachel Maddow I feel that I have some Expertise and authority to speak here. It is true I mean so we should be clear too There are people who are transgender and that means they have a psychological disorder where they think that they're a different sex And then there are people who are intersex or hermaphroditic where it's just a little unclear It's unclear as a matter of chromosomes or genitalia or whatever that appears to be this person So fair enough that he isn't clearly male or female, but he isn't Something other than male or female right? Those are the two ingredients. Yeah, right. I my heritage is Sicilian and English and Irish That doesn't mean that there is a separate race of people that is the combination of Sicilian and English and Irish I'm just kind of in the middle and it's a little ambiguous. I don't know what I put on my passport What should I put on American? I guess that it is true that there are a handful of people with this condition and Exceptions could be made for those handful of people. Yes. Why not just pick a lane. What does it matter? Why not just put on your passport? Okay, I'm a male or a female and go on living your life and to say it's it would be a lie if they were to pick one is I mean to me that's a giant stretch But that's where we are because it's about how you feel about who you are and what is your truth. Yeah, yeah Kavanaugh Kavanaugh, yes, so apparently there was a there's a clerk who says that he knows how to pick those. Oh, yes This was a female clerk a Yale law student writing anonymously in the Huffington Post said that she went in for an interview with with Kavanaugh and she was told that he Picks girls who look like a certain type or she noticed that and then maybe she just wasn't that smart I well it could have been it but in her encounter with Kavanaugh what she left This is the big bombshell is that he was perfectly appropriate and professional in cordial So that waking the nerve Kavanaugh still very unimpeachable cordial. Yes The week those how his wife has actually been handing out cupcakes to reporters and protesters on their front line No, isn't that sweet? You don't know what what's in that? Oh, that's why I would not be eating those cupcakes I was like I saw that and I was like she's a better woman than me because they're treating my husband like that. Oh Oh, man, it's it is hysterical. You know these girls speaking of this Yale law student who maybe I know I don't know I was I was there around the time that this anonymous person. Oh, that'd be interesting. Maybe it's me I Well, I hope not otherwise they're coming for me next but the the Line in here is that even all of these other Yale law students have signed a petition about Brett Kavanaugh They said if Brett Kavanaugh is put on the court women will die. I Mean I mean the obvious connection there It is really said Yale law is supposed to be the best law school in the country and that kind of hysteria You know these mainstream outlets even Huffington Post Washington Post New York Times. They're supposed to be Serious places of journalism running anonymous insinuations and nonsense. It's pathetic Meanwhile, so we're talking about Brett Kavanaugh the squeakiest cleanest guy probably walking around this continent Meanwhile the economy hits record highs Meanwhile joblessness hits record lows Everything is going so incredibly well that the Democrats to derail this confirmation hearing have to Literally invent a problem. They have to create a total fiction and then publish it to try to derail it. Yeah, and speaking of I think we have a Trump tweet I believe if we don't but he said he said Thursday's claims report He spoke about Thursday's claims report, but it showed that the number of people receiving benefits Jobless claims it hit a 49 year low That's but did you I don't think you probably didn't was in the newspaper this morning Yeah, unless you were paying attention to Trump's Twitter, which I will say a lot of people do pay attention Yeah, or Michael no a lot of people do pay attention to Trump's Twitter. However, you know, it's interesting to me that all of this all of these These statistics that show that the economy is doing really well. I don't see that at CNN I don't see that People receiving the number of people receiving benefits after an initial week of aid fell 55,000 to 1.645 million for the week ended September 10th below its level since August 1973 Wow, I mean come on. That's not your leading headline your leading headline is well the Kavanaugh accuser Has this friend who said this thing, but then she said maybe not and she wants to testify But only if you meet really subjective conditions and please don't talk about the economy Please don't talk about the economy. No, the midterms are coming up It is really pathetic, but I got to tell you something in all of this Kavanaugh stuff Typically Donald Trump would just be on Twitter means this isn't fair and as always. Yes, he's handling this so smart God Well, you know, it shows it shows that he's learned something apparently, but it also shows Maybe they've got something up their sleeves and wheelin has been writing about this He has he's a lot of Kavanaugh insiders rich Lowry said, you know, just wait until next week What else are the Democrats gonna do they've got the squeaky is totally qualified guy They have no political issue to run on not a single one so they've got to create something out of this But I think they've probably overplayed their hand. I guess we'll see you next week Yeah, all right get your popcorn ready. Thank you guys so much Second Amazing, I'm kind of sad to leave but also not really Now I heard in Texas they let you have the guns and not pay any taxes, so I'll just follow you down there I'll see you next week.
