    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks X 10 show podcast Third hour of the clay Travis and bucks X 10 show is here and we've got a lot to talk to you all about Thanks for staying with us. Thanks for joining We have a friend Rahim Kasam in the mix right now He is the editor-in-chief of the national pulse. They're breaking all kinds of new stories on a regular basis Including on the national security front Rahim my friend great to have you back Thank you for having me. What do you see going on right now? I mean just at the at the macro level with this Ukraine situation What's your take on how the West how Europe and the US have responded to this and where you see it going? Oh In trolley predictable carnage bark. I mean I have been talking about this Ukraine situation since The Madan revolution of 2014 I was actually in Kiev While that was going on I didn't have any kind of understanding or preconceived notions of what was taking place on the ground when I left London to go there But it became very apparent to me that that if we continued on this trajectory This tit for tap that we've seen over the last decade Between NATO and Russia that we would end up in a sort of conflict like this and I think it's just one of these most regrettably predictable You know end results of a failed foreign policy That's emanated from London from Washington and has resonated across the Western world for the past several decades now It's predominantly concerned with People making money. It's predominantly concerned with what we in the industry know as managed decline And that is you know sort of the very same notion that had Obama take his first foreign trip as president to Cairo and bow before the Eastern world and Effectively say you know, we're sorry And it's one of those things that is entirely predictable when you look at the last several decades of Political philosophy that is the underlying consensus that the elites in DC the elites in London have subscribed to which is predominantly Francis Fukuyama's end of history theory, right? That liberal democracy will pervade nothing can stop it and here we are now Staring down the barrel of mr. Putin's guns. I happened to believe as a matter of analysis, you know within myself looking at this situation And I wrote an article about this for Newsweek a couple of weeks ago that this will of course end with a You know prolonged negotiation a new set of treaties and a whole lot of blood that's been shed for virtually no reason So I said back then I continue to say can we just skip to the good part the good part being when people stop dying I Mean that is well said and we just got a great question as we went to break about What we think is going to end up happening when all of these people do stop dying? What does the end result in your mind look like Reheem like how do we end this conflict in Ukraine and Russia? And what is the result of the end? Look unless unless we as a as a as a as a civilization are willing to risk a Pretty pretty level of certainty behind a nuclear World War three For the sake of a non NATO member country and we can get into the Budapest memorandum if people like as well And these and these small pockets of disputed territories Then and then an end is necessarily you know coming to the table and saying right what is actually your beef? now the interesting thing about all of this where we are now and and really it reached this kind of Crescendo of nonsense a couple of weeks ago when Vladimir Putin goes out and he gives this you know long winding 90 minute setting out his stall of history and culture and ethnicity and land and Stalin and Lenin and all of this stuff and then the next day Biden stands up in front of Elector gives an equally winding but extremely short and unspecific speech that doesn't actually deal with any of the Specificity that mr. Putin raised so these two sides what I'm saying are not even speaking the same language at the moment One side is speaking real politic one side is saying hey We want this territory we believe it's ours here is our justification and the other side is pretty much putting its fingers in his ears And saying yes, but you're just a warmonger and you're corrupt and so we're not going to do any business with you Well, it's funny isn't it because the West has actually been pretty happy and some European countries especially I've been pretty happy to do extremely high levels of business with Russia over the last several decades My country especially selling football clubs property All sorts of things to the Russians for the past several decades and now here we are you know Bringing our hand saying how on earth could this have happened? You you as a nation as a civilization. We have sent mixed messages to Russia You know on the one hand you'll remember Barack Obama sort of whispering to Medvedev You know, I'll have more flexibility after the election on the other hand this posturing about how you know Russia's so small It's not a threat We don't even have to worry about it and all of those things lead to somebody like Mr. Putin Looking at the West's foreign policy and national security apparatus and saying well They don't know what the heck they're doing and that is that I fear is absolutely true There are more parallels between what's coming out of the White House today With a show like the West Wing then there are parallels will with actual geopolitical theory I'm talking about howford Mackinder Mahan all of these great geostrategic theorists who warned about You know what happens in Eurasia and the control of that landmass and why those conflicts arise and how to avoid them Well, I've yet to hear any of these geniuses in this Administration I call it a regime this regime talking about those things How do you actually bring this conflict to a close quickly and that that brings us to the other point doesn't it? Do they want to bring this conflict to a close quickly? Speaking right we're speaking of Rahim Qasam. He's editor-in-chief of the national pulse We should all go check it out. They're breaking great stories there on a regular basis Rahim I'm sure you caught this but I wanted to bring it to the attention of our audience all across the country here yesterday during a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on Ukraine Undersecretary of state for political affairs Victoria, Newland to anybody who knows who the neocons are knows From previous multiple administrations who Victoria Newland is this is in exchange I want everyone to hear with Marco Rubio and Newland and I want you to react to it play does Ukraine have chemical or biological weapons Ukraine has biological research facilities Which in fact we are now quite concerned Russian troops Russian forces may be seeking to gain control of so we are working with the Ukrainians on how they can prevent any of those research materials from falling into the hands of Russian forces should they approach I'm sure you're aware that the Russian propaganda The groups are already putting out there all kinds of information about how they've uncovered a plot by the Ukrainians to release Biological weapons in the country and with NATO's coordination if there's a biological or chemical weapon incident or or attack Inside of Ukraine is there any doubt in your mind that 100% it would be the Russians that would be behind it There is no doubt in my mind senator and it is classic Russian Technique to blame on the other guy what they're planning to do themselves Okay, Rahim just just two things here because I went a little longer Then then maybe was was helpful for because I wanted to to go into this one part of it if it's medical research That's being done. Why wouldn't she just say yeah? There's medical research, you know trying to cure cancer or whatever and if it was just medical research Why refer to it as biological research that you're concerned the Russians may get a hold of that that struck a lot of people Who are not trying to be conspiracy theorists as quite strange Well people will cast their minds back to the beginning of the pandemic when the likes of me and me were talking about this BSL for Bio weapons bio research facility in Wuhan and the level of Just flat out denial that we heard at the time that this thing was even something to be concerned about something to look into And then of course fast forward to just about a week ago When people started to raise the specter of these issues in Ukraine and the almost the entirety of corporate media in the United States Board down pressure on people asking questions questions like mr. Rubio just asked there and said this is fake news This is Russian propaganda no such things exist and then come obviously to yesterday where you have Newland Yourself saying and you're right to point out the very cagey terms that she uses there Right and you can hear the kind of stuttering and stammering and if people go and watch the video as well You see her body language when she's talking about all of these things She's very clearly deeply concerned about what is going on at these labs now We did a little bit of digging into some of this last night and we found out that actually none other than then Senator Baracko bomber in 2005 was one of the people who helped set up US aid Going to Ukraine To use the words that they use at the time in a press release to secure these facilities In case of any accidents or like we're seeing now whatever, you know conflicts and so forth But it was really interesting to us that these web pages had been taken down Over the last couple of years and we actually had to go back through the web archives to find this information Finally enough at the same time as right, you know as all of that is happening Who is nowhere to be seen that would be dr Fauci mr Fauci as I call him because he hasn't acted like a doctor over the past couple of years and he's nowhere to be seen at the moment So now the questions and the freedom of information requests will all start pouring in Where were these labs who was funding them? What research was going on there and what NIH grants if any and what NIAID grants if any we're going IE with Fauci sign off to all of these things. Yes, this is now and look I got to tell you this I when it comes to the fog of war Especially in the propaganda realm you can't believe either sides, you know the numbers are nonsense You know we've shot down four billion planes and or you know the ghost of Kiev is lurking behind every corner It's all nonsense You've got to just look through all of that and get right to the signal and the signal here again comes back to our first point How do we end up in this situation? How do we get out of this situation because for me? I said this back in November Mr. Poussin knows that this is a prolonged conflict if he wants it to be and he is now seeking to normalize conflicts in that region I would I would say that responsible people You know the grown-ups with all the grown-ups the grown-ups should be talking about How to how to you know not allow conflict to become normal in that region and in Ukraine?

You can search out my name clay Travis. You can search out bucks accidents We have not talked a lot about inflation so far today But it's not going to surprise you that the Democratic Party who has Essentially an entire party now that has never done anything in the world of business Doesn't understand how basic business works and so I got a couple of Democratic Party all-stars here Elizabeth Warren says that profit margins are Gouching the oil companies out there are gouging you here is cut 16 I'm coast boss room with senator White House and others a bill on Windfall profits tax look we get it supply and demand that prices go up But profit margins should not go up. That's just oil companies gouging when they do that So we're gonna be on him on this. I mean the lack buck and I'm gonna play where she did to leave here in a minute the inability to understand how business works is really the undergirding fatal flaw of all Democratic Party economic analysis and it used to be That there were at least some Democrats in Congress who were really highly successful business people who had a strong voice and that's just vanished and they've turned all into Socialists so that's Elizabeth Warren going after oil companies and then Congresswoman to leave Came forward and said it's not actually inflation that's going on that's seven and a half percent inflation that all Economic indicators are letting us know exist. That's not inflation according to Congresswoman to leave It's actually just Extortion listen to this as you know the pandemic has been you know Great for the richest Americans who have lined their pockets and doubled their wealth during the pandemic as we all know Corporations have the nerve to blame inflation while consolidating their market power and raising the price of essential goods and Services while working people Put the bill for me. This is not inflation. It's extortion No, it's inflation. It turns out turns out and it's yeah, you know Circle does not get the square on that one. It's inflation clay when you have economic illiterates across the top of the US government in very prominent positions people who have only ever made money by either a paycheck courtesy of the taxpayer or Essentially selling their their access their Rolodex and and their name as a result of that It tend to not really know how this stuff actually works You know gen saki and Elizabeth Warren and Not people you want to charge your business or certainly telling your business what it can and can't do and this is why inflation is attacks on the poor more so than anybody else in the country and There's still a lot of Democrats that don't understand this as prices go up For all goods the amount of profit that you're gonna make goes down because of your cost increasing So you have to increase cost as well and that's why Biden trying to claim Oh, well wages went up. I think they said 5.9 percent or 5.5 percent something along those lines for average workers according to the most recent data. Yeah, but when inflation is going up 7.5 percent that means that the average person has less money in their pocket and When the Democratic Party who actually represented working people they at least claim to understand this a little better When she's talking about all the super wealthy people Many of the super wealthy people on the east and west coast in this country actually vote Democratic and the people who end up with the biggest Difficulty are people who have to spend all of the money that they make on goods and services because they get hit harder by inflation They don't have hard physical assets. They don't own homes They they don't have land. They don't have a property to offset the overall rise in inflation And so this is a fundamental failure. Thank God I got to give him credit that Joe Manchin stood up against this buck because without Joe Manchin think about how bad inflation would be even now because build back better they would have spent trillions of more dollars Even than they've already spent it's crazy to think about how close we were to one of the biggest expansions in the history of the federal Government on top of all the COVID spending I got to tell you I'm sitting right now in an ex-chair It's the most comfortable office chair. I've ever owned. I've bragged about it enough that buck actually followed my lead He's getting his own ex chair as well. Can your current office chair give you a massage while you're working the ex chair Can can you cool up or heat up? Or cool down we got all different sorts of temperature gauges the ex chair can and it'll help support your back Thanks to their dynamic variable lumber lumbar support their dvL support You can get hooked up right now if you go to ex chair clay and buck calm now That's the letter X chair clay and buck calm a lot of you working from home right now You can also call one eight four four four ex chair hundred dollars off your order 30 day guarantee ex chair clay and buck calm plan box show going strong here gonna switch the gears to domestic politics away from Mess in Ukraine for a little bit a lot going on here at home We still need to stay focused on we've talked a bit about COVID today, but I wanted to speak about Parental rights schools and the fight over education because this is something that we remember in the last election Was critical in the victory of Glenn young kin, which was not expected. They all thought that Clinton flak Terry McAuliffe was gonna come out victorious in that one turned out not to be so because young kin came out saying schools should take the opinions and interest of parents in the education of the parents children very much into account they should Actually listen to them. It should matter and they also should be responsive to the needs first and foremost of children and parents the families that send their kids these schools not teachers unions and lazy Democrat voting adults who just want to get away with the bare minimum, which I know is not all teachers but teachers unions Do some really bad stuff and have done some really bad stuff during the COVID period here So this is turned into a a battlefield Over parental rights. That's why in Florida. They passed a parental rights bill It has been signed by the Florida senator awaits signature by governor Ron DeSantis The activists and I mean quite specifically the activists of the LGBTQ plus community Have dubbed this the don't say gay bill, which is not in any way in the bill It actually doesn't allow you to say gay Anything about sex whether it's gay sex heterosexual say it doesn't matter It's just a do not have sexual or gender identity or sexual relations instruction for kindergarteners and Pre-k up to the third grade This shouldn't be super controversial But the Democrats see an opening here based on the propaganda They're using to make it seem like they're on the side of the righteous here And it's the bigots in the Republican Party that are causing the problems. Here's chief PR lady at the White House, Jen Psaki the steps we've seen in Texas and Florida are are are deeply concerning and are having Are discriminating against exactly the kind of kids who we need to be loving and supporting And we've seen and I referenced Florida because as you know, they just recently passed a similar hateful bill That hurt some of the students most in need in terms of any legal actions I'd obviously point you the Department of Justice But I would just note that the president the secretary of education many members of the administration have spoken out about the discriminatory nature of these bills and our deep concerns about the message they're sending to LGBTQ Kids and families Papa Clay's got some thoughts. Oh, I'm fired up. This is just a lie Okay, I can't imagine There is anybody out there with a kindergartner to a third grader who believes that sex should be a topic of conversation either straight or gay sex in the kindergarten pre-k kindergarten all the way through third grade I You know, I know that we have a lot of kids that ride around in the car with their parents So I always try to be conscious of what I'm saying on the radio in some way Especially since I had young kids of my own This is just a lie fuck It's just a lie That there is in any way Discrimination going on in these bills There does not need to be any discussion of biology or sexuality in kindergarten classrooms This is this is madness right that it would be and and so what is going on here is Clearly the fear that that was occurring and some you some of you out there say well, that's crazy Did you see what I believe his name is Tom Bevan who does real clear politics? I work with my kids some in fact yesterday I was helping my first grader with his with the spelling be you know the words that he's gonna have every week that he's learning How to spell did you see the fifth grader science class words that Tom Bevan put out that his kids in public school? We're getting didn't see it. This is this is where this kind of fear is coming from this He has a fifth grade kid science classroom adolescents. Okay, you might say well, I made sense for a fifth grader consent I'm not sure that a fifth grader needs to be having discussions in his science class about consent to sexual acts That seems a little bit strange, but maybe maybe you're like, okay. They need to have that conversation. I don't personally transgender Fifth grade science. These are his fifth grade science vocabulary words cis gender I Learned that word three years ago and I had a large vocabulary I like to think buck that you and I would do very well on the SAT vocabulary test still I'm sure we did well back in the day too. I didn't even know what cis gender was and here's another one non binary fifth grade science class Does your kid need to learn? Non binary cis gender Transgender like are these science terms that your fifth grader needs to be using and again. I'm citing him This is Tom Vevany runs a high up in the running of real clear politics great website encourage you guys check it out They do a good job of presenting a variety of perspectives in the political world I use it all the time buck because you know, I'm kind of a polling nerd I like to just look and see what polls are out there different states everything else. Okay This idea that this is banning the use of the word gay is a lie It's a lie that is being spread widely and they go even further than that and this is a common tactic that you will come up against if you're having any discussion public debate about transgender issues the trans agenda This is an extension of the left speech equals violence argument. It's unless you concede to the you know the agenda the trans agenda in this case unless you concede You are forcing people to commit suicide. Therefore you are effectively murdering people you are engaged in violence This is that is actually an argument tactic that is frequently used people that I know who are on the on the front lines of this debate We'll often be told children will commit suicide because of you That's what they'll say and here is Florida State Senator Shervin Jones Suggesting that this bill will in fact increase suicide To continue to keep children more closeted It's going to put more of a sensor on teachers where teachers are as a former teacher teachers are the first responders to a lot of problems that Children come to speak to someone about so it is not going to be beneficial to to the teacher nor to to the student And let's be clear the Trevor project Did a study and come and find out that LGBTQ you are four times more likely to commit suicide Not because of this sexual orientation But it's how they are treated and that is actually the message that I was trying to convey to my colleagues in the room Yes, you can have your belief But who are you hurting in this language that you're pushing not just in Florida, but national I mean allow six-year-olds to be talked to about cisgender Rism and pansexualism and whatever else the left decides or else you're encouraging child suicide I mean clay this is this is vicious. I mean this is evil. It is vicious. It's just untrue and I Would imagine that most people out there explain that babies initially when you're talking to kindergartners and first graders and whatnot They come from the stork, right? I mean that's what I was told back in the day That's what most kindergartners and I told you guys what I learned and I thought that was true for a while Yeah, yeah, that would have been biologically Implausible almost as biologically implausible as being told that a man can get pregnant and have a baby Which is what we are sometimes told now as well And so it was craziness when I was six I think I thought I was a stegosaurus for a few days I mean, they're little kids. This is for parents and for families to handle this is not for the public Education system to dive into but you you notice the left is very bothered The same way they were very bothered by the any kind of talk about and then of course Prohibition on critical race theory indoctrination in school They're very bothered on gender identity issues For pre-k yeah, let's be a five-year-old and six-year-olds. What is wrong with these? I I give a lot of credit to my wife for summing this up Well when you're talking about six-year-olds being able to pick their gender We don't let six-year-olds pick their lunches, right? Because they would eat birthday cake for every meal if they could they would eat candy they would eat cookies They would only eat sweets if we let six-year-olds pick all of their food So why in the world do we let a six-year-old pick their gender? I mean this is this is craziness or teach them that it's normal to be picking their gender at six-year-old Biology is real. You know, I I want to start selling t-shirts on out kickbook that just says biology is real boys and girls exist You know this is this is crazy a six-year-old couldn't decide if you let your six-year-old decide We know without setting up home schooling or something. They're just not gonna go to school Yeah, child services might be called unless you set up a separate instruction If you just said all my six-year-old doesn't want to go to school You know the school the state actually will mandate instruction for children to go to school at some level But you're supposed to have six-year-old seven-year-olds who decide that they're actually not their gender And then the school is supposed to by the way all know this it's not like the school talks the school encourages it these Programs want to encourage gender transition, which is why the study out of Brown University on Rapid onset gender dysphoria Which proved by the numbers that young children who around other young children that are suddenly made a big deal of because they think they might be a girl It's usually boys transitioning to girls It they they try to bury this study because it wasn't with the narrative which is that maybe children are very vulnerable to manipulation and to psychological Imposition and that's why the parents want to have them protected and not have them subject to the whims of a school system that nobody should really trust Buck we won't let kids buy alcohol until they're 21 But we let them pick their gender before they even hit puberty and start pumping them full of drugs if they want I mean that's child abuse I mean it would be fascinating to see if you could do a study of When when when people have their first you know what let's say a 12 year old goes in and says I think you know 12 year boy goes in says I think I'm a woman I Guarantee you in every school system across the country the overwhelming majority of any administrator would would would celebrate and act like it's time to break out A birthday cake instead of saying hold on a second like let's talk this through I don't even think I think that the agenda is to push as much transition as possible for as many people as possible because that then further normalizes taking hormone therapy when you're not even Full you know not even fully physically be here and you're gonna pump somebody full of hormones This is a losing issue. This is a losing issue for the left Which is why they have to lie about it. So we stay on this folks we stay on this The more voices the better speaking up with a unified voice is helpful particularly with so many important decisions are being considered our economy our border security The insanity around vaccines and mask mandates when you're plugged into the information activities You can make informed opinions and decisions.

My good man, you know, I always like to give people a fun Engaging hopefully funny like way to send off into the into the show if you guys haven't noticed that a lot of times at the end of the hour Because I feel like and buck. I know you feel this way, too I Don't know that there's ever been in most of our lives a two-year process where there was crazier more serious stories Happening on a day-to-day basis, right? There there are lots of battles that have been fought historically In the United States, but in our lives We've been very fortunate by and large in the last 40 years or so Most of the time the things we argue over aren't necessarily seismic in nature I mean even with cove even a few years ago You could say my Michael ever Michael Avenatti and Stormy Daniels and there had that was the biggest problem in the world for like three months Yeah, so and even back, you know 20 years ago, you know, Bill Clinton having an affair with Monica Lewinsky I mean how much would people love right now instead of a war in Europe? You know political affair as the story of the day or remember when Chandra Levy disappeared That was the big story in DC. So I know we got a lot of listeners in DC and block. I was telling you this off the air There's been all sorts of craziness at the quarterback position in the NFL So I got a good sports story for you Washington first of all they changed their name from the Redskins, right? Which again it just puts other and now the Cleveland Indians had to change their names I got asked at our Houston event somebody said hey, you know you moved from sports to politics How did that happen? Jesse Kelly was asking me that at our event with Michael Barry that appreciate all you guys who came out KTRH I believe listening down in Houston and What I should have said better more succinct answer is politics just became sports and The Washington football team now the Washington I think they're the command I can't even keep top I think they're the commanders now, which is a weird name in and of itself They have traded for Carson Wentz who is You know kind of a perpetually star crossed quarterback for a long time. So The only thing that may be more incompetent than the Biden administration Is the Washington football team? So the Washington commanders now have traded for Carson Wentz so It is an epidemic as some might say in Washington DC of stupidity spreading widely all over the place Also when it meant we gave a couple of really good book suggestions Splendid in the vial if you are wanting to get into the the Churchill years when the bombings are coming down I gave the lost city of Z and you said which is a good news story and one that is pretty cool If you want to read about this endurance about the earnest Shackleton expedition they have found his boat, which is a positive cool story It's pretty well Amazing because it's you know, it's so cold. It's such cold water that they can go down two miles I think about how far down in the ocean and it's really mind-blowing and then I Brought it up, but whatever the the other book was about finding that was it the law city of the white gosh What is it called clay I could only city of God something no Monkey God no you guys are yelling the wrong ones in By the way That's the city of the monkey God. I told you it was the monkey God I got the monkey guy I have to say but there was yellow in other words By the way, we have to talk about this Spiders are infiltrating the east coast. Allie was super nervous if my wife's listening She's probably gonna drive off the road There is a monster spiders This is true that have infiltrated from Japan and they are soon to land on the east coast It's like a red dawn meet spiders is the way to think about this. They're taking over spider invasion everybody Yes, that's something else that will be playing legs. That's right We're gonna keep it all going here in the clay and buck show though. We will make sense of an insane world Stay with us friends. We're gonna be be a diving into all of it tomorrow till then Play Travis and bucks exon on the front lines of truth"
