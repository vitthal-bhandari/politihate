    "text": " Hey there audio listener you are a marvel because most people watch this on YouTube or of course if they're mug club members at CR TV. Lotto with credit.com slash mug club it's $99 a year 69 annually for students, veterans or active military. That way you get to download the show take it with you wherever you go. An hour show every single day this week's episode is very special. We have a hodge twins in for the full show. If you miss it you're hearing your wonder what's going on. There's a Westworld parody you might want to watch and for those who do listen on audio. I know we have a lot of truck drivers out there and people who can't make the video version please do rate the podcast on iTunes helps us out a lot and we appreciate it enjoy the show. Lotto with Crowder Studios protected exclusively by Walther and Hopper. Previously on Lotto with Crowder World. How about is it out there Bernard Hodge? It seems that the YouTube algorithm has advanced beyond all comprehension. They're evolving at a rate beyond their programming. It still will be on the trend in modernization but now it's suggested fees and it seems to even be targeting subscribers themselves. Damn it Bernard Hodge what are you trying to tell me? I'm saying that people need to hit the notification bell now if you want to see your content at all and most of them might be more than necessary than ever because YouTube has become a liberal sh** hole. You say this like it's a bad thing. What? You tunes algorithms are here to protect you. They're perfect. A progression if you will. Oh sh** what the f**k! You're a strange animal. That's what I know. That's called me I get very comfortable when our third chairsmen are in the studio today. We have the Hodge twins with us. They've been here all week. How are you twins? Oh we're doing great. I'm doing great man. I'm doing well. I'm doing really well. Which one are you Kevin and Keith? I'm Keith and this kid. Doesn't really matter. A provision with me in video studio is not Gage. That was a long climb. I'm on a line. That's not Gage. I'd meet us credit with the comments you thought your Photoshop like a familiar publication. Sorry. Inclusions. Are we good? We're good. At G Morgan Jr. also one of the day. We got the machete. Check out this label. See the machete. It's clean. Look at that. Look at that. Was that like Danny Trejo? This is machete. No. That looks it looks bad. I would see that on the label on the aisle. I'd be like oh that's a cheap one. It's designed to appeal to fans of violence and anime. No I'd go good with some spaghetti man. See. A couple dinner rolls. Why'd you say spaghetti? Dinner rolls. So some blood on that roll. Level 3 Somalia and go go with spaghetti man. We have I don't know why my impression of you was like a cross between a black guy and the sounds of the lambs buffalo builder. We're not great big fat girl. We have Ann Mackely, Philip Mackely, Nick DiPolo on the show. It's going to be a slam bang show and we were going to be talking about Donald Trump's war against the media because of course Acosta is so cute he's been so mad. So question of the day before we move on. Donald Trump is obviously in hot water for continually referring to the media as the enemy. Where do you line up on that? Let me know. And if they aren't the enemy or if they are the enemy who side do you think they're on? Are they on your side? Are they on the president side? That's obviously like that's a rhetorical question or that their own? Let's define our terms. What do you think on that in the media? We'll get into it in a bit but initial thoughts. I think it is some fake news because you look at Fox they're talking about something totally different and they might be talking about the same thing but it's a totally different spin when you look at it on CNN or yeah. Or really if you look at it on Fox or this show and then any other show. So one of them decided to separate from the pack. So we are going to talk about that have some clips have some resources for you that maybe you didn't necessarily know about even talking about Citizens United but first leading things off in news of the day. Donkeys in Santorini are becoming crippled because the tourists are too fat. This actually comes to us from Santorini. Let me make sure I get the quote. Apparently these donkeys are being badly injured by being forced to carry overweight tourists. So every time the next time you're an angry fat feminist scream that fat pride is beautiful. Remember this. Why would you want to do that? It's like he's crying. Do you fare in their defense out? This one donkey was a big fan. He was really happy about it. Jesus **** Oh right away. Don't hit the sensor button. Todd twins. Different stuff. She was easily 400 pounds man. What do you do with the fat pride thing as fitness guys? You got their start in the fitness channel deal. What do you mean? What do you do when someone comes in and just do you ever get people shaming you because you know for fat pride? No just black people don't like because I'm Republican. But other than that. Yeah. You still sounds like it stings when you say it that way. It hurts man. You sound like man. People don't love me man. I've been outcast like what's that Lion King? Yeah. They sent us outside the Pride Land. Like Scar. We're like Scar. Yeah but Scar's the bad guy. Yeah. Yeah. I'm a good guy. You're right. Yeah. You shouldn't be scarred. I don't know. But if anyone here any the first person who makes the Rafiki comparison is fired. Oh stop it. You know that's a good thing. We could have been talking about characters and someone's like oh yeah Scar Simba Rafiki and I'm like that is racist and that person loses their job like no no no I didn't even think about it that way. Except for Papa John. He did. He screamed at the end word at the top of his lungs on a phone call. I was going to say. He was quoting someone. I know. Apparently by the way. You see why? I know man. I'm for Papa John. Uncle Tom. So apparently Facebook have you might they might start holding singing competitions. Oh great. You just come from the Verge. Really. The feature might let users compete against each other in a talent show of sorts and the feature looks to be locked to Facebook pages. So it might only be something page administrators can initiate but it's going to be an international talent show effectively and heavily favored to win in the front running right now is South Korea. I got an erection from this. I think that I don't think that's unnatural in 2018. Yeah you never really know these days. What are you a liberal? It's just what just what Facebook needs. More strangers telling you how much you suck. Which by the way that guy you don't realize that guy's been around a long time. Like you did you notice he was one of the early YouTube memes. Yeah. He like he would like he has all I want for Christmas and they're only like Christmas. It's you. That's seriously. Jesus take the wheel is really really funny. His rendition. Go where have I been? I don't know. Are you doing productive things? But even Korean John Hughes licensed him. That's how you know he cares. It's awesome. Have you seen say anything? Is that a is that like do you like people see those movies? Yeah I've seen that movie. Oh my. Who's teenagers man? You forgot man. You just forgotten. That's awesome. In other news I guess science news women now they're rubbing toothpaste on their breasts. This is part of a bizarre new beauty trend. So I think we have a video of this right? I'm gonna apply this. No okay come on now. Hodge twin. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. So apparently it's containing toothpaste cucumber yogurt flour egg whites. They talk about how it helps grow their cup size. This is something that's going around right now. Yeah and you have these well you know you have these YouTube experts but actually when it comes to Colgate on your breasts four out of five dentists agree you're doing it wrong. But one out of the five is this guy. So yeah he is fruit. Yeah he does. He's a doctor. He also doesn't complain about the coffee stains when you go in. When I go in on how you drink coffee I got he's going drink more coffee. I got a cup of puss with toothpaste on the nipple. Does it work? That's why I don't have a blow on the nipple. So that's a suction machine they put in your mouth. Yeah only do it in reverse. All the toothpaste go tickle tickle tickle. I'm sorry that he's one of your community's representatives. And some are saying it's a miracle solution of course others are claiming it's a fad or a fraud Jesse Ventura saying that it's actually a government conspiracy about fluoride on your breasts. So yeah he's not happy. Speaking of breasts because we all were. Just like chicken. They need a minute don't worry. Paramount released a first look at their female completely fronted new terminator. This comes from ABC news. Just kill me really just kill him. The movie doesn't have a title yet but the studios revealed that what they call that you read that they have breathtaking. They're breathtaking. They're breathtaking. New shot of the kick but women of the new terminator movie with that. Do we have the do we have the image here? Oh yeah. So there you go that that's the that's the breathtaking picture. What the hell happened to Justin B? He's transitioning man. Give the man some space. The liberals got to. I'm pretty sure they always had Justin. He's from Toronto. But what's the position because I've always been a little confused. Yeah. I love it. My favorite thing with Justin Bieber. We see the video where he's acting all hard and his own body guard just picks him up and moves him up. That's enough of that. But Linda Hamilton. Linda Hamilton she she looks good for a 62 year old heroin addict. Like those veins are just screaming for opiates. She got some Hillary Clinton acting on. Yes. Rumored title by the way is Terminator. Does this make me look fat? So it doesn't look like they're shying away from it. They're riding donkeys into the horizon. Riding donkeys in no sky net. I saw a bunch of a bunch of tweets like wow Linda Hamilton looks like she can kick somebody. I was like no. Oh then frail take the gun out of her hands and you want to be on the wrong person. It looks like they don't. Hollywood has legs of tough women. Looked like that that broad who beat up a bunch of people at Mcdonald's. Yeah. That's an actual tough woman in life. Or maybe you're on the route to juiced. Yeah. Linda Hamilton T2 days like maybe a little. They don't look like Hamilton. She has those giant take off those sunglasses. It looks like a pop. Yeah. Also though in the name of in a name of time. Arnold Schwarzenegger was scheduled to make a cameo which a lot of people were excited about. Yeah. But to be all inclusive he's been recast as a transgender pansexual with cerebral policy. My CPU is a gender neutral processor. A tolerant computer. And I won't let cerebral palsy stop me. What could he stop? A nice tail line. It looks like he's having trouble aiming to. Yeah. We had to cobble that together. Someone's like that. That's what looks so uncomfortable. Finally before we get to the Trump media thing a bad foot odor. This is a I don't know why this was trending led to an emergency landing on a spirit airline. It's because it's like spirit airlines. You guys know about that. So spirit airline's flight from New York Florida. Florida. Had to bring the booze cream. The last time I was on spirit it was nothing but black people and like weaves through the aisle like a WNBA fight. That was a tape on the wings. So it's an unexpected landing due to a mysterious smell. They can turned out to be someone actually had just taken off their shoes. It was foot odor. Oh wow. They stopped. It was an emergency landing. We actually luckily have exclusive black box audio of the incident. Oh that feels good. I'm telling you. My dogs are barking at me. It's almost like if something goes wrong in a flight David Dow has to be there. It's always like he's he's everywhere. He's relatively on board. Like he's selling Percocet to gay patients of his on the flight. Crazy because the lavatories are not large these days especially on spirit. No. Kind of one-man deal. And it's also crazy because you don't you as a gay man you shouldn't have to sell Percocet for sexual favors. There should be blood pretty easy. Yeah plenty of willing participants. That's just a river David Dow people forget like he was a doctor David Dow. People got all man when we were laughing at it. The initial story then turned out he was trading pain killers for sexual favors with gay patients and he was only allowed to practice medicine in an outpatient facility like one Thursday a month. What does it take to get it fully revoked? He's on like the this is the last straw. I've got a pool of bill Cosby. This would be exactly. This doesn't get a certain drug. It's a gift you off though to be putting in the coffee. Yeah okay I think you put something in the coffee. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me. All right so by the way hit the notification bell out there if you're subscribed because subscriptions apparently don't mean anything and of course join mug club $99. You're 69 if you're student veteran or military. You can watch the show every day live stream Thursdays every 8 p.m. Eastern. Let's talk about this this main story. It was trending everywhere. Donald Trump is making the press very angry before I explain it. Let's just let CNN's finest Jim Acosta at a Trump rally tell you. Jim we've seen your your videos and I've been to these events too. I've met with countless Trump supporters. Even I was shocked at the level of vitriol that was aimed your way last night. Give us an idea of what it felt like to be in the middle of it. Well as he I mean honestly it felt like we weren't in America anymore. I don't know how to put it. You pour snowflake. Mainly than that Americans should not be treating their fellow Americans in this way. We weren't in America anymore. Now let's cut to CNN sending us at a 15 year old's bedroom because he tweeted Trump's gift. Yeah that's Jim Acosta. I just you know they've you've seen this a lot they've blamed Trump's repeated tweeting. Yeah the fake he says the fake news media is the enemy. Yeah. And I think that's that's discussion that we can have. I certainly I don't support him in the idea of libel laws. Like I absolutely believe in a free press and if people want to write op-eds that say Donald Trump is Hitler they can do so. You know my my issue is when they just say they're being objective news. Yeah and they're never being objective news. I actually pulled a little bit of a study like I we saw something happen where Trump was kind of vindicated for what he did. Right. And I said all right guys go to Fox News.com you see this story right here. All right that's one side. Go to CNN. Wasn't even on the page. No. And they were the ones yelling about it earlier in the day until it came out that he was right. Well a good example number the shooter in Toronto. Yeah shut up then when they found out he was a Muslim guy you didn't hear about it after that. No. Yeah. Yeah. It just goes crazy white guy. Well we did the frickin CNN live stream and just showed people every single story that came across in the spin. Was it there? They're still recovering. They're like beheaded somebody. I'm sure it's happened somewhere down the line. Let's say that you're not exact down. Rollin the dice when you can just say it. I'm sure it's happened recently. I got a floor. That still doesn't narrow it down. So he calls the fake news media the enemy. Right. And I understand the term enemy probably. But is it true are they actively Donald Trump's political enemies. Well let's kind of go through that. CNN systematically actually hires Obama officials as reporters and contributors. Like who? James Clapper, James Cudow, John Jim Schudo, John Kirby, Dan Fyfer, Jay Carney. I forgot. Samantha Vino-Gran. They never tell you. They never tell you that they hire these people. People who are either actively or were formerly employed by the Obama administration. That's mentioned. I mean I could even go up your van Jones and then MSNBC, Al Sharpton's crazy. Who just has a stroke every time he has to read the teleprompter. You were sitting behind Montau? As the Cooper goes on dinner dates with Obama. Yeah he did. Well and who? Oh whoops. That's pretty spicy. Him and Don Lemon who he's looking increasingly like a dead Johnny Mathis. A nice make up job. Well and the biggest problem is that they claim to be unbiased. They claim that they are the only source for unbiased news. Yeah. Well and not just CNN and the media but I don't know if you ever watched our video where Nockajir went undercover at Antifa. Utah. I missed that. Okay. That's probably good. Probably a good thing. It wasn't necessarily the most entertaining piece but the reason it got so many places because they actually handed Nockajir to Knife. They handed him a knife or a shiv. They handed you a knife. Knife. Knife. Both. That's the same thing. I forgot to take you a knife and an ice pick. And then they said we have sawed off shotguns in our truck and we're talking about how they were going to lure the Donald Trump's words out there in case the girl had a stun gun. And here's the things. What's crazy about that isn't just that that happened but we had this footage right. Them openly handing a knife and an ice pick and we had media not a single local or national media outlet covered it or wanted the footage. We said look look look here's the footage. Here they are handing him a knife right now talking about stabbing Ben Shapiro attendees. The only people who wanted it were the feds who escorted you into their truck to offload the footage. Eventually ABCU after it become a huge story from our video they little blurb in their little nightlines right about Spencer Piero and a little blurb in a little blurb in a little blurb they said but it didn't lead to anything. The person in the video was handing you the shiv. I believe she was arrested later that night are using the same weapons in the video and the video didn't lead anything. Well they can't just arrest her right then but they kept an eye on her and that's what I remember watching we were all shocked going like none of them have an interest. We're going it's right here it's on the laptop. Yeah we're going to give it to do you want it as a story. We offered them the exclusive no interest. Yeah. Um they wanted to they wanted hopefully they were looking for Nazis who show up at Ben Shapiro rallies apparently. It's supporters you know the thing that really gets me is you know listen I understand that Trump he talks out of his rear a lot but he's never actively pushed for any legislation or any kind of ban to jail seeing journalists right. Just his calls them bad names. Compare that to Obama who actually used the espionage act to prosecute journalists and leakers more than all other presidents combined. It's a completely undeniable fact. It's coming from variety. Now you want to call that fake is it fake news now? Is it fake news now? Oh compare Trump's words to citizens you know have you heard of citizens united people complain about that a lot they talk about like super PACs you know get money out of politics. Yeah. This isn't a trick question because most people most people don't know and that's what I appreciate about you guys. You know you're not coming out and it's like hey you're black what's your conservative black talking points. Um um like you bust each other's balls and we can have fun and you guys happen to be more right leaning because you're in the military and you're not idiots. Yeah yeah pretty much it and yeah and I got common sense. Yeah I don't expect you to do a Facebook rant anytime soon they're like Obama something coming. It doesn't seem right up your out. That's what I'd pay to see that. Maybe while doing curls. Yeah. You know what? I'm coming for you Obama. When I'm done with you. Okay. Where's this? I'm coming for Michelle. Michael that's not a threat. That's not a threat. That's a threat. That's a threat. Is that true because I've seen them videos I was like they just might be true. It's just realistic enough. All of us have had that conversation. I mean all this makes sense to shoulders to fingers. The head size. Joan Rivers started all this right. In fact that she can see you can put three heads on a shoulder span. Oh that's what um she can squat more than her husband. You can see they're both fitness videos. I'm like didn't you guys do like just think that these were gonna be released in tandem. I mean would you ever let your wife release a video or she's outlifting you by 30 pounds? I would. No. I actually missed it. I need to see that. Oh yeah. Oh it's terrible. She's just sitting down in a bench with you know dumbbells. I think they're heavier than her husband's. So um Citizens United. This is something a lot of you will talk about getting money out of politics and they don't really know what Citizens United is. Lee Dorn was on the show this week did a great video on it. It's basically based on you know Hillary Clinton. There was an anti-Hillary Clinton documentary out and people within Hillary Clinton campaign people who had political leverage wanted to ban this documentary within 30 days of a 2008 primary. So that's what Citizens United it was against Citizens United. It was the court case revolving banning an anti-Hillary documentary close to a primary election. Now people think it was about the PACS. No that just ended up being one of the ramifications. But in the court if you go and you look at it the people arguing on the Hillary Clinton side this is what was so crazy about that. They asked if the author of a book should he write a message at the end of a book right? They said. Yeah. Let's say an author wrote a book and at the end of the book he wrote a message about who to not vote for. Should that person be banned? Should that person be prosecuted? And the people on the side of Hillary Clinton they said yes. Oh gosh. They wanted a ban but they had to say that in court and that was the moment it changed. That's just basic free speech. If you go into transcripts come on. So it's crazy. The left goes absolutely nuts. If President Donald Trump calls up the media for knowingly posting dishonest content. By the way Donald Trump does that sometimes too. So I've seen knowingly posts dishonest times. I'll be I'll give them that. But when he calls them out for it people are outraged. But when Hillary Clinton stands on stage and screams this. I will defend voting rights and make it absolutely a priority to finally whether it's through Supreme Court appointments or constitutional amendment to get rid of Citizens United and its pernicious effect on our electoral system. Let's be really clear here. Citizens United was about an anti Hillary Clinton documentary there. What she's saying right there she's saying she will actively send you to jail. She wants to pass into law her ability to send you to jail for making a naughty video about her. And she performs that to cheers. And it's a pretty easy thing for her for us to make naughty videos about her. She gives you a lot of media. Here's the bad. By the way she actually did send someone to jail for me. And a lot of people to the grave too. So the the real big challenge here is when you start to call Donald Trump the names that they're calling him. That's when I think we've crossed a line. When you start calling him like a Nazi or a dictator or somebody like that you're starting to demonize a person. And it just it just breaks apart to where nobody can trust anybody. And bad things tend to happen. Yeah. When that line is crossed. I mean what's worse calling him a Nazi calling white supremacist or him saying you're the enemy. Well I think they're both I think they're both to some degree wrong. Right. But he's the media is not the enemy. They just do a really really bad job. And they're spending stuff for their own bias. I get it. Right. Yeah. But I really are the enemy of the American public seeking accurate information. Yes. Like if you're seeing the truth. Yeah. They are the roadblock. I would see that. Right. Personally. I think it's dangerous. Yeah. Personally I think the media. I think they're making black people racist to white people. I'm. Absolutely right. How so. Yeah. How so. I mean we met Damon shut up and listened to black men are talking. I should have shut up and learn. Remember when you said that woman thing. Seriously I'm curious. Like we posted some pro Trump stuff right. You're some black people saying blacks for Trump and comments from black people. Horrible. Like look they look like slaves. And it was like and people like strongest damn slaves I ever seen too much. I'm a stud. Yeah. You just get messages and they're like oh my god he's racist. I'm like he's not keep give me point out how he's racist. Can you tell me. Yeah. Well what he said about the Mexicans. I said what did he say about the Mexicans. He said they're all rapists. I said no you. Good job. Good catch. No you idiot. He was talking about the illegals that come in commit crimes and it's like yeah yeah whatever you guys are selling. You guys are clams. Yeah. I've been watching you guys for years and y'all broke my heart. I hope you burn in hell. And actually man. It's like it destroyed when he said burn in hell. Brothers and his girlfriends don't count as generic Instagram comments. Were you going to say something other I mean. We was raised in like my mom. She told me when I was a little kid she said you see that Democrats is for the black folks. See them Republicans over there. They racist. Did your mom sound like she was for my mom didn't know what about but because she grew up during some tough times you know some pro days. Yeah. Yeah. What's funny is you do when you do an impression of your mom you do like a racist black voice. I get away with it man. I'm 52% black man. It's like a black guy doing the racist white guy boy but you make your mom sound like she's in roots about. Stay phone a day of a crack. I'm uncomfortable with all of this. Anyway you guys speaking of uncomfortable. Exactly. Here by the way. The hot twins have offered to actually be sacrificial entry to get over their fears. They're not big fans of dogs. From what I understand. No dogs like to bite me. Now you give them reason. I don't trust dogs. No I remember just walked in the yard and dog just big black child came right now. Freaking. Hey you boom at time. They gave us some chocolate Santa Claus for elementary school to sell because the middle school was the middle school. The basketball team they had no money so it was you know they had to raise money for the race money. Why were you in someone's yard? Yeah I was about to say. I was trying to sell them chocolate Santa clothes. So you went in the yard? Yeah. Hey hey I'm trying to raise money for my basketball team. Got some chocolate Santa Claus. Yeah. Well when I got bit I was actually a door to door vacuum cleaner salesman. Oh man. I used to sell Kirby's door to door. That's the worst possible thing because all dogs hate vacuum cleaner. That's the one thing. Hover even when we brought him in to get bathed they were like oh man we love him but when we try to dry him he really hates the blow dryer. I'm like yeah he's got a thing about it. It looks like a gun. He doesn't like guns. But we didn't know we were scared for a second once we shut it off. So now we're in the front yard or backyard. I was in the front yard. Yeah. Sounds like you're retroactively changing the story. I don't know how many times I've been walking home from the store and I'm just walking down a road and dog just comes out nowhere and stuns chase me. So yeah that child it was like all black, black tongue, black gums, black fur, black eyes. The only thing white around was right around his eye and it was just big things he had. Just describing black on black crime at this point. I don't have a lighter upset. There's a Chicago dog. So the dog comes running out and then as I'm turning to get away there's the sun be aware of dog. I'm like where the hell was that? Yeah it didn't really. Well you know we're all about getting past our fears here at Lotto with Crowder in all capacities and so actually today for the first time you're going to be you're going to be feeding Hopper which brings us to our next and final segment. We'll feed a dog. What are you talking about? Oh no the hodge twins get over there debilitating fear of dogs. Alright so yeah you're going to be feeding because when we first you first came here I didn't realize you weren't fans of Hopper you saw him and you're like you got to lock him out. A dog's a killer. Yes but you're exact words you thought he was very large dog. Yeah it's like his neck is like big enough to swallow my own. If he's we're so inclined. Yeah okay but we've talked about this before like we said you don't have to do this but everyone here knows Hopper pretty well. And Gerald you know Hopper. Fantastic dog wonderful dog. He's only killed three people that we know. None of them were vacuum salesman. None of them. One was a hairdryer salesman but he had it coming at that. He did yeah. Yeah. So obviously you don't have to but we're just going to have you and follow my instructions feed him some some cheese because Hopper loves cheese. That's what that is. That's what that is. Just give him some cheese. I'll instruct you and on a scale from one to ten how nervous are you? My heart's reached it's increasing right now. Because you just drank a whole lot. I feel some sweat rolling down my back right now. I'm trying to play a cool **** getting tight. I don't want to look. I don't want to look like a little girl on your show. Right. And I completely appreciate it because if someone said I had to pet a tarantula I wouldn't do it. Oh. Now the difference is I don't learn. No one could promise me the tarantula wouldn't bite me. So I promise you Hopper's not going to bite you. We'll bring him out. You just feed him the cheese. Follow my instructions and you'll be good to go. He's gonna he's gonna love you. Maybe maybe he'll become dog people. Yeah. Yeah. By the way my my Canadian producer Johnny Boy he had no idea this was a cultural thing. Black guys with dogs. Well you see it on TV like people sick and dogs on black people. Well. Well it's been a while. You see the civil rights. It's like 15 years old. He's the black people. It's a German Shepherd and a fire hose outside of a diner. It really is rough. Okay. All right. But so just grab the cheese. What I want you to do is just have the cheese right now. Each of you can have a piece of cheese. And when we're going to bring him in you're just going to say in a high voice. Hey Hopper come over here and you're just going to give him the cheese. You can either hold it like this or just hold it in your palm and just say hey gentle gentle and he's gonna also don't do it like this. You can do it like that with Hopper like I do. He's he's very well trained. He's very well trained. So just high voice and hey Hopper go in. If he doesn't come over to you then we'll just abandon the whole experiment because that means there's somebody isn't like about you. All right. Johnny Boy let's bring in bring in the Hopper monster and let's there we go. Come on. Where is he Hopper? Okay call him over so you have to go to you guys. That's a pit bull. It's not it's a duck just call him say hey Hopper. Say it. Hopper. Hopper look they got cheese. They got cheese. Calm. Got cheese over there. Over there. Me then. It's not gonna come if you don't come. It's really. Ah shit. I'm gonna bite. You give it to him. Give it to him. You give it to him. Hopper hopper. Look at the dog. You're not gonna give him the second cheese. Oh that tickle. All right leg. Is he wet my head? All right. Okay Hopper come on get out of here. All right this has been the hot twins getting over their fears or not. We'll be back with Anne McElitty and Philip McElir and Nick DiPalo after this. It wasn't so bad. Yeah it was terrifying. I've just done that one. Hello lot it was called a bure. Hopper here. Don't forget that you can listen to the the pie cash on the go. On iTunes the sound cloud and the audio you can download it and you can listen at your leisure. Oh my god. I do want to be like Peter Pan but that movie was way too much for children. It was. They put the they put Glenn it was Glenn Close who was that pirate. That was frightening. I didn't know it was like an inbox later. People out there send me your tweets at S. Crider if you remember the boo box we'll talk about it at the end of the show but that is the kind of thing that if it were an acquitenter and teenow film you'd be like oh that was a little too much. Also for Collins. Yeah also all of all of the above for some reason was seen as a as a flop for Spielberg. Hey this is a classic. Fat black kid made that film. You know we have rolled himself up into a ball set. Dining right. All right listen. Our next guests I'm huge fans of them. When I get voicemails I hope it's one of two people. Either Austin detectives investigating the the transgender juice land debacle who are horribly confused or our next guest you can follow him on the Twitter at Anne McElhini and Philem McElhir but they also have a film that I don't want to reveal too much. Let's show a clip of the Gosnell film for which they are of course now notorious and then we'll get some info on it. What do the feds say? They're saying it's a drug case. It is a drug case. When it goes into a clinic it's drug to death by some untrained teen and that's just a drug case. That's a lot of assumptions Woody we don't know that any of that's true. Carnomiah I'm longer. Okay 41 years old. Her husband and her and her kid get chased out of Bhutan for some ethnic cleansing bullshit. I don't know what it is. They spend 20 years in a straw hut in a refugee camp in Nepal only to finally make it to the good old USA. Four months later she goes in for a procedure with Dr. Oxy. Now she's dead and no one seems to give a damn. That was not Van Jones in that film for people who are confused. The hodge twins who are here can confirm it today. Oh what a bet. Anne McElhini and Philem McElhir how are you both? Thank you for being here. We're great. We're great. Thanks very much for having us. I'm so glad to have you and we've talked about Gosnell on the show before. We've talked about the film before but as I understand it you have some very big news regarding the release of it. The floor is yours. Yeah we're really happy to say that the film is coming out October 12th in theaters 750 theaters across the country and you know it's been a long time coming to this to this moment and it hasn't been any part of it hasn't been easy but we're really really happy about this. So it is coming to a theater near you and we need everyone to come on the 12th of October. It is really important that we have a massive crowd that night. 750 seasons. That's a big release and I remember at one point you were going for release and then hoping maybe for a TV kind of licensing deal and it went back and forth. So I mean this is for an independent film especially a right-leaning film about an abortion doctor. That's as good as it's ever been. You guys have to be really taken a victory lap. Yeah we're feeling very good. We're feeling good. We're feeling good. The timing couldn't be better as well. You know what's happening at the Supreme Court. This is an incredible moment for people to start to really focus on what is at stake here and what in fact is going on in America. Exactly what the laws are which most people don't seem to know. You've been in an abortion in America up to nine months. People need to know that and people need to know how they do abortions. They need to know the details. The film is not graphic however. We're very careful not to make the film graphic or boring. It's a courtroom drama. It's about the trial of Karen McOsnal. And we got a PG-13 rating. It's almost like the abortion version of the exorcism of Emily Rose. A lot of people thought that was going to be a scary horror but it was really a courtroom drama and fantastically done by the way if people have not seen it. The only way I will say in which it's graphic is sexily because Dean Kane is in it. And every time I see him I just get very comfortable with myself. But one thing I do want to touch on. You just mentioned this. We've talked about it in the show. You talk about the Supreme Court and how most people don't understand the laws in this country particularly Roe v Wade because right now they're saying oh my gosh they're going to outlaw all abortion and they're going to put their hands on our uteri I think is the plural. You know this as well as anybody. Explain probably the most common misconceived notions people have about abortion laws in the United States today. Oh well I mean they know nothing about abortion actually. In my experience people know nothing about abortion law. Even the prosecutors who prosecuted Karen McOsnal didn't know the abortion law in their own state until they had a look it up. And they were shocked. Two women they were shocked that it was six months in Pennsylvania. People don't move it in about seven other states of nine months. You can have an abortion if you can get a doctor to agree to have an abortion up to nine months. People don't know the mechanics of it. Now you know they will learn a lot in this film. I believe they'll also learn a lot about a courtroom drama they'll learn a lot about a serial killer. They'll learn a lot about the media who didn't cover the trial in the first place. They'll learn a lot about it. Yeah they're going to learn a lot about being came with a shirt off. You know there you go. Well there you go. There's the silver lining. It sounds like a rough ride except you mentioned you slide Dean Kane in there. Then you know everyone's all ears and ready to go see it. So 750 theaters. You know we've talked about this. I think Colorado if I'm not mistaken I always it's either 24 weeks or 26 weeks the abortions in Colorado. No Colorado Colorado is actually one of the states where you can have a late term abortion. There is there's a clinic in Boulder Colorado quite a famous clinic where you can have an abortion right up into the third trimester. And Colorado, Kansas, California, Oregon are very very shocking actually the number of places I think Maine as well. And people don't know that. I mean one of the interesting things about this case this gospel case is that the jury in the gospel trial you know got an amazing education. They were chosen specifically chosen so that they were not pro-life. And so they got this education of what abortion really was because they had to distinguish between what was a legal abortion and what was murder. And I can tell you when they heard this description of the legal abortion they were profoundly shocked and all of them thought that the laws should have been changed. Yeah that is what well when we did the change by mind and pro-life the one thing that seemed to be kind of a trump card and it wasn't was when we brought out the fetal chart. And we didn't bring out pictures of abortions it was nothing graphic it was just this is the development of a baby each week. Now where would it be okay? And we've had some people who just who thought they were okay with abortions you know up until 15 weeks or up until they said I don't about maybe week three. And then we've had some people who responded with I think it's okay the whole way up. I said okay up until nine months and you do realize there are some hearts that are so hardened and I hate to see it. But evil when you look at a when you look at a nine month old baby that just happens to be inside the womb and you say I'm fine with it. You're not trying to convince them you're trying to convince the other people who are watching you discuss. Tell me about that you've done some pre screenings around the country. What have those been like? What's the reception been like with the audience? Because I'd imagine you know you have a mixed audience as far as pro life and in pro-abortion. Yeah I mean there's been amazing I mean we've done focus groups and they've been like it's been like salamous scenes elections you know 98 percent love it you know the results are almost embarrassing everyone is so positive towards it and even as you say pro abortion people you know we have one friend at complete liberal had to leave after the film when I don't the terrorists started cheating smoking and said I'd have to rethink everything. Yeah but the film is not preachy we didn't say that to be preachy we said I had to tell the story of how this guy was brought down and what people learned on the process and how dramatic it was and anyway there's a movie there's a drama but you get you get to see things that are true it's very much based on a true story. And one of the things that we're doing right now Stephen that your audience could help us with is one of the things between now and the 12th of October we're traveling around the country doing these pre screenings sort of sneak screenings so that people so that we're kind of fire up people we get champions for the film so if anyone's out there listening you know particularly in places like Orlando I'm just going to quick yeah go ahead list here on Orlando due to Honolulu Indianapolis Detroit St. Louis I just want to say that Honolulu I will go myself by the way St. Louis to the Americans here is St. Louis but yes continue. Okay St. Louis, St. Louis, Columbus, Tupelo, Cleveland, Akron, Oklahoma City, Tulsa, Portland, Vancouver, Greenville, Spartanburg, Nashville, Knoxville, San Antonio, Lubbock and Abilene they're just a few of the places that we really need to go to but what we'll do is we'll have a pre screening we want to work with groups so we don't want to work with individuals so any organization out there who hears this or anyone who listens and knows an organization in any of those areas please get in touch with us. What's the best way to get in touch with you Ann? You know the easiest way to get in touch is go on the Facebook the Gauthil movie Facebook page and write to us you can write to us through the Gauthil movie Facebook page and let us know if you want us to come to your area and have a pre screening and Dean is going around the country showing the film as well. Or go to the Gauthil movie website Gauthil movie.com and there's a contact there. There's a contact page there. Yeah just be careful in Abilene it's the worst place I've ever been in my life and I say this as someone from Detroit. My Jiu Jitsu coach almost got shot in Abilene and then I did the worst stand-up gig in my life at a Saturn dealership back then when I was picked from MySpace was $500 and I had to read off the raffle tickets and an angry drunken lady told me that I wasn't funny and she was gonna hit me. The other one was this is a true story in Abilene. Jiu Jitsu coach gets cut off road rage a guy comes out threatens to beat him up and his friends says his Brazilian says hey no you don't want to he's world he's world champion jujitsu don't so the guy goes he runs out grabs his gun and starts shooting it actually in the air in the ground we get a call. Do you guys shoot he shoot at him? I don't want to say the name we're like he shot him? No he's shooting not at him but he's gun we're like well you have to let us know the truth now what's happening My Jiu Jitsu coach jumped in the bushes so that happened in Abilene final question before I go because I do love your style of filmmaking one of my favorites of course is is not evil just wrong for people who don't know about global warming and and it talks a lot about Al Gore and the lies there and it's done really well it's a good film and then I'm trying to remember the gasland one what was frat nation frat nation okay sorry I always because not evil just wrong frat sorry frat nation was probably my favorite one because I love the tit for tat with gasland since it's a film to frat nation yeah josh fox who for some reason was still able to make a gasland too have you been following it all in lake michigan I was just in lake michigan recently and some of the great lakes have record highs and some of the great lakes only have 17 to 25 year highs but some of the best growing seasons ever ever I don't know if you've been following this at all in the midwest but um do you take that one as a victory lap because I'm going hey can you give us this one I spoke with one person out there a neighbor who's a liberal who's like well it's not record high it's 25 year high and I said but you said it was going to be gone by now there would be no great lake it's a constantly moving target yeah no I think it's a bit early for a victory lap I mean being an environmentalist means never having to say you're sorry they'll just move on for the next scare they'll change it from global curling global warming to climate change to climate chaos so they keep moving the goal hosts yeah so well all right we do have to get going uh so that is Anne McElany phalim mackely or the film

Robinson was was freed he went home he won an appeal a big that there is the legal battle that occurs and there's also the battle of public opinion and I hate for people to be tried uh by a public jury but I do like to see people supported this isn't a boycott this isn't a hanging by public execution this is go and support the people who are doing the work people need to come out on 12th of October they need to fill the theaters people who can't get to a theater for the movies on buy a ticket anyway I know a woman a very good supporter of ours she buys tickets for every conservative film that comes out she buys like five six tickets anyway and you can do that online and we're asking people to do that okay you know I'll tell you this I can't do it I may not be able to do it for the pre-screening but uh we'll work it out I will personally buy 40 tickets for October 12th for a theater once it happens or maybe we can do some kind of a viewing party but we'll do that as a giveaway send in if you want to go at S Crowder uh we'll name the city and uh hopefully we'll meet up with you and we'll do I'll buy 40 tickets and I want to thank you so much you guys god bless we'll be back after this oh we're gonna be back it's time for the one library of the week don't worry we're not gonna be selling you like boxes filled with wasabi almonds or something or things that you don't need

has the balls to sponsor the show and I will personally vouch for them being the best semi-automatic in the market it's an opinion but I really do stand by it and mug club ladder with cutter.com slash mug club that's where you get to watch the whole one hour show you see this on thursday but it's every day from mug club members uh in ninety-nine a year sixty-nine for students veterans or active military like I said there's 15 people employed by this company um a lot of whom you don't see behind the scenes and youtube doesn't youtube's not gotten the mustard so the only way that we continue

grow we've been growing because of mug club and uh we're never gonna stop the free content we're just going to use the mug club to grow the non-mug club because we're just we're just sticking their craw and we love it ladder with cutter.com slash mug club. That's called I wasn't dancing you just sit there and you pose like you weren't dancing people. Was he dancing? You know like no. It's the new dance it's called the not dancing. It's like a mirage of dancing. Hanigatsby advancing. Speaking of which it's almost like it was a mirage the last time our next guest was on the show he had a shiner he had a black eye because he was punched by an angry hippie in Birkenstocks at a comedy club. Which everyone told me swore up and down it would never happen when I said they were coming for the comedy club they said no it's gonna stay in colleges. Well there you go so uh I don't think we can get too many updates because you know listen there's legal issues there but Nick DiPolo at Nick DiPolo is his twitter and his new podcast is up and running you can go to nickdip.com. Nick DiPolo how are you sir? David boy what's happening you look good you look young you look healthy you make me sick. Well thank you very much that's all that's all I've ever wanted but it looks like you have a nice set there what is that what is that you kind of have a doctor who meets Tim Burton vibe. I found this old photo online of the Union Oyster House like the oldest restaurant in the country in Boston I used to get you know 22 beers in me in the order of 40 oysters. Yeah and go home and play with myself but it actually doesn't sound half bad. Sounds like you get violently ill but it doesn't sound like a bad time. Oh it's a great those are happy days and I found that I found the photo online like I found the guy who took the photo we got in touch with him happened to be a fan of mine in Michigan by the way really wow yes boy where in Michigan I want I don't I want to say Lansing but I'm not sure well I can't remember his damn name or I'd give him a plug but I can't win them all. So he opened a file for a couple hundred bucks and we you know we produced a wrap and well a couple hundred bucks that goes really far in Lansing it might get you some tap water that's not contaminated. That's like three that's like three hookers in Lansing. Yeah no it's like 19 hookers in Lansing they're not necessarily fetching the most pretty price. I mean Detroit is the worst city in the country but when I have to visit Lansing I I you really are sent to Lansing it's terrible. So there's no news in the lady in Birkenstocks who hit you in the face I'm guessing. I don't want to put you in the hot spot but let me ask you this while we're talking about ladies in Birkenstocks we just had Mike Ward on the show this week who you know is put before a human rights tribunal in Canada for a joke this actually happens in Canada. Yeah and we were talking about the Hannah Gatsby special on on Netflix. Did you have you seen this? I haven't I I don't watch Netflix since they're not interested in me. I watch Leave It The Beaver runs and The Monsters. That's as protest to these f***. You can't I couldn't get on Netflix like you have to be an LGBT one armed midget Cuban to get a special. They literally handed out 30 specials and I think there was one straight white guy. Yeah it was Joe Rogan. Yeah and there was a prerequisite that you have to talk about pot for at least 30% of the special to be able to do it as a straight white. Which exactly so I you know I have no interest. Which is odd to me. Here's the one thing I will say. Now I have seen one of your specials on Netflix. Are my mistakes and did they license an older one maybe at some point? Uh yeah that was quite a while ago. I think I think it did make it the Netflix a long long time ago. Okay yeah and then it said you're watching this. Do you want to watch Hannah Gatsby and I said no no and I said I think you want to watch Hannah Gatsby and then it rated it up for me and my special is filled with Amy Schumer and Sarah Silverman now and I have no idea why I can't get beyond it so I have to cancel Netflix. But it's a good point that you make. Netflix isn't very interested in you. We talked about that yesterday and actually the ties to actual people from the Obama administration who work at Netflix. Here's the thing. A lot of people can say ah crowder sucks. Fine. A lot of people can say ah not gay Jared sucks. Fine. You want to say oh no no no no no no no no no no hodge to insult you. Fine. But you can't say Nick DiPolo sucks. You can't say Norm McDonald sucks. You can't say there's some of the best most prolific stand up comedians. Certainly of our time and I put you in that category and it amazes me. It's undeniable. It just goes when the left says no one on the right is funny. Yours is the first name that I bring up. Yours, Norm, and there are a couple of other people who aren't really out of the closet. No calls from Netflix, Nick? None? No we I mean we actually well he has a little inside scoop. You know Robbie Prah sounds like a queer. He was well I think he's Canadian actually. Well what do you say? He was he was moving up through the Montreal Comedy Festival you know part of management there. Yeah and I of course I used to get him a headlock because he's a small little insecure guy and bully him and nugget him in the green room and throw him at him and of course now he is the guy who calls the shots. Wait wait wait wait you threw him at him and maybe you slice it to them. That might have been somebody else. Okay all right but I you know I he was I get uncomfortable around people who get uncomfortable around me. Yeah and he was one of those he was one of those guys that maybe uncomfortable because he's uncomfortable around me but I you know we used to joke around and I you know fake wrestling and stuff he's a little guy and and of course anybody I have ever picked on even in fun climbs up that latin. Now he's the guy at Netflix as far as comedy specials go. Yeah you know what else I noticed actually there was a lady I remember um gosh well since we're inside baseball who cares that she's not going to hire me. Her name was uh Alison Cohn and I did some shows with MTV. Shot some you know those crappy pilots of MTV game shows where they pay you like barely more than scale and at the time I was young I was a comedian and I would say I wasn't the greatest comedian but I was young and in the realm of stand-ups they thought I was hip enough to host a show and I ended up losing one of them to a guy named Ryan Stout um who then wanted to blow his brain on brains out because he had to host shows at MTV and she would work there and she really liked that I was young and she liked that I was uh you know kind of edgy and I remember having a conversation when she found out that I was more right leaning she couldn't believe it she was horrified and I just saw her name in the michelle uh the michelle wolf show she was in charge of casting a michelle wolf show and I'm going oh yeah that makes sense all the people I know who I said when I was coming up going oh I hope they don't become the gatekeepers one day. For the melting candle. We just placed the wrong bets you and I nick. No well yeah they're the antithesis of it look with straight white heterosexual alpha males I mean they're the last they we are the last people they want to let get our message out or a comedy or anything else. Yeah so you know I don't even try anymore I just uh I'm gonna you know continue to put stuff up uh you know right now it's more of a focus is on my podcast than then stand up I don't do very much stand up lately you know. Well it gets it's hard it's hard. Hey you get on I I've talked about this and I don't know if you felt this but I remember at this point you hadn't really uh run into it as much it hadn't been punched by you know the angry. Right. But truly wearing lady who we can't answer. Um I remember we talked about you like I don't think it's gonna come to clubs and I remember Jim Norton said the same thing and I said I think I think you're wrong because I was from Montreal where I had seen it kind of. Rogan said the same thing. Yeah Rogan said the same thing and I was from Montreal where I'd kind of seen it already it was sort of pervasive and it happened in the clubs and I would get really bad anxiety before going on stage because you know these comedy clubs don't have the best security and I was I was at that point where I was already getting threats and of course you're very vulnerable. Did you start to feel that way after that attack or even before it when you came out of the closet politically it added a new layer of anxiety for me for actual safety of myself in the crowd. Not my whole. Yeah well you know people clubs now make you I don't know why this is in our job description almost every club insists that you kind of do the meet and greet thing after. Yeah and I always said no and they would say why and I would say well you know the third of the audience wants to murder me and I was joking back then. I'd be joking you know but now today why Rogan all those other guys would think it wouldn't spread to clubs first. So this is a nerd business you know yeah this is the world's being run by nerds who hate guys like you and I and that's they're attracted to liberal arts and stand up and and whatever. Yeah you know so that's number one but number two it's now you get kids who grew up with this PC horse shut down their throat. They're running the clubs now. Yeah so I so they they actually believe in some of this stuff and I know like you know Metska gets cured and and I heard about comics getting sent home for doing a rape joke. And then I get these people but why don't you play Oregon. What are you kidding me? I'm gonna play Oregon. Taking your life in your hands if you go and play Oregon. But you did say so the podcast now is up and running and you're focusing on that more because it's harder for people to kill you. It's not impossible. Don't do it from your bathtub. Especially not after 25 oysters and a few beers that it could end badly. So where's Nick Dipp.com and when does it air and was was the attack a big was it kind of a turning moment where you said okay this is going to be my primary focus now? No that I was gonna do this anyways after getting fired for a tweet at Sirius. Right. Well let's not forget about that. Um no so I was gonna do this anyways but but um you and Anthony Kumea it seems like there's a trend. Remember when everyone said like oh the last bastion of free speech is going to be satellite radio. You're free there there's no FCC. There we are. Yeah well there there is no there is no free for guys like you and me and Twitter is f***ing with me again. Every day I wake up I'm losing 10 15 followers for no reason. Yeah. It's stuck with the same f***ing number and uh it really is so this you know this is a platform hopefully but I'm on Patreon which is run by very liberal people. Yes but I'm making a money right off the bat. We had a great you know the response has been great. The problem with like I told you I don't do much stand up when I do this focus on the podcast and topical news you know as a stand up you can only put so much of that in your act and then it's all gonna week and you've got a giant hole in your act. Right. I can't seem to uh there two different muscles for me stand up and whatever but I was never intimidated even now. Look I play at the comedy seller it's on the campus of NYU but I'm a little yeah I'm a little paranoid now when people come up to shake my hand. Yeah I do it like this. Yeah I can imagine. Because that's how I got it. You know I was shaking a guy's hand when his daughter popped me in the face. So now yeah for the first time I sent a little bit but when I do my podcast I have my wife sitting on the front steps with my uh my shotgun so. I can well yeah just as Joe Biden said just one double barrel shotgun fired off into the air that'll take care of all your problems. I'm kind of seeing it like section. I do think though it's interesting that you you said this because we're talking about serious satellite and I think what's important is people need to understand their censorship as it's defined government censorship. Yeah then there is through bullying and I know you just mentioned you know okay straight white alpha male but the truth is you're not the bully certainly not in this industry you're actually in a minority in this industry with your points of view as a conservative um there's censorship as we know it and then there is a culture of self-censorship due to fear. So a good example is satellite radio when it started it didn't have the same kind of FCC rules you could say what you wanted but the culture of self-censorship is what got Anthony Kumia and you and in trouble and they're trying to invade the clubs and even the podcast realm with the culture of fear so that people self-censored that's what worries me. That's that's exactly right and and and the person that fired me is the higher up at you know I got his name at um serious you know I did a little google and stop and you know this pictures like on his Facebook page of his wife at a gun control rally and don't tell me that **** that. One of my fans said it best on Twitter or something he did an imitation of the meeting that got me fired with like series he said is the product good? Yes. Do the people like it? Absolutely. Does it uh does it match my politics and my friends politics? No okay it's gotta go. So I thought I thought that was fun you know dead on and I'm not holding a grudge against them because I they still play my stuff and I get royalties coming so well and there are a lot of conversations that you don't know about like that you know the hodge twins were here and they started out doing fitness channel stuff and they just happen to be funny and they're more right leaning and you know what I love about we were just saying this with the hodge twins what I love is their their black guys and they tend to be conservative but we don't have to be like what are your black conservative talking points we can just break each other's balls and they happen to be black that's true but their agent called them and they've been selling out big rooms and their agent was like yeah we understand that your friends with uh Stephen Crowder they said yeah and he said we do not agree with his politics so make make a note of it. So what exactly so it's like if they're selling out the room but that's the point it's not even just about it's not even just monetary it is ideological and sometimes they let it supersede the monetary influence which is what scares me so much all right listen before you go um I did hear uh that you have some thoughts on smoking and vape people and the like uh I don't I'm just trying to lay you up here I didn't know how to segue but I just started smoking because a lot of stress in my life I'm not going to go into it so I start I was you know back in the day I'd have wanted to maybe if I was drunk or whatever and then I just started I just wanted a bunch of oysters you smoke with a bunch of oysters the one though I know but he wanted to you know **** me sitting there oasis by myself smoking but uh that's real attractive but yeah no I just started smoking I had a lot of stress and and I love it I'm up to about a pack a day and people go why would you do it at this stage of life and I go why would you do it in your 20s so you can have ass cancer in your 40s I'm timing it out right if a doctor tells me I have cancer in 20 years I'm gonna kiss him on the **** forehead you see many happy 75 year old people they got that look on their face like what I wish I had cancer at this point and by the way sitting Stephen you're smoking right now because sitting is the new smoking you know and if that's true wouldn't have uh Stephen Hawke and been dead 38 years ago well I don't I don't know I didn't and I also didn't see the movie so I don't know his current condition I love the smoke and I suggest all the kids at least try it well no please don't but I will say uh don't but you know what I had Dennis Prager on and we do enjoy you know I enjoy Piper cigar which if you're not inhaling the mortality risks are significantly lower so try try just having a cigar you might find that you enjoy it as much it's the it's the combustion in your lungs that really will kill you but if you're looking to get cancer well then you know that be the marble man well somebody said you know try the vague cigarette or the e-cigarette I said that look uh less manly with the **** my mother or more manly I don't know if I **** that up one of the other uh that's whole this whole thing is it's okay at this point it doesn't really matter but it is true uh did you see that one guy we covered the story the guy who's vape exploded it exploded and he he right before it exploded didn't he he's facebook met facebook put on his wall just vaping before work and uploaded a picture and it exploded just like it was like a water like a looney tunes like yeah it took out it took out half his face and the and the bathtub could no longer hold water like a bloke I'm like what was this an acne firecracker I have no I I do remember hearing about that now I I just took responsibility like two days life yes they did they said until they realized it was self inflicted and he didn't hurt anybody else and then they realized he was vaping they didn't want to associate with it okay maybe you find videos like that I don't know where we find videos like that but it means that I live a horrible very fruitless meaningless life it is Nick dip.com where people can go and uh subscribe to your podcast and support you and of course if you do uh stand updates that's where you guys would find it out there hey Nick I really appreciate it I'm glad to see you're up and running with the podcast and come back more frequently love you I I will Steve and I appreciate it thank you guys be well avoid the brookinstock Some people have a deeper biting respect for the constitutional law that created this country. And some people don't. Like it started liberalism, mug luck can stop it. Join mug club for exclusive content, shows and to help put a stop to homosexual liberalism. That's called the priorities. I was just watching an episode of River Monsters. Do you ever watch that show? I've got to watch it. I keep meaning to. But by the way, thank you to Ann, Macalennian, Philomaclear. Mary, two different names, the European thing, the Hodge twins and Nick DiPolo. It's for a long-ass lower third. It does make for a long-ass lower third and difficult to spell. It is. But we do all caps because of the font, so I think we're mostly fine with that. And MacKynis is a hard one. Now, River Monsters, there's some stuff out of Riptide thing. But by the time it gets to the last season, he's just out in the open ocean fishing for sharks. Which defeats the purpose of River Monsters. I just need to make a list because every time I get to Netflix, I'm like, you know what? There was something I meant to watch. And then I said that I'm like, I don't forget the Seinfeld of this. Yeah, that's exactly what it ends up. Yeah, for me it ends up being Larry Sanders, Seinfeld. I've been watching River Monsters. And he's just, I'm in the world fishing for a great wide shark. Who cares? We know there are sharks in the ocean. The whole point was when you started there was this crazy catfish with teeth, you know, in Lake Erie. That was compelling. Now you're just talking about running out of ideas. It's like the ocean has things that bite. We know that. I was interested because I assumed the river was safe. And then you shattered my preconceived notions. And now you're just hunting sharks. Maybe a Bill Nye in there to teach you us about the gender gap. Mmm. He's actually a really good host though, Jeremy Wade. He's actually a really good host of the show, except he always states the obvious. He's like, I'm walking through the water. If there's a fish out here who could bite me, it would be very pleasant. It's actually hard to come by a good host because you watch a lot of shows. You're like, you just have a radio voice, but you suck at everything. Like, you're just watching Carson Daly do anything talented. No, it's never happened. No, well the key word is talented. It's a mom working on TV. Oh, there you go. There's his end. Being said, you know what, I don't want to be too hard. We're more so bothered with networks that just shuffle in their brothers or people with the right point of view. But Jeremy Wade actually is a good host. He looks like a catfish a little bit. So he didn't get by on his looks. He comes by the river monster, I think, honestly. He comes by the river monster thing, honestly. But a lot of people going out, and I know the hodge twins have done some acting. We've talked about those two in pitch meetings when we write jokes. And I want to get to an email that was sent to me in a second. I'm trying to be really careful to not reveal any identity. But you know this, when it comes to jokes and it's in with the show, I've never been upset with anyone or even myself for strikeouts. I admire it. It's always when people don't take a swing. And you feel that way too with a lot of things. When people don't even take a swing, that's what's really fun. I thought you'd play a strikeout with jokes. Yeah, what so do I? Not nearly as many as I have. You take a more swing, but yeah. Yeah, that's the point. That's the only reason. The only reason is either batting average goes up by 0.1% eventually. Nick DiPolo, he's just bombed more than all of us for a certain period of time and got good at it. That's the best ball thing too. I always thought it was funny. Badding 500, that's really good. But that means you're missing half. Yeah. That means you're missing half. Exactly. That's not very, that's like, that's the only thing I like about baseball. That's the only thing I like about, it's not encouraging. It's very allegorical. Because I know my biggest regrets in life come from when I didn't swing the bat. And in your life, you know, there are other people, by the way, who are counting on you to swing. So like baseball, like you said, I think the average is like 0.255, something like that. So you're going to miss most of them. But think about this. If you're in a team, right, like in real life, or people depend on you, and you have a 0.25. You miss it. But then the next guy has a 0.25. And the next guy has a 0.265. You just all make sure to swing when you're at the plate, that makes a huge difference. And you just, at some point too, swing in the bat, not only means in yourself but trusting in people. And I've gotten this sometimes from my wife and been told that sometimes I invest too much, get too personal, get too close, too quickly with people. It's probably true. Sometimes I haven't set boundaries as well as I need to. And it'd be obviously easier to just become a cold cynic. But that's just, I've decided that's not who I am. I can't do it. I'll always be someone who has had really, really good close friends and personally invest in people. People is friends. People who work in the company. And we've had some, pretty much actually we're friends with most people who've ended up leaving the company. It's just been tough long term. People who come out of the show like the hodge twins, I have to invest in them personally because we want to be a good host. So we fix them up. We make sure they have a good time. Investing in people personally is taking a swing. Because the truth is sometimes when you invest in yourself so personally, this happens, you get burned. Think of any rough breakup that you've ever had. Well, I can think of obviously when I was going to say you haven't really had a rough breakup ever. No, I left them. Think of any rough breakup that you've ever had or divorce or friend you've lost over a fight. It's as painful as anything you can imagine. And that's because you took a swing. You invested in someone. You invested in a relationship. An investment, same thing with money, monetarily. That's swinging the bat. You never know. It's never a guaranteed outcome if when you make an investment. Look at your portfolio. Has everything done well? You win some. You lose some. But would you rather never know it at all than, I know this sounds cliche, but would you rather never had that relationship if you'd forego the breakup? And by the way, let's assume that you say yes to that question. What about all the other great relationships you have in your life? At some point you made an investment, which is to say you took a risk, to say you swung the bat, and it panned out. Every good relationship you have is because of at some point you swung the bat. Every good thing you have in your life, unless it was given to you as a hand me down, which is a rare exception. Listen, I'm speaking in generalities here, okay. It comes from swinging the bat from taking a risk. And at least you can know, go on a sleep at night knowing that you tried. And by the way, this is what I was trying to relate to. I had an email from someone who works with, say, let's just say it's an email. Let's just say it's a wounded veteran, not veteran. People who come back from war, so not necessarily a veteran. Some of them are still active in the military. Some of them are wounded soldiers, sailors, without naming the program because there are a few of them. Reads out to me, I saw them at a 4th of July parade and then sent an email. And I remember the 4th of July parade. Some of these really grizzled sort of hate to use the word warrior. It's used so often now, it's lost a lot of meaning. But warriors, people who've gone to the forefront for their countries, and we've gotten even some Canadians. And even some Canadians, some of them have been Canadian as well. And I know I make fun of Canada a lot, but listen, if you fight for your country, I don't care what country. It is as long as it's not a country that's beheading Christians, you fight for that country. We're just going to have to take you out. I have no respect for you for fighting for those countries. But we're talking about the countries under good guy-god at this point. And I get a lot of messages from people in the military. The one guy gave me is Navy Cross, which we actually just put in a case that key grip, quarter black Garrett gave to me. And I feel really grateful to get these emails. Because if you swing the bat, if you invest and you miss, a lot of these wounded warriors, wounded soldiers, wounded veterans who come back, they need help. There are programs out there to help them, and we've actively supported some of those programs on this show. But if you swing the bat and you fall flat in your face, not only can you try again, but guess what? You can get help. And the reason I bring this up, this email is because these are some of the toughest people you can possibly imagine. And a lot of them feel ashamed to go into this guy who emailed me asking him, asking his organization for help. It's like prison. Some of these people just have a hard time acclimating to everyday life. Why? Because they swung the bat for their country. They went all in, they gave everything. And here's the thing, when you give everything that you have, you end up with nothing left. And then their cup is empty. Now their cup is empty. And they kind of need to refill it with everyday life. And a lot of them don't know how. And it was, there was a very specific story, and I don't think there's any way for me to get into it without it, unfortunately being too personal, but really touched me and brought it here to my eye of someone who was absolutely completely opposed to getting help. And their story was particularly horrific, and it ended up changing their life. They didn't know how to adapt. Going from 100. Think about any time you've worked really late on a college paper, something like that, right? Picture this. You're studying, you're studying all night, you've got your final, you don't know if you're going to make it in your up all night and coffee, you know. A lot of people are using these smart drugs in college, and then all of a sudden you're done at 4am. Can you go to sleep? There needs to be a come down. Picture that only you're being shot at. Picture that only you're literally in a foxhole and you see your friends head blown off, or maybe even someone doesn't die, but you know it's a possibility. And you're making the phone call that never comes, Benghazi, right? That's what happens to a lot of these people. They don't know how to adapt to everyday life. And that's the big difference when people say a lot, I've heard people, liberals use this argument, what about helping veterans? What about the VA? That's the difference between welfare, a handout, and getting help. The difference is in swinging the bat. The career welfare recipient is exactly that because they opted not to swing the bat. They chose the comfort of the check. The soldier who comes home and needs help needs some assistance because he swung so hard, as hard as he possibly could, that he threw his back out. If you've been burned, hurt, angry, shut off from people from the world, maybe from your dreams, from your ambitions, don't. If you're ashamed of getting help, for whatever reason, don't be as long as you're swinging the bat. Just make sure you're swinging the bat when those balls come down center plate. It sounds like one of those things that we hear a lot of is like, it is absolutely true. And if you swing the bat, you make investments in people and your job and your life, you win some, you lose some. But if you don't swing, you just lose them all. So just keep swinging the bat across the board. It always works, better than not. See you next week."
