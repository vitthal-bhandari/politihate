    "text": " There's been a dizzying spike in the number of children who identify as transgender or non-binary. Five years ago, that number was 15,000 children between the ages of 6 and 17 were diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Last year, there were 42,000, and that's just the number of kids who had been diagnosed. At every stage of the process, they have to be encouraged to transition by adults in important positions, doctors, therapists, teachers, coaches, counselors, all the way up to the president of the United States. And that's how bad things are. Our president nominated a transgender activist to the Department of Health and entertained a TikTok celebrity who plays a cartoonish stereotype of a woman. They're always recruiting new victims and devoted to making it as easy as possible for minors to transition at whatever cost. And by transition, I mean a name change or updated pronouns. This is a lot more than just that and more than playing dress up. For the first time in human history, least recorded history, kids as young as six are receiving puberty blockers, hormone treatments, even surgeries that include irreversible mutilation of genital parts, hysterectomies, and massectomies. All in the name of compassion, but I don't think that that is compassion. Despite major censorship and progressive bullying around the issue, transition regret is becoming more and more common. A growing number of people who have transitioned have realized that trying to change their gender doesn't solve their emotional or mental problems the way they thought it would. And as you will hear today, it can often make the problems much, much worse. Our guest today, after getting her first iPhone and logging on to Instagram, she says she became brainwashed by gender ideology at 11. At 13, she began medically transitioning to a boy. At 15, she had a double mastectomy. At 18, she has had to grieve the fact that she'll never be able to experience the sacred part of motherhood and even breastfeed her own child. But now she's on a mission, and I'm telling you a very brave mission. Pray for this. Pray for this young woman. She is extraordinarily brave. She says her mission is to expose the darkness and the lies of the transgender movement to save other children here in America and around the world. Today, please welcome our podcast guest, Chloe Cole. If we're walking to somebody's house and it smells like cat or it smells like fish or it just smells like something they cooked, even if it was good, I used to live in an apartment that everything always smelled like soup.

Hi, Chloe. How are you? Good. Happy face. You're a brave woman. And thank you for coming in. Thank you. And I just want to explain if you're watching, she's got to blank it because it's about 62 here. That's about what we keep the studio at 62. And so I hope you're comfortable. I want to preface this with this is a subject that you just can't have a frank conversation on. And people on both sides are going to be pissy about whatever anybody says. But we have to have this conversation. And as a dad, I tried to explain to my 16 year old daughter that compassion without truth and without full knowledge and expression is not compassion. And there's a trend in our country and in our world where I don't care what the subject is. You're either with the right people or you're out of society. And it's extraordinarily dangerous. And you unfortunately have felt it firsthand. Yeah. So talk to me. You're eight years old and you're a tomboy. Yeah. You have two sisters, two brothers. Two brothers. They're all older than me. Right. And you didn't like dresses or, you know, really stuff. I mean, I was kind of in between on those things. Like I had influence from both sexes growing up because I had so many siblings. I mean, actually, when I was younger, I actually loved wearing dresses and skirts and things like that and like playing with dolls. And I also like playing like video games my older brothers and like playing with their Legos and their toy guns. I know a lot of girls that are tomboys. Yeah. And that doesn't make them in the wrong body. It just is everybody's different. Everybody's different. So did anybody think, did you think eight years old? I'm in the wrong body. Um, I mean, the idea never really came to me until I started using social media actually. I got my first phone when I was 11 and, you know, because I wanted to fit in with all my other friends. At the time, I made my my my first social media account on Instagram and Snapchat and on Instagram. Um, I mean, I wasn't actually supposed to be using it so young because the minimum age is actually 13, but they don't really actually don't actually check that. Yeah. But, um, I saw a lot of things on there that I really shouldn't have at that age. Like what? I mean, the content from other women, um, other young women. A lot of it is like, um, they post themselves in like really like skimpy outfits or like really, really sexualized poses or they're, they're wearing like a bunch of makeup or they've got like, they've, they like edit or like filter their bodies or they even have like, like plastic surgery they're done on their faces with the bodies. And I mean, aside from that, a lot of it was just like complaining about like, um, just how tough growing into a woman is like how scary periods and the possibility of pregnancy and the pain of childbirth and then eventually going through menopause. And I find that nobody, no girls or women really ever talked about like the great things about being a woman and the great things that come with all those things. And I find that this not only was it like this on the internet, but even from like the, the girls and women that I grew up around me with were kind of like that as well. It's really interesting to me that our society and we've been doing it for a long time. Um, says that they're empowering women, but at the same time, they're not. They're empowering a specific type of woman. Um, that will assume a stereotypical male role. Um, and that doesn't make that bad, but it, it, it, our society is not celebrating the other side. I've talked to moms all the time who say, I'm, you know, I'm just a mom. What do you mean you're just a mom? That's the hardest job out there. I agree. So that's what in my generation, we had, uh, people saying, you know, girls saying, how can I be happy with my body with all these magazines? But it's a hundred times worse now online and nobody seems to talk about it. Yeah. Um, I mean, not only did I have like a, I was kind of insecure about like my, like being, like being feminine a little bit. Um, I mean, growing up, I mean, a lot of the content, the, the, like comics and books and cartoons, I would, I would read or watch as a kid were kind of, kind of like downplayed like the role of like the, the girls, like it was always like about the boys and the girls were always like getting in the way or they're like really stupid. Not really, not really helping. But I also, because I was using social media so young and I was seeing like these very idealized images of women. Um, I mean, as I was just a kid and I wasn't like, I was only a few years in puberty. I wasn't very developed. But I also didn't understand that I wasn't really, most women aren't really supposed to look like that. But I started developing some body image issues and, um, down the line, I was actually diagnosed with body dysmorphia well after I transitioned. Okay. So. You go from not having any idea that none of these ideas really crossed your mind. Yeah. Eleven, you get the phone. Then when do you start to say, I'm in the wrong body? How long after eleven? So at around that time, I also started to get like a lot of LGBTQ content in my feed, especially like trans, like non-binary or, um, things like that. Right. And a lot of it was coming from other young women as well. Like ages maybe like twelve to early twenties. And, um, you know, I was kind of a, I was kind of an awkward kid. I, I'm actually on the spectrum. So I've kind of struggled a little bit with socializing with, especially with other people, my age and making, keeping friends. And I found that as I got older, um, it got more difficult to make friends, especially with other girls, my age and, um, Girls are vicious. Yeah. Yeah. Um, But it just kind of struck me how like, how happy these people outwardly seemed to be and how when they came out to their families and their friends, they were. Accepted. Yeah. So I, I was something that even if I didn't realize at the time, I wish that I had for myself. But you didn't find that. Not really no. Okay. So before we get there, let's, let's take it the next step. Did you initiate this and say, I'm non-binary? I think I'm in the wrong body. What happened? But who did you first tell and what happened? Yeah. So naturally after some time after being exposed to stuff for a little bit, I started to wonder like, what am I? Who am I attracted to? What's, what's my sexuality? What's my identity? And I kind of like switched through switched between labels, like bisexual, pansexual, and whatnot. It went on to a gender, bi-gender, non-binary. And then eventually I settled on maybe I'm just not a girl and I'm actually a boy. And I started to cut my hair shorter. I came out. Do you think this would have happened without the media and the popularity of this? No, no, no. I wouldn't even know what it was. Okay. But I, I came out to my older sister and some closer family members and friends at school first. And then without my parents knowing, I started buying like clothes out of the, the boy section. And then after a few months, I, I came out to them. I wrote a letter because I was, I was afraid of having that conversation, starting that conversation face to face and I wanted to allow them some time to think about it. So I just left a letter on the dining room table. It is, it's frightening to talk to your parents about, and I've, as a parent have had conversations like these. And if you don't, and I don't know your situation with your parents, but if you don't have a conversation where you, you don't have a relationship with your parents, or you don't have a relationship where you feel, I can say anything and they'll never stop loving me. It's tough because your age at that time, you don't really know that. You don't know that. What was your parents reaction? Um, they were, they were a little shocked actually. They didn't, they didn't really expect this. I mean, they knew I was like a bit of a tomboy, but they never really saw this coming. And you know, they were, they were normal people and they didn't really know what to do about this. They were like really experts on the subject. And so they wanted to turn to the real experts. They took you to the doctor. Yeah. They, they saw it as like a psychiatric issue, which they were right about that, but it wasn't treated as such by my therapist or any physician who is involved in my transition. More with Chloe in just a second. When the alarm clock goes off in the morning and you open your eyes is pain. The first thing you think about used to be for me. I'm going to face another day of this. For years, I suffered every day from just debilitating pain that really focused on my hands. It was impossible really to do anything. And I, I didn't think I would be able to even do this, pick up a pen, write a note, write a letter, or, uh, paint a painting anymore. All of those things were so important to me. And I thought I lost them forever until I started taking relief factor. And I will tell you, I didn't believe in it. My wife made me take it. I took it. And I was actually surprised that it worked. Uh, you know, it's all natural and blah, blah, blah. Uh, I don't, you know, okay. All right, medicine doctor. It's not witchcraft. It is science developed by doctors and it is, it is great. Worked for me. And about 70% of the people who try it go on to order more month after month. So maybe this is for you too. Relieffactor.com. Call 804 relief. 800, the number four relief. It's relieffactor.com. When you went to the doctor, I'm assuming that your mom and dad had the best intense and just don't, they want you safe and they want you happy. And they loved me and they wanted to figure out what was going on. And, well, I felt this way and that was just never figured out. Unfortunately, it just went straight to, oh, yeah, she's a boy. And behind my back, they actually told my parents that if I wasn't allowed to basically do what I wanted in my transition, that I would be at risk of suicide. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Had you said that to the doctors? No, I didn't. I wasn't. No, I didn't. Nothing. Nothing. I wasn't suicidal until I was. For years. Yeah. Yeah. Into my medical transition. Wow. Okay. So the doctors, they didn't probe on what is happening to you in your life. They didn't talk to you about anything. They just accepted that you should be a boy. Yeah. And there is very little psychological evaluation. I did have some stuff going on at home and at school, but I mean, it was just never really probing to. It was never really considered as having any relation to my gender dysphoria. I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria. I think by a, I don't think it was by the first therapist I saw because he never really did anything actually, but I think it was. Wow. I think it was a gender specialist and, you know, all the research I did on transitioning before and like the. Even like the medical professionals who I saw basically presented transition as the only means of treating dysphoria. No alternatives were even brought up really. It was basically just so if you believe your boy, then you're actually a boy. So I. I understand and you can go into this or not. It's your choice, but some of the issues like at school where you were. Some boy was quite inappropriate with you and that. That made you so uncomfortable and you didn't want to be a girl part of that was you didn't want to be a girl because of that. Is that. This actually happened while I was early in my medical transition a little down the line before I started to before I started, but I mean a lot of my a lot of my girlfriends and some the women I knew growing up had like a history of like being victims of sexual assault or stalking or abuse or rape. And like all these stories out here made me really afraid of eventually experiencing that for myself and from a young age, I had a really bad fear of like being assaulted or raped. Oh my gosh. And so when that happened, you started to bind your breasts. Yeah. Right. And I was actually it is a little unusual because at that point I was I was several months on testosterone and blockers usually most. Trans identified women will start binding long before they start like the medical process, but I mean, I wore kind of like loose shirts and I was at the time, maybe like a like a big upper. So so I didn't think that like my chest was very noticeable, but that incident where he the boy who was bullying me groped me made me very conscious of the appearance of my breasts. And I wanted to had them from the world forever. Gosh. And no doctor ever talked to you about that. No, I actually never brought this up. Did they give you the opportunity to ask probing questions that would have gotten you there? They probably have, but I never really I never really spoke up about it because. Shame. Yeah, that and I kind of just told myself, you know, I was I was trying to become a boy and I was like, I just told myself to man up basically. And I downplayed the incident in my head and I didn't really realize just how it affected me, but also I knew that at the time, I wouldn't really be able to speak out about it because if I told my parents, then they would bring it up to the to the school, the school office. And I know the school would probably just give the kid a slap on the wrist and he would maybe be suspended for a few days and then come back and maybe do something worse to me. Wow. Holy cow. What a I can't can't imagine growing up today. I mean, when I first saw Bruce Jenner, I mean, I grew up when he was an Olympian when I saw him tell his story and before was it before right after he became Caitlin, I thought. I can't I feel so horrible that he spent his whole life feeling like that. I don't anybody to feel like that and terrible feeling. I still struggle with it to the state. It's it's got to be horrible, horrible. And you want to be compassionate. I mean, I don't you know, Bruce Jenner, Caitlin Jenner, whatever, whatever it doesn't affect me. But I don't know what the compassionate thing is. But I think and help me out on this. I think until you've become an adult and you've settled, I don't think if I would have made decisions on anything, if I would have had a tattoo, I probably had a pop eye tattoo on my face today, you know, you just don't make good decisions at that time. What is the most compassionate thing to do? I mean, it really it really depends. You have to wait until the individual is an adult and preferably a fully developed adult. But they they'll say to you, well, you will. Yeah, but there's no puberty blockers. They can't if they miss that window, then they miss it forever. It's not true. I mean, I know a lot of people who have transitioned well into their adulthood, like a like Buck Angel and Sarah Higdon and Sarah Higdon and I think that's the way that they're doing it. And a few others and they're pretty satisfied with their transitions. There's there shouldn't be a rush to make things make kids do things on age where they're known to make rash decisions. So gender affirming care is what you received, right? But it wasn't really affirming anything other than metallusion. Explain that. I mean, I genuinely believe that I was a boy, but that couldn't possibly be true because I was born. I was born female and sex is an immutable trait. But they'll tell you that sex and gender are different. That's that's where the argument kind of falls apart, but there's there's a lot of places where it falls apart, actually, but yeah. Yeah, it doesn't make sense. They say like there's they say that gender is like, I mean, they say all sorts of things about it. Like it's it's like in the brain and it's immutable, but also that it's like this detached entity from the body that somehow determines what you who you are kind of like a like a soul almost. It just it doesn't make sense. Okay, so you had this gender affirming care. You had parents who were lied to and were just I mean, I honestly, I don't know what to do as a parent. I don't want to do all I want to know is is my child happy and healthy and how can I help them navigate. This is all new stuff to parents. They have no idea. So your parents are lied to on top of it. And so you start taking the the blockers and everything. What is that like to take the blockers and then to take testosterone? What happened? What did that feel like to you? Yeah, so I'd say the amount of time between getting like the dysphoria diagnosis and actually getting like the prescriptions and then starting on the blockers and the testosterone was really it was only a matter of months. It hadn't even been like a full year. It was only a few months after that I started that I that I talked to my gender specialist and I was like, I want to. I want to go the medical route. I want to start taking testosterone and become more like my real self this image of myself that I had in my head. The first son of chronologist I was referred to actually had. He said no, he did not allow me to go on these treatments because he said that there would be concerns for my brain development because I was so young he doesn't he didn't really know like. How that might affect like my cognitive and emotional development going forward, but. I should have listened. We should have listened, but I mean, we heard this from nobody else. He's very brave doctor. He's probably been fired or had to resign by now for doing that. Honestly, did you saw the doctor in California, right? Yeah. Guarantee he's either silenced himself or he is no longer working. And it shouldn't be that way, but have you reached out to him? I have not. You should and just say I thought of it. Yeah, that would have been especially if he's really struggling to know that somebody. I mean, there's a lot of doctors in the situation who want to speak out, but they just can't they feel. Oh, yeah. Stifled. Oh, I know. I know. And I don't know if that's scarier or the doctors that truly believe this. I'd say it's equally pretty scary, but it was very easy to just get referred to another endocrinologist who after like two or three appointments gave me my mom the consent forms and like the side effect forms to sign off on. And two months after that was when I think I was given my first blocker shot and then there is what did you feel anything when that came in? Did you with any changes happening to yours? That just stopping progress. I mean, it stopped the natural development of the sex hormones in my body. Right. That causes a few side effects on which I was informed of. You were fine. No, I'm not sure because I'm well, all is on it while I was on them alone without the testosterone because I had, you know, after all the sex hormones were like flushed on my body. I just felt kind of depressed. Right. And so. And nothing. Yeah. Yeah. It was like I was waking up basically waiting for the first testosterone shot every day, but I'm. After a while because it basically puts the body into a state of artificial menopause. I started experiencing hot flashes, which were really bad. Like I couldn't wear like pants or warm clothes in the winter and they would make my whole body itchy. And whenever. Whenever they would come up, it was really hard to focus on whatever. Yeah. My wife has gone through and she it was it's hell. It's hell. No, I can't. And you're old, you have to go through that. No, no. So then you get your first shot of testosterone. What did that feel like to you? It was. I mean, for lack of better words, it was euphoric. I mean, I finally had like, I had my energy back and, you know, I started. It was like this big milestone through me and, you know, after after some time, after maybe a week, I started noticing my voice was starting to drop. And after a few weeks to a few months, my future started to get more. More squarish, more masculine and my hair started growing thicker and I started growing some muscle. And I mean, I felt good about myself. I felt like I looked good. Did you feel differently or did you just see things differently? I mean, I'm sorry. This is probably a stupid question, but I never talked to anybody who's done this. So do you did you? When you got your energy back, was it a different kind of energy or did it feel like when you felt good as a girl? I mean, it's kind of hard to gauge how much of it was just like a. Actual and thinking. Yeah. Okay. I would say it's probably a little bit of both. I mean, testosterone as maybe it's kind of an exaggeration to say like this, but sort of like a stimulant effect. I mean, it gives you more energy, more drive to do things. You become a little more competitive. We are dealing with so many massive issues and we're not. I mean, I'm so honored that Chloe would sit with us and talk about this today, but this is not a normal conversation to have. Even though it's such a huge part of what's happening in America, same thing with abortion. We didn't talk about it for a long time and. We need to. We need to do everything we can to protect life.

Okay, so you start getting that then I was in eighth grade at the time I was I was 13. Great. It was the second half of my third year. Did you get the this is what year 26? 20, 2018. Yes. So this is not like the dark ages. This is like now and at the height of everybody saying oh celebrate and accept. Yeah, right. Did you get that acceptance? I mean. I had some friends online who would like celebrate like every basically every big milestone in my transition in like kind of. I guess you'd say like affirmed me, but I mean my family was accepting. I wouldn't say that they celebrated my transition specifically, but. They were loving. Did you have did did did you get that feeling when you thought wow these people are doing this and they're popular and they're happy and. I want to do that that feeling that you had at 11. I would say a little down down the road. When I was in when I was in eighth grade, I was you know, I was I was still in middle school and so people the people around me weren't really the nicest at school. I don't think girls until maybe well, I don't know until at least you know 18. I think they're vicious. Oh yeah. They are. Yeah. Some girls didn't treat me. Yeah. Very nicely when I was transitioning they would. And they would ask some legitimate questions, but other times they would just like harass me a little bit and. I mean, it kind of. Was like an outcast amongst my my peers. Because you're in neither world. Yeah. So and how did the boys react to you? It kind of depended like most of them were like. What is going on? Yeah. Right. But I made I made some friends who were boys and they're they're fun to be around and yeah, I made some pretty good friendships with them. But um boys are pretty much dogs. They're just like. Whatever. Yeah, exactly. That's what I liked about them. By the time I got into high school, I was on testosterone for long enough that I mean I passed as the opposite sex pretty well. My voice was deep enough and I didn't really have to worry about anything other than like getting like my my files changed. But um they're all high school. Nobody actually really knew that I was transgender even. So you go to a bigger high school or a different high school. Yeah. Nobody nobody knows your past. So you're just accepted as a boy. Yeah. So I mean, some people who I know I knew in like elementary and middle school knew and then I was outed behind my back a few times to like a small number of people. But nobody could really guess that I was a girl. I mean, I was just a short guy to them. Right. I'm not I'm not that tall. I'm like five foot three five foot four. But I mean, concerning my age at the time, I was like 15, 14, 15, 16. So it was kind of just like maybe it's like a late bloom or something. So are you still binding your breast at this point or what point do you decide to have the mastectomy? So, um, I'd say about halfway into my sophomore year was when I decided that I wanted to get him a mastectomy. I was I was 15 at the time and by this point, I'd been binding for maybe about like two, two and a half years. And, you know, I was I was really sick of it because binders are basically like these compression devices that cover the torso and in the chest area. It is like a it's like a like compression fabric to basically flatten the appearance of the breasts. And some some people get like really bad like breasts, red back pain from it. I never really connected. Can I tell you that I think this to me is akin in a child. It is akin to when the Chinese used to bind women's feet. I mean, this is this is just not good. It's not good. Yeah, I I never really experienced like pain, but I did have like discomfort from from it like sticking to me whenever I would like work out or like swim. And I didn't realize this until after my breasts were gone, but they actually deformed my ribs a little bit because they did. Yeah, I think it's mostly because I was I was still growing when I was using one. They basically pushed the breast into the rib cage. Oh, my, and I wasn't like large chest or anything. I was I was rather small and I had a I had a very small build. And it fit well. And it's still it's still cause damage. Is that going to affect any of your internal organs in the years to come? It's it's not too bad. I don't think it's just a little. Yeah. Okay. But it is noticeable. So. When you went in for a double mastectomy. Was there anyone who said real problem? Don't do this. No, there wasn't really like any psychological evaluation, which before in the months before I got my mastectomy, actually, I had like a I had like a note from one of my doctors to my school, basically saying that I would be taking leave because I was in a lot of distress. Over the course of my transition, I actually developed more psychiatric issues as time went on. You know, I was I kind of thought that like. I was really a boy and by by doing this, I would become. My I would become a piece of myself. I would I would become whole. But it just it just tore me apart more and more and. Okay, so we wait, wait, wait. It was there a period of time where you thought. This is going to be great and it is I'm transitioning now medically and it is good. I was very sure until the end until after my my my surgery. And so when did the the doubts start to come in just after the surgery? It's kind of complicated because I mean right after the surgery, like the moment I woke up to the moments, the first few days at home post stop. I was I was pretty happy. I mean, I was even though you were in pain. You're happy. The pain wasn't too bad. It was like a deep muscle soreness. But the pain from the pain medications, it caused me like some really bad digestive issues. And I had to go off of them within like two days. That was the most physically painful part about it. But eventually reality kind of struck me like I would. I wasn't allowed to like shower for a week, basically just to protect like the. But after I was like allowed to and I started bathing and I had to like take care of my my dressings and these big wounds on my chest. It was like. I can barely look at myself like the thoughts of maybe this isn't the right thing. Didn't start until like a while after though because I did start feeling some grief, but I couldn't really identify what the feeling was because it was like I was so invested in this. I was maybe like three or four years into transitioning at this point. And like everybody around me knew me as Leo and you know, I didn't look like a girl at this point anymore. And it was just hard to think that it was the wrong thing. You're too deep. When people get deep into something, the hardest thing is to. To admit to yourself. Oh, this is wrong and change. That's one of the reasons why I said you're so amazingly brave. So amazingly brave. Thank you. So. You start to have these feelings of. Oh, where you longing to be a girl? Were you realizing that it's this is a lie that you know, I'm going to be happy being this was a lie or. What was it that you were feeling at first? It was like, well, I really miss like looking feminine being pretty and. I would like secretly know I was so embarrassed about it. I shouldn't have been because you know, I was actually I'm actually a girl. There's like there's nothing wrong with any of that. But behind my parents back, I basically bought like some makeup and. Like skirts and stuff and like I would just like kind of like stay in my room and just like play video games while while wearing this stuff and not really go out like that. I sort I started to withdraw a little bit from like the people around me and my surroundings. I would just kind of just be just stay in my room like play video games all day and just draw and just be in my own world because. I didn't want to live in reality. I didn't want to live in a reality where I looked like a boy and I I felt stuck like that. Eventually my great performance started to start to drop. I mean, this is around the time that a. COVID restrictions started to come to place and they started doing like the distance learning model and. So that that made that made it a lot harder for me and I was kind of. I was kind of just stuck in this headspace because I couldn't really like I couldn't really. Go out and like see my my peers or anything. So I was stuck on. Yeah, I was stuck in my room stuck in the night all day and eventually I stopped paying attention to my classes and. Basically just withdrew from the world as whole and my. My parents decided to take me out of school and put me into an online only program. And during the second second quarter of the online program. I was taking a psychology class and there was like a there were some some chapters on like child development and. Parenthood and. There is like a like a lesson on how. Like breastfeeding and physical contact plays a role in. In the bond between mother and child and then eventually. Goes on to affect like child development like psychological emotional development problem solving. And I realized that like. I was told before my surgery that I would lose my ability to breastfeed but I didn't really think this was important because you know I saw myself as a man and men don't do that. And I could just I could just use formula. Yeah exactly I didn't know what parenthood would look like for me because I wasn't thinking about that. I was thinking about like getting my score done and fitting in but. When that hit you. That I can't. Chestfeed I can't breastfeed a child if I want to someday and. I realized like not only did I lose the ability to naturally feed my kid but I also could. It's so much more than just feeding them like it plays a role in. It's an important part of the bond. Between the mother and her children and I didn't know this but when I realized that I took this away from myself I felt like a monster like a. That was probably my worst. I was probably at rock bottom at that point and I just spent a few weeks just. At my absolute lowest and. It wasn't until like maybe like two weeks later after I finished that lesson I was like. This is all wrong and I regret every single step of this. This shouldn't have happened and. It's it's it's just made everything worse and I feel like I'll never be able to go back and. That is true in some ways I'll never be able to to feed my children. I don't know if I'll be able to safely carry a child to turn because I was so young when I started. Medicalization but. That night when I made the realization it was like. It was kind of like coming out all over all over again. But even even scarier this time because like. Me and my parents and my family were so invested in this and it was it was all for nothing. And I just felt like. And I was just so grateful for you apart. Yeah and I couldn't even bring myself to talk to my mom face to face about it. So I text to her and I. I texted a friend about it and I called I called him but. It took a while for me to be able to have that conversation face to face and you know. Sometimes my mom would like check up on me like asking me if I was okay coming to my. My room to like bring me food and stuff but. It took a while to really. I guess get the ball rolling and figure out where to go from there. I stopped taking testosterone almost immediately and that impacted my health quite a bit actually. I. Because of the deficit of sex hormones in my body I got. I was like really I was having really bad like mood swings. I was very prone to like emotional outbursts and. I was not at my most stable. I wasn't very nice and. I did I did lose a few friends out all of them actually every friend that I had at school and. I lost quite a few. You know your you know all of this is okay right you know that. You know that this is this was not. You being a monster this was not you. You know this is you as a kid making decisions. That honestly shouldn't have been in my opinion shouldn't have been. Made and they shouldn't have been should have been options for you but. Not to blame anybody else but you know that. Anything that happened. You can release that you know you know that don't you. Good. But it it I got very sickly afterward as well I dropped like 25 pounds within a. Matter of two months and I was prone to. Getting ill. And. To stop stone had some side effects for me. Maybe after like a year to a year and a half I started developing like some. Some urinary tract issues and by going off to stop stone it actually. Worsened for a little bit. And did you start taking hormones. No I just. Stop taking to stop strong stop taking the stop stone basically had to wait it out and. I did get my period about two months after the fact which I think I'm I'm very I'm. Very lucky for because sometimes it never comes back right yeah. They came very soon and. They've been very regular since which is. A miracle I think because when when I started the I was so young that they hadn't even. Regulated yeah I only had about like three to four per year. So I guess there must have been at least some development having gone on my body somehow luckily. There was a story this week that came from the Netherlands. The Dutch are are buying farmers out or just pulling their property away. Because the farmers aren't going to be able to grow anything or have. Ranches anymore because of the the nitrogen that is now being outlawed you know because of the world economic. Forum and global warming. This is coming to America this is a very big deal that people just don't understand what's coming. Good ranchers is there I started looking for a company that would support. Ranches like mine I mean I don't need it a luckily I I don't depend on ranching as my business. However there are people in my community ranchers who are barely holding on. Because they just can't afford to stay open and if the government keeps twisting the knife they're out. And that means we won't have either farms they'll all be big industrial farms or you will you'll have a rancher that just can't keep up with the price and so they're not making meat anymore.

How's your friend network now? I mean it's not exactly where I want it to be. Some of my old friends really strongly disagree with with what I'm doing now and. Are they transitioned? Yeah I have a friend who is biologically female right like me but I'm transitioning to a male identity and. So is it because you've betrayed or what is the problem? Yeah I have a few friends before who were transgender both online and. Excuse me that's alright in person but. They a lot of them they cut ties with me or they started like like harassing me because. I mean I think there's a lot of factors like jealousy and fear of being wrong themselves and. A lot of them say things like you don't deserve parents who. Loved you enough to let you let you transition or you were 13 you weren't you weren't a baby you knew exactly what you were doing to yourself. Oh my God. Are these people your age or older? Around my age if not like a few years older. There I find that a lot of them are very. Stunted in a few ways and so they don't really understand. Just the the weight of the situation unfortunately and they're going. Almost all of them are going through their own thing right now like no no mentally healthy person would be saying these things. They're. They're afraid and they're. They're struggling themselves. And seeing me going down having been having gone down this route further down this route than they have being jealous of that but also seeing. That I was after so much time and effort I was still wrong that's I think that's that's terrifying for them. So there's a lot of mixed emotions and they can't really they can't really handle it and. They just truly is about accepting people who for who they are. You know who I was when I was 20 is not who I am today. You know and. We grow we change we're different we learn absolutely and nobody really. Talks about this but the way you feel about transition will change over the course of one year two years five years a decade several decades. And there's kind of a honeymoon phase with each with each with each stage of with each part of the process. And I didn't really know about this until I went through all of it. And I'm just I'm just trying to to warn them now they're all they're all adults and I can't really their parents can't really do anything about them transitioning but I just. I'm worried for them and I don't want them to end up the same way. I am now where if not it's not worse. What what do you wish would have happened. If you had to replay it and you'd be like this is what should have happened. What what should that have been. I shouldn't have been allowed to medically transition at all. They. I wish there was more more thorough assessment more trust between me and. My health provider because there are some things that I can really trust the adults with unfortunately like the groping incident. How do you mean you couldn't trust an adult with that. I just felt like speaking about it would just make the situation risk and. Maybe that was kind of on me but. I don't know growing up I just kind of had like a sort of like a mistrust of the adults and even some of the people around me. So what is the compassionate thing to do. 13 year old. Let's start with the doctor. What is the compassion thing to do probe more and yes and. Bar them from any treatments. Okay. Until until they're until they're in a door and they're at a point in time when they're. In a mental state that that is healthy and they're able to. You know what I mean and able to consent. Right. You don't have anything else. Confuse it when you first go through puberty it is confusing already. What's the most compassionate thing a parent can do because your folks sound. Compassionate. What what what should I if you were my daughter. What should I do to show support and compassion. I mean really the best thing to do is to show them love without affirming the delusion. Tell them that they are not a boy and they never will be but you accept them as they are and there's nothing that they need to change about themselves. Right. But if you want to wear. I mean you wouldn't even have known but if I but if I did I still would go. Hey Leo but I would tell my daughter. Leo is is not a boy but unless I knew you will I wouldn't say that to you but I would tell my daughter. She's a she okay is that wrong to do that and not say I don't judge Leo. I I'm happy for Leo if Leo is happy but here's the truth. That's that's not compassionate in today's society that's wrong. But there's it's only the truth and okay there's nothing wrong with telling the truth. What do you say to people who say no pronouns whatever you pick. I have to say that because it's the only right thing to do. I just want you to be happy. Yeah it's it's complicated. I mean. That's really tough. I I refer to people by the name and the pronouns they they want me to but unless they go out of their way to like. Disrespect me right and like for instance I've never had a problem with Caitlin Jenner never don't have room. But that's an adult. Exactly. You know when a child or I'm sorry I'm just getting to the point where 25 years old is still a child to me but when somebody who hasn't really gone through life yet decides I'm Bambi a deer. I have a hard time but if you're 50 years old and you're I'm no I'm a furry animal. Whatever whatever that makes you happy. It's it's interesting that we're allowing kids and young adults to. Make these decisions that affect their overall health and their fertility when I mean. Why do you do a lot of people don't even know that they want to have kids until they're well into their 30s or 40s. I would if 15 years old if if of the sect me was a thing so I never had kids. Count me in. Yeah I remember the endocrinologist the one who affirmed me. Asked me like do you know that this treatment may affect your your fertility I was like. Well I don't want to have kids as I was 13. Yeah right. I don't know a kid that wants a kid. How's your safety. I mean it's don't don't tell me anything that you shouldn't I don't want to make it worse for you but do you. Fear for it at all. A little bit yes. I mean I haven't been like recognized in public but it might be to the point where I have to worry about that I mean I have. This my friends in my area who. Strongly disagree with me and they're not very friendly towards me. And and I mean all over all over the country there's people like that. Who. I mean I get I get really really hateful really violent threats sometimes. I had somebody make two accounts on Twitter just to tell me that they were making like a like a sex doll out of me basically. Out of my image. And some people like threaten threatened violence or like threatened to kill me or assault me. Just just for speaking out and giving my peace. Can you define what a woman is. Adult human female. But what does that mean. What does that mean. Well adult just means fully developed physically mentally and human. Almost a pins. I don't think I'll have to explain that but female just means that. You produce sir your body is. Centered around the production of the large meat the the over the eggs. It's not simple and just because you can't produce it. Doesn't mean. For reasons like menopause or being too young or having some sort of condition doesn't make you doesn't make you not female. That's just right. You're not able to. Right. Right. If you could go back and talk to your 11 year old self. And really have her listen. Try to put yourself where you were where you thought you knew. What would you say to her. That's a hard one. I feel like I would have a lot to say but I think the one the most. The one the. Important things would be. That. I mean. It's. In such an image oriented society it's kind of. Especially with the advent of social media it's really hard for young girls to. Really recognize this but I mean. Your worth is. So much more than your looks. I would tell her to. Spend a little less time off the off of the internet and social media go out a little bit more maybe. A few sports to. Really focus on. On something other than. My body and the internet and. Just so. It was really hard to make friends at the school I was at but I could have been a little closer with my family. I feel like I would have been a lot happier if I was. Talk to a parent. Your daughter or your son comes home and says. I don't know what I am but I think I'm in the wrong body. How do the parents deal with that. I mean. I think the conversation should start with them trying to get to understand each other and. Letting your child know that. You love them. But that there's there's absolutely nothing wrong with them that. There's no such thing as. I think that. I think that's. I think that's. I think that's. I think that's. I think that's. That's. That's. That there's no such thing as. Being born the wrong body and that they're. They're fine just as they are. But as a parent it's. Really important to get down to the bottom of why. Why they're feeling such a way and. Where they got the idea from and. Basically going from there chances are you might have to. Restrict their social media usage or take away their phones entirely. Poi I tell you. In some states. It's hard. California, you could be a gender denier and you'd have your child taken from you. Yeah. I actually know a few parents who have had their, who lost all custody of their children because they won't affirm their kids. Are they heroes or monsters? They're absolutely heroes. Because they fight for their kids. I have to tell you, I just love you so much. You are, you came in and you smiled and you, there are times that I can see deep sadness in you, but you are a delightful person. You really are great. Thank you. Yeah, thank you. Thank you. Thanks for coming in. Thank you for having me. God bless. Just a reminder, I'd love you to rate and subscribe to the podcast and pass us on to a friend so it can be discovered by other people."
