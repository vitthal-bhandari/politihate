    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast. Third hour of the program off and running. We are rolling through as we finish off the week 14 hours up. 15th hour now underway. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We are here in Salt Lake City and we are having a fantastic time. Going to be running around Park City over the course of the weekend. So if you see, you want to cat call us. We're talking earlier. We've never been cat called. Evidently, according to the She-Hulk new Marvel show, everybody has fired up about the idea of how difficult it is to be cat called. If you want a cat called Buck and I as we walk around, that would be easy for you to manage to do. We're looking forward to everything that is going on there. We've been trying to put into context all of the craziness that's going on as Democrats continue to try and defend what happened with the CDC. And as the White House is continuing to make brag, a docious comments, including from the chief of staff Ron clean about exactly what has been going on in the past few weeks of the Biden administration. We also have been discussing all of the craziness that has come out of the ongoing crisis surrounding the the the moral law go raid and what exactly is going to be transpiring there. And one thing that I think has certainly not gotten enough attention is how exactly wild things have gotten when it comes to all of these surgeries that are going on. Buck, if you've been paying a lot of attention, I have to this craziness about. Remember when they were saying early on, Oh, nobody under the age of 18 is having these gender affirmation surgeries. Nobody out there is making any sort of decisions that would lead to a 14 or a 15 year old actually getting surgery that could screw up their life potentially forever. And I got to give credit to Marjorie Taylor Green, who went on Tucker Carlson last night and said that she is arguing, and I think she's right about this, that kids under the age of 18 should not be able to have surgery to change their gender. And she's saying that a lot of people are not standing up and supporting her. She thinks it's a referendum on the Republican Party. I agree with her on this particular issue. Let's listen to cut four. You know, I should have every single Republican cosponsor, but unfortunately I don't yet only have five cosponsors. I'm talking to all of my colleagues and urging them because Tucker, let me tell you something. This is a referendum on the Republican Party with when we take back the majority. If the American people elect us, we need we have a lot of work to do. Not only do we need to impeach Merrick Garland, we need to clean out the corrupt FBI. We need to hold the Democrats accountable and defund all of their climate garbage. 87,000 IRS army. But there's one thing that we have got to do. And we're not even a party worth deserving of the American people's votes. If we cannot protect children from this horrific child abuse and create this to be a felony, because this practice has to end. It's the kind of things nightmares are made up. Percent right here. And the way that I would contextualize this is for those of you out there who have kids, we don't let kids make significant life choices when they are minors because we know that they are not fully developed and sometimes make awful choices. In fact, think about this for a minute now. We don't allow kids to go out and buy beer because we don't trust them to be able to make good choices when it comes to consuming alcohol until they are 21 years old. We don't let people rent cars until basically they are 25 years old because we don't even trust them to be able to rent a car. And we're letting 14 year olds decide that they want their genitals to be chopped off. And there are doctors that are doing this. This is absolutely indefensible. And the fact that Marjorie Taylor Greene only has a few sponsors is evidence of how crazy this has become that it's considered transphobic to say you should wait until you are 18 years old to make a decision about what gender you want to be. Now, look, I'm not claiming that after the age of 18, I think it's necessarily a brilliant move for a 19 year old to decide that they're going to change their gender. I think that's a challenging decision to make. But I would rather a 19 year old make that choice than a 14 year old. And to me, it is clear child abuse in order to be allowing these kids to have these surgeries, Buck. And that is why it is challenging in and of itself to have this going on in general in any way at all as it pertains to these kids having this surgery. And so the fact that Republicans are afraid of doing this is an unbelievable failure of honesty, of truth and of basic decency and understanding larger context of choices that are being made. It is a failure of epic magnitude that every Republican is not lining up behind Marjorie Taylor Greene here. And I want these questions to be asked of every Democrat out there. I want for Joe Biden to have to explain whether he thinks 14 year olds should be having genital mutilation surgery and whether that should be permissible to happen. I want that discussion to take place because I don't believe there's any parent out there at all that understands the importance of kids growing into adulthood. Just think about it. We don't let a 18 year old until they're 18 make a choice about whether or not they can go join the military. We don't let somebody make a choice until they're 21 about whether or not they're going to drink beer. We don't let somebody until they're 25 make a choice about whether or not they can rent a car and we're letting a 14 year old decide to have gender, gender genital mutilation surgery. It's just to me, one of the biggest flaws when it comes to the Republican party right now, that they have allowed transgender activists to so shame people into saying this. Now, I remember recently when Mario Lopez is a good dude, got in trouble. Do you guys remember this? When he said that he didn't believe a six year old should be able to choose their gender. He didn't think that made a lot of sense. And he got so castigated for that opinion that he walked back and apologized on it. And my thought was, how in the world is this something that anyone should have to apologize for? I was having that conversation with my wife. So what are you talking about that you would let a kid pick their gender when they're six years old. We don't even let kids pick what they eat for meals when they are six years old because they would have birthday cake and sugary, at least in my house, birthday cake every day that they could ice cream and they would have that for every meal. And the parental responsibility here is not to allow that to occur. So all of this, I think is a big deal here also is Marjorie Taylor green, announcing that she has proposed this bill. I told you she only had five co sponsors. Here's what it would do. It would make it a felony to chemically castrate and perform gender affirming surgeries on kids. I agree with her a hundred percent here. And I think every parent out there with a functional brain should agree with her as well. Listen to this. If we are willing to stand up and stop horrific things like child abuse and like so-called gender affirming care, which is really genital mutilation. It's puberty blockers that cause chemical castration. Teenage girls actually having their breasts chopped off. Teenage boys being castrated. This needs to be illegal and I'm introducing a bill called protect children's innocence act and it would create a law that would cause it to be a classy felony for any person involved in so-called gender affirming care. That means general mutilation surgery. That means hormones. That means puberty blockers, anything involving any, any youth under the age of 18, because these kids are too young to make these awful decisions that will affect them and will be permanent for the rest of their lives. So Marjorie Taylor green deserves credit here. And I understand some people get nervous because Marjorie Taylor green doesn't tip toe up to her opinions and everybody doesn't agree with every opinion that anybody has, but she's a hundred percent right here. And I wonder, I want everybody out there to be thinking about this. Why are there only five co-sponsors on this bill? Shouldn't anyone who really dives into these details agree that this genital mutilation where you are taking a girl and chopping off her breast when she is 14 years old, when you are taking a boy and you are chopping off his penis when he's 14 years old, this is craziness. And it appears now as more and more evidence is coming out that this is occurring everywhere. We need to have a national conversation about this. We need to have a national debate about at what age should you be able to make a choice like this? I just don't see this as a remotely difficult decision to make at all. And I think Marjorie Taylor green deserves a lot of credit for speaking out on this issue. All right, we're rolling through the final hour of the program. We're going to open up phone lines here. Usually take calls on Friday. I don't believe we've taken any calls so far. 1-800-282-2882. We will be ready to get some of your calls as we continue to close out the program. But I want to tell you, so many businesses out there are compelled to try and nickel and dime you these days. One of the side effects of living through the kind of inflation we're suffering right now and cell phone companies are some of the worst. They will take advantage of you to the best of their ability. They will charge you left and right as much as they possibly can. We've got to make sure that you end up with the right company and you're not right now.

We had to do a little troubleshooting here. Figured it all out. But Clay, I'm having a day, man. I know it's not Friday the 13th. It's Friday, August 19th. But you know, this morning kicked off. I was on the way to the studio and I'm staying in a hotel in downtown Salt Lake. All of the elevators, there are three elevators in this hotel. All three of them went out at the same time. How long were they? I probably waited for about 15 minutes before I called to the front desk. And people are just like, Oh, you just take the stairs. I got bags. You really want to carry your bags out. Fifteen flights of stairs, you know, first thing in the morning. So all the elevators are out. And then when we actually be there and they said, no, no, we'll get it. They get it to turn back on. Then they stop at every floor on the way down, which wasn't that big. Deal, except it just sort of compounded the insult, you know, because everybody was still waiting, trying to get on. So they were there were some. There was we stopped at empty floors. Oh, there was some malfunction. So the elevator stopped at every floor on the way down. Or maybe people, what might have happened is people had pressed the button on every floor and then decided to walk, but I had bags. Slash. I was being lazy, whatever. I did have six cupcakes last night. So, you know, you definitely needed the stairs. I needed the stairs. That is true. And then of course, my, my mic died here, but I did have my, should I not even bring up flights right now? Because I feel like all you do is jinx yourself. My flight out was perfect. Mine was perfect. And yours, unfortunately, how delayed? Three hours. I just at this point, I'm supposed to be in Atlanta next weekend. Um, and that's not that bad of a drive from Nashville, but the flight situation is such a disaster right now in this country. And they're talking about mayor Pete. If Biden doesn't run being a potential presidential candidate for the Democrats again, and I'm not sure that we've ever had a transportation secretary who has ever been at the helm for more of the failures to exist. We have a supply chain crisis. You can't fly anywhere right now, Buck. If your flight even takes off on the day it's scheduled in some way, you feel like you have won. I was down in Fort Lauderdale. They just canceled my flight. I spent four hours at the airport. Couldn't take off. Set three hours at the airport in Nashville. At least it's my hometown to fly out to Salt Lake. And I totally anticipated now that it's going to be a massive delay. And they finally started to admit that it's not weather. It is staffing problems because the airlines were going through this, this thing for a few weeks where they kept saying, Oh, there's weather one because it's harder for people to get mad at weather, although people still do. And two, I believe that there's less liability for them. If they declare it's a weather issue, then if they just can't get their stuff together. But I think it's funny because I remember tweeting out about this a few times and having a bunch of smart Alex, maybe you should check with the weatheries or whatever. And I'd say, guys, it's staffing. I was right. They were wrong. No one ever apologizes on Twitter. Clay, ever noticed that? Have you ever had someone reach out to you on Twitter who was writing a horrible stuff, but you're such a moron and then later be like, wow, the thing I was yelling at you for, you were a hundred percent right. If I had a nickel clay for every time, I'm telling you every now and then people in sports do that because sports is a great, uh, not really mad at you. Well, over sports, no, no, but I'm saying it's a great BS detector because unlike in many other parts of life, you say, Hey, I think Ohio State's going to be Michigan. And you would have been right about that a lot of years, except for the most extreme. But if you're wrong, then there's a three and a half hour football game that's played and there's an immediate referendum on right or wrong as it pertains to that game, immediate referendum. If you're gambling on it, which is why I love sports because it's a BS detector. You can determine whether or not there's going to be an outcome. Whereas what's frustrating so much oftentimes about politics right now is if you're totally wrong, like the Democrats are on defund the police or the border or Trump, they just wait so long. COVID we're seeing with the CDC now, they wait so long to acknowledge any wrongfulness and they constantly shift what they said. So for instance, they separate cause and effect. They slow roll the reality of what their decisions have done. Like COVID shots. Now there are a lot of people that are of the opinion, even though it's a complete lie, they say, well, they never told you that the COVID shot would stop you from getting or spreading COVID. No, no, that's exactly what they shifted the rationale to such an extent, even shifted the definition of what a vaccine is, Buck, that there are a lot of people out there right now who say, you're just not, you're not aware of what the COVID shot was designed to do. It's supposed to keep you from dying. And by the way, it's not even doing that. But that's how they shift the stories and there's no rational discussion of how much the lies really were. Two huge problems we have in our society today. Nobody ever debates anymore. Yeah. And nobody ever admits they're wrong anymore. And that's it. Admitting you're wrong when you're wrong is actually kind of cleansing. It's cathartic. It feels good. Nobody wants to do it anymore. Nobody will say this. I found out, Clay, anyway, it's all because the apology game is total BS in many respects. The people who want you to apologize don't actually care about your opinion. They just want to destroy you. That's what social media has created in many ways. Federal Reserve expected to raise rates again next month in September. Does that make it the fourth or fifth?

Dot org. Give them 10 minutes today. What is the worst three letter agency of the federal government right now? I got to tell you, people have very strong opinions on this. Not quite as strong as their favorite dog breed or ice cream flavor, but people do get very fired up about the worst three letter agency. I, of course, come from the CIA analyst cadre and left and never looked back. I've never worked at these other places, so I'm just covering them as all of you are from what they do from their actions. I would argue though, and I understand people right now are very upset at the FBI. But look, we always have to keep real here. Be honest, a lot of FBI field offices are do are going after people who do elder fraud, who are stealing the life savings of senior citizens through different scams. You know, there's a lot of FBI work going on day in and day out. You know, kidnapping stuff, all kinds of things, right? Child exploitation, FBI does some important things day in and day out. It's when the DC office and the political stuff comes into play that all of a sudden we're like, there's a big problem here. There is. But I would say, Clay, that there's a very strong case to be made that the CDC was really more, you know, it was almost like built for this moment of COVID, right? That's this is if we're watching the CDC, Super Bowl. That's right. The absolute CDC, Super Bowl. If we're watching the movie Armageddon, you know, the CDC is is NASA. When NASA is trying to figure out how to stop the asteroid from destroying the entire planet, right? This is like, this is what NASA is for. That that's what the CDC is for in this context. And I think you can make a serious argument that they got absolutely everything wrong, that they made everything worse during COVID, that they showed what a bunch of lib lunatics who really belong in the Wesley gender studies department were somehow running public health policy at the CDC and in state state health agencies in all blue states and a lot of red states around the country. And it's so bad that even the CDC itself has had to say, yeah, about our pandemic response. But don't worry. Fauci, the cleanup crew is on the way. The fauci is here to say, you know what accountability looks like clay? It's when a football team loses by eight touchdowns in the Super Bowl after promising you they would win. And then a year or two after the game says, maybe we called the wrong place. Here is Fauci saying, well, Lensky deserves praise for coming out and admitting that the CDC is a dumpster fire of crappy. Realizing and recognizing the shortcomings that have been there for quite a long time, long, anti dating Dr. Walensky's tenure. And I think it was the stress and the challenge of a historic pandemic that brought some of those deficiencies into sharp relief. I believe we should commend them for realizing that, particularly Dr. Walensky, there are very, very good people at the CDC. There was an issue with the culture of how they approach their responsibility as a public health agency that I think has now been recognized. So I'm actually optimistic that given the fact that the problems have now been recognized, that there's a pathway to making a very good organization much better. He's a delusional megalomaniac. I wish we could have a real accounting for what would have happened, Buck. If we had had someone who signed the Great Barrington Declaration, right? If Dr. Marty McCarry had been in charge of the CDC as COVID began. And if we had had by certainly May and June of 2020, somebody come out and just addressed the American public, maybe Rand Paul, right? We've talked about Senator Rand Paul from Kentucky about what a tremendous difference it would have made if he had been in charge of our COVID response. And they had come out and said, effectively, we can't do anything to stop this virus from spreading. You probably are going to get it. You may get it more than once. If you are immunocompromised, if you are elderly, it probably makes sense for you to limit your indoor exposure to many different people. Otherwise, we have to just keep American life going on. We cannot shut down the country. Certainly can't shut down schools, all those things. If we had we talked earlier making jokes about She-Hulk, but Marvel's big thing now is the multiverse, Buck. In other words, everything is going on. Many different versions. Is there a world in which the United States says, along with many other countries like Sweden, basically says we cannot shut down countries. What does everything look like if that had occurred in the United States? I think there'd be way more confidence in the CDC saying you have to have the individual responsibility to make the right choices for your family. And I wonder what it would have done to our beliefs and institutions in general, because Rochelle Walensky and the CDC to me, I don't trust anything they say about anything. They wouldn't stand up on a matter of science. To the teachers unions. That's right. OK, the CDC showed zero backbone when pushed on by the left wing in this country, by the Democrat Party, by the desire to first defeat Donald Trump and then to prop up Joe Biden and the lunatic vaccine and mask mandates that were entirely ineffective. And it's also amazing. You know what I'm getting a lot now? You know, I did a podcast. I did a podcast as a guest recently of Paul Reichhoff, who's an independent, right? He's not neither Republican or Democrat. And it's interesting because so many of the responses from from that audience and a lot of people think their independence are actually just lives who can't make good arguments, but so many of the responses are, well, all you do is criticize the CDC and Fauci. What else are we going to do? And I look at them and want to say, what else are we going to do? Not all of the things that I said, don't do this. At all stages of the pandemic, this this slide that people are telling themselves now that we had no choice. Oh, we had choices the whole time. We had this mash down our throats by evil little Fauci, by Walensky, by the CDC, the NIH, by the Lid Media, by Democrats, by leftists, by collectivists, by commies. They made us do all of this. It made not only no difference in terms of stopping the spread, it actually made everything worse in the aggregate. We would have done far better off buck if we had never done. Now they just now they want to make really even dumber arguments. Well, we had no choice. Yeah, we did. And you all made the wrong choices, libs. The libs made the wrong choices. The double maskers, they should feel ashamed at how duped and dumb they were. This was reckless. It was wrong. And we have our first opportunity to vote based on this. That's why when I see the generic ballot, Republican, everything going this direction, I'm saying, well, what are people need to see? They want to do this with climate change, Clay. They're trying to shut down farmers. They want to feed you bugs. You think this collectivist insanity of shutting down churches and controlling every aspect of your life is going to stop now that COVID has become a cold. I think what's going on with generic ballots, first of all, everybody should vote based on COVID and the failures of the Democrats because that's the purpose of democracy. There should be consequences for getting things right and getting things wrong. And right now, what I think is going on is buck, things were so bad with inflation, with the border, with crime, people become a nerd to it. They just expect that that's what's going on right now. And you're angry as things get worse. But when they hit the bottom, you've reached the bottom and there's the sort of acceptance that goes on with it. And sometimes you get that dead cat bounce when you hit the bottom. And I think Biden right now is getting that dead cat bounce. It's not going to change anything. Everything is still worse. The Biden's touch is real. But I think a lot of Americans are so used to the awfulness of the Biden regime that there's a little bit of bounce back performance right now for Joe Biden. Can I your top three worst three letter federal agencies? What what is in your pantheon of the worst? CDC is number one, right? Me too. I can't trust one. What do you put it to in three? I would probably put the I RS at two because I think they are just so utterly incompetent and I and I dislike the way that they run their business because partly the IRS anger is a function of my anger anger at the tax code in general because it's so broken. And then I probably would put I think your point on the FBI is a good one. There are a lot there aren't a lot of FBI agents walking away, but there are a lot of FBI agents who are investigating crimes that matter and they're being snowed under relative to the incompetence surrounding the Trump and Trump Trump investigations. I'd probably go those three in order. I'd throw the EPA probably at number two just because when you see what they really do and the green agenda stuff, we all want clean water. I got no problem with clean water. I got no problem with making sure there's no lead in people's drinking water. That's great. Sign me on for that. CO2 emissions as an urgent national matter, which is what the EPA is focused on is as lunacy. So I go I go probably CDC number one, EPA number two and you know the IRS. Yeah, the tax code is awful, but that's actually Congress's fault. This is why I think there's a little bit of misguided blame, I think there, but somebody has to get my ire and the fact that the IRS is so bad at what they do, I think in terms of enforcing the tax code. But yes, it's Congress's fault to have built this tens of thousands of pages, a monstrosity of a tax code that then a bunch of bureaucrats have to enforce. I think by the way, I would knock the FBI out as angry as the TSA really infuriates me. Really? I'm TSA. I don't know, man. We got a lot of TSA folks to listen. I don't begrudge people for working at the TSA. I don't think the TSA makes very much difference. I think you could do a better private agency version of the TSA. And I think where the airlines do private security and bring in a lot of people, if they're qualified and have done a good job from TSA into those roles, essentially think of it like to black waterize the TSA. So you have you know, you know, you know, water them. Yeah, yeah, for sure. Contractors, yeah. I think the TSA, first of all, like taking my shoes off is not making anybody safer. Taking my laptop out. I don't believe it's making anybody safer. I just don't buy that much of what is going on as it pertains to the TSA rules and regulations. Actually, it's a dirty theater. I totally agree with you, but I've got that thing now where they scan your eyeballs. Let me tell you, works like a charm. What is that? That is clear clear. It's great. It's great. They don't do that for kids. So it doesn't really make much difference for me. I'm trying to hold my kids off. I'm flying in coach here and back. I'm not a fancy guy, but it's called like a hundred bucks a year, by the way, for the clear thing. But when you when you see that line of all those people and then you're told the clear is shut down, you have to go stand. You just feel like, man, I'm in I'm in the peasant line today, Clay. It's rough. It's rough. I know. Yes. Makes me sad. You've got to read, I think, for you. I think I think we're trying to make money here to close out. I think we have a read here. We do clay.

When I think our hosts said K and RS out in Salt Lake City, the past couple of days here in studio headed up to Park City should have an awesome time there through the weekend. Buck and I are doing an event up there together. Sided to hang out with everyone there. Buddy Jesse Kelly in the mix. Also a excellent radio show host. That's right. Another member of the premier mafia. So I don't know if he can dunk, but as he is seven foot four, I think he should be able to. Yeah, there's no doubt it should be it should be possible for him given his advantages. We have negative ups like negative hops and you still be able to dunk a basketball. We were talking we're making some fun of Shee Hawke and we've got some calls rolling in, but for obviously not surprising a vast array of different subjects. So I thought we'd close it out since it's Friday with some calls and I want to start with Maria in Flamborough, North Carolina. Is that right? Flamborough? Where is Flamborough Maria? It's it's Swan's borough. Swansboro. All right. I was told Flamborough and I was flambero sounds awesome. Flamborough sounds like the kind of place that no telling what happened. So you wanted to talk about being cat called? Yes. I mean, I'm an older woman now, but when I was young, I was very pretty and I got cat called a lot and I hated it. And I defined cat calling as obnoxious whistling, yelling out, baby, come over here. That kind of thing. And I absolutely hated it. But on the other hand, there were also those gentlemen that would say was I was walking by, wow, you are pretty young lady. You just made my day. You you were looking so good today. You are so beautiful and I love this. That was that's a compliment. So it is interesting. She's saying compliment versus cat call is a dichotomy. We should all understand. Do you think that Buck and I will ever get cat called? I've been working out, Clay. I just I do. I mean, you wear the right shirt and you wear the right pants and you wear the right shoes. Do we lose? She's like, I'm out. Do you think there is a single man who is listening to us right now that has been cat called more than once by women? I don't mean cat called me like, hey, you're outside of a bar and there's some drunk girls like on a bachelorette party or something and you're walking by. I mean, like a woman was at her job because like construction workers, cat call, right? Like they're out, you know, working on whatever the building is. Good looking girl walks by. Is there any female profession where they cat call men? I mean, probably a place where the men are dancing the chit chippendales, right? Yeah, yeah. That's just a call. But if you're a stripper, I mean, it's not right. I think it's kind of a you ask. I think it's probably accepted. Like I don't think strippers who are women are like, oh, I was so disrespected when the men that I was stripping for were cat calling me. I mean, you're just walking down the street. You're a dude. If you get cat called, no guys are different than girls, man. This is one of our. I would be so utterly flattered if somebody were like, man, you're looking crap. I mean, that's obviously a male voice. But if there was a woman who was like, man, you're looking incredible. I would I would be like in disbelief if that happened. Yeah, no, I mean, see, this is where we could use Jordan. Peter seemed like you bloody well better understand the difference men think about six or a hundred times a day. We've been thinking about it. Oh, I don't know. Bloody well computed yourself. So there you go. Even the caller she called us it. She said I used to be, you know, she's older now. She said I was incredibly good looking when I was younger. That's pretty good confidence. I like this wagger. I like this wagger for sure. But it's in if you haven't, if you missed any part of the show, subscribe to Clay and Buck podcast. That's a great way to check in on the latest that we've got going on for all of you and also have a great weekend, man. We're going to come back on Monday. Fire up. I want to be down in Miami in Florida, the free state of are you anywhere cool or you just home in Tennessee, I'm home all week. And then soon after that, I will be on the road, get him ready for the college football season every weekend throughout the fall. Probably crossing paths with a lot of you out there. Cannot wait. Thanks to everybody at K and R S in Salt Lake City. Been a great end of the week. Play Travis and Buck Sexton on the front lines of truth."
