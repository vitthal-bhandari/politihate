    "text": " Informed Descends. The intersection of healthcare and politics with Dr. Jeff Markey and Dr. Mark McDonald. Well Mark, great to be with you on another episode of Informed Descent, available on all podcast outlets including Spotify and Apple Podcast. How you doing? Feels like it's been ages. So we've got a great guest tonight and that is Dr. Miriam Grossman. And boy she's been doing some work for a while and specifically talking about the dangers and falsehoods of the sexuality and gender industry. She's been doing this since 2006. So Dr. Grossman, welcome to Informed Descent. Great to have you. Boy this is really a hot topic. I don't know if you watched Tucker, but he was blowing up this whole nonsense of gender affirming surgery and permanent things that they're doing at a whole host of institutions around the country on minor children. It's one thing if you're an adult, but it's a whole nother thing if you're a minor and that's what's going on. And of course I'm in the education industry. I started at charter school a couple years ago. My wife's on the county board of education and we're seeing that as well. Parents opting out of schools because of the over-sexualization of the children and just this nonsense of some of this. Gender identity, garbage literally that's going on in schools. Meanwhile our kids can't read and write at grade level, but they're woke as hell. So tell us about your experience and what you're trying to expose. It's been a number of years since I have felt like I'm living in a parallel universe. And as time moves on, those, that universe that I'm in, it seems to be moving further and further away from the other universe. I first got into studying what's in our sex education when I was working at UCLA as a psychiatrist at their student counseling center. And that was, I don't know, 12, 15 years ago. And it became clear to me that a lot of the kids that were coming in, especially the young women with emotional problems, anxiety, depression, were suffering because of the sexual decisions that they had made. A third of them at least had a sexually transmitted infection. Many of them more than one. They would go frequently for pregnancy tests, abortions, multiple abortions, to say nothing of the distress that they might feel after their hookup partner ended up having no interest in them whatsoever. And they wondered what was wrong with them for feeling attached to someone that they had had sex with a number of times. So, imagine that. I went and looked at what young people were being taught by organizations such as Planned Parenthood, Secus, Advocates for Youth and other places, and I guess Secus, Sexuality, Information and Educational Council of the US sounds like a government organization, but it is not. They now call themselves sex ed for social change, which they changed their names some time ago, which I think is very good because I like that it's just out in the open that their focus and their goal is social change. It's not health, it's social change. So, it became very clear to me as I looked for them at the material that they make for kids, that they write for kids, and I have to underscore that, that what we have to do, those of us that are concerned about this, is look at the material that's actually put in front of the eyes of young of children and teenagers. You can't just read like the mission statement of the organization, you can't just read the claims that they make about being concerned about the child's health and the child's well-being and giving them medically accurate information and being comprehensive. You have to go and look at exactly what they're being told. And when I did that, I discovered all sorts of stuff. Among, well, I don't know how much of the stuff you want me to go into, but let me just say that I ended up writing a book called Unprotected, and that was a book about the students that I was seeing at UCLA and how the radical social agendas in my profession in psychiatry, in medicine in general, were harming my patients. So that was my first book, Unprotected. I wrote it anonymously, but right after it came out, I did put my name to it, and when it came out as a paperback, it had my name on it, and I'm very proud of it. But at the time that I wrote it, I was rather terrified. I felt very isolated. I didn't know how it would be received, and that's why I didn't put my name on it to begin with. And Dr. Grossman, you're a child psychiatrist. Are you actually practicing and seeing patients? Oh, yes. I certainly am. And what's the feedback from patients when you express your opinions and you see some of this coming your way? Parents contact me because they're aware of the work that I've done. I've also spoken out quite a bit against the gender, the way that kids are being indoctrinated with all sorts of ideas about gender that are not based in hard science. And I know that the two of you and your audience, of course, is very well aware of what's going on right now in our society and how small kids are being told that there's such a thing as gender, and it's completely separate from the biological sex and that you can choose whether you're going to be a boy or a girl, and so on and so forth. So I've spoken out against that. So the families that contact me are very happy with my positions. Now, I know Mark has lost patients as a result of speaking out and not going along with some of this, you know, basically pop psychology that's going on and is very destructive. Have you had that experience as well? Yes, I've had patients who discover my presence online or discover that I was in Matt Walsh's documentary and they refuse to talk to me. What's been the feedback that you've gotten so from schools, for example, as you speak out against many of the educational topics that are going on? Well, mine, I don't have any schools that contact me. There's individuals that email me and write nasty things. But overall, I have a huge amount of support. I mean, I have so many. After the documentary came out with Matt Walsh, I was really flooded with a tremendous amount of support from all kinds of people, but especially I want to highlight the support that I got from the community. I got from medical students, people doing their residency, pre-med students writing in and saying, you know, I'm not sure that I want to be a doctor now because there's so much, you know, politics in the profession. I was a social worker, a psychologist writing in and saying, you know, I didn't know there was anyone that was brave enough to speak up. You know, guide me. Can you point me in the right direction? I actually was contacted by enough medical students and people in their residency and early in their medical careers to put them in touch with each other. So that they could form, you know, their own support network. And Mark, are you seeing kind of a similar experience in your practice? What I was thinking about is how aggressive and violent the transgender activist society is. It's a very small number of people, but they're incredibly aggressive and they are, they're very powerful. They can shut down corporations with eight or nine tweets and a protest march in front of the CEO's office with five or six people. And if you get on the radar of these people, they will do absolutely everything to destroy you. I fortunately have not had that happen to me yet, even though I'm very outspoken on this issue. And most of the people, nearly all, that respond to me, parents, school officials are very supportive because this is truly an atrocity. This is not a political issue. This is really, in my view, a battle over good and evil. It's that basic. They're diabolical. Anyone that abuses and mutilates children is criminal, in my view. And yet, most Americans have really remained silent on this issue, largely because they're scared. The Miriam Webster Dictionary just redefined the word male in July to holding a gender identity opposite of that of female. That's the new definition in the Miriam Webster online dictionary. It's July 22nd, I believe, is when they redefined male. They also redefined female in the opposite way to hold a gender identity opposite of male. So the gamete, genitalia definition, biological reproduction is gone from that dictionary. If you have the physical dictionary, obviously you still have it, but online, everything changed. And everyone goes online now, no one has a dictionary in their bookshelf if they're under 40 years old. So I am hopeful from what you just said that there's actually an unspoken voice that's much louder than the people who are screaming right now, that are in this small minority who are doing all the damage. And I think that if you and others who are outspoken in taking risks can encourage that voice to come out and to be vocal and loud, I think that the battle is very easily won. It's just that right now, there is a very small minority who are intimidating and scaring the majority into silence. I agree with everything you've said. I think though that the man on the street doesn't know what's going on, at least not until very recently. This is going on a long time. We've been teaching kids that gender is distinct from sex since the 90s. So it's been around for a long time. We've been, sex educators have been telling little kids that sex is between the legs and genders between the ears, and they are not related to each other whatsoever. Now mind you, the real science, the hard science gives us overwhelming evidence in the opposite direction. You know, the hard science, and there is, as you're probably aware, a new medical specialty called gender-specific medicine. It really should be called sex-specific medicine. They're using the word gender incorrectly there. But there's a specialty called gender-specific medicine, and it focuses specifically on the far-reaching, massively powerful effects of the genome on every system of the body. And it highlights the differences in cardiac disease, kidney disease, cancer treatments, and development of new pharmaceuticals, and burn patients, infectious disease. Every area, let alone the brain. I mean, every area of medicine is impacted by whether the patient is male or female, and by that I don't mean their identity as male or female. I mean their actual biology as male or female. That sounds like a threat to the trans movement, because that's a reinforcement of biological difference, which is exactly what they're opposed to. Yes, you see, science itself, hard science itself, is transphobic. And that's what, you know, they're up against. And in the end, of course, they will lose. Mother nature will win, or if you would like to say, I don't know, mother nature, God, whatever your particular belief might be. Mine is God. But God, mother nature, hard science is going to win. It's just a question of the body count. The body count is very, very high. From where I'm standing, and it's just getting higher. Yeah, it really is. Fortunately, I think there is of late publicity about this, not so much in legacy media, but at least word is getting out, and parents are realizing what's going on as well. So hopefully, with your leadership and others, your books that you're writing, your lectures that you're giving, and so forth, that more and more people are waking up to what is going on in our schools, in many of our medical communities, and will play more of an active role. I had a patient recently saw a pediatrician, a well child check, a little kid, I want to say, 10, 11 years old, and mom was asked to step out of the room. And mom said, no, I'm not going to step out of the room. It's my kid. It's a minor. I want to be here and hear the conversation. So pediatrician said fine. And as mom is sitting there, the pediatrician quizzed her on her sexuality and her gender and her pronouns. And about halfway through this discussion, mom grabbed the kid and said, we are out of here. You're not having that discussion with my child. That's something for parents to discuss, not their pediatrician, and we will never come back again. And they left the pediatrician's office. But I'm sure most parents are just deferential to the physician and their degree. And if the physician says, I want to talk to your kid without you, they're like, okay, you know, that's fine. I'll wait in the waiting room. And parents need to wake up to that. It's not right. They need to protect their children. And too many in the medical community are buying into this crap. And it's harmful. And it's dangerous. And it needs to stop. The thing is, I'd like to hear from the two of you. How do you think we can make change on the level of the professional organizations? Because, you know, in medicine, there's a chain of trust. And, you know, we were all trained to just, you know, follow the guidelines and follow the policy statements of our professional organizations. But our organizations have been captured. And so they're putting out guidelines that are not based in good, solid research. They're based in ideology. So I would like to hear if I'm allowed to ask you guys questions. Of course you can. You know, I think the reality is, no, I don't think we can change the professional organizations. We need to create new ones. So there's the AAPS, the Association of American Physicians and Surgeons. And there's, you know, thousands and thousands of members of that. The American Medical Association pretends like they represent all the physicians in the United States. Their enrollment and membership is declining. I think it's, last I read, it's something like only 15% of physicians are members of the AMA. Even specialty boards, you know, the American Academy of Family Practice. I'm no longer a member. I'm no longer board certified by this specialty board because of the craziness. And instead there's the National Board of Physicians and Surgeons, which is a new emerging growing specialty board that will board certified you based on, you know, common sense things of CMA and so, CME and so forth. So I don't know that we can change these, you know, traditional professional organizations like even, you know, there's the senior citizen organization, you know, what's it called? AARP. And then there's now a competing one that's come out that's, you know, right of center. And so I think that's how I think that's how we need to approach this. Yeah, the American College of Pediatricians, of course. And I wish we could approach it in that way. I guess I need to be more hopeful. But as I speak to my colleagues, even though they are very, very distressed about what's going on with the transgender push. They don't, you know, they work for, they don't, they don't want to lose their jobs. And so they're not speaking out. And I'm very pleased to be able to meet and talk to the two of you. It does give me hope. But as long as the professional organizations are captured and they're putting out statements and they're acting as if there's a consensus as if the science is settled and that every single, you know, child psychiatrist in the entire country is behind their pronouncements about affirmative, so-called affirmative care. You know, this is this is very uphill. Yeah, I mean, last night I think it was I think it was Vanderbilt last night that Tucker called out that were right on their website. They acknowledged that there isn't science behind surgeries on minors for sex reassignment that they're relying on consensus opinion from experts. And it's ridiculous because these poor kids are being mutilated. The damage is permanent. It can't be reversed. And it should be outlawed that we allow a minor child to have an operation to remove their breasts or do a hysterectomy or a young male remove his penis. I mean, it's just, it's, it's, it's archaic. It's, it's Nazi-like. And we just shouldn't allow it to happen. Well, I guess we're all preaching to the choir here. We're all on the same page. What's next? I think doctors need to go independent. And I think that both the organizations and the corporations need to be vacated. Meaning I think doctors need to get back to individual practice, group practice, and they need to form, as Jeff was saying, an organized new organizations. As an example of that, you know, Dr. Simone Gold is creating a new network of physicians out of Florida, some of whom are doing remote work. I know a lot of physicians have left Kaiser, which is one of the most extreme top-down corporations that essentially enslave their employees. I know one that I just did a workers' copy of El-An recently, who refused to get the injection for religious reasons, and then caught the Wuhan virus and was put in the ICU where he was treated as a lawyer. And in the ICU, they just gave him water and time and all. And after three days, sent him home and said, if you can't breathe, call us and we'll bring you to the emergency room. Well, after he recovered, a guy is a marathon runner, a very healthy guy. After he recovered, he was told that he wouldn't be allowed to go back to work without his vaccination, even though he now had circulating antibodies. And he had to leave the company, and now he can't be rehired because he's considered disabled. So I think that if enough people can leave these corporations and stop being employees, there may actually be enough freedom of movement to form new groups. But the American Psychiatric Association is lost. Gender Identity Disorder is now gender dysphoria, and in two years with the new DSM coming out, it will be gender incongruity disorder. So there's no way, I don't believe, I agree with Jeff, I don't believe there's any way to fix these groups and these corporations. I think they're a lost cause, and I think we need to start a parallel competitive marketplace of doctors, ideas and work. And I don't have confidence in groups, I don't have confidence in corporations, but I do have confidence in the competitive marketplace of ideas and of good service. And I do believe that most Americans want that, and I think that the other side will lose if there is a viable alternative that is accessible. That's what I believe. And I just want to say I'm sure, Mark, that you're aware of the incredible demand for non-affirming or, let's say, gender exploratory therapists for kids. You know, parents are just, I don't know, the suffering of the parents is really not like, I've been practicing psychiatry for almost 40 years, and I've seen a lot of terrible things. But the parents of kids with rapid onset gender dysphoria who are indoctrinated and believe that their homes are unsafe and toxic to them, and these parents are the most devoted, wonderful parents one could imagine, they're suffering over this. And their terror over what's going to happen to their sons and daughters if they get their hands on hormones and surgeries. I don't know if I've seen anything like this before, this degree of, you know, because they feel like the whole world is against them. And they say to me, you know, sometimes I wish my child had cancer because then I would have support from everybody, but my child says they're transgender and I've lost, you know, my family, my sister, my neighbors, my friends from college, my pediatrician, the teachers at the school, and sometimes their marriages, they lose their marriages over this. Sure, it's almost the equivalent of, you know, bleeding people to heal them in the 1800s. You know, we just don't have science to support what's going on. And boy, I hope more parents and physicians speak up. You know, we've got a large audience, and this is not unique to the United States, this is going on around the world. What's your message to parents that are listening? What should they look out for and how do they stand up for their children? Just in general regarding parenting during this day and age, you cannot send your child, your child is like a sponge. You have to, you can't just send your child out into the world to be exposed to willy-nilly to all the ideas that are out there, dangerous ideas. You have to inoculate your child against these dangerous ideas. Children need to make sense of the world. Children need to have some sort of framework to understand the world, to know who they are, to know what's right and wrong, to know what's true and not true. And so you have to start early in doing that. If you don't have a framework like that to provide to your child, to your family, frankly, you know, there's plenty of people just waiting at your door, waiting on YouTube and waiting on Tumblr that it will be more than happy to recruit your child and indoctrinate your child into the world view that is their world view. And that world view might very well teach the child that their parents don't know anything and that they're toxic and dangerous and that they need to find a different family. So that's my advice. Yeah, I think that's really good advice. So as we wrap up, how can people find you if they want to follow the work that you're doing? Well, I have a website which is MiriamGrossmanMD.com. And on there are a lot of the articles and podcasts that I've been on, articles that I've written, lectures that I've given. And then I'm also on Twitter, although I don't tweet that often. Miriam underscore Grossman. I wrote two books. The first one is called Unprotected. A campus psychiatrist reveals how political correctness in her profession endangers every student. I thought the title was too long, but it didn't matter. They did it anyway. And the second one, yeah. The second one is called Your Teaching My Child What? A physician exposes the lives of sex education. I like that. Well, listen, it's an honor to have you on our podcast. Thank you so much for the great work that you're doing. Godspeed to you, and we look forward to following the work that you're doing. Thank you. Thanks for having me. Thank you. You've been listening to Informed Descent with Dr. Jeff Markey, Board-certified primary care physician, and Dr. Mark McDonald, Board-certified child adolescent and adult psychiatrist. Informed Descent, the intersection of healthcare and politics. Thank you."
