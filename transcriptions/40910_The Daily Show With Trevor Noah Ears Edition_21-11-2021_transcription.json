    "text": " You're listening to Comedy Central. Wherever in the world you are, I pray that the signal from this radio is reaching you. I don't know how long I have until that German finds me. But until he does, I will not be silenced. I'll help you ordinate again tomorrow. All the right we cannot see, now streaming only on Netflix. Going away? Welcome to the show. Man, thank you. I'm good to have you here with like, you know, a book that I didn't know what to expect when I started reading it. But it feels like a memoir in pictures. It feels like a story of your life and some of you in a monologue thoughts. Like, what inspired this version of the book? It is. That's exactly what it is. I didn't want to go at it from a standpoint of like, just words on a paper. I've done it once. And it was great. But like this time, sitting down thinking about my responsibility in my role, and I take it very seriously as a public figure. And, you know, just understanding that little doings need something to see. You know, like reading something is great, but when they can actually see the image of something, of someone, I think that right there is more powerful. So for me, it was important that I show the human side of, you know, what people look at as an athlete. Because they might be an athlete. OK. But I'm a human. And so I wanted to show a little bit of that. Yeah, it's a beautiful book divided into quarters, you know. You know, like your life has been this game that you've been playing out. I was a little disappointed because I was like, well, it can't be four quarters because your life's not finished yet. So then the next one's going to be overtime. You realize that, right? They're bigger that. I didn't think I'd write another book. This is going to be like this is it. Your life is, do you ever think about that as an athlete? It's like, you know, a lot of the time for athletes and for the public, sometimes your life ends when your career ends. You know, do you ever think about that? And and and how hard it is to think about your next journey as a human being? I mean, I know, you know, you're a husband, you're a dad, you're a businessman now. But will you ever worried was there a moment where you were like, man, who is Dwayne Wade without the ball? Who's doing Wade without the hoops? 1000% mean basketball is what I know, right? From the standpoint of focus my whole life on trying to be great. If you're trying to be great at something you understand it, it takes all of your your attention. It takes all of your time. And once I got to like my last year when I was like, all right, I think I'm ready to walk away. I was like, what am I going to do next? And everybody tells you along the way, you're going to be fine. You're going to have so many things going on. And you're like, how, where? And, you know, I took a few took a few months off, maybe like two to three months. And then I just say, you know what? Talk on my team and let's say let's get back to it. Let's just hit the ground runner. Let's take meetings and let's just see. Let's see what my interests lies because I didn't know, you know, all I know is I love the game of basketball and I enjoy business and I enjoy making money. I enjoy creating things. I enjoy designing things. So for me, it was like, let's find what the next step is. So I feel that I'm in my rookie season in life again. I'm in a pregame. I'm in a pregame again. And in this new step, this new walk. If I had guessed before reading the book and someone said to me, okay, what are Duane Wade's passions? I would have gone, okay, basketball is definitely one of them. I would have said fashion is definitely one of them. Yes. You know, Duane Wade's never been afraid to take a chance. You know, I would have said wine is one of them. Yes. You know, but one thing I would have never said before reading the book was karaoke. Oh, listen. You're a humble person, but the one thing you have no humility about, you call yourself the greatest karaoke singer in the league. Well, when I was in a league, now I'm out of league, I'm on the go. Oh, you're just the go. It's not that I can sing. I cannot sing to save my life. It's that I will get up on stage anywhere to sing karaoke. Like I go to local bars and just jump on stage. That's the kind of person I am. Wow. I got to know the song, but you know what I mean? Yeah, but you just I do it anywhere. I do it anywhere. Do you have a favorite song? Like what is like Duane Wade's? Well, my wife told me I need a new song because I've been doing the same one for about six, seven years. What's that song? My tell joy. And this is how, you know, it's easy. Why I like my my tell joy because it brings the energy. I hear you. Everybody know the words. Even if you don't know the words, you know some of the words. And so it's kind of crowd participation. I'll have the same. I can deep voice it. So, but yeah, I love it, man. I love it. I did like the human side of your story with LeBron. You know, I wasn't in I wasn't in the US when when the whole move to Miami happened. I wasn't in the US for that chaos. What do you think was the biggest thing that people missed from LeBron coming to Miami? You know, you you you share a few thoughts in the book that I really enjoyed, you know, the conversation you had, what were you trying to you were trying to achieve? What do you think people missed in that story? What do you think that, you know, people just didn't understand about that move and the big three? Well, I mean, I'm sure it's a lot that that people didn't understand. I mean, as athletes, you know, you're you're touted as one of the the goods and the greats in the game. They say these are the things you have to accomplish. You have to get rings. You have to get in repeat. Like it's all these things. And so you can't knock someone for for listening to that and going on and making sure that you put the best team around you, right to win. And so I think at that time, you know, I was I had one championship at 24. I've been losing, losing, losing, losing. I was tired of that LeBron, you know, for seven years. Just, you know, he's got he got close ones, but he was ready to like get over that hump. Right. Chris Bost was a merchant star in Toronto. And he was ready to get a little bit more light, a little bit more attention. So I just feel like man, just to be young and to decide as young man that we want to do this as friends. We understood at that moment that we were shifting the culture of what an NBA was. Yeah, it has will never be the same. Yeah, player empowerment. That's what they're moving about. Your life has been one that is filled with both tragedy and triumph. I can't help wondering if that's why you've been as dedicated to your family as you have been. You know, it feels like Dwayne Wade has gone like I want to win championships on the court, but I want to win championships at home as well. And you know, I see that, you know, with, for instance, your son's idea was playing in the game now. Yeah. I've seen your face light up when you play against him. And I've also seen like the journey that you've been on with your daughter and just like talking through the challenges of having a child who's trans and learning about it. And I want to know a little bit more about that. Everyone thinks the journey to understanding trans people and the conversation happens overnight. It wasn't overnight for you. No. And you had to learn if you were to talk to another parent out there or somebody who just goes like, Dwayne, this is just, I don't get this is wrong. This is, I don't get it. I want help you to begin to understand so that you could be the best parent to her. Well, I think when things happen personally to you, when you have a personal connection to something or someone, you take it a little bit more serious. And but when it happens to you, you have to, you have to look it in the face. You have to, you know, write on like my daughter looking at me across the table. I have to, this is somebody to deal with, right? In the sense of, I don't know everything. You know, and as a parent, you want to make sure that your kids come and you have answers. You know what I mean? You have the right words. You have the right, you know, support, whatever it is, you have the right motivation. And so at that moment, I had no answers. The only answer that I knew and that I had that this was my child, I love them and I hate the pain that my child is in. Wow. Right. You know, seeing, seeing the pain of, you know, not being able to feel, feel, you know, confident and comfortable in who you are. Right. And so I don't want to see no one live like that, no one you love. And so immediately when it's the hug and embrace and you see the just the light, like I seek Ziya's light. And for me to, to be in a place where I'm not trying to dim her light, I'm trying to move out the way and let her get all the light. I just see a beautiful, you know, blossoming, 14 year old girl who's, you know, trying to find, you know, trying to pass her, her, her test at school, just like everybody else. She's trying to find friends that are new. You know, this year going back to school like everyone else. And you know, my wife and I, you know, our whole role and our whole job. And we understand this is, you know, to provide, to protect, to love, to facilitate. You know, we have all these rules. It's not to, to, to own. It's not to say you're going to be this and you're going to do that. Right. It's to find out who they are. So I know what their likes and, you know, and what are their dislikes and try to help them, you know, through life, you know, either best they can find themselves. It's not about us. You know what I mean? It's not about us. It's hard to accept this apparent, man. But you're doing it. Dwayne Wade, thank you again for joining me on the show. Congratulations.
