    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us as we roll through what is, as always, a bit of a wild ride into the world. Every day feels like things crazy that you don't necessarily anticipate. We got Chris Christie and we also have Mike Pence joining the race this week. We will discuss the impact of what might transpire there, but we tease this off the top. Buck and I'm going to give you a little bit of a background. I bet there's a lot of questions about this. 800-282-2882. The PGA and the Live Golf Tour are merging. I would describe this as blockbuster news that came down about 10 a.m. Eastern this morning. Here's a good question for you right off the top. Buck, what percentage of our audience do you think are golfers? 30? 40? Yeah, 30% maybe. I think it's a pretty high percentage. So I think there's a lot of you that are fascinated by this story. For those of you who are not, let me give you... Is that crazy about this 30 way too high or is that that seems about right? I think right? Probably. I would think that there is a massive overlap between this show and golf. If I had to bet on any sport... Obviously the NFL is huge, college football is huge. Football in general in this country is huge, but if I had to bet, I would put a lot of money on there being a huge number of you, even that are listening to us right now as you drive to or from the golf course, as you get out and work on the range, I would think there is a huge overlap. I know for a fact that outkick and the golf universe are basically one and the same, right? There's just a huge overlap of people that are interested in golf and also read outkick on a regular basis. So, Buck, let me tie it into Trump here off the top. You and I last year in July were with Trump at Bedminster for the Live Golf event. I played the Live Golf event there. Let me give you a little bit. I don't know that I said this on the show. I stayed at the Live Golf Hotel the night before the Live Golf program, right? I played with Brooks Kepka. I nearly killed him with one of my errant shots. He's lucky to be alive. I think he's going to be a father now, so I'm glad I didn't end his bid for fatherhood when he almost got blindsided by one of my awful shots out there at Bedminster. But the reason why I bring this up is the night before the tournament officially got underway, I was sitting at the bar at the hotel and all of these, you remember this, Buck? All of these 911 protesters walked in and they were saying that anybody who had gone to work at Live was taking blood money, that this was unacceptable. And I was sitting at the bar just having a beer with several different Live Golf executives and players. And a couple of these dudes came in and they were like, oh, you're, you're going to play in this course. Don't you feel awful for yourself? How could you take blood money? First of all, I wasn't being paid anything. I was just playing in the course and we were doing our show with Trump. And I believe we have audio of PGA tour commissioner Jay Monahan effectively saying anybody that went to work for Live was standing alongside of the 911 terrorist effectively. Here's that audio. Well, I talked to players. I've talked at a player meeting and I've talked to a number of players individually for a long period of time. And I think you'd have to be living under a rock to not know that there are significant implications. And as it relates to the families of 911, I have two families that are close to me that lost loved ones. And so my heart goes out to them. And I would ask, you know, any player that has left or any player that would ever consider leaving, have you ever had to apologize for being a member of the PGA tour? Okay, Bach, I mean, that's pretty aggressive to say basically you're turning your back on 911 victims if you're deciding to play on the live tour. Here's what's significant. There are reports that a guy like Tiger Woods Buck turned down $750 million to stay with the PGA tour. Now the PGA tour itself, which tried to keep its players from joining the live tour, is now in partnership directly with the Saudis themselves. You're not even a hardcore golf guy or certainly a sports fan. But that hypocrisy has to even kind of blow your mind a little bit, right? Money talks. I mean, at the end of the day, the Saudis are there's really no money like oil money. Because even if let's say the Saudis ran their treasury down to zero tomorrow, not that that's going to happen. But they have free money that just comes out of the ground. And it's money and it's a substance oil that the entire world needs, the world economy, the global economy functions only because of hydrocarbon, despite what all the lunatic leftists and you see these, what is it like, stop oil protesters in the UK's people are they're grasping at a religion that is rooted in lunacy. And that's what this climate oil stuff, climate change, oil, hydrocarbon, opposition's all about. But bring it back to the sports side of things. You know, I'm trying to think of something to say about the PGA tour. I know nothing about the PGA tour. But I know that divesting from from Saudi entirely is effectively impossible. I mean, what is it? All over 12, 13, 14%, something like that of global oil output every day comes from Saudi Arabia. So unless you want the world to be markedly poorer, you're doing business with the Saudis. You just don't know it because the world economy functions on oil. So I don't know what, you know, I also would kind of wonder what the it's easy for people to talk a big game about Saudi Arabia. Here's where here's where I can add to this conversation. Because I know now I have never watched a golf on TV event in my entire life. I don't even know how that's possible. You have never watched any golf tournament. It is a I could think of nothing. You know, I'm just I'm gonna hold my opinions back on televised golf. My dad loves golf. So there are sextons who love my dad loves golf. He's all about it. So I'll just keep this tomorrow. I keep my golf. I love it too. I love playing golf. I'm awful at it, but I'll watch it on TV too. I really enjoy it. But remember when there was that that guy who was assassinated by the the Saudi, you know, the basic, a Saudi hit squad and they chopped up the body and saying, you know, Khashoggi and my Muhammad bin Salman was all of a sudden persona non grata. What are we gonna do? You know what everybody did about that? Democrat and Republican, you know what really happened as a result of that? Nothing. Yeah, nothing. So all the talk and all the editorials and all the no one did a damn thing. They use it to blame Trump because it happened under, you know, Trump had nothing to do with any of it. But they're like, why don't you just, you know, get all get into it with the kingdom of Saudi Arabia? You know why? Because we need the oil still. And that's really what it comes down to at the end of the day. The global market needs oil. So we try and the relationship with Saudi Arabia that the US has has been getting better in recent years. So it's easy to play to talk tough about the Saudis, but they got a lot of money and no one's going to do anything about the Saudis really. So that's the that's what I see from a geopolitical side of the live golf PGA merger. I think we have audio from me talking about this a year ago. My person, this was on Fox News. My perspective on this has always been buck. As long as you don't lecture me about politics, I don't have any issue at all with you making money from countries that have different values than the United States. But when you lecture me as many athletes do, and as the PGA tried to do, oh, how dare you take Saudi money? And meanwhile, you got the NBA making money from China. I'm trying to find this money. Yeah, of course. Like we're dead. That's what I'm saying. The whole thing is ridiculous. And I'll also point out that there was way more criticism of these golfers for interacting with Saudi Arabia than buck there was for Joe Biden. Remember last year he went to Saudi Arabia and begged for more oil because oil prices were so high last summer. Here's an audio clip of that discussion, I believe from last year on Fox News. Ultimately, as the live tour continues to grow and as the PGA tour shrinks, this is going to turn into a legitimate battle royale between these two big golf entities. I think the live tour, given their backing from the Saudis, they have money to be able to go for a long time. Eventually, the PGA and the live tour are going to have to sue for peace. It's going to be like the AFL and the NFL for those people out there who remember when the NFL had a charging league, a challenging league and ended up merging together. That was a year ago. That is perfect. Can we get that clip so I can share it too on social? Because I couldn't find it myself. Good job by the staff. Trump also built on this and made the same prediction. He ended up being 100% right. That is now echoing around. But Buck, I think what is so interesting about this is this is part of the larger global behemoth that's going on. And I would even tie it in to Bud Light. I would tie it into Target. There's a good article up. Bobby Barakett out kicker wrote it. You know, everybody changes. All these big companies, Buck changed their logo for Pride Month for their United States based branding. The same companies that do business in other parts of the world. They have the same Twitter account, but it's like, I don't know, anheuser, Bush, Mideast or something, right? Just throwing it out there. They never changed the logo. So the same, these multinational businesses make no mistake that they are selling artificial bills of good to you. And they say, Oh, we're all about pride. The NBA is a great example. You know, the NBA is going to do a game, Buck in the UAE, where if you are found to be gay, do you know what they can do? They can behead you. So the NBA lectures, all of us, and they wag their fingers and they're like, how dare there be a transgender bathroom bill? And then they go take the money of the UAE, where if you just are gay, you're allowed to be beheaded. This corporate BS again, if your goal is just, Hey, we're going to make as much money. We'll follow the laws everywhere we can do business. I get it. But the hypocrisy on this is staggering. Well, China is also a much bigger concern for America's future. It's safety, it's preeminence than Saudi Arabia is. It's not even close. I mean, by a factor of 100, the Saudis provide the world with with with oil effectively. And there was a period there where a lot of the, and this is now bringing me back to the old days, a lot of the Wahhabism and and Islamic radicalism, jihadism was funded by Saudi oil money. And that obviously ties directly into 9 11. And I understand why there's why there's still a lot of anger, because there really was never any Saudi accountability for that. In fact, there's still to this day, some classified stuff around Saudi knowledge of or any complicity in by any Saudi official, what happened on 9 11? So I'm very aware of all of that. But you also have to deal with the world as it is today. And what have we seen with Russia? With Russia, we tried to take a a moral stance that people will argue that Ukraine is a geopolitical win for us or something if we help it. But really, it's a moral stance that the Biden administration has taken, which is Russia is bad Russia invaded. We have to help Ukraine. And we're going to attack them economically. What we found out is that when you have a whole lot of natural gas, a whole lot of oil, a whole lot of fertilizer, a number of inputs that the global economy needs, it's going to get it. You're going to sell it. People are going to buy it from you. And so we need to be realistic about what's possible and what's not when it when you're talking about boycotts. But the perfect example is always anything that is woke in corporate America that is doing business in China, they're always like, well, I can't say anything about China because that would really hurt my profits over there. But you know, here, I'm really, really brave. The NBA is probably the most obvious and and pathetic example of this. But there are many others as well, Disney and so many companies out there. So, you know, maybe, maybe I'll be watching my first, are they going to change the name or are they going to stay as the PGA? Do we know? It's a great question. I think a lot of the, I think it's still going to be the PGA tour. But it's a great question that there doesn't seem to be a lot of definite knowledge. I mean, they went on CNBC, but it's always when they do these mergers, you know, they end up it'd be like the PGA, presented by Liv golf, you know, like they try to say PGA tour sponsored by Saudi Aramco, whatever. Yeah. So, you know, we'll see. We'll see how that goes, everybody. All right. Some of the best moments in life that you've got are stored away, unfortunately. Some of those memories are on VHS tapes.

An important update, an important update. I am the voice of the DM Brigade here to clay because he was he was talking some rough stuff to some of the D.M. tipsters. I let him happen. It was, you know, he was throwing Bud lights around. He was saying, who wants one? I was saying, hold on a second, buddy. Hold on a second. Clay, share the update. Let's be fair minded. What did your DM tipsters tell you in response to you calling them out? So first hour, we were making fun of the fact that Joy Behar was not on with Tim Scott when Tim Scott lacerated the view yesterday. We played that clip for you. And I stand by the analysis, even with but keep going. And a bunch of people jumped in my DMS and I have opened DMS. So I will scroll through a lot of times. I don't click. But like I said, a lot of the DMS I get, not going to surprise you are from woke left wing people who want to attack me. But occasionally, I get good tips and it's fast. I've never in my whole life because I wasn't always in media. I was a normal, you know, like everyday guy. Well, CIA, whatever is, you know, doing the normal stuff. I've never written an angry message or email to a stranger in my life. I don't understand these hateful things. It is. It is a really I don't know what percentage of people do it. But I would say maybe 5 to 10% of the American public is the kind of person who would send an angry email or tweet or whatever. Because I do think it's a small minority because I think most people are busy and don't have time to lash out at strangers over things that, you know, that they're upset by. But I have open DMS because sometimes we get tips on stories. Sometimes people reach out and otherwise wouldn't be able to get in touch with me. Okay. So I made fun of how many people were reaching out and say, enjoy Behar was off to a word book and I give them credit. Almost every single one of those guys immediately responded. We appreciate you listening to the show and said, Hey, I only know it because I watched gut felt last night and they made a big, a big to do about the fact that joy was not on. So gut felt great show Buck and I both enjoy doing it. So I will rescind my criticism of all of your masculinity. You don't drink Bud lights. You do have a little bit of ultra. Do we go?

Welcome back in play Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us. Yesterday we talked about Chris and who knew current governor of New Hampshire and the way that he announced that he was not going to be going after the 2024 nomination in the Republican primary. He announced with both CNN and the Washington Post and then he continued his tour of left wing media outlets by going on with Jen Psaki on MSNBC. Now we said all these people hate us. They're not going to be friendly. They're not going to be fair and not surprisingly Jen Psaki tried to argue that Russia collusion happened in 2016. But I wanted to give credit to Chris for pushing back against that lie yesterday on MSNBC. Here's what it sounded like. You've all created a situation where God what kind of planet are we on where Donald Trump has become the victim? Well, I think I think we've very no one believes it. We know I have to stop you on there because we know very clearly that Putin and the Kremlin did intervene in our election in order to try to help Donald Trump back in 2016. So we know that it's true. But you may think that they shouldn't engage in this as a messaging tool because it's not helpful to them. Is that what you're saying? Yeah, I'm not going to re-relitigate the Russian collusion nonsense that went on for two years. You don't need to relitigate. It's been litigated by a lot of investigations. It's nonsense. But nobody buys that any attack on Trump isn't anything but political. The bot can you believe that Jen Psaki is still trying to sell the Russia collusion? Why? Why on MSNBC? And I get credit for Chris Sinu new for saying that's not true. Yeah, the Democrat base still believes that you notice the language that she uses. It's very specific that that Putin intervened in the election. What does that mean exactly? And what you'd find is that how it translates still to a large percentage of the Democrat base. The same Democrats who go on TV to tell us all the time, you don't accept the results of elections. While they still live in this fantasy land about 2016, intervention in an election is so broad as to be meaningless. And this is a tactic of propaganda. It's really a magnification error. Right? So what happens is, I could take a bucket of boiling water and pour it into a swimming pool and say, I just changed the temperature of the swimming pool. No, you didn't. Doesn't do anything. It's way too big. It's not noticeable. It has no effect whatsoever. What they're saying is because some Russian bots bought some Facebook ads or something. I think they said it was what was it? $100,000 what they ended up finding, which on Facebook is, you know, nothing. That's so key that that change change the result of the election in some capacity. I mean, that's, it's outrageous. And you also have to remember that this was all going on at a time when the FBI was actively trying to undermine a political candidate by investigating him for the very collusion that did not exist. But this is a fantasy that they will not let go because the fantasy of Russia collusion gives the libs the imaginary moral high ground because of the imaginary crime that was committed. Yeah. And you're smart and astute to point out. Intervene. Thank you. The work that she's trying to use by using the word intervene there, right? Because intervened to most people out there implies, oh, you intervened in a significant way. What she's saying is Russia intervened in the 2016 election by spending roughly $100,000 on Facebook ads. Now, keep in mind, there were billions of dollars spent, billions of dollars spent by both candidates, Republicans, Democrats, all the political action committees on the 2016 election. If Russia impacted the election in any way, by $100,000 they spent, it is the greatest $100,000 spent in the history of American political campaigns. Okay. The reality is that that is such a pinprick of spending. And I know a little bit about this because I ran a media company. You can't really influence anyone in any kind of significant way on Facebook by spending $100,000. You just can't. It's impossible. And so what she is trying to do there is claim that it's collusion, first of all, which is still not true. Can I using the word intervene to try to make that a significant claim? That's right. But a better way to put this, forget about my pool analogy. Think of this in terms of there is in every national election and put aside everyone's feelings on 2020 for a second here. There's always some fraud. There's always some fraud that happens. Someone and sometimes it's incidental or meaning someone, you know, votes in the wrong, they vote in the wrong state or they, there's always some fraud. There are 150 million ballots that are cast. Is it right if I were to say, well, you know, we got three people indicted on double voting in the, you know, 2012 election. So that whole election doesn't count. That's effectively what they do with the Russia collusion lie. They find the basis for the most minor, the smallest possible thing, or another version of this would be, you know, Clay, have you ever jaywalked? Beyond all the time. All the time. Clay Travis, if I ran around, if someone ran around saying Clay Travis is a criminal, he's a criminal. I mean, it's in the most technical kind of way, somewhat true, but it's a massive magnification distortion, a magnification error. And that's, that's exactly what they do with Russia collusion. It's just, it's loony tune stuff, but they have not, if anyone thinks they've given up, they have absolutely not given up and they have not admitted they were wrong. Buck, it's funny you mentioned the jaywalking thing. Just by the way, all that's true. There used to be, I don't know if he's still there. There used to be a cop on Capitol Hill. And there will be people who worked in Congress around the 2000 era. And I don't know how long he kept doing this. He was the most zealous jaywalking monitor that I've ever seen in my life. I was an intern on Capitol Hill when I went to GW undergrad. And the number of times that guy stopped me for jaywalking, right? And by the way, jaywalking is just there's nobody on the street at all. And you're going to cross the street to hop on the DC Metro or whatever. The number of times that guy stopped me. I bet he stopped me five or six times. Now eventually when in the office, I was like, Hey, am I, am I crazy? Or is there a Capitol Hill police officer who goes after jaywalkers, the likes of which you have never seen before. And around 2000, 97 to 2000, I bet if you're on Capitol Hill and you're listening to us right now, you will be like, Oh my God, I totally forgot about this guy. I've never seen a cop be that committed to keeping people from jaywalking Buck. And when you're wearing a MAGA hat, he might have locked you up in the goo line. I mean, yeah, Jan when I see the Jan six prisoners, I'm like, there might be a history of clay Travis jaywalking violations from around circa 97 98 99 before it turned to pre turn of the century now, as they say it. But that guy was the greatest, most loony tunes jaywalking cop that I've ever seen in my life. So yes, there may be documented records of me being a jaywalker. I am in that respect a criminal. A smooth criminal indeed. So there you go. Wasn't expecting the Michael Jackson reference. That's going to be a media matter said line later. Buck Sexton praises TV sexual assault or Michael Jackson. It unprecedented attack upon American moral virtue. I do ask people sometimes I'm like, do we do we just did we just decide we're not because sometimes I'll hear Michael Jackson songs at a party and I'm like, is everyone okay with this or where are we on this? Well, you know, everybody stopped our Kelly. But I think that was a function of our Kelly's music wasn't really that good. I don't think anybody's came to Michael Jackson. I still hear Michael Jackson all the time. It just didn't work. His music was, I always say, Buck, you're as long as your talent exceeds your problems. You're okay, right? Michael Jackson's talent, even with the allegations against him exceeded his problems. Also, he died before he was ever convicted of anything, which is, I think, also, what others point to I watched that finding Neverland doc that was a tough watch. I couldn't get through it. Yeah, couldn't get through it. It was just because it was so hard to watch. I just was like, I can't. And also it feels unfair on some level just to me when someone dies and they aren't able to defend themselves at all. And then you come back and just eviscerate them. And there isn't really anybody there to speak out in your favor. I watched it. If it's true, it's awful. But man, that is a scenario where I think his music is going to go on just because it's so good, irrespective of what the artist may have done in his past life. We'll see. I also think this is a tough question for the Woke universe out there because pretty much every artist, if you go through every aspect of their life, whether it's literature, whether it's painting, whether it's music, they have something pretty bad, right? Like, it's hard to drive two of his wives to suicide and was like abusive and horrible. I mean, you go back, you look at a lot of bad things. I mean, Van Gogh wasn't exactly a guy that you'd want to bring home to mom and dad if you're out there in the dating universe, right? I mean, it's almost impossible to find artists who are completely clean, especially given the era in which we live in today. Guess what? Getting exercise. It's hard. You got a lot going on, but I'm making time for it. I have a little bit of the sortest to prove it. And in particular, you know what I was doing this morning, I was boxing. And you know, when I box, I like to go, I go nine rounds, 27 minutes straight. Don't take a break. You know what happens? My shoulders actually, they kind of ache, honestly, it's kind of embarrassing. Get into bed, lay there, roll over. And I'm like, man, this, this shoulder issue. I'm 44 now. I can feel it after I box for a while. Relief factor helps out helps out not only me, but also my wife, who is in far better shape than me. And we take advantage of this 15 year scientific research treats aches, pains, elbow, hip, knee, head, hand back neck, shoulder, rush was a big advocate of relief factor. And you know why? Because he spent a lot of time on the golf course and we're getting a bunch of those DMs rolling in from the anti golf people who used to come after rush. And he said, I don't care. I love to golf, but he needed all the help he could get sometimes after you play 18 holes, walk all over the place. You could join the more than a million people who've purchased a quick start.

Welcome back to clay and buck. The team making an interesting music choice there. Thank you everybody for shooting and listening in. I just I just want to say to such an apologist from Michael Jackson. I mean, when I see this media matter, you're the one who says his music should be all settle down, settle down, slander machine. You're the one who says the music stays forever. Okay. I just made a lyric reference. I think his music is overrated. I think he has a couple of very good songs. But I think overall without the medium of MTV, Michael Jackson doesn't become the superstar that he was at the time. I think Michael Jackson and Madonna were made by MTV. I'm just telling you, I think Michael Jackson in particular is a stud. You can go all the way back to the Jackson five in terms of his media matters is I mean, yeah, you got to use in the word stud. Is the thing that you've gotten attacked? We're coming up on the two year anniversary of the show, by the way, since we took over. Is the thing you've gotten attacked for the most in the two years of the show? Your Simone Biles take by all by live media? Yeah, not by not by like people actually listening or anyone who disagree with me on something. But I mean, in terms of articles that have been written other than your mask thing in Asheville, North Carolina, but something you actually set on the show. But I was 100% right on that and everybody knows that. So the only people that disagree with me on the mask thing or lunatics who can't read and think. But in terms of the Simone Biles, I was still right. Just putting that out there. It was the whole thing was so, Oh, you know, it's amazing. It's like, no, that's not it's fine. It's fine. But we don't usually anyway. I know what you're not making Travis. You're not breaking me down that pathway again, buddy. You're just going to get all the all the libs getting all angry at me. You know, the cool. Let's say you do a backflip. I'm like, no, I'm a radio host. I talk. That's what I do. All right. Shiva in Los Angeles. You're up. Shiva, what's going on? Hey guys, how are you? Great. How are you? You're good. I'm good. I heard your show. First of all, thank you for, you know, everything you do. I'm a former lib voter for, you know, Clinton, Biden, and you guys have been instrumental in opening up my eyes in the last couple of years. The reason I'm calling is because I heard your show yesterday and you know, you were kind of disappointed at the governor losing. I'm sure you're all bad and you were like, this is not the time to say we don't want Trump. And I just wanted to give you a different perspective on it. I think of our goal is to win the general election. The general election is going to be won by independents and people like me who switched over. And I think that if we have 55 different people running against Trump, the Trump base is going to get the 35% and he'll become the nominee because the rest of the vote, the rest of the 70% will get split between everyone else. And then it's going to be a lot harder to convince independents and people like me to vote for Trump versus voting for like the scientists or Nikki Haley or someone like that. So, okay, so I'm fascinated. Sorry to cut you off, Sheva. Did you vote for Joe Biden in 2020? I did. Okay. So, so unfortunately, no, well, welcome to the welcome to the revolution. We're happy to have you. Okay. So what made you change your mind in the last two years such that in 2020, you were open for voting for for Biden and did it. And also how old are you and you say you wouldn't vote for Trump necessarily in 24? Does that mean you would vote for Biden again if they rematched or you would just sit out and what I'm asking how old you are. Clay, I'm kind of I'm kind of fascinated by this. I'm kind of fascinated by this in terms of whether you're speaking not only for yourself, but some of your other friends. I am. Yeah. So I am 39. I've got two small kids. And I think the thing that, you know, made me switch over and question everything with COVID. You know, we have a lot of friends who, I have a lot of friends whose kids were in preschool, who started preschool at the beginning of COVID. And it was ridiculous that our like two, three year old has to go to school with a mat. And like to this day, we still have to test our kids after every, you know, spring break or whatever. And it's just like, you know, it started to defy logic at a certain point. And then the whole like mandating a shot that wasn't even fully tested for people who weren't even under risk. It just, it started to just make me question it. And then the more I looked into it, the more it didn't make sense. And now a lot of the moms, you know, here, especially in LA, are concerned about the whole gender identity thing in schools. But nobody feels comfortable talking about it. Because if you do, you get labeled, you know, you might not be able to get your kids admitted to like private schools. You know, you'll just be ostracized, whatever, people will look down on you. So a lot of people are just kind of going along pretending like they're okay with it. But like when we talk amongst ourselves, everyone's outraged. So I feel like the DeSantis thing is huge for mom for independence. I think that I there's a lot of people are going to have a problem voting for another, you know, 80 year old who's going to follow up. So so Shiva, this was an excellent call. Thank you so much for sharing. One thing I would say, just in response to your initial, you're saying different perspective on the sinu new thing. And I appreciate you're just giving a different perspective. And that's totally cool. I just felt like the way sinu new framed it, lost sight of the ultimate goal here is to beat Biden, the ultimate goal for any Republican should not be to make sure Trump is not the nom the ultimate goal, to be sure. So it felt to me like a little bit of a of a misapplied focus for somebody who seriously wants to stop a lot of things that the Democrats are doing to the country right now of a clay on the totalitarianism point or rather the COVID point, which I say is totalitarian. I'm hoping I'm still hopeful. There are a lot of people out there who are just like Shiva. Yeah, that's why I'm so fascinated by her perspective. She called in I thought only other thing I would have she didn't answer if she would still vote Biden in 2024. If it was a rematch against Trump and how her friends might vote. But it's the 39 year old ish moms, probably suburban moms who are going to decide this election. There are a lot of Shiva's out there. How do you win him? That's the question."
