    "text": " You're listening to the news and why it matters on demand. Hey, I'm Sarah Gonzalez. Welcome to the news and why it matters. We have a special guest in the house. Jason Howerton is back from CRTV. Yes. Yes. Thank you for being here. Absolutely. Sue, what is the top story for you? The National Football League. That's just, that's it. I mean, it's definitely the top story. But there's an observation, I think, is actually somewhat pertinent to the audience and the way we think about, see, sort of these culture wars. Is it that the Cowboys beat the Eagles? I don't remember that. I mean, if that's true, I didn't see that. It is matters to me. That was a couple of weeks ago. We're about to take actually NSC East. That's even bigger news. That's really sad. Yeah, I know, right. It's not a good division. Oh, not this year, Jason. Judicial dictatorship. And how do you know when you're on that road in that direction? Okay. Jason Howerton. It's got to be Dan Crenshaw. And of course, he's from Texas and he's making all of us proud down here. Yes, I love that story. I got a lot to get into. Before we do that, we want to thank our sponsor, Brick House. So as you can see on this table, we have some lovely vegetables. We've got the broccoli over here, the cauliflower over here, some edible moss. So you could think about eating this. This is like your Thanksgiving dinner right here. Yes, it is. I know. I'm talking about field of greens, but really I'm in deep down. I'm like, oh, this looks really good. So you could think about eating this or you could think about eating your vegetables in a shake, a smoothie. It comes in powdered form. Again, it's called field of greens. You take one scoop and you put it in whatever liquid you want. And it tastes great. You guys have tried it. Yeah, it tastes really great. It's a way to get your vegetables without having to eat your vegetables. So that is really nice. You don't have to be Sarah and enjoy cauliflower to be able to work in this world and get the vegetables your mommy told you to eat if you never did. Yes. And I'm about as meat and potatoes as it gets. Right. So I don't... You need this. You don't touch this. Exactly what I need. My wife is actually thanking you for the introduction to this. So technically, potato is a vegetable. And we should see it as that when it's fried in particular. I don't know. I can cook once the nutrients that way. Don't forget that you... Okay, Miss scientist over here, whatever. But yes, your wives will thank you. They'll get off your back. So you can go to brickhouseblaze.com and use promo code greens for 15% off your first order or you can text greens to 41411. Stu, the NFL. Yes, they always appreciate when Glenn is gone and we get to that. Yes, the cat's away. It's time for the mice to play and talk a little sports. And it's related to sports, but not... It's not exactly sports. First of all, if you didn't see the game last night, you missed out. Oh my gosh. It was a 2451 win win. History. Yeah, it really was one of the most amazing games I've ever seen. Yeah, a few penalties early on. But other than that, it was a great game to watch. It was really exciting. A massive place on offense and defense. I mean, it had it all. The crowd was insanely into it. The game was scheduled for Mexico City and was moved to the last second. So it was kind of like everyone like Jake was... Which is weird for LA because I live there and they suck at being fans for any... Yeah, yeah, yeah. It was totally awful. I'm not opinion, they don't even deserve an NFL team. Because half the time, they don't even show up to the games. Yeah, no, well, they lost them for decades. That's why, basically. What are the biggest markets in the country? How does that even happen? I don't know. But last night they were into it. I don't know if it was because just the way the seats were sold. But it was really exciting. It was a playoff atmosphere. It felt like watching a Super Bowl. And these two teams might wind up there. It was really interesting. And as the game was over, I was kind of like basking in the afterglove. I got another great NFL game and I'm a huge fan. I started thinking to myself like there's a bunch of different kinds of people. Like people that just don't care about football. Like totally understandable. There are people who love it and watch it. There are people who would have loved to have watched that game. But it ran late and they didn't wind up watching it. But there's one group of people that I think it's sad. Which is the people who love football and would love to be watching it. But made a decision over the past couple of years to boycott the NFL because of the kneeling situation. A lot of my friends. A lot of people in our audience. I was just going to say I think it is a lot of people in our audience. And I understand it and I understand why you would do that. You're saying, hey, the country is more important to me than this. And I believe the national anthem is important. And people should be standing for it. Completely agree. But take a step back for a second. I think looking at this again is worthwhile doing. Colin Kaepernick taking a knee is one guy taking a knee on a field. He is no longer in the league. He's not actually in the league and hasn't been in the league for multiple years. There are approximately two or three people in the entire league who are taking a knee and protesting the national anthem right now. If it's even that. I know one cheerleader recently started doing it as well. Really? There's one cheerleader on the Bucks. And there's I think two or three players who are currently involved in this. And this is two or three people out of, you know, 700 people in the league. Very small percentage. All those other players. In fact, many of them, real patriots, people who have the technical team, the patriots, but also people that America should like, unlike the patriots. But like, you know, people who are real supporters of the military, people who, I mean, the Patriots organization are huge supporters of Donald Trump, right? Like a like Dak Prescott who refused a needle and then beat the Eagles. But yes, that did happen. Did happen. That did happen. I think it was it that was the one in the super. No, that was the other. Oh, God, no, they won the Eagles won the super bowl. So I got this year. I got one freaking year. But it's so like, you know, I understand the idea to go to this, but take a step back. I think conservatives wind up getting in these culture wars sometimes. And we allow, we assign our decision making process to others. Why if it's something that you would have enjoyed watching that came last night, why are you letting Colin Kaepernick make that decision for you? Why would the actions of this one guy who is not even in the league? Why would that matter and affect what you're doing? You know, that giving control to Colin Kaepernick and his choice of sock is not something I want to be a part of. I want to make decisions on my own. And you know, I think we get into this world where because Washington and the media have identified this culture war, we have to take this, you know, stance and change our behavior based on what Colin Kaepernick says. Like Colin Kaepernick, I believe has the right to protest. He can do whatever he wants. But I believe he's patently wrong about the issue he's talking about. And if I wouldn't trust him on analyzing the actions of police, why would I trust him on my entertainment choices? This is my life. I get to make the decisions in that life. And I think we lose sight of the fact that yes, this has been a, you know, it's all over Facebook. It's all over Twitter, you know, this culture war thing. And it's faded out quite a bit since the president started talking about it. But between Washington and media, it's been this big thing. And we've, they've told us they have told us we need to take a position on this. Well, you know, every time you walk into a restaurant, there are servers at that restaurant who feel the same way Colin Kaepernick does. There are cooks at the restaurant who feel the same way Colin Kaepernick does. Every time you walk into, you go to a gas station, the people working there, you go to a grocery store, the people stocking the shelves, the television stations you watch. The blaze. I guarantee, I don't know who, but I guarantee there's somebody here who certainly disagrees. There's plenty of people who disagree, but really agree with what Colin Kaepernick says. You know, there are people in Trump's administration, I bet you. I mean, Amorosa was there for a while. She seemed to be pretty, you know, working with that. There are every place you go, you're going to find people who disagree with you and take passionate stances on the other side. If you make your decisions based on what they're doing, you're giving them control of your life. And I don't like doing that at all. I, you know, as a person who's an individualist and a conservative, I feel like I need to look at that and make my own decisions. And if your decision is, well, football sucks or your decision is, you know, I can't do this because I really feel upset about it. I understand that. But we shouldn't let those decisions be made for us. We have to really stop and think about it and say like, well, this is something that I really enjoy. Do I want something that is going to give me three hours of enjoyment taken away because of someone whose opinion I don't even respect is being talked about on the field and of course, not anymore? I'll tell you what I did real quick. Yes. Because I'm a very big, obviously, patriot guy. I love the anthem. I want you to stand. Yes. I think it's a sacred moment. But what I did with the guys who were kneeling and doing all this stuff, I didn't boycott football. I just root it for them to get laid out. And I watch and I root for teams playing against teams that were doing that kind of stuff. It makes it even more enjoyable. It makes it even more enjoyable. So I'm with you 100%. I mean, we have to learn to agree to disagree and to understand that you're never going to... Why would you want to silence everybody who... It changed the world to be exactly what you agree with. I'm with you 100%. So the irritates me on this is just like how you talked about the overexposure with the media. This could have happened back in the day. We just never heard about it because they didn't... It wasn't blass all over every single screen whether you're holding it or watching it in your living room 24 hours a day. I mean, it was just insane the exposure. But it's relatively unimportant too. The flag is important. Patriotism, I think, is important. What are more than this even in Western values and what our country stands for is really important. The idea that someone who's opinion I outwardly don't respect is doing something that I don't respect should not really... Why would that be a big deal? It's different the league took a position as an old, right? That's different. But that never was the case. And the opinions seem to be basically the league should have been harder on them or whatever. They'll kick them out of the league. Right. And they could take that stance I guess if they wanted to. But it shouldn't be... You think about Fox News, right? Like the typical conservative network that people would mention. It's like people who are... We were there. There are people on the air. I mean, Shepard Smith seems pretty darn friendly with this outlook. Certainly there are cameramen and everybody... There's tons of people who work at Fox News who are lockstep in line with Colin Kaepernick. Where it gets difficult in my opinion is it's so easy to fix. The problem is easy to fix if they really want to fix it. Like I don't care where you work. There are rules and if you don't abide by them, you're fired. It's so easy for them to fix. They can just say, look guys, you either stay in the locker room or you don't kneel. You stand there. You don't have to put your hand on your heart. You don't have to sing whatever. But you do this or else you get fined $50,000 per game. You still do it. Some of them would still do. And they would eventually quit after they've lost half their paycheck that year. Maybe. If you lose 50... You're in favor of them creating a rule making them stand. Oh absolutely. Well, yeah. Actually, yeah. Are you sure? Are you sure? I mean, yeah, I'm absolutely... I'm absolutely. Because I think it's ridiculous. It looks like this is the NBA. I don't think political protest should be a part of sports. I just don't think that's totally fine position. I think what the NFL is looking at here is not... Like the NFL, like they embrace every freaking patriotic thing that they can think of. They are not trying to make anti-America statements. But I think they look at this as a problem. There was a rumored policy that was going to come out, which was, hey, we need to... You guys need to be in the locker room or come out in the field or you're going to get fined. They actually were implementing that. The problem with this arrangement is they were in a lockstep where they're having any relationship with a player's union that has a lot of freaking power. And they opposed it. And if they don't agree to it, yes, they can come out. And then you have to leave it to individual owners to find their own players. And then those players are going to get pissed off. And it just winds up being too much of a hassle, I think. I personally am fine with them kneeling if they want to. It tells me something about them, which I don't like. I mean, it would make me think of wanting to root for a different player or get them maybe laid out. If you're allowed to tackle anymore in the NFL, I don't know if it's still loud. But I don't have a problem with them being able to do that if they want to do it. It's just I can see how it's a problem. When you're running a business like that, if you lose your star players, it becomes more of an issue. And I always feel like the real solution to this is what's wound up happening, which is you don't see the anthem covered that way anymore. For a while there, every time the anthem aired, you'd have to have cameras on every single person and watch them all kneel. They just don't show it anymore and now no one talks about it. And one of the things that ticked me off and going towards that exposure stuff is last year, over the past couple of years, there's been an explosion in faith-based players and actually demonstrating it on the field. Like before, that was like controversial. Tim Tebow runs out there and kneels down like, oh my gosh, what's he doing? Now look at like, and I cannot believe I'm going to say this. I don't want to say this. But the Philadelphia Eagles players are one of the best at this actually. They'll go out there, they'll pray beforehand and they'll show it. Every once in a while, the afterwards, almost every single one of the Eagles is on like a 30 for 30 or some kind of like, you know, before Fox special showing how great they are. I mean, a lot of monetized video views from your Eagles. It's probably mostly. Yeah. Carson Wentz is one of the leaders for that. But hardly anybody else will cover that. You'll get that every once in a while, like ESPN or something like that. But as a whole, no one wants to cover that. They want to cover the people kneeling during the national anthem, but not that. Yeah. All right. I think that we've hit our quota of national Philadelphia Eagles for probably the month. So let's agree. Did you get a less, or did you want me to Super Bowl? Did you guys see that? That was a little badly. The best moment in American history. No. All right. More to get into. But first, want to thank our sponsor, Rydya Zone. Rydya Zone has been a godsend for me. I used to be what you would call a little chunky, or maybe you would just call really fat. I don't know. But that was me, the number 10. This does not look like you at all. It doesn't make any sense. I feel like it's a scam. It's what I have. It's not. It feels like a scam. All right. It's me. Next to my beautiful, tiny little mother who is still tiny and has really good genes. I don't. I always struggled with really... You do know that she probably passed some of those along. That's how this works. No, I got my metabolism from my dad. Sadly. And so I just have had sluggish metabolism my whole life. But I lost the weight and I was having trouble keeping it off. And Rydya Zone helps with that because it helps boost metabolism and help you feel full longer. It's something you're definitely going to want going into the holidays. So you don't gain a gazillion pounds from now until January and then have to work it all off. That's a New Year's resolution, which then everyone... No one does that. Right? Like everyone's resolution is like, I'm going to lose weight this year and I don't. Yeah. For a couple weeks, I'm all about it. You're going to get a dime up. Everyone's a chimp in the first couple weeks. I'm so annoying. It's a couple weeks, but it's spread over several months. For those of us who stay in the gym, it's annoying. My dad. You're just like, okay, this was my machine every morning at this time, but now all these people want to come in. So Rydya Zone can help with that so that you don't have to go through all of that.

So this is really irking me lately. Every time a federal judge will, okay, so going back, the last time a judge really, really pissed me off was when they basically put the injunction for getting rid of DACA. I love the D-A-list of when a judge really, really pissed me off. It's a long list, but I'll skip to just two instances for the sake of time. That was just amazing to me because that was not a law. That was something that the president and President Obama just did, which you could probably, you could even say that was just unconstitutional, but you just executive ordered this thing just as kind of like a stopgap. Didn't go to the Congress. It could have, but the moment that the president, this current president tried to dump it, give the power back to Congress, he said, no, you can't do that. I'm like, what? It was like, how are you not interpreting any law? This is, I don't understand that. Well, the most recent one was, I believe it was yesterday, where a district judge, that's still considered a federal judge, federal judge, shut down the president's plans to not allow asylum seekers when they enter the country illegally to claim asylum. They have to go through like a legal, like an actual point of entry to do that. They have to actually go through the process that is laid out for them to go through. Right. Well, okay, so let's talk about that, because the law is, the act, the refugee act is kind of vague on that. So basically, there is some wording that says basically if you interpret it the way this judge interpreted, I guess, as long as they get inside the United States or get to the border, they can claim asylum. Now, listen, this is one of the reasons why I got out of the Marine Corps, and it's probably just military-wide, because they make you do things that just don't make sense. There's like guys, common sense. We don't have to follow, you know, use some common sense here. This is a, the refugee act was enacted in 1980. They obviously had no idea that there was going to be this tactic of 2000, 3000, whatever people just flooding down to the border. They didn't think about that. Now that's obvious to people like now, be like, okay, now maybe we should use a little common sense here. But of course, this is all about judicial activism here. So he doesn't really care. He went off of a lawsuit from the Southern Poverty Law Center for crying out loud and the ACLU. I mean, it's got activism written all over it. But so the law states that basically, as long as they're here, however they guide here, they can claim asylum. Now those are kind of built off of also like UN guidelines. And again, one of the reasons why, you know, these mega super, you know, treaty organizations like the UN, EU, whatever, how you can see the dangers where this can encroach on your sovereignty. If you're just going along with this, just because it's right for this country at this time, doesn't mean it's going to be right for another country at another time. But this is just one of those things to write. This is a judge that his entire job, his entire reason for being is to ensure that law and order is being maintained in the country. Well, right now he's agreeing to put an injunction to help people break the law to then apply for asylum. I'm just, I'm a wits in on this. Now, the injunction, I think, only lasts until maybe mid December. And then there'll be another, you know, a decision made on it. But I mean, I just, you know, I'm not a loss. Like, how bad is this going to get? I mean, I'm an idiot, so I don't know how that all that process works. But is it possible just to be devil's advocate that the judge could do the injunction to send it to a higher court to let them kind of really analyze it and figure out out what the right course about it versus him just being a, I mean, he might just be an activist judge, right? He's an Obama appointed judge. Okay. Yes, that would be possible. But I don't understand really what you would even get out of that because I'm assuming that this Supreme Court would say the president has a jurisdiction here to decide who does and doesn't come into the country. He just doesn't want to be the guy to make Obama mad. I don't know. You don't kick it to somebody else. You figure it out. Well, I mean, I think this is a larger problem than that. Whatever, like, let's say they delay this for two months, and that exactly thing happens. It goes back to the way it probably should have been from the beginning. Well, it's two months of people who have taken advantage of this. This has become a more common tactic lately with activist judges, particularly against Trump, where they see, they think he's acting in ways that they don't like, so they use their power, which is their power to go and create injunctions instead of just letting it go through the process. Normally, what's supposed to happen is like the policy would stay in place until it rose up and went through the process and said to do these injunctions. And I was reading a, I can't remember, it was a dissent. I think it was one of the dissents of Clarence Thomas in this last session. And those are always great to read. Anytime you declare it Thomas, I mean, Scalia was the same way. Anytime I wrote anything, it was always worth reading. But in Thomas specifically calls out this practice and says, basically, we can't get to apply, I'm going to non-legalize this, legalize this for a minute. We can't get to this point where like, every time a court doesn't like a federal law, they get to just overturn it for a few months until we figure it out. This injunction thing that's happening all over the country way more than it was ever intended for is something, if it doesn't stop, we're going to have to take it up. He said that in a way it was another case unrelated to an injunction question. It was just another case where the federal judge jumped in, canceled the policy for the nation for a few months until it got figured out. And like, that's not the way this is supposed to work. And Thomas is, that is on his mind. I mean, it was an unrelated point and he made sure to put it in print and I will not be surprised at all if within the next year or so the Supreme Court finds a way to take that up and shut that down for only extreme circumstances, which is the only time it's supposed to be used. I wish I had the list of all the things that have been decided like on local state levels, you know, like the lower level courts that have decided like, wasn't the same sex marriage, wasn't that originally? Went up through the courts, yeah. I mean, so many other, like, they don't have to go through, you know, the Supreme Court. They don't have to like go through legislature. They can literally do a lot of this stuff through the lower level courts. So they can change the way the country's supposed to be ran just through these, this judicial dictatorship style of running things. And it can't rise up fast enough for everything to be dealt with, right? Like, Supreme Court can't take on every single one of these things and they know that. So they, you know, they keep trying to get their way in ways that they shouldn't and it needs to be stopped. It does. I mean, we can't be run by the courts. Yeah. And I do think it is important to point out really quickly before we break that Jason just, I think it was you who was talking about this the other day that people can flate a lot of the time, you know, if you're against the migrants coming in that you're xenophobic and all these other things, just because you don't want illegal immigration, you know, like there's a time and a place in, but I think we all can agree at this table that we're all for immigration when it's done the right way. And we know who's coming in our country and we know that they're going to be productive citizens of society. Maybe they have, you know, specialties that they can contribute, you know, special things to our economy. But that we people have to be careful not to conflate just because you're against a migrant caravan, you know, barreling their way into the United States. It doesn't mean that you're against immigration as a whole. Something that, yeah, totally. And something has to be done with this new tactic of flooding the border. Something's got to be done about that. You think about now, like the the main port of entry in T1 has been closed for, I think like three days because of this. Think about what that is of the economy for both countries. It's just closed. Yeah. All right. Back in a minute. Up next, enjoy bonus overtime content from the news and why it matters.

Yeah, since we pushed the best topic to the back end, that's fine. So not surprised the Cowboys family think the NFL was not the best time. Not a Cowboys. No, that's fine. That was a zinger though. So Dan Crenshaw just won election in Texas to be a representative. And he is you probably know him from S and L. He was mocked and then he went on and he had this awesome moment where he roasted Pete Davidson and it was like a great politics. Love to. He's awesome. I'm also convinced that he has read Glenn's book addicted to outrage because everything that he has said goes right along with that the way that he handled the Davidson thing was just like, we don't need to be outraged. Awesome. Yeah, it was awesome. So but he's now kind of become a national figure. So he's on, was it face the nation the other day? And he did what I wanted for so long, which is these Sunday shows where they go and they debate and they they speak in these stupid hyperbole and Trump is this and Trump is that and there's no substance. There's no there's no actual conversation happening. Like nothing's happening. It's just no way. It's like on your TV. So he goes and he's like, what do you mean by that? What do you mean? What do you mean Trump is a threat to the free press? What do you mean? That's a attack on the free press. Explain what you mean. And it threw the whole panel into like disarray because nobody's used to that. They're used to either being agree mostly just people agreeing with them. Trump is racist. Trump is this and everyone's just like, yeah, so I'll indeed and do it oblique. And so he just asked what is that was his question? What? And and they looked like they had a hard time kind of understanding how to how to put their words to their to their claims and what they were saying. And so my prediction is not going to be invited on that much more. He's just not what cable news is anymore. It's not what they want. It's not what they're looking for. Once once kind of his star, you know, fades a little bit. I don't think we'll be seeing him as much. At least on, you know, the big ABCs. Yeah. Well, it's too effective to be invited back. You need like Alex Jones is to like make, you know, the caricature of what a conservative is. You can't have somebody like Dan who can dissect arguments and actually get some good men. If you're not willing to engage in hyperbole, like what place do you have on cable news now? I mean, literally that's all it is. Like in that segment, it cracks me up because right when he, when the moment you're talking about when he's like, can you like, what are you talking about? Like attacks on the pro? What are you talking about real quick real quick? So when I was doing an interview once, I can't remember where it was. It was on one of the bigger places and I was there and I was talking and I was in the same breath. I defended Trump and I attacked or not attacked him, but I criticized him, defended him and like was trying to do kind of what Dan was doing. And I got off close my laptop and I was in a hotel and there was a guy behind me on the other side of the conference room in the hotel and he looked at me and he goes, they're not going to invite you back. I was like, I guess I was that bad, right? He goes, no, he goes, they're not going to invite you back. You made too much sense. They're too reasonable to be on cable and to be on news because that's kind of what it is now. So that's kind of exactly what it reminded me of. And for those of you who haven't seen it or heard it, I think we have a couple parts to it. Let's watch the first one now. I mean, precisely that that I think some of our democratic freedoms and the principles that we live by have been under attack for the better part of the last two years. Do you want to respond to that since the president is the leader of your party? Well, I always ask the question, like what? What is the undermining exactly? What democratic freedoms have been undermined? We just had an election where we switched power in the house. Democracy is at work. People are voting and run record numbers. I always ask for examples. And then we can hit those examples one by one. And if it's worth criticizing, it's worth criticizing, but just kind of this broad brush criticism that the president is somehow undermining our democracy. I always wonder what exactly we're talking about. I'll be happy to add it. All of the things I can do. I'm happy to give it to you. Yeah. I mean, the undermining of the free and the free and the free and the free and the free and the free and the free and the free. The free press in judiciary CIA FBI voting process. Right. So there's more to this that we can play, but really quickly. Okay. So they listed undermining the free press the judiciary. The FBI. Yes. Which is exactly what he said. What he said. What explain what not just things. Okay. He's table chair lamp. He even said, you know, we get into these broad brush criticisms. And they just did exactly what he just said. Broad brush criticism and just listed all of these departments. I was expecting the end with dogs and cats living together. He goes on and pushes them more and tries to get them again to explain more narrowly what they're talking about. It's really great. Yeah. Let's watch that. Obama indicted. It was had many press members under investigation. Trump is not. So just so what is so what is the difference last week with the largest media publications in the United States, right? Had to go to a federal court in order to essentially regain access to the press order. One reporter. Not the whole organization, including CBS did file amicus. That's right. And support. Yeah. So I mean, again, I think the obviously it's part of much larger because he was disrupted. Well, again, I would argue that our president is consistently disrupted in those very same press conferences. And I would argue that he chose that. And how is that? And how is that? I'm not impressed, though, because it's literally an attack. I've literally been attacked. So I, I, again, let's choose our words carefully. His language is an attack. Okay. So why can't he speak? Why is he not allowed to use his own language and freedom of speech? Because you, and you talked about this actually, it's important that we lead from example, that we lead from the top. And the way that our president is struggling with you, I agree with you there. I agree with you there. Style is one thing. If you want to criticize style, I'm with you, right? But to say it's an attack on the freedom of the press. That is a very bold statement. I could watch that not knowing who that is and tell you he is from Texas. I like the Texas phrase on it. I mean, he's great. He's very effective. I mean, I think like it's important to look at that in this case. And first of all, the judge did not agree that Jim Acosta was not disruptive. That is not what the case was about. It was just an injunction. It's a, it's like a first step in illegal proceeding. He is temporary access basically back. And whether the administration was right, I tend to think that they shouldn't have done it because it gives Acosta so much attention that he wants. But legally, yeah, legally, I mean, I don't, I don't, I don't see how it's not a First Amendment issue, first of all, because constitutional rights are not granted to people who are members of CNN or who are members of the White House press corps. Like they get, those are great. It's everybody. So if, if Jim Acosta has a First Amendment right to be in there, so do we. Okay. And I know we don't. So like it's a ridiculous claim in the first place. I want to just quickly though, make make this comparison to the media and people who, who, who, let's give them an benefit of the doubt here for a minute. What they see is a president who is trying to limit critical coverage of himself, right? And he is taking action against a media organization. While I agree with Dan's point, we're like, Hey, this is, it's one reporter. It's not the whole organization. The president of the United States should have been dictating to organizations, which reporters they're allowed in. Like he shouldn't be able to, Oh, I'll keep rejecting people until I get somebody friendly. Again, I'm making their case here a little bit. So what we see here basically is not an attack on the Second Amendment or First Amendment. It's, it's an attack on it's a possibility of a slippery slope. Right. If we don't fight back here and draw a line, this guy's going to be able to do all sorts of things to us. And we have freedom of the press. It's this sort of argument they cannot understand when it comes to the Second Amendment. When you're coming out and saying, like, Oh, these are common sense measures. Like this is, we want to take this and say, Oh, look, it's we just can't have a 500 round magazine. And that's all we're doing. It's no big deal. And Second Amendment, a proponent say, wait a minute, this is our constitutional right. It shall not be infringed. Any minor step you take to try to limit that amendment is something we have to react heart, harshly about and fight back against. And I can understand that I don't agree with them and their take on the, on their case with Acosta, but I can understand how if you're a press organization and you feel there's someone who's adversarial to you, you have to make sure you're fighting those battles every single time to hold that line. And the same thing happens with the Second Amendment and they can never understand it. Oh, we can just take half of your rights. We can take three quarters of it. You'll still be able to buy a gun with a permit that we give you and after you're trained. And if we should, we say you're not mentally incapacitated in some way in all the little ways they want to work that. Oh, well, we'll just put the restrictions on the bullets and we'll just put restrictions on this and we'll put like, well, you can see why we'd be defensive on that. They should be able to see it. The way they act about the First Amendment is, it is, I think at times incorrect, but still I understand the passion to defend that right. And they should understand it when we're talking about the Second Amendment and also our First Amendment rights when it comes to freedom of speech and freedom of religion. I just wish they picked anybody but Acosta to be the guy like, to be the hero. Like, I can't do it like seeing him march into the White House. Like I know, no, no, no. What about when he, when he had them revoked, he had his password revoked and he went to the outside grounds and was like, hello, Jim Acosta here. I'm outside the White House because I can't get in. I would literally would have supported anyone else. I would have said this is unacceptable. And I still, I'm with you. I kind of think he should just let it go. He's the president and he just has to deal with it. But but anybody else. Well, that's a problem is it really wasn't, it wasn't Acosta being chosen. Trump chose Acosta. Trump is the one that made him just big and harder. And that's why I really hated because a Jim Acosta just loves Jim Acosta. And he wants to make himself into a big hero and we're giving him that path. And I just don't like that. There's this photo where he was, somebody was video like recording him walking back to the White House and he had the biggest smile on his head. It's all like, yeah. He's so like, he's so like, he's got a press conference after he actually that he got the injunction. We walked up to reporters and asked them for questions. If you want to ask a question. I was like, no, he's kidding me. He's a theory. That's so funny. Oh, the worst. Democratic women feel united by gender. Yeah, this is kind of, I don't know. This is interesting. I think my perspective on this, like if you were to say, because of the way the media talks about gender and race and all of these things that are so identifying, how people are going to vote and how they think. And we always see people saying, you know, Acasio-Cortez, we need to have people who are, we need to make sure the diversity of the opposition to Nancy Pelosi, we have enough men and women and different minorities represented in that opposition. Well, what if they just think Nancy Pelosi sucks? It shouldn't matter. It's about the point, not about the color of the skin, content of character. Somebody made that point a long time ago. But it was interesting. I would think that like, Democrats would be like totally about seeing themselves as just members of a gender or a race. They would associate that we have all, we're all in this together. And that's how they would, they would see themselves. And you'd think maybe Republicans are the opposite. New polling is out where it shows really it's very limited. In fact, people don't see themselves as members of giant groups. They see themselves as individuals. And this is a poll that came out. This is actually in the Huffington Post, shockingly. If you look at it, you see, the top one is female Democrats. And they're the only ones who see themselves having a lot of in common interests and concerns based on gender, instead of saying gender is not really relevant. Only 34% say it's not relevant for Democrats and females, but 50% say they have a lot in common. But every other group says gender is not relevant by pretty large margins. In fact, the largest one are male Democrats, actually more than male Republicans seeing that this is, now you could say that that's part of them essentially pandering to. I was about to say, because they're ashamed of being male. That's probably part of that one. But still, if you take out even the Democrats, you look at the, I would say even 50% of female Democrats, which is the highest number, is much lower than I would have thought it would. I would have thought it would be 80 or 90%. And just for the people listening on podcast, there was all of those categories, female independence. Yeah, so, yeah, independence. It's a different podcast. So you have, these are the people that say gender is not really relevant. 34% of female Democrats, 45% of female independence, and 63% of female Republicans. But on the male side, it's 61% of male Republicans, 50% of male independence, and 58% of male Democrats say gender is not relevant. The majority of four of the six groups and the plurality of five of the six groups say, look, this isn't about gender. And this was also reflected in some of the questions they asked about race. It was questions about income. It was questions about all sorts of different dynamics that they measured this. People generally speaking say, yeah, like I might have something in common with it, but I don't see myself as a member of a group that we all have to walk and lockstep. I'm an individual. And I think in the more that we can treat people as individuals and not as members of groups, the less problems we have. I mean, what is racism at its core? It's identifying people as just a thing in a group rather than seeing them as an individual. Something different. It's like, that's what we are. We're different people, and I'm glad to see that that's reflected so widely. So is the takeaway here that female Democrats are crazy? You know, I don't think so exactly. But I just wanted to be clear. Yeah, okay. I just wanted to clarify. It seems to be your takeaway. That shows that you're sexist. All right. Let me see what's the poll question we have here today. All right. Today's poll comedians have officially been scrapped from the White House Correspondence Dinner. Some think the dinner should be eliminated entirely while others believe it's an important tradition. What do you think? Let us know on the blazes Twitter that is at the blaze and we will see you guys tomorrow. Thanks for tuning in. Thanks for being here. You're coming back tomorrow. Yep. I believe we should just eliminate the dinner or food. So they have to sit there for three hours and listen to some of those people. Like what you're hearing?
