    "text": " Thank you for listening to this podcast one production. Your life, your country, your listening to the Laura Ingram podcast. That press conference with the ROM Emmanuel, liberal, Clint and Esta, outgoing mayor of Chicago and the police superintendent, Eddie Johnson reacting to the Jesse Smallet case being dismissed. 16 felony counts dismissed record expunged. Okay, the record is expunged. That means there's no record of it and they sealed the grand jury report. So you have no grand jury information either about this. So we get no information except we know that police have apparently a treasure trove of information. Implicating him. We've all seen the, we all see the video surveillance video in the hardware store of the two Nigerians. Who were buying the rope and the red hat and all of this together, all of this combined. Absolutely ends up being, as Emmanuel said, a whitewash. This is a prime example of two different types of justice, one for celebrities and one for everybody else. And it's, it's quite amazing on many fronts. It involves George Soros perhaps or Michelle Obama's former chief of staff, Kim Fox, who was the state attorney who supposedly recused herself after having received text messages from Michelle's old chief of staff about how we really want to. We really want to kind of. We're really concerned about the police having this investigation, but really appreciate it. This could go to the FBI instead, meaning. What we want to get it off the Chicago police's plate and put it right on the FBI. Well, because, I mean, you think the FBI is going to spend time focusing on a case of a celebrity hoax in Chicago. They got bigger fish to fry. But they wanted this, they wanted this out of their laps really fast. So just days after small at told Chicago police, he fought off a pair of attackers. Remember, they targeted him because he was gay and he was black. The Cook County state's attorney, Kim Fox tried to persuade the police superintendent to transfer the entire thing over to the FBI. So she makes a call. After the former chief of staff contacted her. Now, this all stinks to high heaven. And I'm actually. Gratified and. Surprised. Very surprised and I'm not surprised by much anymore that Rahm Emanuel actually stood up and said, uh, this is ridiculous. Mr. Smollett is still saying that he is innocent. Still running down the Chicago police department. How dare him. This is not the superintendent and the detective department word against his. And even after this whitewash, still still no sense of ownership of what he's done. He says that in fact, he is the wrong in this case. The man has no shame. Just see small it. Could have caused race riots. Violence, not just in Chicago, but across the country. And we say this a lot, but I'm going to, I'm going to. I mean, I'm going to say this again because I think it's important to think of it this way. If someone who was white and conservative. Faked a crime committed against him. That supposedly happened by two black guys who were. Trying to get him for being a Trump fan. And said cracker or something. Scream cracker. We hate Donald Trump. And the whole thing ends up taking up all of this police police resources and hours. Turns out he faked the whole thing. Again, the victim, a white. Suppose a victim, a white conservative guy who claims a couple of black guys attacked him. Because he liked Trump. Can you imagine what these people would be saying? Oh my God. It would be. It would be Armageddon out there. They would be blaming Trump for it. They would say this atmosphere and this fraud is created by Donald Trump and we won't stop till we get to the bottom of this. But when it's shoes on the other foot. Oh no, you seal the record. Have him do a couple of days of community service at Jesse Jackson's operation rainbow push. Shakedown organization. Membership drive. So it's like a two for you help the left by helping Jesse Jackson and you get credit for community service. That that made me laugh. I've got to say I've been truthful and consistent on every single level since day one. I would not be my mother's son. If I was capable of one drop of what I was accused of. This has been an incredibly difficult time. Honestly, one of the worst of my entire life. But I'm a man of faith and I'm a man that has knowledge of my history and I would not bring my family. Our lives or the movement through a fire like this. I just wouldn't. But make no mistakes. I will always continue to fight for the justice equality and betterment of marginalized people everywhere. Oh my God. Now he's rose a parks. Okay. The marginalized people. Yeah, marginalized people include people who fake hate crimes. Yeah, you're definitely representing them well. There's got to be something wrong with him. There's got to be just something really off. This is just a. Again, I've seen a lot in my 20 plus years in the media. In covering politics and the culture. I don't think I've ever seen anything like quite like this. Extremely odd. George Soros gave four hundred and eighty thousand dollars to Kim Foxes. Through an organization to support Kim Foxes. Efforts in Chicago. Okay, Breitbart did a big piece on that. A four hundred and eight thousand excuse me. Not 80. So she ran in 2016. Against this incumbent Anita Alvarez who faced intense. Public controversy. Over that Laquan McDonald murder that black teenager 2014. So Fox ran on a criminal justice reform platform telling the local ABC news at the time that she wanted to focus on restoring faith in our criminal system. And bridging the divide between the community and law enforcement. How's that worked out? Alvarez received donations from the quote old boy network. But Fox found other donors including Soros. Kim Fox found two other sources of cash in the form of twin three hundred thousand dollar donations to a super PAC supporting her called Illinois Safety and Justice. The sole donors to the PAC. Our neoliberal super donor. George Soros and a dark money group called civic participation action fund. A super PAC. You all know it's just a big fundraising group and the citizens United decision. Allowing those to raise money largely you don't know who really gives money to these things and as long as they don't coordinate on any level with political campaigns. Then they can basically do whatever they want. They can raise as much money as they want as long as they don't again coordinate with the campaigns. So state campaign finance records show. That Soros personally contributed a total of three hundred thousand three hundred thirty three thousand to Fox the super PAC. Before that March 15th primary was over and an additional seventy five thousand after she won. That's very curious. Don't you think why would George Soros be so. Focused. On this race in Chicago. She has higher. Ambitions obviously and she's this Fox. Gal has connections going way high up into the Obama's very curious. George Soros have other fish to fry other. Campaigns to donate to. I want to thank all of our sponsors. Genuselle and Syro vital they both help provide this podcast to you free and many others. Couple times a week you get to download three times a week you get to download this podcast and we got such a great response in our first few months of launch. And let's keep it going. You'll learn more about these great products special offers by the way later on in the show. Tina Glandian is an attorney for Jesse Smalllet and she was on GMA with Stefanopoulos and he's questioning her about. Okay. Well what's next for you guys? I mean you're going to. They're going to sue the police. Final final question. You've said clearly you think the police are not telling the truth about Jesse. Are you going to sue. We're weighing our options now for Jesse. What's really important is he really just wants his career and his life back. I don't know. I mean we're shocked at the mayor and the police superintendent doubling down yesterday when the prosecutor after a dispassioned look at the evidence realized that this does not hold up and chose to voluntarily dismiss all counts and expunges record. So at this point we're going to weigh our options and see and see how this develops. We're going to weigh our options. Now is Byron York chief political correspondent for the Washington Examiner and Fox News contributor. So we had a couple of hoaxes on our hands. We had the Russia hoax Russia collusion hoax. And now this one. This is like. This is manna for cable heaven here. This is unbelievable Byron. How are you? I'm doing great. I have to tell you the obviously the news that they just dropped. All the charges against Jesse Smollett was huge news. But for me, I mean the first moment I heard it they said they dropped the charges and sealed the record. Remember Chicago police had talked about there just being a mountain of evidence that Smollett was guilty in this case. But he states his own hate crime against himself. And of course the grand jury indicted him on 16 counts. So this wasn't just police leaking stuff. This was the grand jury making a decision. Now all that evidence is apparently sealed and hidden from public view. And I would imagine that maybe one way it could come out would be if Jesse Smollett suits somebody which he would be insane to do and will not do. If some other legal proceedings come from this matter and remember now if the record has expunged it as if it's as if it's just if it's Jesse Smollett never did these things. He's the victim of a hate crime attack. And Chicago police need to solve this. Now what is really odd is that George Soros would give $408,000 to a state's attorney race. Now here's a little bit of context I can add to this that might help. I heard you mention that. Remember the 2000 presidential race, the Florida recount? Obviously the Secretary of State in that was very connected to Jeb Bush. And a lot of people on the left felt that she had helped fix the election for Jeb Bush. And then if you remember in 2004 there were people in that sort of Soros world who believed, I mean they actually believed that Carl Rove had personally hacked the election, the voting machines. And Ohio somehow if that hadn't happened John Kerry would be president. So a bunch of millionaires including or billionaires including Soros after they had spent so much money trying to defeat Bush in 2004 decided that they needed to sort of salt their money, spread their money in lower state office races as well to make sure that things are when their controversies arrived there settled the way they want them to. So they started something called the Secretaries of State Project and tried to get progressive Democrats elected as Secretaries of State in as many states as they could. So if there were election disputes they'd go their way. And I think the spending a lot of money on a Cook County State's attorney's race falls in that same category. So what is interesting is when you think about the money that Soros spends it's not just when the race comes down to Trump versus Clinton or presidential level race, he's spending it at all levels to affect outcomes at all levels. That's really actually smart of them. It's very smart. I know they're putting a lot of money into state judge races in Arizona. So if they can own the judges in important electoral states they can really change a lot. I mean they can change a lot of that. I think that happens in Arizona. Remember it happened over there. They're law about illegal immigrants. It's a huge fight. Well if you have your people in the key positions in the state when the giant controversy arises you're in good shape. Yeah and I think that we're going to see a lot more of this. Just friends of mine in Arizona have told me that Tom Steyer himself has poured in gobs and gobs of money into these very, you would think are kind of obscure races. I think it's super smart. You only have a few Sheldon Adelson's, it seems, on the right they better come up with some more big donors to try to get to remove the needle the other way. This is what Tina Glandy and the attorney for Small It by the way said on Good Morning America. Again he did not ask for any of this. He was a victim of a crime. This has completely spiraled out of control and become a political event at this point. And his goal and focus right now is just getting his life back on track. He has not even started healing from the initial attack because he's been dealing with everything that's happened since then. I mean is this so still maintaining he's a victim of an attack after he does community service with Jesse Jackson's operation rainbow push. Yeah, I know, you know, there's something actually very interesting that occurred. A conflict between his, what his attorneys were saying and what the state's attorneys were saying. And that is, you know, when I first heard this news I was right around the car and I thought, and I didn't initially hear why this had been done. And I thought, well, gee, maybe there's some revelation that they've discovered that evidence. They thought was solid is actually not solid or the case fell apart. And then you find out later they didn't even pretend that there was some sort of change in the evidence or that Jesse Smollett is not guilty of staging this hate crime against himself. They didn't even pretend that. As a matter of fact, the state's attorney said they stood by the charges. They had just dropped and sealed. So instead they said, well, in exchange for this community service, which is apparently advising rainbow push on the best camera angles to use in some of the stuffing envelopes. PSA is something and stuffing some envelopes. So in exchange for this community service plus forfeiting his $10,000 bond, which is a tiny, tiny fraction of the amount that Chicago police spent trying to get to the police. Chicago police spent trying to solve this case. So in exchange for that, they dropped the charges and expunged the record, which they said was a just resolution to this case. Now, if you listen to his attorneys who came out and spoke when they came out of court, they said there was no deal. That he agreed to do community service because he's such a great guy. And he agreed to give up the $10,000 bond because he's such a great guy, but there was no requirement. There was no deal. It wasn't in exchange for anything. And the state's attorney just dropped it. So I mean, the thing is, in this case, the state's attorney just dropped it because they wanted to drop it. That's the only explanation there is for it. Oh, my goodness. Well, this was Joe Maggots, who's one of the assistant prosecutors. Even he said this. This was not an exaggeration to say that he was exonerated by us or anyone else is natural. I called an alternative disposition in that he agreed to do community service. He agreed to forfeit his bail to the remainder of his bond to the city of Chicago. And in return for him doing those things, we agreed to dismiss the indictment. Okay. That is a deal that his lawyers deny was made. His lawyers say there was no requirement that he did those things. That needs to be cleared up. Yeah. That is just preposterous. I mean, I mean, the account indictment returned by a grand jury. Okay. You're listening to the Laura Ingraham podcast. We're talking to Byron York. Byron, we have to get on to the next hoax though, because this Russia collusion hoax is the aftermath of this is really quite fascinating. The left never. I mean, I always say this being a liberal means never having to say you're sorry. Like you just don't ever have to. You mean, they say Trump doesn't apologize. They literally dragged the country through two years of Trump's a traitor. And the only person who wrote a piece that made any sense, I think from the left is Matt Taiby. And, you know, he hates Fox and he, you know, he's, you know, he's a real left wing guy. But at least he said this was a horrific moment for the American media and forget the Democrats, what they said. But they're just pivoting to now Trump is going to push mother mom or grandmom off the cliff with health care or Mueller's report's going to really reveal the truth. The full report. I mean, it's quite something. Well, there's a lot of movement taking place. First of all, on Democrats on Capitol Hill, they had a meeting Monday night. Basically decided that they were going to stop pushing collusion. It was interfering with their legislative agenda. What I think that really means is they're going to compartmentalize things so that Jerry Nadler and Elijah Koppel, and Adam Schiff are going to continue their investigations just as much as they were before. But Nancy Pelosi will come and talk about health care all the time. So I think the investigations don't go away, but they're more compartmentalized. As far as the talking heads are concerned, I mean, if you spent two full years investing your entire public persona in a theory, the collusion theory, you're not just going to completely give it up. Now, some people we've seen have just pivoted quickly to obstruction in which the bar summary is not at all conclusive about obstruction. Or some have decided to absolutely stick with their guns. We believe collusion occurred. I believe Ralph Peters, the former Fox News commentator said on CNN that he believed the dossier is true. He said this like they are. He's mentally. He's mentally. And so they're not going to give up on this. And the one thing I will say here, as a matter of fact, I've just posted a piece on the Washington Examiner. Oh, good. Which is we need to get this report released. I said that last night, absolutely. This is absolutely crazy the way that's going on because we have these snippets on the issue of collusion, and a snippet on the issue of obstruction. All we have is what the, quote, principal conclusions that the Attorney General has shown us. Now, one of the things I've looked into, as you know, can a star when he investigated the Monica Lewinsky scandal? wrote a long report, 445 pages. Gave it to Congress, and that was under the old special counsel law that no longer exists. Gave it to Congress. It was filled with grand jury material. He gave it to Congress on Wednesday, September 9, 1998. On Friday, the House voted to release it, and by within an hour, millions of people were reading it on the Internet. A star had gone to a court beforehand and said, this is the grand jury material I need to release to Congress, because it is against the law. Right. For a prosecutor to make grand jury information public, it's against the law for them to send it to Congress. You can't just give it to Congress, because of course they'll make it public. You have to go to a court and get permission to do this. A star did that ahead of time. I don't know why Mueller did not do that. Maybe he tried, and we don't know about it, and there was a problem. But there are ways to get around this. You either get a court to give you permission to release the parts of the grand jury testimony that you've included in your report. Or you write your report in a way that includes information from FBI interviews that are not as protected as grand jury information. But you write it in a way. You know that this is the most important document when it comes out. It will be the most important document on the face of the planet for a good while. There's intense public interest. It's of the highest importance, because Democrats hope to use it to remove the president from office. And you know this is going to be released, and it's got to be made public. So why this was handled this way? I do not know. The Justice Department is now saying it will be weeks, not months, but weeks. Before something is released, it could be a sanitized version of the Mueller report. Or it could just be a much longer summary written by the Attorney General. And the fact is everybody is making arguments without having read the report, because it's secret right now. And this is a crazy situation. Mueller and Barr should have fixed that. No, absolutely. And this was by the way, on your point about how they're still maintaining that Peters was still maintaining that. The dossier was true. This is what that charmer, Eric Swalwell, said on Fox. So it doesn't bother you that the Clinton campaign paid for a dossier to be put together by someone who had all kinds of ties to intelligence and put together something that turned out to be not necessarily factual. That part of that. Which part of it hasn't been proved factual? Well Christopher Jill himself said it was not a finished work product. And everyone analyzes it. Which part was not proved factual? I mean, are you serious? Martha didn't really have any answer for him on that. So now someone can put something out that's unverified. And then it's a burden on you. Just prove that it's not true. That's a really, that's a clever deal. By the way, just so your listeners know, two of the major purveyors of the dossier, David Corn and Michael Isekoff, appeared on MSNBC. They are so before. And Isekoff in particular said, look, the dossier made all of these allegations and it wasn't true. I think if you remember when people say, well some parts of the dossier haven't been proven true, but it's broad argument is true that Trump and Russia conspired in the 2016 election. I mean that was the big point of the dossier, which is that there was a broad and deep and long running conspiracy between Russia and Trump to fix the election. Even the small parts of the Mueller report that we have via the Attorney General say that's not true. And so I think, like the two sentences we have already have already destroyed the dossier. I'm finding this. This is like a psychological profiling experience. Don't you think on the people's reaction to this? It's all about people's longings. If you desperately want this to be true, and then if you find out it's not, you're going to reject the evidence that it's not true. And I think we're seeing this play out actually on television now. It's almost like they have a narrative. And regardless of what happens to prove it false, they're going to hold on to that narrative. The narrative never changes. The villains, the heroes never changes. That you're so invested. You're so identified with it. You've devoted two years of your life to it. So I don't care what anyone says. It is true. That's like insane. The definition of insanity. But I have to tell you, I firmly believe, and I'm sure you do too, that the voters are actually not insane. And a lot of them, I'm sure, have withheld judgment on the Trump-Russia issue. And even the brief conclusion that we have from Mueller that the evidence does not establish that those coordination or conspiracy. I think they're going to look at that and say, okay, that's settled. Because everybody had agreed that Robert Mueller was the authority on this and that his conclusion on this would carry an enormous amount of weight. So I think if Democrats try to keep pushing this, they're going to lose altitude with this, which is pretty obvious. That's why they said, oh, let's talk about health care. It's very clear why they were trying to change the subject. Their leadership was. And so you can get an audience on cable news of 3 million people who have this particular belief. But in terms of winning an election, I think all of Democrats know this is not going to be a platform for them. And the reason it's not a platform is, while Eric Swalwell cannot face reality, I think the voters will process this and say, okay, that wasn't true. No, that's an excellent point. Do you think the timing of this small thing, by the way, there's a lot of whispering online that it's odd timing that this would happen with this Mueller report coming down? Or do you think there's nothing, there's no comment? I mean, my initial, first of all, I don't know anything. So this, I mean, my initial reaction would be skeptical at that point. I think that, you know, the small case had its own dynamic. We knew that this former aide to Mrs. Obama was in touch with the state's attorney. We knew there were other efforts on this. We knew this had been percolating up. And so I'm not, I just don't think there would be any connection. We did hear that Chicago police superintendent yesterday on Tuesday say that he learned about these charges being dropped at the same time that everybody else did. In other words, through the press. A friend of mine sent me this. Listen to this, Byron. A friend of mine said this. I'm nervous that Rahm Emanuel and other Dems are setting a trap for Trump saying the feds must rush in to prosecute given that the DA won't. If Trump took that bait, the Justice Department, the Dems will say that he himself is acting on a belief that a prosecutor's decision not to prosecute like Mueller's can't be trusted. So I say, I mean, there's other possibility, which is that Trump respects the prosecutor's decision and that the feds go in to prosecute the unsolicited. The unsundero brothers for the hate crime. The fact that this seems like a crazy suggestion shows you how much it's clear that Jesse Smallett did this. But there's an open case now for all legal purposes, this hate crime occurred. This man was attacked by MAGA hat wearing thugs who said it was MAGA country. He was attacked because he's black and he's gay. That all exists now and we have these two suspects. And you would think that bringing them up on federal hate crime charges would release all this evidence and we would finally find the whole story, which would, I think, be very good for the process. So the president could actually respect the decision of the prosecutors and the federal government could prosecute somebody for this crime. Do you think the left is going to stay on this Russia thing though for the next few years or do you think they're going to move on to? Well, I think that with the release of the report, which you and I both hope will be, you know, really a full version of the report, there's going to be evidence that they can use. I mean, there's no doubt about that though. You know, certainly my feeling is if you release the report, there will be people who will argue that it dead solid proves the Trump obstructed justice. And you'll have people argue that it dead solid proves that he did not obstruct justice. So, you know, their partisans will be able to use this. But the thing I was saying before about the big picture that voters have, I think that this is going to be closed in their mind. Fairly soon. And, yeah, my view is that, yeah, my view, Byron is that the Republicans better have really clear answers on this healthcare thing with what's happened with everybody's health insurance and the cost and the out of pocket and, and. In the way they're messaging this Obamacare decision not to, you know, to want all of Obamacare overturned. It seems like things happen in a really small little, you know, small drips and drabs and there's no overall messaging coming from the administration. One part of the government not talking to the other part of the government. I agree. You're absolutely right because it is true that if you look at exit polls from 2018, you know, healthcare was a huge thing for a lot of voters. And it's going to be the same in 2020. And, you know, Trump, I think, can say that he got rid of the most onerous parts of the, of Obamacare basically by saying he got rid of the individual mandate. And I think voters never liked that. They didn't like it at all. But we all know that pre-existing conditions coverage is very, very popular with voters. And if Republicans are going to say, well, we're going to take that away. It better be as part of a deal that makes things better and doesn't just take it away. Yeah, I think that's like those are the kinds of issues that the Democrats are just going to go to town on. Byron York on the tail of two hoaxes and what this says about our current culture politically beyond that entertainment. I mean, it is a, it's been a while, two years. And now we're going to go into a real year and a half sprint to the 2020 election. It's hard to believe or more than a little more than a year and a half, but it's going to be here before you know it and we'll be covering it every step of the way. Byron, thank you so much. It's always, always great to have you on the podcast. Thank you, Laura. All right. Let's go right to the lines. Let's go to Joseph in New York. Joseph, welcome. Hi, Laura. Thank you for having me on. You're welcome. Okay, so, Jesse small. What I wanted to say is I'm 32 years old, right? And I've been hearing about privilege for the last few years from the left from the media. And I look at this and I have who's really privileged. He has connections to the state attorney general, possibly to the Obama. He commits a hopes files of police report and walks away with less than a flap on a risk. I think it's disgusting. And one more point I wanted to make. You mentioned it with Byron York about a trap, a possible trap for the president. People are saying on Twitter, you know, how could you be made if Smolik is walking and not made about Trump, the bar report, the bar report on Mueller. And the difference is there's actual evidence in the Jesse smaller case. I mean, yeah, that's good. I'm going to go and bite at him. You know, they let him go. Well, and also Mueller can't prosecute. Mueller can only make findings and then send the findings on to the attorney general who then can send the findings on to Congress. So Mueller himself is not a, he's not making a decision to prosecute. He's an investigator who. Interviews a lot of people and sometimes he comes to conclusions about evidence and sometimes he doesn't, but he is even though it's called special prosecutor. He himself is not gone as far as the president is concerned. So that that's up to Congress to prosecute the president. This is Brian Stelter on CNN, must we? But I do think we will see Smolik get back to work because the narrative is once again changed from victim, you know, to villain back to victim. It's been very confusing as Ryan was saying. Confused. People don't know what to believe and we may never really know what happened on the street that night in Chicago. But for his fans, for his friends, this is a triumphant moment that he can now get back to what he wants to do, which is work. I never really ever know this triumphant moment. Oh my God. Carla, Texas, Carla help us help us, Carla. God, this is nuts. We need help. Jesse is definitely a villain. You look no further than his social media postings, which are filled with hateful, hateful profanity regarding our president and his supporters. Yeah, that's why they wanted to protect him. That's why they all wanted it to be true because he, as he said, he's going to keep fighting for marginalized people. Oh, please, you're fighting for your job. So you're fighting for. I'm so tired of these people trying to make themselves out to be these superheroes for the underprivileged. If you're a superhero for the underprivileged, first of all, you don't talk about it. Second of all, you don't fake hate crimes and make the police in Chicago have to devote a thousand hours to your case, and then, meaning they don't have the time to devote it to people who really need the help. It's just a complete fraud in the fact that that state attorney that Kim Fox. I would not trust her as far as I could throw her. I can tell you that. Let's go to Charlotte and Charlotte, are you in Louisiana? Yes, I already like you. I love Louisiana. How you doing, girl? I'm great. How are you all? I'm great. Thank you. I think the most disturbing thing about this incident is the effect is going to have on future victims of hate crimes. And just as in the whole Supreme Court nominee debacle and the Me Too movement. These fake crimes and these hoaxes just hurt future victims. And I feel like in our society, we should support victims coming forward and reporting crimes. And even if they can't be proven, make them a matter of record so that hopefully the perpetrators will eventually be caught and punished. But if people have taken these crimes, it makes the victims think, well, why should I go forward? People are going to taunt me and laugh at me and say, oh, yeah, do you like Jesse? I'm so sure you were a victim. And that's really the most obscene part of all of this is that it's hurting the actual victims of hate crimes and sexual assault. I can't disagree with anything that you just said. I feel so sad. I feel sad for, you don't have to be able to feel sad for. I feel sad for our kids. A lot of people listening, you might have grandkids. Because this is so wrong on so many levels that our country is torn apart by this stupid Russia collusion hoax for two years. And that the media devotes itself to covering this just small at case for the last two or three months, two months, I guess. And all of the emoting on television to tell us what a racist country we must still have for people to be pushed into doing this by the nastiness of the atmosphere created by conservatives and Donald Trump. Remember, the Jesse Smallet case was all about Trump. That was linking Trump to a hate crime because we were supposed to believe, this was implicit in their commentary, that Trump was the one who spurred this attack. We have to remember that. The first reaction, the reporter said is that he told police initially that the hats weren't just red hats, they were MAGA hats. Then they kind of tried to back off on that. But no, that's what he said initially to authorities. So this was a, these were two Trump hoaxes, anti Trump hoaxes being perpetrated on the American public. One in the city of Chicago by a Trump hating celebrity activist. Two by deep state that wanted to stop Trump from ever becoming president. Then we became president. They wanted him out. Two anti Trump hoaxes on the American people. One national and international implications, the other Chicago based, but still reverberated across the country. It's stunning. Really? I mean, it's complete beyond a complete outrage and completely political. I want to talk to you all about what happens. You get a little older. You start feeling like your energy is declining.

No. That masculinity itself is toxic and terrible and poisonous. All of those things in fact has to be discouraged in many ways. Oh, they go crazy when you say you throw like a girl. You're not supposed to say that anymore. Oh my gosh. Well, guess I'm guilty as someone who could throw like a like a guy. I'm guilty of saying that on occasion. You're listening to Laura Ingram podcast the attack on masculinity and we're going to dig deep into this. What does this say about our current state of affairs in this country and what is the real agenda behind this? Stay there. You're listening to the Laura Ingram podcast. We have to now dig very deeply into a subject that we've addressed before, but not in the way we're about to address it. The attack on masculinity. What it means. Who's driving it? What the real intentions are of these individuals? What their ultimate goals are and why you should pay attention and why you should resist this. We're going to talk to a few people, one who's had a personal horrible experience with her own son being unfairly targeted and another man who studied this phenomenon. Joining us now is Dr. Paul Nathanson, gender relations professor researcher at McGill University. And he's wrote a book some years ago that addresses this issue of this goddess ideology and the attack on masculinity called sanctifying. Misindry, he joins us now as part of this deeper look into what really is going on. We have the singer Sam Smith making this big announcement that he's feeling just as much as a woman as I am a man. He's feeling like he has to announce that, whatever that means. He went from gay to saying he doesn't know what his gender is. And then we have the royal couple in Britain, Prince Harry and his wife. They're not going to raise their child apparently as a boy or a girl, but just let the child figure it out. This is just ludicrous. Professor Nathanson joins us now. Professor, I miss my mom every day, but there are days like this where I'm glad she does not even hear to see this because this is ridiculous. What's going on here, Professor? Well, you've already touched on many of the things that are going on. From my point of view, one of the things that is most important and the other things are, I think, offshoots is the hurricane of hostility that has been generated by one form of feminism. I call it ideological feminism. People discuss things now in public discourse. People discuss sexual harassment, for example. They seldom, if ever, discuss the counterpart of that, which is what I call identity harassment, identity harassment against men. There's a long history of that. During past 50 years, it's probably always existed as both misogyny and misandry have probably always been around to some degree, but political events make one or the other more important than right now. Feminism has monopolized public discourse on gender, and in doing so, they have promoted not equality, which is what they purport to be promoting, but rather inequality, in of the reverse kind. In other words, men are now the source of all suffering and evil. Women are the inherent victims and good people, and history is a gigantic conspiracy of men to oppress women. It's a thoroughly cynical and un go-on-sable point of view. That's where we are now. We have now taken, we've developed offshoots of that in hands, movements, and non-binary movements, because feminism challenged the notion of gender. Of course, why confine yourself to making gender more compatible with the needs and aspirations of women when you can simply eliminate gender altogether? As if you could. I don't think- And I want everyone to understand that. Misandry is actually, and a lot of people might not even know what that means. No real reason you have to, but- It's the sexist counterpart of misogyny. Yeah, so it's the prejudice against men or boys, basically. It's contempt. It's utter contempt for men. Well, yes, I mean, I would go even further and face the dignity. It amounts to hatred. And hatred is not an emotion. It's not anger. It's a culturally propagated worldview. It's institutionalized. It's taught in schools. And it's not simply a transient emotion. So why is this happening? What's the underlying reason? Well, I think that one of the underlying events that entailed development such as this was the development of the pill in the 1960s, because that was an unprecedented discovery in all of human history. It separated pleasure from reproduction. Now, once that separation occurred, people thought, well, now we can undo millennia of culture. We can rewrite scripts or abandon scripts. We can re-engineer society. And so one of the products of the pill, albeit an unwitting one, it was the elaboration of gender series and ultimately the development of feminist ideology. Their goal ultimately is the destruction or elimination of the traditional family, though. Is it not? That's really the ultimate. That's what we want to get at here, because that's really what's going on. I mean, if masculinity is bad, and men are inherently going to be patriarchal, unless somehow we can train them and beat this out of them to be protectors and to be courageous and all these things that we impute upon men, well, if you get rid of all that, then the traditional family itself collapses, and that's one last bastion of Western, biblically centered morality that's developing our, and has helped us prosper, frankly, for millennia. And advance in millennia. Yeah, that's true. I think that the trans people have taken it one step further, because by abandoning gender altogether, not simply rewriting it, they're basically trying to use social engineering to create a new species, which is what, in fact, the trans human has been doing for the past half century, and medical and other technologies to develop a new species. So the goal is really quite radical. We're not talking about people who want to simply do a bit of reform here and there, add a new category. They want, they must, in fact, destroy whatever is in order to replace it with what they think should be. So this is, we're talking about revolution, not reform. And the new species will be looking like what? It will be part human, part animal, and it will be human mostly part machine. But, you know, I don't think not everybody really accepts science fiction writers who have transformed their genre. You know, one time science fiction was about the wonders of the universe and what might be discovered there. But over the past few decades science fiction has become increasingly cynical and dystopian as distinct from utopian. So science fiction writers are worried about this, but of course, because they're fiction writers, they'll want to pay attention to them. The transhumanists have been active and are an active movement, and they are developing technologies including deep freezing until, deep freezing of bodies until science discovers a cure for this or that disease, cryo-generation. So this is all going on behind the scenes. Now I'm not saying that every feminist or every trans advocate is actively thinking about all this. There, most of them are probably just saying, hey, this is good for me. Let's have more of it. And I'm speaking from a perspective that I think needs to be mentioned here. I'm a gay man, and I certainly in childhood might have been diagnosed with gender dysphoria had I been alive now, had I been a young boy now. Because I didn't fit the standard format of masculinity. However, I never thought that I was a girl. I just, and that wasn't in the cultural repertory, I simply didn't understand what being a boy was about. Now I have to say that I'm very glad that no school teachers join forces with sociologists and social workers and psychiatrists to give me hormone therapy or even surgery. Because as I say, it turned out that I'm just a gay man, I'm not trans. So, I say this because my perspective is not one of detachment. I'm not somehow above all this. I don't look down on people who are confused about who they are. I just think that the solution that many are choosing to either mutilate their bodies in one way or another, in order to affect a cosmetic change, because you can't change your chromosomes, you can only change outward appearance. I think that that solution is a misguided one. Well, and there was this just terrifying panel discussion. Maybe it was in February, I think February, January is recent at the Heritage Foundation in Washington and maybe you saw it professor. If you haven't, we'll make sure we link it up and send it to you. Of feminists, and I think a couple were lesbian feminists, and just basically they were not conservative fire brands or anything. These were people who were either gay or feminists who described the most horrifying things that are happening and happened to them personally with their children in public schools. And that their children, in one case, one child was taken from them from her. And because the child said, I want hormones, I want to go in through puberty blockers, I want to do this. And the mother said, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, we're not doing that. And actually the state, I think it was Washington state, acted against the parents' interests. Yeah. Scary. I mean, these were people who were like, look, I'm a gay woman. This is, they are truly taking our children from us. Well, you know, we've had other moral panics. About 10 or 15 years ago, we had the panic that was called, uh, uh, retrieved memory syndrome, recovered memory syndrome, which turned out to be false memory syndrome. But hundreds and hundreds of families were destroyed. Social workers came in, empowered by the state, took the children away, destroyed the families. On the basis of unprovable and under-monsterable accusations. And we're still getting false accusations. Only now it's in the, it's in the MeToo context. I mean, so these things keep reappearing. But meanwhile, we have these children who, maybe they're sensitive, maybe they'll be gay, maybe they are gay. But a lot of the kids are, look, I mean, I was someone who was playing three sports. I couldn't stand wearing dresses. My mother would make me more dressed. I went over pants. It was like I was a tomboy. Okay. And I mean, I don't know what they would say today about me. I don't know if I would be corralled into this, a group of people who may think about being transgender or gay. I don't know, but I can tell you from the words of parents who have gone through this, it is terrifying. And the percentage of kids who go through this and then commit suicide. And then who are like, oh my God, now my brain is fully developed. I'm 25. What have I done to my body? Yeah. Horrible. In fact, in England, there was a school. This was about a year ago in which 17 children, decided that they were boys, not girls. And the school, without consulting the parents, of course, recommended that they get hormone treatment and begin the process of transitioning. Now, somebody else has written the book recently. I can't remember her name, but if she's well, she's in the news. You can find her easily. In which she talks about, she invented the term rapid onset gender dysphoria. And she described that as a distinct phenomenon. And she described the cause mainly to social contagion. In other words, if your peer group, if your friends are thinking in the same way, they very often come to the same conclusion. And it might be friends in your school. It might be friends that you've met on the internet. But there's a kind of contagion involved, but there's a different phenomenon from social dysphoria, which usually occurs in very, very young children. And sometimes, it sometimes disappears. So we're dealing with a problem that is taking on... This is child abuse. I'm going to say it. You don't have to say it. You don't have to say it, professor, because you're a professor in a steamed institution like McGill, which is a phenomenal school, by the way. This is a form of child abuse. I'm sorry, but I'm going to say it. And I don't care what anyone says about me. I don't care if they try to throw me out. This is child abuse to do this to children who are learning about the world, who are figuring things out, who are developing to stop their human biological natural development. And we're worried about putting hormones in meat and milk. These are the same people like I have to eat organic, professor. Yeah. Okay. You can disturb the reproductive system. Oh, just, you know, just my condition to become a woman and have your reproductive... Organs no longer able to produce children. I mean, they're a very serious consequence. It's not just a matter of feeling good. But professor, the language in and of itself, I think is part of the problem because the thought police will tell you, you must say, you might say this person who is transgender is now a man. You must say that. But is that scientifically the case? No, definitely not. That's crazy. No medical procedure can change your chromosomes. Every chromosome in your body either has two X chromosomes or an X and a Y chromosome. You can change the... The look. Your luck. Change the... At a cosmetic level, you can pass for the opposite sex, but you can't be the opposite sex. So, again, where do we end up? I mean, I know this is a very kind of clich\u00e9 question, but all my friends who are into the artificial intelligence world and investments say that this is really what will... This will change the world in the next 30 years, like 10 fold with the internet change the world. That's what they're saying. And I don't know if that ties into all of this and the transhumanism and all of that, but it seems to me that we are on the verge of changing our very essence, our humanity. I think that, let's say 50 years ago, changes occurred. The pill became a reality and you can't put the genie back in the box. But I think that some of the things... Some of the movements that developed from that, social engineering movements are at least in theory possible to argue with. So, of course, it's politically possible to do that arguing, which it isn't at the moment. Right. So, then what happens? No, I don't have a crystal ball. People have this question often. I know. Where are we going? That's why I didn't want to ask it, but I asked it anyway. Well, all I can say is this. I mean, I have done a lot of reading in both history and anthropology. I can tell you that trying to abolish gender. Gender is something other than sex, by the way. Gender is the cultural interpretation of biological sex. Trying to abolish gender would be an unprecedented activity. No human society has ever not had some gender system. Some of them are very minimal, but they're still there. There is still some need of culture to interpret and enhance the differences that are initiated by sex itself. So, we've never had a society without women, without men. There's always been some interaction. Heather of sexuality depends on that. And therefore, so does reproduction. Well, reproduction. Unprecedented. Yeah. And without, I mean, so if you can reproduce without that man, the ultimate natural act of reproduction, once reproduction and sex become delinked, then unlinked. Well, look, we already have technologies that are in the process of replacing natural reproduction. We have all sorts of in vitro and surrogate methods. We have, you know, on the drawing board is part of the novel genesis. Now these are all technologies that really could undermine the need for either women or men or both. So, we're playing a very dangerous game here. Well, you were born, where were you born, Professor? You were born in Canada, what, late 1940s, something like that? I was born in New York, actually. Oh, okay. Okay. Wow. What a different world. I'm an old cudger. No, you're not old. You're not, you're wise though. I can tell you that. You're very wise. Well, you know, I had to stop thinking about what is good for me. I mean, when I, in the 1960s, I called myself a feminist. I thought, look, they're challenging gender, which for me was a big problem. Why shouldn't I support feminism? But then I began to read feminist literature, and by the 1970s and 80s, it was becoming very, very hateful stuff. It was no longer about equality, which it had been originally. It was about something else entirely. And so, I had to question, at each step of the way, I've had to question my own assumptions. And I tell you now that in a democracy, people, citizens, must think not only about what's good for me and people like me, but also what's good for the community at large. If you don't do that, if you cannot even entertain the possibility of thinking of society ahead of your own interests, then you can't have a democracy. And there's no point in democracy. Well, I agree with you. I mean, if you see it in the way people dress, the way they speak in public, people show up. I know what I call air travel now, professor. I say it's sweat pant nation. I've never seen so many sweat pants and yoga pants in my life. I mean, the pants industry must be losing money because, and these are always people who you don't want to see in yoga pants. Okay, I mean, God bless them, but most of you aren't doing yoga. It's whatever is easiest for me, just pull on a pair of yoga pants. And I'm just saying, if you don't care about how the world considers you or these spaces or whether we should interact with people, we're not using swear words in public around kids or not watching porn on your laptop when a little kid is sitting behind you on a plane, that's all part of it. Right? All part of this, not caring. But I move from sweat pants to me too, because me too is a much more disturbing phenomenon because it overtly undermines due process and the rule of law. It legitimates vigilantism. And that's a problem. That's a huge problem. Well, and then it's again, where do you ever go to get your reputation back? I mean, I know people who were friends with the Duke kids, the Duke lacrosse players, a couple of them are working in New York, but they're even though they were completely exonerated, they couldn't get jobs. That's right. That's what happened. Totally exonerated. The woman made the whole thing up. The court of public appeal takes precedence over the court of law. So you have, instead of justice, you have revenge. Justice after all is something that incorporates the notion of reconciliation. Revenge does not. So with all due respect to the women who have suffered assault at work, I wouldn't go so far as to say as some do, believe women, any woman at all costs, because it's not true. No, and by the way, like anyone else. Yeah, well, there's some women who are tough, tough to work with, some women who are bullies, some women who are impatient. I'm very impatient. And men are too. I don't like any bully. I don't like bullies in any regard. I've never, never liked bullies. Well, what I want to get back to, I'm determined to get back to this is the notion of identity harassment, because I think that that is having a devastating effect on boys and men. And you can see that effect partly in the very, very much higher rates of suicide, for example, among males and much higher rates of dropping out of school. One of the things that happens when, see, I think that to have a healthy identity, either as a person or as a group, you must be able to make at least one contribution to society that is A, distinctive, B, necessary, and C, publicly valued. And if you cannot do that, then some people will simply say, okay, if I can't have a healthy identity, I'll have an unhealthy one. Thank you very much. And it's in that context that you have the breeding, the marination of people in resentment. Right. Well, I know a lot of kids on college campuses, or just they don't speak. Gavin News, they don't speak because they're afraid. The boys are afraid to say anything. Gavin Newsom was on the view. It's a show on ABC in the United States. No reason to watch it, but it's often entertaining. The governor of California, this is what he said. The biggest issue we have in this country, the crisis of boys. The fact is, I would argue the most dangerous words in the English language are man up. Be a man. Don't be assisted. Right. And we hear that all the time. And what happens, the young child puts a mask on and their face grows in it to become how society expects them to have. And what we have as a society is a crisis of suicides, disproportionately men, issues related to dropouts and binge drinking. All these issues, one thing in common, including mass shootings, men. Okay, well, he's right. We have a boy crisis, but I mean, but not, but like man up is the biggest, the most dangerous words. That kind of hyperbole is another thing that I can't stand. Well, look, he's a politician. This is political rhetoric, but I can tell you from an academic point of view that the problem he mentioned is real. It's demonstrable. Oh, yeah. That is the. It's the. It's ignored. Well, boys again, all those years ago, Christina Hoff summers wrote the war against boys. That's right. Twenty two years ago, whatever, she was way ahead of the curve. And that's right. And in fact, one of the things that I should mention here, if you haven't already mentioned it elsewhere, is that many of the people who are waking up to this are, in fact, women. Oh, they don't like the men that they're dating, perhaps, or interacting with. Many women, many women or their moms have shung that they worry about. And many women simply want fairness. And many women are still committed to the notion of egalitarianism. So I think it's important. This is not just a matter of men saying one thing and women saying another. There are women who are waking up to this. Well, and we're going to talk to one of them in a few moments because her son had to pay a very steep price. Professor, you are just fascinating. And we really appreciate your, well, your scholarship, your deep thinking on these issues and your deep study. And we hope you come back soon. It's so great to have a long form audio interviews where we can really, really dig into issues like this. Thank you so much, Professor. Thank you very much. All right. And coming up, Renee Jolly is going to join us, the parent of a son who was falsely accused by a female student, wrongfully expelled from his university. She's going to join us in just one moment.

A really notable woman who needed a hill, a professor, showed the courage of a lifetime talking about her experience being harassed by Clarence Thomas. We knew a lot less about the extent of harassment back then over 30 years ago, but she paid a terrible price. She was abused through the hearing. She was taken advantage of. Her reputation was attacked. I wish I could have done something. I posed Clarence Thomas nomination. I voted against him, but I also realized there was a real and perceived problem the committee faced. There were a bunch of white guys. Now, I'm in this sincerely, a bunch of white guys hearing this testimony in the Senate Judiciary Committee. Joe Biden is running for president. He hasn't announced yet. And that was an example of a man contorting himself to the age, to this time that we live in, where if you're a man, you have to constantly apologize. Everybody knows that I clerked for Clarence Thomas. Anita Hill and what she accused him of all those years ago was the first in a long line of false accusations alleged against men who are years and years later forced to answer questions that fly in allegations that fly in the face of actual conduct. So Anita Hill, of course, invited Clarence Thomas to speak at her university. I mean, if someone abused me, I wouldn't invite him to speak at my university. I wouldn't keep in touch with them. I wouldn't hope that he comes to visit and et cetera, et cetera. And there are no contemporaneous corroboration by the hundreds of women who worked over the years with Justice Thomas. So knowing him, like I know my family, it was, it was, could not have been the case. And her, her, the things she alleged, they were both single people. The things that they, she alleged as far as my memory even serves me, if it serves me correctly, or didn't rise to the level of what most of you would consider to be on the job harassment. She didn't receive promotions because she wasn't talented enough to receive promotions. But again, if you're a woman, you don't receive a, receive a promotion or if you're a member of a protected class and you don't perceive, receive a promotion, what do you do today? You sue, you sue people, you try to sue them into submission and you're rewarded for it regardless of whether the underlying accusations are true or not. And I mean, he's, Justice Thomas is one of my favorite people on the face of the planet. And let me tell you, the use of, of gender or the use of the Me Toov movement as a way to form this weapon politically is gotten really tired. We know the Anita Hill hearings were deeply flawed. There were lots of allegations at the time. There were a lot of corroborating witnesses that weren't even interviewed. And, and which is why when we had the most recent Kavanaugh hearings, we were so focused on all these corroborating witnesses that the committee would not allow to testify. So they made the same mistakes again. not allowing truth to be told not allowing full transparency and all of this goes to this overwhelmingly important issue to me and should be to America that do we value women? This is all they have. Do we value women? Well let me say you're a woman and you're a senator. Okay, Hillary was a woman she ran for president. You both want to be independent and strong and you want to get special treatment. That's the problem. You treated in a way that's different than men because men have to answer these accusations. Women can make the accusations and throw the whole country into turmoil by making accusations decades later, 35 years later. How do you defend against an accusation 35 years from now? How do you? Like just imagine you're walking down the street now and imagine 35 years from now. Women says, oh, when he walked down the street, he called me a name. He said this about me. He spat on my shoe and used a racial epithet. What? I didn't do that. Then what do you do? How do you ever defend yourself? Well I told someone at the time and well he happens to be dead now. But he's so he can't, it's just ridiculous. The whole thing. Joining us now is Renee Jolly. Her son was falsely accused by a female student and wrongly terminated. Renee Jolly's son found himself in the crosshairs of the Me Too movement and I just think the use of sexual harassment allegations as weapons rather than for vindicating those who are truly victimized and protecting them. She joins us now. Renee, what happened to your son and when? So this happened five years ago Laura and by the way, thank you for having me on today. He was on full on the ROTC scholarship at the university and he was expelled for an allegation of sexual assault by a woman, a young girl who when in fact the evidence and the fact showed he was more likely than not the one sexually assaulted by his accuser while he was passed out. And the school did not consider this evidence. It included photographs, it included key eyewitness statements. But they had made a decision in my son's case long before it was over because they did their investigation with start by believing in a very victim centered investigation which as you know when we began by start by believing the complainant were in effect presuming guilt on the accused. So there was no fair process from the get go. So this was Columbia University. So was there a student disciplinary hearing in addition to a anything else, the criminal proceeding? No, interesting one, Lee and I, there wasn't. The beginning of the inference started with an email that he received from the student conduct office stating that he may have violated the student conduct code. They didn't say what he was being accused of, who was accusing him, what incident was in question or even when the incident occurred. He had no opportunity to prepare. So he had basically a 20 minute conversation with a student conduct office and two months later he was expelled. He was able to give names of people who were witnesses and could corroborate his side of the story. But the school denied considering that evidence and didn't even included in their final 16 page investigative report. Oh my God. And how long did it take before this whole allegation fell apart? It was about, it, she went to the student conduct office about six weeks after she claimed the incident occurred and two months after that he was expelled. And there was no opportunity for him to have a hearing. The presumption of innocence was not given to him. He didn't get written notice of actual allegations who was accusing him. He didn't get an opportunity to review the evidence. Didn't get a right to cross examine the right to a hearing. So he really was denied due process. And like you had mentioned earlier in your, in your opening, in my son's case, for example, there were two witnesses who walked in the room and saw the incident occurring and they gave their individual statements to the student conduct office. But yet in the final report, the student conduct report said that because they were his friends and their stories were so similar, they must be lying. Yet we also know how their stories been different than they would also have been accused of lying. No way for my son's innocence to be proven because they'd already long before considered him guilty. What's your son doing now and how has this affected his life going forward? So this occurred about five years ago. And with a mark on his record, it was very difficult for him to get into another university. But he did. He finally got into another university, but he did lose his entire army ROTC scholarship where he had planned on serving in the military as a second lieutenant. And he now actually has to pay back the government, the portion of the scholarship they paid for his education while he was at that school. So you know, his entire trajectory was changed, but he's moving forward best he can and really proud of him and how he's moving forward to get this behind him. But why can't you sue the university for this? Why didn't you file a lawsuit? So looking back, this was five years ago and five years ago, there wasn't a lot of precedent set and we honestly, Laura, didn't have the financial means at the time to do a lawsuit. There had been another case in the state where a student had sued the university and they got a settlement of $15,000. After everything that our son lost, it's especially the scholarship and that opportunity to serve as a military officer, that wasn't adequate and we just felt that going to the Department of Education, Office of Civil Rights, would help to ensure this never happened again, that the school would have to change their policies. And we really hope that the outcome of his case will set a precedent so that other students can also follow and benefit from not having this happen to them again. There's been over 1,500 students who have contacted a nonprofit called Safe called Families Advocating for Campus Equality in just the last four years, whose students have also been expelled or suspended without a fair process at their university and this needs to stop. And what's Betsy DeVos? Is the education secretary regulations that would they just affect state schools, I guess, not private schools, obviously? No, actually, the new guidelines are, as I read through them and made some comments on them, they actually include both public and private universities to have a fair process. And so what she is taking us back to constitutional protections because what she's calling for is presumption of innocence for students to get written notice of the actual allegations, including who's naming them, the opportunities for both sides to review the evidence, the vote to cross-examination right to hear everything that my son did not get, she is calling for her new guidance. And my son was one of seven accused students who were expelled from their university who actually went before Secretary DeVos and her Department of Education in the summer of 2017 to share his story to help them understand really what is going on on university campuses because students should not have to lose their constitutional protection when they walk on campus. No, it's not right. It's completely outrageous. What is your son doing now? Is he out working? He's out working right now. He's got his degree and he's working and moving forward. He actually is considering going to applying to law school, taking his LSAT. I think these students are going to make excellent attorneys because they've learned first hand in justice. Well, they've learned a lot and it's a travesty. It's a complete travesty. But again, it's weaponizing human relationships and weaponizing the two movement now and a lot of these women especially feel like, and look, look at Jesse Smalllett did. He just made up a whole thing and he wrapped the whole nation into this news cycle, completely lied about it and got off scot-free. It's unbelievable. So it's all part of a piece. No personal responsibility and everybody wants a quick path to fame and fortune. And there's a lot of casualties along the way. Renee, we really appreciate it. And thank you for joining us.
