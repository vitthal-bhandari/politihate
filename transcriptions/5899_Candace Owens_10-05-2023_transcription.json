    "text": " All right, guys, happy Wednesday. First and foremost, I reminded you all that I am still in London, so there may be a few audio, tricky audio issues because we are not, of course, in our usual studio, so please bear with us. I mean, to the question of the day, though, guys, how do you know if your child is trans? Think about that. It's a big question. We're hearing this now that your child can just wake up one day and decide that there's something else. And so I want to take you through an all-important checklist because for all you know, you're a child. You're listening to this. He or she might be something else. Plus later on in the show, we're going to talk about jazz Jennings again because she has issued a scathing response to me and Ben Shapiro. Oof, I am feeling the sick burn right now. All that and more today coming up on Canvas Oans. Watch psych influentials from technologyazi Mangans Australia. It's a big question. How do you know if your kid, your child, is trans? Obviously, this is now a huge cultural debate people that are sharing a lot of stories about the moment that they knew, the one that they looked at their precious child didn't realize that in fact, They were born in the wrong body and they were the opposite gender and they realized they had to help them achieve Becoming the opposite gender and so I gathered some of these reasons because I do realize that there is a common denominator And I'm hopeful that it can help you if you're watching a show and you have young children like I have so first and foremost We have this woman this woman of speaking out against A pediatric gender a bill part and that would ban pediatric gender mutilation in Louisiana So she decided to testify in front of a Louisiana house of representatives against that bill known as House bill 463 And she just shared her personal story She shares that she knew that her daughter was actually a son Because of her food choices when she was a baby take a listen At anxiety and would never sleep and we couldn't figure out what the problem was we took him to specialists and Neurologists and he had brain scans trying to figure out why he couldn't sleep Then as he grew he got to sleeping But his food choices were odd they were always like green vegetables raw green vegetables Which you know kids most kids don't like to eat those things And then the precocious puberty All of those things once we figured out That he was transgender when he came to us and told us That he was transgender when we went back and realized that the pattern of Everything that he had experienced as a child including eating green vegetables because that boost testosterone were just methods of His body trying to become who he was meant to be His brain does not match his physiology So there you have it. I mean, I don't know about the rest of you, but I have questions I mean when my baby did not sleep my son did not sleep I never thought to pause myself and ask if whether or not as an infant he was experiencing Anxiety because he was in the wrong body and maybe my son actually wanted to be a girl I mean every parent ever goes through a baby that won't sleep a toddler that won't sleep But this woman realized that it was a sign that actually her son might in fact be a daughter But if that didn't sell you, let's not forget that something even more serious happened her daughter liked Vegetables which is Extremely concerning to me because I too have a ten month old baby girl who loves vegetables No matter what I put into her face She just really genuinely loves food, but she especially does love vegetables She eats them my son never did and she loves them So maybe I'm just not paying enough attention as a parent to the fact that she may in fact be trying to signal to me That she's in the wrong body because vegetables as this woman shared Increased testosterone and what she's dying for really is testosterone So I am just so happy that this woman shared her testimony really showed us how she knew it was That her daughter was actually a boy. Does this sound crazy to you? This is not crazy to you Well buckle in because we're gonna get to some more stories of people that recognize that their children were trans This is another woman who decided to testify against HB 463 a reminder if this would just ban pediatric gender mutilation if you want to turn 18 and you want to take a bunch of pills Totally fine being adults But this these people are standing up and saying we cannot do this because children to need to have their puberty blocks Well, this woman knew when her child was just 18 months old She knew her daughter too was also a boy and here is why take a listen Sure, sorry I was Christmas shopping for them They were 18 months old and I bought one of those toy tool benches and I was making the joke that well when one of them Comes to me and says they're a man when they're 18 I can't say I didn't see it coming just because they kind of did draw the boy toys And I was just making a joke But I am so glad I said it out loud because I have that in my mind now that at 18 months old something something somewhere Was telling me what he knew all along sure? Okay But so when he could start talking he articulated to me that he was a boy mommy I'm a boy mommy. I'm a boy and both of my kids did mommy. I'm a puppy all that it's it was very different and We drug our feet on it cuz what you know, it's normal to not understand that obviously so we saw therapists and we saw doctors and Ultimately we came to know what he is known all along which is that he really is a boy. He really is and I Will be starting gender affirming care for him He's been seeing doctors for years and it is a very long process. They are very thorough so now that he is a Almost 11 and starting puberty We are discussing puberty blockers and what that would do would prevent him from growing the body of a woman Because I promise you he's not a woman He shouldn't be in a woman's body and honestly, I don't think he could survive if we forced him into it I really don't so we will find that care for him I will go to the ends of the earth if I had to for either of these children And we'll probably just go to New York and not the ends of the earth But if this bill passes, so please don't make us travel for doctors appointments Did you hear that guys? Don't pay attention to the fact that she sounds completely unhinged and she's talking very quickly and very in a very concerning manner Which makes me implicitly not trust her or believe that she is a stable individual But she said some really important things here that I want to slow down She knew that her daughter was in fact a son when she was 18 months old because she liked to play with boy toys And now I am shooketh to my core Because I have a 10 month old daughter and she too plays with boy toys when my son who is two years old has his toys around She gravitates towards them. She tries to get on his bike. She plays with his tools Clearly, this is a clear sign that she is trying to signal to me first and foremost She's eating the vegetables She's eating the vegetable my daughter eats the vegetables she likes to play with her older brother's toys the Logical conclusion completely logical conclusion is that she therefore must be a boy So this woman is deciding that she's going to start her now 11 year old on puberty blockers Something that we do know Deforms the body when they are sustained on the body for a long time on these puberty blockers known as loop-ron Which is also given to pedophiles to castrate them in prison They will never be able to become sexually productive in their lives But that's all fine with her because at some age I'm assuming he was she was a toddler her daughter looked up for her and said mommy I'm a boy and that is all that it took for this mother to believe That in fact the child that she had the once 18 month old that played with boys toys Must obviously be trying to scream to them that they are in fact a boy The other thing that she says is that her other children when they were that age when they became toddlers said mommy I'm a puppy and so I have questions is she also going to transition her remaining children which are humans Into puppies. I hope that she's beginning that process because Clearly if we should add credence to everything that toddlers say if her other children tried to express the fact that they were puppies It would follow that she should also travel across state lines or to the ends of the earth as she put it to help her other children Transition into animals does that sound crazy to you because I'm recognizing this theme throughout these individuals that support these Transitions for example some pop culture ones Charlize Theron. I liked her very much in movies. She adopted a son and his name is Jackson a young black boy And then we started realizing that Jackson was wearing dresses and when she spoke out about this She said that one day Jackson looked up at her when he was in the tub and said I am not a boy I Don't know maybe he said he was a dolphin. He said he was a mermaid I have baby sat for little girls that say they are mermaids And yet Charlie's Theron knew in that moment that it therefore must be true and she is now dressing up her young adopted black son Jackson in dresses now personally me of being a sane individual would say that she should have the child removed from her care Because people that abused children Take them out of foster care and take them out of adoptive care to abuse them in my opinion should be in prison But no, she's being applauded and she's being celebrated for listening to her very sensible Three-year-old the same kinds of people that tell us that they're puppies and that they're Batman and that they're Superman and that they're fish Should be listened to when they tell you that they are the opposite sex And so she has begun that transition process for Jackson So I have recognized that there is in fact a common denominator If you are like me and you are at the edge of your seat wondering whether or not you're 10-month-old You're 18-month-old you're three-year-old you're six-year-old you're 11-year-old you're any year old below the age of 18 may in fact Be the opposite sex if you're sitting here and you have that thought is my child trans let me tell you what I know for a fact No, but you are mentally unwell You are not a mentally sound individual You are not somebody that should be in the care of children and that is a way bigger mountain for you to scale If you want to help your child you should help yourself. I'm serious Check into a clinic and examine why it is that you believe that any individual can transition their sex Transition their gender or transition their species you need help Not the children that are in your care and that's all I'm going to say about that There are a lot of things not to like about tech giants But what can you actually do about it when you rely on so many other products?

Now it's time for some topic to show All right, so jazz Jennings has responded to me and ouchy it hurts it really really hurts to remind you of who jazz Jennings is and who and why we covered her on the show Obviously, I always speak out against child abuse and jazz Jennings was such an unbelievable cultural example of child abuse TLC Putting her onto the network essentially it was conducted. It was a cultural a neo-Frankenstein experiment I don't say this to be mean to jazz Jennings. I am saying it because that's exactly what it was We experimented American society watched as this young girl had her private parts Experimented on the doctor tells you it's the first time we've ever done these things just to remind you what jazz Jennings lived through take a look at this compilation I started the puberty blockers at age 11 and hormones at when I was 12 She's one of the first to have undergone complete pre-roidal suppression And lack of growth of the skin and other tissues which we rely on as surgeons to do this operation I was just not expecting her to have a complication as severe as what she did have The wounds were definitely separating and she formed like a blister like it's almost like a blood blister As we were getting her under bed Like I felt something go pop And when I looked the whole thing had just split open so the hissons on the outside it was it was bad She really was under so much tension that it created these large wounds So we took a little bit of a skin graft from the other side of her groin which we didn't use before and I just put that in over the open wounds repacked to vagina and we covered everything up Let the skin recover as much as it can Skin grafts don't always work and if that happens and we probably just do the skin grafts again Let me just take a picture to Porp thing you could be a porn star for all the photos are taken I have some concern that we can get enough mobility of the tissues that we can make the labial structures Look convincing You know, I really thought after this third surgery that everything would be smooth sailing But now there's this whole hiccup My peace dream is not quite going out in the right direction and just recently I've been experiencing less clitoral sensation. I feel like I've already lost the aesthetics You know, hopefully after this revision it'll look good once it heals But if I lose some of my sensation and nerve endings, I might never experience an orgasm every single child who was or adolescent who was truly blocked at tanner stage two Is has never experienced orgasm. I mean, it's it's really about zero So there you have it And that's why I referred to this as neo-frankenstein Obviously jaz Blood blister formed where his penis used to be we know that jaz jennings suffered these wounds They had to use skin grafts and again, nobody Intervened nobody said this is absolutely wrong for us to be watching And what can we do to help this child get away from his abusive parent So of course I covered this on my show because we need to talk about this We need to talk about the dark term that culture has taken where we are quite literally looking at people like as if they are Carnival ax looking for more in more extreme examples What people are willing to do for fame and for profit as jaz jennings mothers did And jaz jennings got wind of this video that I did and decided to respond to not just me But to also then shapiro take a listen You person that a lot of people look up to Her name is candace oh, and this is what this is what she had to say about you and your gender affirming care My five-year-old came up to me and explained that actually he wants to be a girl. That was all it took What is that what is that signal to you? It wasn't all it took. I didn't just say I want to be a girl and whoop We began the transition. No, it was a process. I had to work with medical professionals I had a therapist who confirmed that I had gender dysphoria and it was really Not an overnight decision. In fact, it wasn't even a decision at all. It was me Marching to the beat of my job being my authentic self at a young age knowing who I am and everyone just embracing me I was persistent consistent and insistent I showed my mom that this wasn't just a phase but that I was intent on living my life as a girl And that was who I was and she listened to me. She didn't force me to be anything She didn't abuse me in any way Instead she heard me and said my child is hurting my child is not able to be their true authentic self How could I help her and she all she did was embrace me? She didn't encourage me. She didn't force me, but she embraced me and followed my lead I'm very blessed that I was able to avoid male puberty. I'm very blessed that I was able to develop as a woman I've always wanted boobies and I got my boobies. So I'm happy with my body. I am proud to be me and I just You know me saying that right here right now should be enough enough to dispel all of them as conceptions enough to dispel all of the hatred I Am me and I just want to be embraced for who I am Or did they push jazz to openly identify in that direction because jazz was a small child a very very small child All this is incredibly disturbing thinking about disturbing things You know here here's a disturbing one for you. You're going to dot head on over to policygenius.com slash apparel and get started with the prop jazz, what do you think about mr. Ben Shapiro famous Ben Shapiro talking about your story And then right in the middle of it I'm trying to monetize off your experience and then say your parents are abusers people like him are the problem Not trans people to promote life insurance after saying that you know my parents were abusers and that I was a young child And I didn't know what I was talking about. We don't know what we're doing. Well, well It's not like you really care about my life or the lives of the lgbtqa plus community So why are you promoting life insurance in the middle of a video talking about us like Boy, it's a real now boy. Bye. My parents have never abused me in any way whatsoever And I'm here saying now. I love my parents. I love them so much And um, and I am jat this person was born in 2000 This person is a boy I and uh and was transitioned by his parents when he was a very very young kid my Oh, it's almost like comedic at this point I've been watching these videos over and over again And it's just not for these people to define me and tell me who I am. I'm defined myself I know who I am and just shut up and let me be let our community be let us thrive You know, why do you have to bring us down? Why do you care so much? It's just so Annoying and so stupid. They don't know my life My personal business and I'm here saying right now that I have no regrets when it comes to my transition I am proud to be me So for people to jump to that conclusion that I read my transition It's just not true and me saying that right here right now Should be enough so give up already give up on trying to tear our community down because you never will We are going to exist forever. We're always going to be here and you cannot stop us So josh jennings has Stockholm syndrome. My parents didn't abuse me in any way whatsoever I just literally watched your parents abuse you I could pull up tons of clips of your parents abusing you The earlier clip that I show was your was your mother talking about how She was going to go into your room and dilate the wound where your penis used to be and where they created a pseudo vagina Herself if you did not masturbate it to keep it open If you don't think that's abused jazz, it's because you've been abused for so long that you have begun to love your abusers I pity you. I feel sad for you, but I offer no apologies for my critiques You the little boy buy at the end You are the boy that needs to be told by and that's all i'm going to say on that topic Moving on this was something that made me so happy So there is an actress named of angeline lily And she stars in ant man and the wasp and she posted something to instagram Which never happens anybody that is in hollywood obviously must necessarily be on the left and must necessarily support uh gender transition and the trans agenda or else be eaten by the mob Well, evangeline has decided to speak out about something that she is seeing it's decided that she thinks is wrong And it is a tremendously conservative perspective and one that I share a lot on this show And man julene wrote why are we only applauding masculinity in women and villainizing it in men? And why are we only applauding femininity in men and debasing it in women? Why can't we just allow for all of it? Why do we feel the need to vilify a man wearing Kicker boots driving a pickup truck who's not afraid to punch someone in the face But if there were a woman, they would be the epitome of cool Why is a man who loves makeup? Christ easily and stays at home betends to the domestic responsibilities valient But valiance but a woman who does the same is pathetic Ah of angeline you have stumbled upon what I have been saying Four years which is that they encourage men to act like women while at the same time They encourage women to act like men and they get angry when a man acts like a man They want a man to have his tail in between the legs They want a man to be especially a feminist they want him to wear makeup They want him to put on nails and they say that's amazing that strength That's the ultimate masculinity when it is anything but but when you see real men like you said that drive around in a pickup Real men that are leading their households they immediately attack it and they say it's wrong and they say it's backwards And they strangely try to correlate it to racism These are white men rednecks and this all needs to be erased And that is because if you are actually wanting to know the answer to your question of angeline It is because ultimately what we are seeing in our society is a repeat attack on the family Via many different leftist cults at their core what they want to do is disrupt the family Because a solid family a nuclear family stands in the way of the state and full omnipotence Right what better way to fracture the family unit than to pervert gender roles To tell women that they shouldn't be raising their children that they need to climb a ladder Don't have children until you're 40. Oh, you can't have any children Well, that's too bad at least you have your career to hug at night Telling them that they shouldn't lead their households that they should be more effeminate pushing for individuals to be identify as either lesbian or gay What does that do it perverts the family unit? It means that you won't have children You don't have mom dad and a brother or a sister sitting around the family Table talking about these topics raising strong children that are attached to their family and not attached to the state You once you recognize that when you start with this question of why you will realize it everywhere You will realize that everything in the left pushes for even the climate change lobby is an attack on family because what they tell those children Who are behind Greta Thunberg and who are skipping school and talking about how the world is going to end in 10 years They tell those children in classrooms. They would be irresponsible For them to go on and start a family because the planet's going to be dead in 10 years Agree to only have one child. It is incredible Once I began looking and I began asking those questions You do realize that what is happening is a state Sponsored attempt to attack the nuclear family unit, which is exactly what conservatives like myself fight for have more babies Keep your families together men be men women be women Let the women be the ceo of the households Let the women raise the children and not allow the departments of education to raise your children and pollute their minds to turn them into State soldiers and let men lead their families properly And that's all i'm going to say on that topic As mother's day approaches I want to highlight an organization that cares deeply for mothers and that's preborn Preborns network of clinics exists exclusively to offer love life and support to pregnant women Who are feeling scared alone and pressured to make the ultimate choice that will not only sacrifice the life of their preborn baby But take a piece of their own heart When a distressed mother comes to a preborn clinic She is welcomed with open arms and has offered a free ultrasound to hear and see the precious life inside of her The majority of the time she will choose life So racist father is um, he was my mentor. We met working at the shop. I was comfortable Being along with him. I thought we were good friends I kind of took that as an opportunity to just get to know him on a deeper level I guess he wasn't interested in that and he was more interested in the physical aspect of everything When I found out I was pregnant he was not okay with that either He pushed for an abortion and that's how I came to the clinic So I felt like the only ones that were really there for me Were the women at the clinic and it actually did empower me and help me I was late enough to get my ultrasound still remember, you know feeling everything It's changing. I said I would not get an abortion So I was going to raise this baby with her without him. So he said without I think if I didn't find the clinic, but I probably would have considered abortion The women there are just so kind of they're just so genuine That would not be this strong without the clinic. My dreams now revolve around my son I want to let people know that it's not over No matter what age you are, you know, you find out your pregnancy It's not over and that there there are places to go and I want he individuals that are Involved in the clinic to know how much we are all eternally grateful For everything that they do If I did abort my son, I would live with many regrets now that I have the way I don't think I can be in this world without My son saved me. I cannot unless they say that changed my life for the better This mother's day you can help bring life to both a mother in need and an at-risk baby One ultrasound costs just 28 the cost of a dinner to save a life Five ultrasounds are $140 Every penny goes towards loving mothers and babies and when you become a monthly sponsor You will receive pictures and stories of the lives that you help to save Help me secure my goal of rescuing 10,000 babies donate securely dial pound 250 and say the keyword baby that's pound 250 baby or you can go to preborn.com slash candace That's preborn.com slash candace jumping into this last story a trans woman Also known as a man has been cleared of flashing his penis at three women Using an ohio ymca facility after the judge ruled that the tranny was too fat for his genitals to be visible This is a real case. I wish I was making it up, but I am not Uh, darren glines is his original name He now goes by rachel was found not guilty of three counts of indecent exposure at the facility and the judge David mcmame cleared him after agreeing that the size of his belly meant to it be impossible for anyone to see his penis I don't even know to say this guys. I welcome to modernity. Welcome to 1023 Where you are so fat that I am going to allow you to continue to sexually assault people I mean because that's really what's taking place you have obviously Several people complained made complaints that daring lines Dating back 2021 Was sitting in the female locker room naked and obviously they saw his penis and this is how this became a case in the first place But now these women are going to be gaslit and despite the fact that I this is what I say If you want to talk about the worst aspects of the trans agenda is that it allows petafiles and perverts to fly under the banner And to fly under the radar because they say oh, I'm just in here exposing my genitals because I'm actually a woman And it's no it's because you get off on it. Okay, if multiple women are making this complaint These women need to be protected and the fact that they are going through the right channels They are filing these complaints that they are they are taking this two judges only to have their concerns dismissed Is the misogyny that people claim exists in our society being blatantly ignored where it actually exists? It is taking place in locker rooms. It is taking place in female sports when women are being told they have to compete with male swimmers That if they don't like seeing their junk too bad, they're a bigot We no longer protect women in any spaces because we are essentially saying that the feelings of A man Are more important than the reality of a woman Right in reality a woman is seeing a man with his penis out in a locker room The feelings of that man are being put in the forefront though when they're saying well, he feels like a woman so too bad Shame on this judge. This was the absolute wrong decision. I will assume without looking at the details That this judge leans to the left an absolute abomination and why we have to fight this at every every Manner that we can in every circumstance that we can we have to fight this ideology All right guys now i'm going to get into some of your comments from episodes past First and foremost you guys loved that video My airport at my airport encounter of that mentally ill young woman who tried to punch a police officer And then claim to have Tourette's because why not you can do anything now and then say i'm the real victim of my mental illness I'm the victim. Sorry if my penis is in your face I'm the victim because I was born in the wrong body this girl tried to punch a Officer three four times and then said I have Tourette's as if having Tourette's which is actually something that people suffer from Automatically means that you're violent. I mean what an insult people that have Tourette's Tennessee girl 79 said i'm proud of you candace not that i'd expect anything less what we need is more people standing up to these entitled brats and woke idiots I have a friend with Tourette's syndrome and that is not how they behave nobody with Tourette's thinks about being tick-tock famous That is correct before she began all of this she said i'm going to be tick-tock famous to the police officer And calmed down suddenly her mental illness seemed to get into check when I yelled at her And we need more public shame I'm a big believer in public shame and i'm glad that you guys got to see the circumstance happen because just you know I don't just talk but talk. I walk the walk. I am the number one karenan society I go around and I shame people perpetually in public because the way that they behave Especially at airports there's just no decorum It needs to be shamed more shame guys not less of it the five birds writes my oldest son 30 years old has Tourette's and he has never Behaved like this. He is extremely smart and polite. No mental illness has a 3.8 gpa She has not appeared to be a person with Tourette's usually when a person with Tourette's hasn't outbursts some people have it worse than others They also lose control of their body and spasm with cursing just throwing out my knowledge here That's actually the first thing that I thought uh when somebody said do you think she actually had Tourette's I said no There were no body spasms and that is obviously when you have Tourette's you do have body spasms She had absolutely none what she's gonna say her trying to punch the police officer was a spasm It obviously wasn't she was conscious of what she was doing especially turning around to me and saying oh you're black Shouldn't you like this? I called him a pig. He's a police officer. This is a learned behavior from tick-tock She has a tick-tock disorder not Tourette's in my view Next couple of comments were pertaining to my video on Jordan Nealey an individual who was incidentally killed on a subway Who was attacking routinely by the way? It's now come out that he had assaulted A person that I think that was 67 a few weeks before he had a warrant out for his arrest He had 44 arrests over the last 10 years Why are these people allowed to walk on the streets? Of course They should be in prison or as I have suggested in an asana asylum Michelle han writes I live in a red state. I have an adult son with paranoid schizophrenia for our safety and the safety of others We documented his threats and are able to have him under court ordered inpatient psychiatric care It is absolutely the hardest most loving thing we can do for him and for those that he may hurt I wouldn't want for anyone to be in a position. I'm needing to defend themselves from him I'm grateful that in this horrible situation to live in a state that has common sense laws to protect its most vulnerable citizens I couldn't agree more that Michelle you were absolutely doing the right thing People that have mental illness We cannot expect that people who are well need to just deal with people who are mentally unwell Constantly threatening us and killing us this makes me think of that recent case Which you guys may or may not be following of that young girl in Arizona who just got killed on a hiking trail a psychopath ran up Behind her stabbed her 15 times and she was found dead on the trail But next day and it turns out of course that he had a very long arrest record of many assaults And because he's a black male and she is a white female There aren't going to be any protests that take place outside Right because when white people are killed by crazy black people for whatever reason It's perfectly fine But when a white person does the right thing as the marine who took out during nearly did and he didn't even attempt to kill him Suddenly there are protests and saying no we we need to have more rights for mentally well people No, we have to mentally unwell people. No, we have too many rights for insane people It absolutely infuriates me that is allowed to keep going on Stop acting me asking me to be more compassionate get your crazy under control Kim ziger writes I was just talking to my 11 year old granddaughter about the need for shame without shame society is lost Thank you for taking a stand. You are welcome. You can always count on me to shame people I will continue to do that because people need to be shamed and lastly captain hindsight. What a great name on youtube captain hindsight He writes I think you can still feel bad for someone without defending them Yeah, I do I feel bad for the marine and I defended him I did both actually so all I can say for Jordan nearly is any person that goes around Riting to throw people on the tracks and assaulting old people is not someone that I feel bad for I will not feel bad for people that are violent in our society All right guys That is all the time that we have for today Make sure you click the link in the description and subscribe to daily wire plus for all of my exclusive content And be sure to come back tomorrow because there will be a brand new episode. I'll see you then"
