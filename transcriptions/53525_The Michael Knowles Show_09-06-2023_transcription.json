    "text": " On the very same day that a Republican lawmaker revealed allegations from a previously undisclosed FBI memo that Ukraine did, in fact, bribe Joe Biden, Joe himself, and his son Hunter to the tune of $5 million each, the Biden DOJ announced that it would indict Donald Trump over his alleged mishandling of classified documents. We sometimes joke about these indictments. Oh, here they go again. Seems to me I've heard that song before, which radical DA is exploiting a porn star or a gossip columnist or whoever to drag Trump over bogus charges this time. We sometimes say this will only help Trump's political chances. His numbers are going to go up. Yeah, sure. This is a little bit different. This isn't some two-bit prosecutor in New York. This is the federal government. Joe Biden's federal government indicting Joe Biden's chief political rival over an alleged crime that Trump not only could not have committed because he couldn't have mishandled the classified documents because as president, he had the right to declassify whatever he wanted, however he wanted to do it. But furthermore, it's over an alleged crime that Joe Biden himself committed. Joe Biden had classified documents strewn all over the place unsecured in multiple states. And he committed that crime when he did not have the power to declassify those documents at will. The DOJ is indicting Trump for having some outdated physical copies of presidential documents in his home under lock and key, all with the full knowledge of the government. While Hillary Clinton stored classified contemporary information on an easily hackable home server and didn't get so much as a slap on the wrist, no Democrats have gotten in trouble at all for that. Donald Trump could go to prison for the rest of his life. Now, even Joe Biden's DOJ is not so reckless and stupid as to go after Trump on the classified documents charge per se, since they know as well as anyone that Trump had the right to declassify. So instead, they're going after him for violating the Espionage Act. You know that super spy Donald Trump, agent for Moscow or whatever, the same nonsense they've been promoting for seven years that has now been totally disproven time and time again. They're going after him for, quote, gathering, transmitting or losing information respecting the national defense. They're going after him for obstructing justice. They charges that are so obviously political that even my leftist doppelganger on MSNBC is admitting it. You have to wonder if the Justice Department is considering whether there is some political solution to this criminal problem, whether part of the issue here is not just that Trump has committed crimes, but that Trump has committed crimes and plans on being back in the White House. Do they consider as part of a potential plea offer something that would prescribe him, pro-scribe him from running for office again? I don't know. There it is. Well, maybe they'll make a deal. We won't throw you in prison for the rest of your life, but you just got to stop running for office. I don't care, especially, not only do I not care how high your poll numbers are, especially when your poll numbers get high, we're going to stop you from running. We're going to stop people from having the chance to vote for you. How's that sound? Is that a good deal for this allegedly terrible crime? For all the parole clutching over Trump's upending of norms and our sacred democracy, Trump pretty much just joked about it. Lock her up was a funny line against Hillary in a debate. It was not something that he ever seriously intended to do. When Democrats worried that locking up presidential candidates to say nothing of former presidents would send us fully into banana republic territory, they were right. That's why we didn't do it then. And that's exactly why they are doing it now. I'm Michael Knowles. That's the Michael Knowles show. Welcome back to the show.

Really telling story of a gal who is working on only fans and selling pictures of her body and everything. Even though she could have been a lawyer, she has fancy degrees, good educational background. She decided to become a porn star. And her reasoning for it is quite bad, but it's reasoning that a lot of modern people take up. So we'll get to that in a second. First though, I don't want to let our corrupt establishment off the hook. Not even just here in the United States, even over in France. Did you hear about this attack yesterday? Horrific horrific attack where a migrant in France, a Middle Eastern migrant, starts wreaking havoc around a playground and starts stabbing little toddlers. Cute little toddlers, two French, two tourists, I think one British, one Dutch. These are kids. I have a son who's the age of these kids right now. So especially rings of cord here, which is these are sweet, little innocent kids, two-year-old kids. And then this migrant goes over and just starts stabbing them. And I think all of them were in critical condition. I don't know how it's shaken out. I haven't seen an update yet. Absolutely horrific, horrific crime. The story here is not even the horrific attack, which had become all too common. That's why they're not exactly newsworthy anymore. Ever since mass migration took over Europe, you're seeing a lot of this in countries that previously had relatively low crime, even the Scandinavian countries. Now, the story here is how this is being reported across the pond. This is what Sky News had to say about it. It seems to me that the French police, not the anti-terrorist investigators, have taken charge of the case. And this tells me that this is not a terrorist-driven case. It's mainly of a criminal case. My fear is that regardless of what the investigation shows, the fact that the suspect is a Syrian refugee and on our asylum seeker will likely be used a great deal by the far right in front, given how the cultural wars and the question of refugees. The first thing I would say, the most important thing is that really our hearts are with the victims and their families, given the fact that they are children, three years old. And finally, even though we don't have information, my first instinct tells me that this is really a mentally disturbed individual, as opposed to being part of a terrorist organization like Al-Qaeda or the so-called Islamic State. He says, my first reaction is to say how terrible this is for the little children. That wasn't his first reaction. You heard his first reaction. He said, my first reaction is that this is going to be seized upon by the far right to advance their anti-immigrant, anti-refugee campaign. That's the real tragedy here. Oh yeah, the first thing that strikes me about this crime is how the Republicans are going to pounce. That's how we talk about it in America, the way they talk about it in Europe. They say, the far right is going to seize upon this to advance their anti-immigrant agenda. Secondly, it's really sad that these little toddlers were stabbed by the refugee who had no business being in France, who received asylum up north and then comes down to France because, I don't know, I guess he likes the weather in France a little bit better. Then I told, no, you got to go to the first country that you received asylum in. And then what's the next thing he says? And by the way, I just want to know, this has nothing to do with ideology. This has nothing to do with his belief system. It's purely mental health. Maybe it is. I don't know. I have no idea what motivated this guy. But you just, you see this instinct. Anything that goes wrong always has to be the fault of the far right. The far right always has to be to blame. Far right, by the way, means anybody to the right of Barack Obama. It has to be their fault. It's either their fault for committing the crime, which is unusual, or it's their fault for seizing upon the crime to advance their terribly unjust agenda. That's the first thing. Second thing is ideologies that the left embraces can never be at fault. If a leftist commits a crime and his ideology is a part of that crime, plays a role in it, then it's just a mental health problem. You saw this in the transgender shooting in Nashville. You saw this in the leftist shooting of the congressional baseball game. You see this every single time. Then the third thing you see is the incidents are never about themselves, as far as the left is concerned. It's only about how they can achieve political advantage. You especially see that now with the classified documents issue, the lives have been mishandling classified documents forever with no right to do so whatsoever. But then the moment that a Republican that they don't like who seems popular, who seems like a threat to the system, not just a threat to the Democrats instead of the Republicans, but to the whole liberal system. When that guy crops up, all of a sudden they go after him, they throw the book at him, even when he had every right to have those documents. The battle we're seeing here is not just the left versus the right or the Republicans versus the Democrats or the conservatives versus the liberals or whatever. It's a broader coalition of the people who recognize that something's rotten about this system that has overtaken the West and the elites who run that system. We got to talk about it.

You want to talk about the uni party? You want to talk about the people versus the elites? Forget about Trump for a second. Who's the most populist major candidate on the right that we have seen in a very, very long time. And that's why the Libs hate him so much. That's why they hate him more than his rivals. But you see it on the left too. Cornell West is a socialist professor. He was at Harvard for a while. Then he was at Princeton. And he's really leftist. I mean, he's really out there. He would produce a rap album. He campaigned for Bernie Sanders. He is a radical. He's a radical leftist. He's announced that he's running for president on the People's Party platform. MSNBC is furious about it. It's not Fox News. It's furious about it. Well, Fox News now, you know, not the most right-wing network. It's not the Daily Wire that's furious about Cornell West running. I welcome it. I think it's probably going to be a pretty funny campaign. I think it'll be entertaining. He'll probably raise some ideas that are at least more insightful, perspicacious than what Joe Biden is talking about. No, it's the liberals that are upset that Cornell West is running. There's a piece here on the Joy Read blog of MSNBC. Cornell West's leftist presidential bid has right-wing DNA. The people framing newly announced presidential candidate Cornell West as a leftist seem to be lazily sanitizing his recent history and voters deserve better. Cornell West is an actual Marxist. You can't. How are you going to say this guy is a right-winger? This guy advocates abortion. He has an extreme view about abortion. He embraces socialist economic policies. He's attacking Joe Biden and the liberals from the left. And the liberals don't like that. So, the liberals are trying to characterize him as a right-winger, but he's not a right-wing. What does this doesn't make any sense? What is this campaign platform? Here it is. Democracy creates disruption. It creates an eruption. It creates an interruption. Wide from below, the energies of everyday people is manifest. And I know there are precious people in your life who you care for. That's why it's important for you to be involved, important for you to participate. I'm not talking about hating anybody. We're talking about loving it. We're talking about affirming. We're talking about empowering those who have been pushed to the margins because neither political party wants to tell the truth about Wall Street, about Ukraine, about the Pentagon, about big tech. Oh, that's why they hate him. They don't hate him because he's a right-winger. He's very much not a right-winger. But he's anti-establishment. He's anti-liberal. This is hard for some conservatives to make sense of because for decades now, we've failed to distinguish between liberals and communists. And also for many decades now, we've defended liberalism. Some conservatives have said, oh, I'm a classical liberal. I identify as a liberal. The liberals are the true conservatives or whatever, which is not true. And so we've blurred the lines. In part, because it's funny. It's funny when we call Joe Biden a communist or something, in part because the liberals and the communists have a fair bit in common with one another. But they're distinct groups. And it's worth pointing out that the Marxists and the conservatives also have some things in common with one another as opposed to liberalism. Politics is a little bit more complicated than just left versus right exactly. A friend of mine who's a Marxist, a very intelligent, educated guy, he thinks that Karl Marx would have been in the Tea Party. If Karl Marx lived in 2011, he would have been a member of the Tea Party. This is why Cornell West, who is extremely left-wing, is a big promoter of democracy. The liberals hate democracy. The liberals are always trying to undermine democracy. Whenever the people vote for something they don't like, they try to suppress the will of the people. That's very pro-liberal, but very anti-democratic. Cornell West just wrote a column in the Wall Street Journal with a conservative defending the classics, defending DeSantis for defending the classics. Cornell West has read all of the classic works in the West. He's come to very leftist conclusions as a result of that. But he embraces the classics, the classical tradition. Unlike the liberals who are trying to suppress that, get the classics out of school and replace it with a bunch of modern nonsense and gay porn in the case of a lot of these school libraries. So the liberals hate him too. There's a good book out, or it's about to come out. I just did a review of it in the American conservative. It's by Patrick Dineen who wrote Why Liberalism Failed, and the new book is called Regime Change. He has a really helpful little chart in it, where he points out four quadrants of politics. On one axis, you have favors the people, doesn't favor the people. And on the other axis, you have views the people as revolutionary and views the people as conservative. And so you've got four versions of politics here. Classical liberalism, libertarianism say, progressive liberalism, conservatism, and Marxism. And each goes in a different quadrant. The classical liberals don't favor the people. They favor revolt. They favor rule by an elite. Same goes for the progressive liberals. They don't really favor the people. They favor rule by the elite. But one of them thinks the people are revolutionary. The other thinks that the people are a conservatism force. The Marxists do favor, at least in theory, favor rule by the people. That's why you always hear power to the people. And we need a people's revolution. Workers of the world unite. They, at least in theory, favor rule by the people. They think the people are revolutionary. They're going to be the leaders of the revolution. Conservatives also favor rule by the people. They think the people are generally right. But they think the people are not revolutionary. The people are a conservatism force. That's why you see Edmund Burke, Benjamin Disraeli, many American conservatives, who say, like C. J. Tocqueville, say that the people have this common sense. They've got this wisdom that slows down the crazy schemes of the ruling class. Conservatives in Marxists have a fair bit in common. And the liberal establishment, the liberal ruling class, is going to go after those left-wingers. That's why they went after Bernie so hard. That's why they're going after Cornell West now, even in MSNBC. And that's why they go after Trump. Because Trump is not a classical liberal exactly. He's not a member of the ruling class. He's a populist. He does favor the people. He favors shaking things up and giving the people a greater say. That's why they're going after him so hard. Donald Trump doesn't fit neatly into the Republican box or the conservative movement box. That's what makes him so dangerous to them. Politics makes strange bedfellows. Think about how the conservatives tend now to agree with the radical feminists on pornography. Radical feminists were very anti-porn. The kind of liberal squishy feminists were pro-porn, sex positive. But the radical feminists were very anti-porn. They said it's misogynistic and exploitative. Conservatives agree with them. The classical liberals agree with the squishy feminist liberals. They say, all porn is good. Don't worry about porn. People have the right to porn or whatever. So that makes strange bedfellows. The thing about it on transgenderism, though it's the radical feminists who are probably most vociferously anti-trans. So the conservatives now make common cause with someone like J.K. Rowling, who's very to the left. Because we agree with each other on this topic. We disagree with the liberal establishment. And on that topic, we just got a really disturbing bit of info about Ellen Page. She's the actress who now goes by Elliot, who says that she was, I don't know, she was accosted in MAGA country holding her subway sandwich a year ago. She told a difficult to believe tale of transphobic, homophobic attacks in West Hollywood, which is the gayest neighborhood in America. And a lot of people didn't believe it. But where did she come up with what appears to be a fable? She's a troubled lady. She's got some trouble. In fact, she explains in an interview with the LA Times about how she tried to kill herself. So one night, well, LA Times writes he, I'll change it to she, because Ellen Page is a woman. One night, she tried to knock herself out, took her knuckles to her face and pounded over and over until Bruce is formed. For days after, she sat in a lawn chair on the porch, ashamed her face sore. And then she heard a voice, you don't have to feel this way. It was a small voice, barely discernible, but it kept echoing in her head a way out. If it, it was as if something in my brain turned around, recalls Page, now 36, the agonizing voice saying, no, you're not. No, you can't just switch and you can't just switched and became very gentle and loving. Oh, maybe I'm trans. Why don't I explore that? Within weeks, she'd scheduled a zoom consultation with a doctor to discuss top surgery, meaning lapping her breasts off. The procedure was scheduled for November. Months later, she announced her fans on Instagram who have known her since the release of June. Oh, 13 years prior that her name was now Elliot. What do you call it? When you're in the midst of a breakdown where you're harming yourself, where you're behaving very irrationally, and then you hear a voice in your head telling you that reality is different than it is and that voice in your head that leads you to even more destructive and harmful behaviors. We, in our modern culture, we just call that, we either call that mental illness or in this case, with the liberal culture calls, it is your intuition. You're true. The vibes of the universe telling you the truth, man. In traditional culture, in Christian culture, there's another word for that. And if you want to hear a description of that, you can listen to my interview with the exorcist, Father Dan Rehill, which is on my YouTube channel and has over 3 million views now.

My favorite comment yesterday is from the superbly fantastical channel who says, Canadian here, a large portion of the current wildfires have been intentionally set. Arson charges have already been laid in some cases. I'd seen some reports of this that not infrequently is the case and what's ironic is in some cases the people who commit this environmental destruction are environmentalists themselves. I'm not saying that's what happened here in Canada though. I'm not saying that's not what happened either. We don't know we'll see how that plays out in the courts but very often that is the case and it's like the black people who hang nooses from trees and say that they were set burning crosses and say they're the victims of an anti-black hate crime. Why do they do that? Why does Jesse Smollett walk around downtown Chicago and say he was attacked by white supremacists who happened to be Nigerian we later found out? They do it one because they're a little off two to get attention and three because they think that will accelerate social change to bring about the political changes that they want. They think that people aren't taking climate change seriously enough well maybe if I burn down forests then they'll start to take it seriously. People aren't taking racism seriously enough okay well maybe if I pretend that I was almost lynched in Chicago maybe then they'll take it seriously enough so they'll lie they'll harm themselves they'll harm the cause that they allegedly care about but it's for a greater good it's to accelerate that kind of change and it's pretty pretty bizarre. Now speaking of Christianity as we just were, Pat Robertson just died. Pat Robertson was the host of the 700 Club he was quite aged 93 years old and he just kept broadcasting so he you know he'd just still be in that chair he was still very sharp until the end. I really like Pat Robertson and I like him for a number of reasons. He and I had you know probably would have some theological differences let's say but he was basically on the right side of things he was basically fighting for all the right stuff he basically had all the right enemies and Pat Robertson was a confounding figure in modern politics in that he helped me to see how corrupt our media and establishment are because this guy was portrayed as a complete loony-tuned idiot by our mainstream establishment media. He was anything but this is a very very serious man. A lot of people don't know this he had a law degree from Yale the top law school in the country. He worked on Wall Street he was by the by the standards of the modern world he was extraordinarily successful pretty much as successful as one can be and then he had a conversion experience gave up his wicked ways and he became a televangelist became a presidential candidate. When you look at his interviews as a presidential candidate back in 1988 he's a very sober serious person giving really detailed answers on domestic policy foreign policy very serious guy and he never shied away from his faith and he never shied away from blunt language. Pat Robertson in a fundraising letter in 1992 formulated one of my absolute all-time favorite quotes in American politics and I'm going to read read it I've memorized most of them I'm going to read it to get a word perfect. I cannot improve on what Pat Robertson said he said quote the feminist agenda is not about equal rights for women it is about a socialist anti-family political movement that encourages women to leave their husbands kill their children practice witchcraft destroy capitalism and become lesbians. A little harsh and yet and yet show me the lie show me the lie I don't see the lie anywhere speaking of weird sex stuff the CIA has come out of the closet. CIA usually hides in closets and underbeds and does all sort of secret spy stuff well they've come out of the closet. CIA is pro pride they tweet out. CIA's 2023 theme for pride month is well come wellness equity LGBTQ positive community openness me pride month is an occasion for all of us at the agency to pay tribute to the rich history community and mission mission contributions of our LGBTQ positive officers hashtag right what's funny is CIA for most of its history would regularly try to ferret out homosexuals because they knew that they were a security risk because they could be blackmailed but I guess now one of the the silver lining in the storm cloud of all this sexual revolution stuff is that it's hard to blackmail people because it's all out in the open. If a guy like Sam Brinton works for the federal government the former nuclear waste czar if he works for the federal government in the past and someone had a picture of him wearing leather costumes leading a guy around on a leash dressed up like a dog wearing women's clothing lipstick whatever they could have turned that guy if the Soviets got that picture they would have flipped him he would have he would have been a double agent oh they would have gotten him right but now Sam Brinton is publishing the photos himself so there's no blackmail it's really bizarre and degenerate but but that would be I guess the silver lining so the CIA they're all for it. The other thing in in defense of the CIA here is that pride is obviously a massive scyop it's a massive scyop intended to weaken our country that was regularly promoted by our enemies who encouraged all this kind of sexual deviancy the Soviet Union had many memoranda written about this about how they were going to try to infiltrate the United States and promote this sexual deviancy because it would weaken the nation. You hear former KGB officers talking about this openly and so because pride is a massive scyop and because the job of the CIA is to run scyops I guess there is a little bit of a king-ru and see there you'd hope that the CIA doesn't run scyops against America that would be your hope I guess but anyway there it is CIA went gay or like CIA gay am I right am I right speaking of the weird sex stuff too there's a really telling interview from an only fans girl whose name eludes me escapes me at the moment but she was speaking to Piers Morgan on one of his TV shows and what separates this only fans girl from other only fans girls is that she has a lot of academic credentials she has a professional credential she could have made good amount of money as a lawyer instead she chose to strip on camera here's why I'm just curious about you being someone who embarked on a law career was obviously very bright went to university packed it in just for money to be effectively an online stripper I mean that's what you do right yeah way worse than an online stripper but what do you mean way worse way worse online strippers just you know naked I do things that are way more grotesque than that pornography pornography anything but it's all within what I want to do and I absolutely love it and I'm really good at it you know I could be a good lawyer yes but also am I good at doing other things on video and camera how do you feel when you want to have kids yourself well I mean that's I don't really want kids right now but you will to help you 25 right so you will do some things probably right maybe when you do you're gonna be proud that you have your little ones and they look at you and go didn't you want to be a lawyer mommy what happened yeah go here but look at all my stuff they can cry in a Ferrari they can cry in a Ferrari that's a good line but think about what that line means it means this woman is willing to compromise her children's well-being for money because they will they will cry and I guess maybe they'll cry in a Ferrari I doubt she's making Ferrari money they'll probably cry in like a mid-grade Lexus but she's saying one I'm willing to compromise my kids well-being for money and two she's saying money is more important than a more metaphysical sense of well-being money is more important than integrity maybe not at every level but enough money at the high levels when you're talking about Ferrari money that is more important it's like that that old joke about a guy walks up to to a girl at a bar and says hey would you sleep with me for a hundred bucks she says absolutely not would you sleep with me for a million dollars I got a million dollars to pay right now to sleep with me she goes oh well yeah maybe he goes okay I've had 200 bucks she says what what are you talking about he goes well now I know what you are now we're just haggling about the price but that there's a difference not in a degree here but a difference in kind or you the sort of person who would who would sell your integrity for money or are you not the I'm not really knocking this girl the temptations here are extraordinarily high and I'm sure that if you're very very good at only fans you can make a lot of money the vast majority of girls make essentially no money on this and then sell out their their image and their integrity and their future marriages and and relationship with their children for for nothing they actually like a lot of Faustian bargains they actually will get you know they won't even get the material benefit from it but I see how some people could be really tempted to do this stuff in our modern culture especially a modern culture that ignores the moral order but it's really not a complicated question there are some things that you should not be willing to do for any price in part in no small part because money isn't all that beyond a certain point money doesn't really make you any happier until you can afford private air travel and then it does make you happier in certain circumstances but other than that it doesn't really make you happier the material things of this world will pass away possession will not make you happier in fact it will probably just arise your desires to to get more material things all the money in the world is not worth a sense of spiritual peace it not not even close it's just it this is not soft so you know proselytizing it's just a fact because metaphysical things are more enduring your treasure in heaven is going to last a lot longer than a Ferrari which is going to rust and break down quicker than you think this weekend the greatest interview show on the internet is back talking about yes or no we got a new episode featuring my pal Charlie Kirk Charlie is of course the very sharp

finally finally we've arrived at my favorite time of the week when i get to hear from you in the mailbag the mailbag is sponsored by pure talk on pure talk dot com slash noals to say 50% off your first month take it away hi michael when the right says that we love america and the left does not i think this needs to be re-evaluated when the left says they love america what they really mean is they love what america could be if their values were put in place but when the right says they love america it seems to amount to basically saying that they loved it when america defeated the nazis for example but i'm looking around as a conservative in 2023 and i can't find anything to love about our nation broadly we kill babies we deny god we trans the kids we open our borders to thieves and criminals and rapists and drug dealers and we look the other way when it affects our neighbors our nation seems evil from shore to shore why would i love america am i wrong in thinking this way or should conservatives think long and hard about what patriotism is i think so i appreciate your response great question i had a wonderful mother absolutely wonderful mother just lover to death so it's easy to love my mother i have a wonderful father very easy to love my father some people don't though some people have deadbeat dads some people have drug addicted neglectful mothers vicious parents some people have bad parents okay and yet all people are called upon to show some respect for their parents and one hopes to love one's parents this is filial piety which is a good thing in itself in the right proper order we are called to respect and even to love our parents if they're worthy of respect and lovable all the better but but we we have that obligation when people just openly constantly resent their parents and diss them all the time and and whine and complain and blame them for everything that's when they become big libs right we say i hate you dad that's what all liberalism basically boils down to patriotism is an extension of filial piety we owe our nation our support and respect because it is our nation and sometimes our nation resembles my loving wonderful great parents and sometimes our nation resembles the heroin addict neglectful degenerate people but we owe them a little bit of reverence and at the very least and love and we owe it to them and to ourselves to help them to improve and to to live a good and more flourishing life in no small part because we're part of it we're in that family it's our community you can't really leave that your family is your family your country is your country and so we owe it to our country but we owe it to ourselves also to love it you can't really improve anybody if you hate that person it's not going to work next question michael big fan and fellow catholic here i wanted to ask about at one of your relatively recent speaking events probably a couple of months ago you briefly touched on the topic of limbo during the q and a section when somebody asked about whether or not on baptized babies go to heaven i was wondering if you could expound on that and what the catholic church has historically taught about limbo and what the catholic church currently teaches about limbo and i had a second question which was uh how does it feel to share a nickname with the former first lady of the united states thanks big mic really good questions i guess i'll take the first one first uh yes someone asked me some wise guy decided what during while i was giving a speech about abortion he said hey do babies go to heaven do a pre-born babies go to heaven and he expected me to just say yes but i started to give the traditional christian answer on it which is well there's actually this concept called limbo and then he cut me off because he realized he wasn't getting the gacha answer he wanted to go well if they go to heaven we should kill them all right isn't that good and it's like well that's not the answer that was the problem so what what is limbo a lot of people are confused about this including catholics who don't even know what the church teaches anymore um limbo is there are two kinds of limbo traditionally understood there is the limbo of the just and the limbo of the just is also referred to in the bible is the bosom of abraham it's the place that souls go after death before the opening up of the of the kingdom of heaven before the the christ fiction and the resurrection and the redemption of mankind uh so it's it's a kind of a hell but it's not like the hell with the pitchforks where you're being just brutally tortured for all of eternity it's nice enough maybe you would compare it to the greek understanding of the elision fields it's it's kind of nice may a little less nice than that but you know it's okay and then christ goes down and harrow's hell and uh you see this in the writing of st peter you see this in in right of st paul you see this you see also the necessity for limbo in the gospels which is uh christ goes in and brings the just souls who died before the uh crucifixion the resurrection and brings them up to heaven to see the face of god christ says that to have eternal life uh to you know be with him in heaven to uh see the very face of god right uh you need baptism you need to be born with water and of blood reborn and this baptism washes away original sin so what happens if you die before you've been baptized and especially in the case of like little un baptized babies the traditional teaching of the church is a little complicated in that st and gustin took a view there was a little bit harsher which is that they go to hell essentially but it's not the worst kind of hell it's not you know they're not at the very pit being in the most kind of physical and spiritual torture but but it's still hell uh st thomas aquinas took a little more lenient view which is that the the limbo of the infants the place that the infants go after after death is a place of perfect natural happiness but not supernatural happiness that in order to have the supernatural happiness of the vision of god himself the bayatific vision that that one uh must be baptized that one must be redeemed and have his soul sealed in christ but but for babies who are not guilty of any sin other than the fallenness of human nature which we call original sin uh they they are still able to achieve perfect natural happiness so it's not like they're whining and complaining well baby's always whining to complain but it's not it's not that they're despairing in the sense of longing for this supernatural happiness that is unattainable for them they've got the perfect amount of happiness that one is capable of naturally but they lack the supernatural happiness that those who have been reborn into christ uh can achieve there's a lot more to say about limbo i mean we could go on for hours and hours about what church fathers and doctors at the church have said about limbo but that's the the basic idea and it is necessary in order to make sense of of church teaching which we get from our lord himself in the gospels which is that tantra haven you got to be baptized and to to be to be reborn in christ and so in order to to make sense of that uh limbo is is a place that what what one we actually do see it in the scriptures but two we can we can also deduce it for a reason as as great thinkers and theologians have done threat history okay next one hey michael this is a really quick message uh let's say hypothetically i killed someone because this this didn't happen this didn't happen let's say i killed someone and they it just imagine they because you know do you need to imagine they are laying in front of me i'm in the kitchen and uh and some people are just knocking at my door so what can i do what can i do to to get rid of the body and don't and not get caught that's that's my question it would be great if you if you could answer that before before tomorrow but uh anyway yeah yeah so hypothetically i guess if someone we're knocking at the door in this case what you should do if you want to avoid jail time if you don't care about the morality of it you just open the door you tell them you are a democrat you tell them you're a democrat tell them you're happy to help joe biden's reelection you're able to do that and then you'll you'll get off without a hitch and probably those coppers will help you help you get rid of the body themselves next question hey dirty mike mr reality here i wondered if uh you thought trans people who undergo surgery and claim they're happy with being trans are experiencing a sort of stock home syndrome um not unlike someone who's been kidnapped uh obviously there's some trans people who detransition and then there's others who insist that they're the happiest they've ever been after they've removed various body parts and it just doesn't seem like that would be something someone happy would do but do you think they're all lying about being happy or do you think some of them have a sort of stock home syndrome almost thanks yeah probably the latter i don't know that i'd call it exactly stock home syndrome but yeah people who engage in destructive behaviors will very often find ways to justify those behaviors to themselves even if they are conscious at some level of the ways in which it is harming and destroying them this is because it's easier for people to change their mind than to change their behavior and especially in fairness to these people if they've turned themselves into unix if they've sterilized themselves if they're going themselves osteoporosis if they've if they've completely or almost completely destroyed their bodies it's very hard to grapple with that fact it's very hard to accept that and so it's much much easier to say no this is actually good boy i'm so happy aren't i happy and sort of rich your teeth and bear ultimately that that won't be good for them the only way out is through the only way out is to say gosh i made a big mistake everyone makes big mistakes at some point and say i made a big mistake there's no totally fixing this but in an ultimate ultimate sense meaning to pursue the good to pursue the true to live my life in accordance with reality one can do that but the first step is admitting that you have a problem which a lot of people won't do it's true of all sorts of vice before we go really quick of britany would you marry tim britany is the a girlfriend of uh tim who is a member of the cr\u00e8me de la cr\u00e8me a daily viewer of the show along with his i hope soon to be fiance britany and uh so yeah this is uh for tim blanchefield he wrote in and asked hey michael
