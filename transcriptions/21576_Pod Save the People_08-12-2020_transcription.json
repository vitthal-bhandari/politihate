    "text": " Hey, this is Dorei and welcome to Pause Here The People. This week we have the crew DR Sam Kaya, covering the news that you don't know from the past week. Netta is here to give us an update on what's happening across the country with regards to the protests and then I sit down and talk to Ejoma Olu to talk about her latest book. Now my advice for this week is a little different. It is check out our latest campaign which is a campaign to ban no knock raids all across the country. The other way is to get around a straight up ban on no knock warrants and this is why we are focused on how to ban no knock raids. Go to indallnoknox.org. Endallnoknox.org. See if your city or state is one of the cities and states is actually working on this issue. There are 37 cities and states working on it right now. We're working with them. Virginia just passed a bill that we helped get across the finish line. Again endallnoknox.org. Let's go. Hello, hello everyone. Welcome to another episode of Pause Save The People. We're back. I'm DR Ballinger. You can find me on the Instagram and the Twitter at DR Ballinger. And I'm Sam Saniongoya. Sam's way on Twitter. I'm Kaya Henderson at Henderson Kaya on Twitter. This is Dre at DIY on Twitter. So, you know, a new administration is coming in. I think one of the things that's obviously top of mind to many of us, particularly those of us that are going back into shutdowns and quarantine, is COVID-19 in this vaccine and where we are with the vaccine, how quickly the vaccine can be developed safely, how quickly it can be distributed, what that means for folks of color in particular. I have been having some conversations with family members because, you know, that's where I like to start, you know, with my aunties and uncles just to get a sense of what's happening. My auntie Jay told me that she won't even take a COVID test because of the Tuskegee trials, which I was like, okay. Hey, hey, hey, hey. Okay. Hey, hey, hey. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, that thing is real. In fact, in fact, Mayor Bowser, as she was talking about how the vaccine is going to roll out in D.C., she acknowledged that black people have a genuine distrust of the medical establishment because of things like the Tuskegee experiment. That means real. Don't sleep on the aunties at all. What a test. What a test. The test, Kyle. So then I had to say auntie, I've had several tests and it's fine. And they're asking for, you're asking for a particular level of nuance. Listen, from gynecology being built on the exploitation of African American women to the Tuskegee experiment, our people have a right to be skeptical of the medical establishment. No, they do. They do. They do. I'm just saying. Yes. But I think part of it is going to be in that nuance, right? And like where we are in terms of the safety of this vaccine, what we know about how it's been tested and what those results are and even whether or not black and brown folks are even involved in the clinical trials, I hear that they are in quotes. So part of this is, yes, Kyle, all that history is true, but I got to get out this house. So we got to get it together. That's real. That's real. That's real. I got to get back to Europe. I needs to go to West Africa. I got to get out of here. Now somebody's places I can't go to, but they don't want you. They don't. So I don't know if the Biden administration is even thinking about the type of public information and awareness campaigns that are going to have to happen. That is marketing like no other. I mean, it's bigger than everything. It's critical. And I also was having a conversation with somebody that's like in the land of Fauci and they were saying that if the timing works out, the vaccine comes out, everybody takes it, then we'll all be fine in November, November of next year. Who knows? Yes. If not next winter, we're going to be done with this. I mean, we already in December and people still not wearing masks. Like, come on. That's the easy thing. Like getting a vaccine. Like, vaccines, like it's a little bit more difficult, right? Like you have to actually go to a health care provider. Twice. Maybe it costs money. Maybe it doesn't. Like there's a process, but like a mask, like you can find that at any gas station. Now, like any like CVS and like people still are going around like no mask, like coffins, sneezing in public, like it is wild. So I am not, I'm not optimistic. Can I tell you all this little mask story? So one of my girlfriends was buying her niece a subscription to Scholastic, you know, the like children's magazine. And she was looking at the reviews. And one reviewer said, I just had to cancel my subscription for my three children. Our magazines came into mail today. I opened one and many of the pages had children and adults with masks covering their faces. I don't mask my kids and I didn't want them seeing that. So she canceled her subscription to Scholastic. Y'all, we are in a place. We're in a lot of trouble. It is also like you want you know, I've seen a couple stories now where like the anti mask pastors have died from COVID. You're like, we tried to tell you I wasn't making it up. The most effective messaging around the vaccine that I've seen is reminding people that they also they already get vaccinated, right? You already got the measles, mumps and rubella vaccine. But we have controversy about that. Yeah, but I'm saying like some people won't even take that stuff. The chickenpox vaccine. Come on. Yeah, work with me. I'm just trying to tell you what I thought. Work with me because I'm also trying to get out the house too. We go ahead to tell these people something that like and I say this is somebody who had COVID is I am worried that like you're right. People aren't even wearing masks right now. You're like, we need the vaccine so that like the world, you know, I'm nervous too. I've heard people I've heard inklings that like business companies will say if you don't take the vaccine, you can't come back to work. You will need to take it to work for us. And I think that will be fascinating. I also saw that there's a study that suggests that COVID might lead to long term erectile dysfunction in men and that that might actually be a motivator for men to to get the vaccine. So that's not a complication. Also there's conversations about companies. If this lasts for long, readjusting people's salaries to take into account the fact that they are not coming to work that like they can pay them less because the associated costs might be different. And I was like, what that is? That's sort of interesting. So this idea that like you might pay people regionally based on where they live, not based on where like the office is because people can move or whatever, that it might lead to some real change. And you know, I think people want to go back to or we at least want to go back outside. Back to normal is, you know, I don't even know what that means these days, but we definitely want to go back outside. I also think for folks who are traveling, the fact that different countries have different standards around what it takes to approve a vaccine. So the vaccine is moving forward in the UK with a far different level of vetting than what we have in the United States. And so at what point do we say it's okay for British folks to come here when they are standard of approving the vaccine is very different from ours. I think there are just so many big questions that are opened as we get closer and closer to having a potential solution and even having a potential solution just creates a whole lot more problems. Yeah, I was thinking about that one too in the UK as well. But something about how capitalistic and money-grubbing American culture is like for some reason I would trust a pharmaceutical company in Europe more than I or anywhere more than I would not anywhere more than I would hear. I think it's something about, you know, like even the race to the finish line right now, I think it's like three different pharmaceutical companies that are like racing to get it done and one, you know, has to be at a certain temperature and blah, blah, blah. I just I still feel like I would rather take the UK's vaccine than ours. Just like I rather have I rather drink milk in the UK than milk in the United States. I'm waiting for South Korea. I'm waiting for South Korea and Vietnam. You know, like there's a set of countries that have actually like solved this problem like already like they living like lives like normal in Vietnam and like South Korea they've gotten this under control Australia. They've gotten this under control. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, because y'all Sam's been mysterious in different places for a while. Sam, are you in Vietnam? Is that why I wish they won't let you know where you are? You know, I wish you know they won't the thing is the countries that have gotten it under control definitely don't allow us in like you can't get in there and that's why they've gotten it under control. Smart. Because because we don't wear man. We don't follow rules. You know, that's the royal we because I wear my mask. Just say it. Yeah, I just don't understand the the no mask thing. It just is wild. I got like a I think it was a glitch but Lyft gave me one of those like wasn't wearing your masks notifications. It popped up on my lift. I was like, I did have my mask going. What are you doing? Sir, try to get me kicked off lift. So lift fiction. I googled it and other people were like because I got it like an hour and a half after I was even in a like I want to go get another ride and then I'm like, why got to help the other era and you can't go back and see it. So I was like, here is I'm like, let me call Lyft. Ain't no number lift. I'm checking for y'all. All right, y'all. My news is from Reuters. It's kind of a simple one, but I just it spoke to me for some reason. So I wanted to share with y'all. Greg Meakes, who's a congressman out of New York is going to be the chairman of the house foreign affairs committee. He's the first black man, black person to ever be kind of a I'll say elected because he's elected by the other Democrats elected to be in this position. And so I just found it very, very interesting that between him and also Linda Thomas Greenfield, who will be our ambassador to United Nations that this is looking to be like a pretty like a good team, y'all like a good squad to really help us on the foreign policy side. So Chairman Meakes says that he's excited about this role, that he's looking for a new way of doing business. And this is sad. This is where we are in terms of foreign policy, but he says he looks forward to the United States rejoining the Iran nuclear pact in the World Health Organization. So and also he, you know, seeking to regain Congress's traditional control over the right to declare war. So he is stepping into this role. It was previously held by Elliot Engel, who lost to Jamal Bowman, who is going to be in Congress in that space, which is another fantastic win for Congress. Engel was a lot different from what Meakes will be respectively. He was a strong advocate for Israel. He was seen as too hawkish by some members of the Democratic Party's left wing. He voted for the Iraq War in 2003 and he opposed President Obama's 2015 nuclear deal with Iran. So the other interesting thing about this article is that it tells us that Joaquin Castro had actually campaigned against Meakes for this chairman role. So he ended up losing by 148 to 78 votes. Joaquin Castro is respectively also more progressive, but again, I think he's still going to be on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is strong and he's going to work with Meakes on promoting diversity at the State Department and also rejoining the Iran nuclear deal. So I don't know. I just was excited by this. I'm always excited about the foreign policy appointments. I had the pleasure of working at the State Department under President Obama and just saw how important, how we show up in the world is to what actually happens here as well. So I'm excited about this one and to see what's to come of foreign policy writ large and how it impacts people of color all over the world. So I'll say, you know, D.R., I would, can you help us understand why this matters? Like what, you know, I didn't even know this was like one of the positions that we should care about. So this was a learning for me. What I will say is that it is cool to see black people being in leadership roles in the administration. So not just the support roles, not just to like, you know, the deputy assistant to the assistance commissioners cousin or something like that, but being like the chair of a body around foreign policy because we often don't see black faces as leading on front policy. Susan Rice is like the only person in Condoleeza are the only two people that I know or Colin Powell. I guess those three. Yeah. Colin Powell, Susan Rice, Condoleeza are the only three people black faces that I've ever seen talk about foreign affairs like on TV or like as put out as experts in the government. So that was powerful. But what, why does this position matter? So this one matters because this is this he will be involved of like foreign policy decisions and like a real decision making role. So it's him. It'll be the national security advisor who's Jake Sullivan. It'll be, you know, Linda Thomas Greenfield. It'll be the secretary of state now. So it really will have a lot of influence on what Congress ultimately supports the United States government doing. And so even the piece in here about getting Congress's right back to go to war for a long time and we've seen in the last couple of presidencies last few presidencies rather that the president really has determined and really pushed the agenda of going to war and has done so not without regard to Congress, but definitely, you know, it should be, you know, Congress should have a larger role in terms of who we're going to war with and what boots on the ground actually means and how it's defined. So I just thought this one was really exciting. And I think the other thing is, you know, I've had the honor and pleasure of going to places and like representing United States government as, you know, a black, Latinx queer woman. And the looks on people's faces when you are of color and you say you represent the United States government is really, really powerful. So I think to see him in this role is really incredible. And something the other thing people don't know about Congress is Congress always takes these trips to different countries, right? They're actively always taking these congressional delegation trips. Well, they'll have conversations on different aspects of economic policy, foreign policy. So Congress is a lot more involved in the foreign policy decision making of this country than you think. But yeah, but that's essentially why it's important. So my news is about New Orleans where just this past Saturday, an election has been held and a district attorney has been elected. Jason Williams, who is the current city council president in New Orleans, was just elected to the DA's office. And this is major because he ran on a platform of reform, a platform that involved a number of changes, some of which we've talked about in the past on the pod. Because after the ballot initiative passed in Louisiana, which abolished the practice of allowing people to be convicted based on a non unanimous jury, now there are a whole host of cases of people who were sentenced convicted based on these non unanimous juries who are now petitioning and want to have their cases re-heard. And Jason Williams has promised that he will offer them a second chance, re-hear those cases under the new rules, which require unanimous conviction. And as well as that, he has promised to divert or decline more cases from prosecution, to cease using the state's habitual offender law, which raises sentences on people. And he has said he's never going to prosecute youth as adults. So this is a set of policies that I'm hopeful will be implemented in New Orleans and is not the first place that has elected prosecutors who've run on a platform of reform. So just over the past several years, we've seen sort of reformer prosecutors elected in Cook County in Chicago with Kim Fox, in Durham, in Orlando, Florida, in Philadelphia, Los Angeles, Boston, San Francisco, San Antonio, Detroit, St. Louis, and a host of other cities across the country. So this really is a part of a broader wave or movement of just a change of thinking about who are prosecutors, what are they supposed to be doing in that role, and what obligations do they have to actually reduce and ultimately end the system of mass incarceration? I thought this was interesting and important for many reasons, but two that really stood out to me. One is he's the first DA without prior experience as a prosecutor in at least 50 years. And I think we oftentimes think, well, if you've done the job, then you know how to do it. But if the job is broken and is not meeting our expectations, and I think having somebody who's not burdened by the constraints of the job who hasn't done it the way everybody else has done it actually produces our best chance for reform. So I'm excited about that. And then, you know, I followed a little bit of his campaign in New Orleans. And the thing that stood out to me most was, you know, he is talking about treating people with dignity and respect and humanity, no matter, you know, whether they're innocent or guilty. And I think that recognition of the fact that we're all humans and we don't get to just treat each other like animals is an important sentiment that if we brought to our criminal justice system, we'd be in a different place. And then, you know, when I look at the fact that his opponent was completely and totally supported by the establishment. And you know, he was the underdog and they took it to the streets. They hired a bunch of community organizers, right? Like, if we don't take anything away from this election cycle, we need to understand the role of community organizers in literally turning this whole thing upside down. He beat his opponent by 16 points. And it was because the community organizers talked to the streets and the streets talked back. And this man is now the new, you know, the new DA. And so I think it says a lot about the fact that our citizens are actually, they have real opinions and ideas about what needs to happen. And they will vote their values if we engage with them and if we present them with candidates who reflect those values. My news this week I chose because it is positive. It's from the New York Times. It's some ideas for fixing America. And they asked a bunch of experts for some specific actionable ideas to address America's most pressing problems. Experts as broad and diverse as senators and congresspeople, university professors, university chancellors, to people like Killer Mike who are working on the ground. And they asked them if you could change one thing right now to help fix the country no matter how large or how small, what would it be? And there were a number of really interesting solutions. Many in the income and equality space, some in the climate space, some in the education space, some in the gun control or immigration space. And it was really kind of a plethora of really interesting ideas, a couple of which stood out to me. One was this idea of giving Americans cash at birth so that they could retire as millionaires. It's a potential solution to the wealth inequality problem. And it creates a way for people without any investment assets to participate in this capitalistic system that we have through a program called Birth Rights where the government would invest almost just under $7,000 at birth for every American citizen. And it would result in retirement assets of more than a million dollars for every person once they get to the age of 65, $2 million at the age of 74. And I think that is an interesting idea given the fact that pensions are no longer an option for most people. And it's a fascinating way to think about how we take care of our older generations. It says nothing about what happens to people before they get to 65 or 74. But I thought that was one of the interesting ones. There's one of course that I love that asks to put an internet enabled device in the hands of every US child. And I think we're at the point where doing education in the United States, you need a computer and an internet enabled computer the way everybody understands that you need a notebook and pens. It's just part of doing business. There are proposals to think about paid internships for every college graduates and abolishing ICE. Stop pushing college is an interesting one to me. Honoring tribal treaties is a fascinating one. Another one that really stood out for me was suggested by Robert Smith, who is the head of Vista Capital. And it's persuading companies to embrace a 2% solution where if the largest companies invested 2% of their profits, we could actually apply those to some of the challenges that are in the areas that those companies serve. So for example, if the 10 largest banks invested 2% of the last 10 years of profit, you'd have $20 billion for African American communities from those banks alone. And those banks could support African American businesses and borrowers or telecom companies who save 2% could eliminate broadband disparities or food companies could work on equitable access to food. Sports teams could invest in communities where their players come from. And the interesting thing about this is that this idea comes from how regular Americans spend their money. The average American family donates 2% of their income every year to charitable causes. And so it's asking the companies to do what regular Americans can do. And so I thought this was an interesting article at a time where we are usually lamenting about what's wrong with America. These are some specific actionable ideas that folks can consider as we move into the next administration. Yeah, so the only two things I'd say is one is we should be doing more of this. We should be pushing people to put ideas down around solutions. That should be like where the whole space shifts is that Lord knows we are like problem, problem, problem, we know the problems. People should have to do a lot of work around putting the solutions out. We fight about them. We're like, okay, I think this, I think we can do this. I don't know if we can do this right now. We talk about phases, but that's such a different conversation than going back and forth about how much everything's a problem. My only challenge with this is this question of like who is an expert is that this is still a very, you know, it's like Congress people, famous people and CEOs. And you're like, well, if y'all could have fixed it, if y'all like if y'all alone were it, we'd have done it, right? Like if y'all had the ideas, but it was not the researchers that got people in the streets. It wasn't the professors who like helped us get free breakfast in school. Right? It was activists. It was people whose expertise was rooted in a lived reality and not only in sort of position. So I'd be interested in seeing more people like the people they have here are great too. I mean, they are experts. I'm not saying these people aren't experts, but just sort of like pushing and saying, let's just, let's just open it up a little bit. So mine is I was fascinated by this. Also I really had never read filter mag filter mag.org, but fascinating publication that was new to me. Shout out to filter mag. So they have a leaked report from the FBI, the Denver division that essentially shows that the FBI recorded that drug sellers were actually practicing harm reduction and they were making sure that the drugs they were selling did not have fentanyl in them. So in Payblow, Colorado, drug sellers were actually checking the drugs with fentanyl test strips that they got through a local serene service program. And they were making sure that before people got the drugs that they weren't going to like overdose on fentanyl that they like weren't there wasn't going to be fentanyl. And they were even selling the strips to their clients. Now, you know, the strips are free from the government. So it's all they were hustling by selling free strips. But what they were doing was actually being really focused on making sure that people were as safe as they could be in the practice. And this really, you know, flies against the way people think about people who participate in the street economy in that way. This idea that people don't care, people don't care about people's lives, people aren't sophisticated, the harm reduction doesn't work. And it's like, this actually shows that people who are engaged in drug selling are actually making sure that people are healthy and then making sure that people don't overdose on fentanyl that there's an acknowledgment that fentanyl kills people and harms people. And you know, this is also like a business use case for the drug sellers is like, have you got people die then ain't no business. Exactly. So when you think about harm reduction, it is it is a pop this was a powerful reminder for me that harm reduction works that syringe exchange programs keep people alive, that testing strips people use them. And that what we see here is often that drug sellers will also be the people encouraging harm reduction strategies. So what was really wild about this for me was the juxtaposition of sort of street drug sellers who were engaging in these practices that were about harm reduction that were about making sure that their customers were not going to be taking fentanyl and potentially overdosing. And the juxtaposition of that with sort of the corporate side of drug selling, which are groups like Purdue Pharma and the Sacklers who literally and you know, this is now all public knowledge because they've been charged with crimes over this. But they literally were flooding the market with OxyContin and paying off doctors and healthcare providers to essentially oversubscribe opioids to patients with no care at all for their well-being and doing it at a scale that literally created an opioid crisis in this country. And just the narrative around like who is causing harm and who is who is sort of harming others with drugs is so far from the reality where those decisions are often made in corporate boardrooms and offices by people who don't look like the sort of drug dealers in the popular narrative or on TV but are causing a whole lot more harm and need to be held accountable and are often not arrested, not charged, completely allowed to just run wild with this at the expense of everybody else. This one was really interesting to me and derate like you, I was like, what is filter mags? So of course I like had to look them up and you know who they are and how this thing came to be. And I found it really interesting that they are like a publication in a nonprofit that actually just helps to like reshape the narrative around not just drug dealers but like drug policy in general. And so I looked at another article because I think for me like I do have like a narrative in my head when it comes to like opioid, heroin selling drug dealers and to me obviously in the mind I make up their white people. And that's mostly shaped by like Dave Chappelle. So and then on the other side it's like like the people I grew up with that sold, you know, so those are like the two different distinct like typographies of people that I have in my mind. So when I click this other article it basically talked about how there was this guy who sold cocaine and he found out that his cocaine through these test strips had fit in all in them and he started to cry like while he was at like so like picture Coachella, this guy is like selling cocaine and then he finds out that the cocaine has fit in all in it and then he started to cry because he really was scared about what he had given to his friends and family and customers. So all that to say maybe it helps no one but it kind of started it just because I just needed like I needed a human experience in my head or I needed something that I could like paint a picture with in my brain to make this article make sense and like that was helpful to me. I'll pick up on that Dara. I thought it was fairly interesting that they went to users and asked why this was important. There was a study that showed that 85% of 300 plus drug users from three East Coast cities said they were interested in being able to check for the amount of fentanyl and the presence of other substances in the drugs that they were using because they know that they get drugs that are compromised that have additives and things that are not good for them. And you know I clicked on another story and saw about a woman who is using the test strips to assess the trustworthiness of her drug sellers right and you know that's her being careful about you know she's using recreationally she's trying not to overdose and she shows she's taking whatever precautions she can and that's Tabitha would say that's her business. Right that. And while you know while I wish that she was not you know engaging in this way I think for me it helped to show a level of humanity and responsibility and autonomy if you will in you know the this economy that we generally don't subscribe these really human principles to. Don't go anywhere more potting the people's coming. Netta Netta Netta tell us what's going on around the country with regard to racial justice in the protests. Hey everyone it's Netta so happy to be back again this week with more news updates and of course more stories about Sage. So getting to the start of my show first Sage is now a teenager. Y'all what I do not recall this happening to my dog back home she is now 13 so this seems like I truly do not even remember I just remember the potty train phase and then ever since then she's kind of just been a grown lady. So she's now 13 and here I am with Sage she is seven and a half months old. So talk about starting over and she is full starting into her teenage years at the seven and a half months. We have been in a few raging wars lately. I did not know that this little dog has so much sass and she's very defiant I truly don't know where she gets this. But I will say if you have any tips or tricks or best advice on how to deal with the teenage puppy years so one of us does not have to leave this house please email me. I'm for real I'm laughing but like I'm laughing through my pain truly but if you have any of your best ideas please send them to me I'm so so for real. I thought this was going to be a heavy winter no clue where that dog came from St. Louis winters are actually pretty tough so I'm used to lots of inches of snow maybe a few blizzards you just never know. We even had thunder snow at one point you know St. Louis weather likes to add a little razzle dazzle on it. So here we've been having like 50 degree days so to keep my spirits up I've just been trying to take more walks in nature and running around with Sage at these dog parks here in DC. It's been pretty great. Lately I have been reflecting on my time in quarantine though. As an introvert I absolutely love being at home all the time. I am fascinated that I did see the same five people all year. The time does feel like it's I kind of feel like it flew by. I'm really just trying to grasp that like I've been on personal lockdown for forever and that is just so opposite of me. I love to travel, fly and see my friends or just work conferences just anything I actually love love love traveling. So this is the longest I've ever had to stay put. Lots of time for introspection spent a lot of time just you know trying to digest the heaviness of this year which includes a lot of loss. I've lost a lot of people and I've watched a lot of people around me lose people that they love due to COVID or related things like that. So that's a lot. So if you've just been reflecting on the heaviness of everything on top of it being the holiday season on top of COVID and it's just been a lot I truly understand. So how am I doing like everyone else I'm throwing myself into my work where to Rihanna. So that's it for those updates. I really do hope like you know just the heaviness of this year I hope we don't take this into 2021. So on to the news is this a pandemic or what with all the talk of the economy and saving the markets what about people. It feels like ever since the stock market went back up the powers that be have started to act like things are going to go back to normal but the economy the middle class poor folks are not dependent on the stock market. People need help in real time and the government has just been out to lunch. We've asked time and time again and now it seems like we may be getting something the AP reports that a bipartisan group of senators are working towards a second stimulus package set a total of nine hundred eight billion dollars. The package will provide some direct payments to folks who are struggling. Senator Bill Cassidy said the pain of the American people is driving this and I'm optimistic that McConnell and Trump will come on board. It is worth mentioning this round will not include the twelve hundred dollar direct payment but it will include the extra three hundred dollars in unemployment. This leaves direct payments up to the incoming Biden administration. I know this is better late than never but the pandemic is something we've never seen before and this requires aid that we've never had before. A one time twelve hundred dollar check that not everyone even received at this point is less than one hundred thirty dollars per month each month of this pandemic. Surely we can do better than this but sadly with the Senate split like it is I don't think we are going to get the aid we need to meet this moment but I'll keep my fingers crossed. What a difference five months makes. Months after George Floyd was grossly killed in Minnesota setting off a summer of protest and uprisings politicians from across the country either signaled their support of the current law enforcement apparatus or support for radically changing things. One person who wanted reforms or said that they did was Los Angeles mayor Eric Garcetti. In June he signaled an openness to divest one hundred fifty million dollars from the LAPD budget. A move like that while not going far enough for some could have been a major step. Fast forward to yesterday Sunday December six the LAPD was literally outside of the mayor's home with batons and pepper spray being aggressively violent with a crowd of protesters. Their alleged infraction exercising their first amendment right to protest. Protesters were present at Garcetti's home to call on president elect Joe Biden not to appoint Garcetti to his administration in a really disturbing but all too common thing police could be seen in riot gear swinging batons against unarmed protesters. I don't know what to say y'all you know when the folks who publicly say that they are on our side who believe that we should make these changes to our communities to the police that police our communities and then when he had the option to do better when he had the option to display humanity to his constituents who were outside and wanted a conversation who probably would have had the conversation had he come outside. I don't know what to say to this that's why I'm bringing it here so maybe we can have a conversation about it with 2020 coming to a quick close. I don't see myself making any new year's resolutions for 2021 other than continuing to keep myself my family and my friends as safe as possible as we continue on during this pandemic. Till next week y'all talk to y'all later. Hey you're listening to Patea the people don't go anywhere there's more to come. And now we have Ijoma here to talk about her latest book you might know her because she wrote so you want to talk about race now she's here to talk about her book mediocre. I learned a lot in reading it you'll learn a lot in reading it we love her here we go. Ijoma thanks so much for joining us today on Patea Save the People. Thanks for having me. I am you excited to talk to you again because you have done the impossible you've written another book that is also great and you did it in a short period of time my my first book almost killed me I do not know how you how you did this but you did it so thanks for coming on to talk about it. Thank you. Now this book is called mediocre and you cover a lot of ground in it. Can you first start with like why a second book your first book was amazing and helped so many people sort of think about race differently it gave people language. Can you talk about why this book? You know this book a book I think everything I write is kind of built out of this feeling of necessity and the necessity is different and so you know see once we talk about race was written after hearing from so many people just kind of stumbling over these issues and trying to have actionable conversations on race and wanting to move these conversations forward but mediocre was born out of a personal frustration as someone who writes about issues of race and as someone you know as a black woman in America who was really frustrated with the way in which we treat discussions around white male supremacy in this country and the way in which we tend to act as if you know we have individual actors who are behaving badly and not a system that was designed to act the way that it ends and so I really wanted to show that system and show how it has acted over the centuries and to show how we have participated in it and upheld it and how it is no surprise at all that we found ourselves where we're in you know in 2020. There's a lot to cover here and I have a lot of questions I read I'm like oh my god I can't wait to talk to us so we can talk about this. Can you talk about the book has been out for just a couple days now? It came on the first right? Yes. How has the reception been so far? So far it's been so positive which is lovely you know the thing about I'm article right that's where I got my start and it's still like where a lot of my heart lies and you have an instant response right the moment you hit publish on the piece you know how people take it but when you write a book you work on this book for a while and then you have like eight months to a year to just imagine how much people will hate it you know you just sit there and go oh it's gonna be awful and so to hear such positive response especially you know for me my barometer is always what other black women think about the work. So to hear so many black women saying this was not only educating but it was affirming to hear so many people say you know that they thought they knew everything about our history and they're learning new things about it has just been wonderful like it's been such a great response so far. Now one of the selection of pen I'm going to jump around those of you listening you need to buy the book so I'm not going to try and give away I'm going to try not to give away everything but there's so much here to talk about. One of the things that you talk about is this notion of like you know when all else fails hire the woman right like there's a on page 155 if you are seeing a pattern here that's because there is one after everything else has been tried everything being multiple mediocre white dudes and time is running out I imagine people start saying crazy things like what if we try to woman or what if a brown person gave it a shot or even crazier what if we put a brown woman in charge can you talk about how you've seen that play out and like what do we because I think people read this bar and be like yep yep that's my experience I saw that happen company was tanking and they're like we're gonna hire the first black person after like all the sales in what do you how do we counter that and what's the importance of including truths like this in a book like this. I think it's vital to recognize and so you know we call this phenomenon the glass cliff which is basically you promote someone when when the ships are already sinking and then when they can't turn it around or you set them up to fail and you go see they were never supposed to be here anyways and time and time again you know what studies have shown and what we see from our own lived experience is that usually the only chance that a woman or a person of color and especially a woman of color is given to show real leadership is when everything else has tried and failed and then what they're inheriting of course is a very broken and hostile system to try to correct you know part of how we balance that is we have to start appreciating the leadership of people who aren't white men in all stages of business and leadership and government and education and business and get people used to seeing it the studies that have been done on this do show that people can adjust but if we just throw someone in at whenever a business is failing as a Hail Mary not only are they unlikely to be able to turn this vast system around it you know the drop of the hat but also they're sabotaged often by their peers who aren't used to seeing a woman or a person of color and leadership so we really do have to challenge what we expect and how we participate to those norms and we start you know getting used to seeing leadership that doesn't look one particular way start experimenting with different types of leadership start supporting people at every level of industry and government who aren't white men and who don't mimic white men in their behavior that's really one of you know the lasting ways we can do that but it also means we'd have to reward the performance and the skills that they bring if there's no reward for it we're just never going to really see the benefit so if we aren't clear about what different leadership styles can bring to us and also what the status quo costs us we're never going to really be able to fully embrace the change that we desperately need now one of the things that was in the book that I was like legit I had no clue like no I was like okay okay Joanna teach me teach me was about Buffalo Bill yeah tell me about Buffalo Bill like I read this and I was like clearly I missed this whole part of whatever was supposed to be teaching me about Buffalo Bill yeah you know it was interesting for me that was one of the chapters that I knew from the very beginning was going to be in the book because when I you know stumbled upon the Buffalo Bill Museum this is a wonderful group in Seattle I knew very little about it and I was like what is this whiteness right here on display and it just blew my mind and then if I dug into it though it's right I mean I was learning less tonight about it I knew there was something there because when you're walking through a space it's clearly not designed for you that's glorifying this idea of white manhood but you know so foreign from like your lived experience as a black woman and it's a whole city block like what is happening here you want to dig into it and so I knew from the beginning that as I started researching the history of Buffalo Bill and just how mediocre this man really was and how integral to white male identity throughout the west especially and I'm talking the broader west right we're like Montana Wyoming and my mom's from Kansas so she when she read the chapter she was like I grew up on you know everyone wanted to be Buffalo Bill when I was a kid and I had no idea half of these things and so I think it's important that we recognize why these heroes were embraced who they actually were and really what it cost us when we build these images off of violence and that's really what that image was and then we allow people to be rehabilitated in how we remember them and so even going through and how people talk about Buffalo Bill they talk about him as a friend of the Indian and as a you know conservationist and as a feminist when really he was contributing to a lot of you know violent white male supremacy not only in his direct actions and contributing to you know the you know murder and displacement of indigenous peoples but in the genocide of the Buffalo population but also in what he stood for as a stage character and as you know a hero to white men who were trying to decide you know what manhood looked like. You also talk about you know I love the chapter about sort of white men and social justice and you and you have this thing about Biden I didn't even know and Bernie I look I was like how did you again I'm I'm in shock that you got this that you wrote this so quickly I'm like whoo you are out here I need to take your writing course because you got the juice. Can you talk about that why you thought it was important to include the Bernie bros like what does that what do they symbolize for you when you think about this larger conversation about race and justice. You know one of the reasons why I knew it was important to write about them was because I was scared to because I didn't want to bring that mess to my door again you know what I mean where I hesitated because people start asking are you going to include Bernie President like and I realized I didn't want to bring that harassment to my door I didn't want to bring because you know any black woman who lived worked in the public space would anything critical to say about Bernie Sanders even if you were criticizing Hillary criticizing you know everyone else um faced this kind of onslaught of you know racist misogyny and I was nervous and I realized okay this is actually impacting how I interact with the political world I need to write about it you know and and I and I was seeing this you know in my peers and my friend and you know hearing in mommy say that she was going to keep her mouth shut as well and I realized like this this wasn't the fact this silencing tactic but it also cost us so much politically it cost us so much as far as progress and so I decided I had to write about it and I really wanted to show it all and I thought it was really important to show both Bernie and Biden and I wrote both of these before um it was subtle that these were going to be our you know the final candidates in the race this for this election um because I felt like I needed people to show how pervasive this toxic need to center white men regardless of you know their actual output and contribution to society and how you know eagerly and violently white men shield other white men from true accountability especially when you know any of that critique comes from women of color and so really those sections of the book were really vital to me and so yeah we just dug into the research you know I really wanted it to be accurate but I wanted it to to show how it plays into a broader pattern I didn't want people coming out of there and saying see the problem is Biden or see the problem is Bernie or it's Bernie Rose I wanted people to see that regardless of your political ideology um we aren't exempt from the toxicity of white male supremacy in this country got it how do you how do you deal with that online right like I think about these and you know this and Bernie Rose I think symbolizes pressing you said it we're like we all are thinking something you know it you're like nervous because the moment you say it online it's gonna be like a swarm of just everything and there's a there's probably a part if we're honest there's a part of all of us at the beginning of our using twitter or platforms like that where we were like you know what whatever we'll do whatever right and then after a while you're like yeah is is my little comment right now worth seven hours of what the internet's gonna be like for me or two days or whatever and you're like no how do we work against that sort of high mentality that was definitely not unique to Bernie in some ways actually see it present in the movement still around some topics or people like just won't say it because they're nervous about the gang do you have any ideas about what we do about that you know there's a couple of things one of these things we actually have to hold these platforms accountable because we talk a lot about speech and protecting speech but we forget that it's a deliberate silencing tactic to make the cost of speech too high for people of color from women for disabled people and for transgender people right we forget that that is actual technique designed to silence our voices and where platforms support that they are responsible for and so I think that that's one thing that's really vital but for me personally in the meantime my tactics you know my block name is strong and when I realize there are billions of people in this world I can afford to block whoever I want and ignore whoever I want so when I say things I weigh why do I want to say it why is it important to add to the discourse and then I know that it's not vital for me to engage with the hatred that comes back at me so if I feel like you know what I want to respond because I got time and I'm in the mood I'll respond but usually for Twitter if I say something and I know I need to say this because I feel like it's important for the discourse and I know that I'm probably going to get a bunch of weird randos you know in my mentions I kind of put Twitter and timeout after that and I don't check it and I know that I'm contributing to the discourse in there but me arguing back and forth with these people isn't and so I try to save my energy and preserve myself in that way but it's a cost that we shouldn't have to pay you know it really is and I don't want people to understand that I think we need to stop brushing and often saying oh it you know it's just a part of it because it's not true social media is also a white male supremacist system and that's run by white men in their own image and their idea of what is appropriate and what is not is really designed to enable them to operate freely even when it costs us a lot of our own freedom and you know peace of mind as well. Now I did want to I've been wanted to ask you this since I saw it happen in sort of real time is you and you read about this in the book which is why it's relevant to this conversation is that you were swatted can you I remember seeing it online was like oh my goodness I think you you all were in a hotel for a little bit like I you know I read it in the book but I've seen read that I remember it on Twitter and was like what is going on you know first can you tell us what that means a lot of people don't know what it means but also you know how have you dealt with the aftermath of what it means to feel safe in your home. Yeah I mean that was I think that's something that we're still kind of recovering from as a family you know so to be swatted is basically this is a technique that really started getting popularity during the gamer game and was used against often women in the gaming industry and people who spoke out and supported women and it basically the goal is is you usually spoof a phone number close to someone's home once you have their address and you call the police from that address and you either make a sweat or you say you've done something criminal pretending to be someone in that address and the goal is to send a SWAT team to someone's home and the goal you know is to have SWAT teams you know bust the door in and maybe hurt someone and people have been killed by swatting so our address was placed on a website designed specifically to encourage swatting and we were placed I was placed on there with a lot of other black journalists and writers a few dozen were specifically targeted and I was in Florida on business and my 17 year old son was asleep and at 6 o'clock in the morning as I was getting ready to board my plane home I got a call from the sheriff's office saying they had a report of shots fired and someone pretending to be my son had called and said that they had he had murdered his parents and so the cops called me because I knew that my address was on this website I had found it a few weeks earlier had notified the police luckily so they knew to call me if they got any sort of threats or anything like that but they still ended up sending six armed police officers to my house where my son was home alone at 6 o'clock in the morning asleep it was terrifying I was you know getting on a plane and trying to determine do I miss this flight so that I can stay on the phone if it got what's happening but then not be able to get home you know or do I get on this flight and try to figure out what's going to happen with these cops that are driving to my house right now to wake my sleeping child so it was incredibly traumatizing and after that once it hit the news it was confirmed that they had our address so the harassment was really monster at our house we ended up moving just because we couldn't get any peace you know I couldn't work the kids couldn't enter the door it was really really traumatic and for me I think as a writer I had long known that there were risks to my personal safety but where it was impacting my children you know made it incredibly difficult we moved and that definitely brought us sub-measure of safety but you know then of course if it's income to your house and it becomes these contingencies you have to make we're recovering you know and it's hard and what I have to remind myself is is that I did this I'm doing this work because I am inherently unsafe at the black woman in this country and while doing this work has of course made me a special kind of target the truth is is why I was motivated to do this work was because everyday black Americans are targeted by this system in ways that they can never expect and I will not be more safe by you know discontinuing this work but it absolutely gets harder times you know we have a strong support network you know we're doing what we can to try to stay as safe as we can but I just have to remember you know as a black woman in this country safety has never been guaranteed and if it was this wouldn't be the work I'm doing. One of the last things I'll ask about that I was super interested in and I was like wow you know the best books are the ones that you learn from and not the ones that just like reinforce the things you already knew and you have a part in here where you talk about Reagan's disdain for our education and like the liberal hippie kids who like you know we're against the Vietnam War and all of the stuff he did to sort of attack the UC and then how that was just like amplified times 10,000 when he became president which I didn't know like I didn't know that was you helped me understand sort of the history of that in that piece. Can you talk about why the Reagan era is important as a foundational moment for you to include as you think about that legacy? I think it's so important because it was such a normalization of this tough guy as a leader in our politics in the highest offices that we don't talk about right we give this dignity to Reagan that I really feel like doesn't actually match the way in which he led which was as a bully you know as someone who really you know chose to bulldoze through populations of color through you know anti-war activists through any sort of you know progressive agendas. We gave it a dignity and a grace that I don't think it deserves you know as as Reagan undermined our poor communities and our communities of color and we need to recognize that because many people on the right and even in the center and some on the left view Reagan is this you know benevolent leader as this you know pinnacle of strong leadership as if trickle-down economics was a great success right as if the way he responded to the aid pandemic or drug addiction in communities of color was a huge success and these were all incredible violent failures but because he kept this strong male persona that fits into these ideals we have about white men people look back on him as if he was greatness incarnate and I think it's really important to look at you know on whose backs that legacy was built who was kind of crushed underneath that and who's been erased and what history has been erased in order to maintain that imagery and what it means for us as a country when we define that as good and strong leadership. Yeah there's a part of Reagan that I didn't know about so thank you for the history lives and I should have gotten in class and that I got from Ejo. What do you want people to take away from the book? You know I think it really depends on who you are so when I write I always have you know different people in mind reading and I try to be responsible to the various populations reading the book and so you know for me like there's always a fictional black woman in my head reading this book and wondering what she gets out of this that's my guiding light but there's I also am aware that there will be a lot of white people reading you know a lot of other people of color reading this book so primarily I want white people who read this book to look at it and say where do I see reflections in my ideals and in what I'm not holding in society here where have I participated where have I been fooled to fit to to uphold these harmful ideals in society so that you can start investigating and distancing yourself in that and for people of color I want us to do that as well but also I really want you know people of color who read this especially black and native people who read this I want it to be a an active counter to the collective gaslighting of our history like you were saying these aren't things we're learning in school we're learning that you know you could be anything if you just put your mind to it and the system doesn't work that way not only does it not work that way it's been actively designed to do the opposite to make sure that no matter how hard we try that we will never rise above meteorical white men because the system needs meteorical white men see themselves as the people in power and so I want that to counter that I want us to recognize that we have every right to demand more and that we do need to look systemically and know that we're not just unlucky we're not just on a warby that this is a system that we have every right to demand changes and the two questions that we ask everybody the first is what's the piece of advice that you got in over the years it stuck with you oh man so you know okay one thing is a writer that I've learned that kind of I learned from messing this up and then being told you know by other editors which is if it doesn't feel right and you don't bring it up in the beginning it's almost impossible to bring it up later and I think when we're so many times we just we're used to in this internet age just growing an opinion out there and co-signing on opinions that don't quite feel right for us because it sits in the moment and not investigating that and then we want to go back and say oh I didn't mean it I didn't mean it that way and what I learned right away is I have to act like it's all a final draft and look at this and say it is you know almost impossible to claim you didn't mean it that way and so as a writer as a person who exists on social media spaces it's just human being it's a reminder for me to pause and say do I really want to own this opinion a year from now how do I you know do I want to own it a week from now and really be more deliberate of what I put out into the world and really treat what we put out on social media and all these spaces as real valid words you know respects a word enough to edit and to think and to be intentional. And the last question is what do you say to people whose hope is challenged in in this moment people who have done everything they were supposed to do they did it all they read your books books shout out to books plural they went to the protest they testified they you know they they did the things and they look up and they're like a job of the world is just like it was yesterday right like we we now we want to talk about or like you know like what do you say to those people. So I'm going to say I'm going to answer a few ways one if you're white and thinking this I'm going to say you're going to have to test not honestly because you're pretending you're just getting started right so I'm just not even going to amiose and they like you know what look at the history of what populations of color especially black and native people have endured through history and that we're still fighting and working buck up you know and keep working like that's the advice I have there but also what I would say for people with color because it's very easy like as a black woman to feel you had discouraged at times and one I absolutely look at our history you know but it's also important for me to recognize this I fully recognize that white supremacy will outlive me. Violent white supremacy and the patriarchy will outlive me so if that's the case I have to figure out what my definition of success is if we know the system will live so then I live in that in the phrase black lives matter right that phrase means that even if the systems do exist we matter and that means the experience that we have in life as we are battling the system matters we are not martyrs we are not being sacrificed to progress how we live our life matters and so my definition of success has to lie first and foremost in what I am doing for my life and for the lives of other black people and so how you define your battle look at that and say what is my definition of success that these systems are going to exist well then it's going to be in figuring out what change you can make right now you know it will be in long-term investments in systems but also recognizing that even if you're not there if you made it possible with how you engage with your school board for black kids to get a better education this year even if you couldn't change the whole system even if you know you couldn't get where you needed to be if you believe black lives matter then every better experience for every black person in that system matters right we can't say black lives matter and then discount the victories we have along the way because they're not perfect and so that reminds me that every victory counts and it's also never enough right my battle is never done but it's also an insult to the lives that I say I'm fighting for to discount the victories we have along the way and that's really what keeps me going and knowing that I have not only the right but the obligation to find joy to find success and to live in that joy as a black person that's part of my revolution can you tell people where they can find the book uh you can find it really anywhere books are sold so I would say you know go to bookshop.org or support your local black or indigenous bookstore to get the book to make sure that we are keeping these important businesses alive in this you know in these trying times oh cool I joined my thanks so much for joining us and I'm glad to see the people we consider you a friend of the pot and can't wait to have you back thank you so much it was a real pleasure it's good to talk to you again well that's it thanks so much for tuning in to pot to the people this week tell your friends to check it out make sure to rate it wherever you get your podcasts for this apple podcast or somewhere else and we'll see you next week pot to the people is a production of cricket media it's produced by Brock Wilbur and mixed by Bill lands executive producers Jessica Cordova Kramer and myself special thanks to our weekly contributors Kai Henderson di Balinger consumers in young way and our special contributor to net alzie"
