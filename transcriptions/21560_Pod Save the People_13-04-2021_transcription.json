    "text": " Hey, this is Derei and we're gonna pass you to the people in this episode. It's me, Sam and Kaya, covering the news that goes unreported that you might not have heard of. And that it comes on to give us an update about what's happening with the protests. Then I sit down with Elua Author to learn more about what it takes to be a death doula. I learned so much in this conversation, I wish we could do a part two tomorrow just because there's even more to talk about. Now my advice for this week is take your hand off. Sometimes we are pressing on things and we are trying to massage the situation where karma is actually the only thing to come through. And we up here trying to tip the scales and move the thing and it's not our business. So some of the stuff you gotta take your hand off. I'm telling that to myself right now, Derei take your hand off of this. So take your hand off of some of this stuff. Let it play out, let karma do its thing or let the universe, whatever you want to call it, you messing with it might only make it worse. That's not everything but you know this stuff that you need to take your hand off. Let's go. This is another fine week here on the POD. I'm Derei at D.R.E.W. on Twitter. I'm Kaya Henderson at Henderson Kaya on Twitter. And I'm Sam Sanieongwe at SamSway on Twitter. Y'all we are it's always good to be back. D.R. is not with us for the recording but D.R. is always a part of the crew. Last week was Easter so we didn't have a conversation then. So we haven't talked about the trial of Derek Chauvin. You know it's interesting in so many ways this feels to me like when I watched the Zimmerman trial like I remember being tuned in. I remember being at work and like we would take breaks to watch some of it and talk about it. And as much as I've tried to stay away from this I haven't been able to like I've watched more of this than I thought I would even though I know like I don't have any questions. I know they killed George Floyd. I have no there's nothing that they could say during this trial that will change anything I know to be true. And yet seeing the kids testify and like hearing the woman who took the video that changed the world in so many ways hearing her say that she wishes she could have done more like it was just heartbreaking in a in a whole different way. So I do in some ways think that this will be the sacrificial lamb like I think it's clear he'll be convicted and this will be used as a way for people to believe that like the system just worked that the system does work. But we can't let off the gas it like Luen knows there's a lot more to be done to dismantle the system of policing. So I'm less optimistic about Derek Chauvin being convicted really this round. So so let me set the table by saying I think it's clear that he murdered George Floyd. I think there's like no doubt about that. What I'm reminded just looking at you know the data in so many cases that we've seen is how the presence of just like one juror who is some like right wing ideologue who no matter what information they're presented with will never sort of second guess or vote to hold an officer accountable for murder. Like I worry about that. And I think about the case of Jeremy Lake a black kid who was murdered by police in Tulsa in 2014 and how there were three mistriles. So they tried to convict the officer in this case. He was a black boy who was dating a white girl. The white girl's parents were police officers. And so like they saw her with him and like I mean they essentially lynched him and it took three mistriles in which in each case there was one or two jurors who simply would not despite all of the evidence would not vote to convict. And finally on the fourth trial they got a manslaughter conviction against the officer. But then that was later overturned interestingly enough based on that Supreme Court precedent because the murder took place in a region in Oklahoma that because of that Supreme Court precedent is no longer governed by Oklahoma state law that conviction has actually now been tossed out. So like there's still been the saga going all the back to 2014 now where four trials have not ultimately stuck a conviction to the murders. And so you know again I think like I am always reminded how like this system at every single level makes it so difficult where it's rare enough to actually charge the officers only you know one in every 50 or 100 cases the officer gets charged. And then even then you have a jury that is comprised of you know a jury pool of registered voters who are disproportionately white and in many cases particularly in the area in which in which this took place in Minnesota you know you have a high possibility of having jurors that just simply will not listen to the facts will not do justice. And I think that that is like a piece of this problem and a piece of why it's so important to continue to change the narrative change beliefs around this because ultimately like those are the beliefs that inform those jurors who then have the power to convict. I mean I'm stunned that you all are watching the trial I cannot do it. The snippets the highlights on the news are quite enough for me but the trauma of reliving this situation is really real and watching these people talk about what they could have or should have done including I mean I watched a little bit of testimony from the guy who called the police and he you know he's like I shouldn't have ever called the police and George Floyd. Like oh my I can't like I can't take the emotion that goes with it on a day to day basis and you know I'm with you Sam I am worried that what we all saw you know before our very eyes what our intellect and our rationality tells us that if you kneel on somebody's neck for nine minutes that you could kill them easily. Like literally you know this is like you know the shaggy song it wasn't me right like she saw me standing on the sofa it wasn't me right like literally like this we saw this man kill George Floyd and the defense is like that's not what happened you don't believe your lion eyes and Sam you are absolutely right it takes one juror or whatever to make this thing go the wrong way and I'm especially worried that what's going to happen in the aftermath if this man is not convicted is going to like I'm I'm just worried I don't like I am exhausted by it and you know I pray that this comes out the right way because if not we're gonna be in a world of trouble. So so from the topic of the you know Derek Chauvin trial there is some good news in the space of addressing police violence and that news is coming from Maryland where this past week the state legislature successfully passed and overrode the governor's veto of a package of three bills that number one repealed the police bill of rights law in Maryland which is a huge huge accomplishment the first time this has ever happened. Maryland was the first state to adopt a police bill of rights law since then a total of 21 states now had police bill of rights laws now it's 20 states after Maryland repealed it and not only did they repeal that law but they replaced it with a system that is completely different. So in Maryland now under legislation that just passed every county is going to be responsible for creating a police accountability board that is made up of civilians who have the power to investigate and hold and review complaints and hold officers accountable they get to appoint members to a charging committee administrative charging committee that then has the power to charge officers with administrative violations so they can actually create the process of formally charging officers with misconduct then civilians also two of the three members of the trial board that then sort of adjudicates that case are civilians one administrative law judge and one person again appointed by these police accountability boards. So basically you know in Maryland the system has shifted from one in which it was almost entirely controlled by the police to now one that is heavily civilian controlled and not only that but huge parts of the system are actually now being controlled by people with a vested interest in accountability these police accountability boards that are really you know this is the first state that is going to have in every single county a police accountability board that has real power to actually formally charge officers with misconduct by appointing those members to the charging committee. So this is huge it is part of a broader package so the police bill of rights law repeal and replacement was one big part of this. There was also a part around transparency so Maryland like many states prohibited public access to information on officer misconduct their personnel files allegations against them whether they were disciplined now records of an investigatory records records of officer discipline will be made public as long as it involves discipline related to an interaction between the police and a member of the public and not only that but there are additional changes that have been made to no knock rates completely changing up the warrant application process restricting the issuance of no knock warrants and restricting how and when any types of rates can be conducted within the state requiring transparency in terms of data around SWAT operations. So those are all good things there are some things in the bill that are a little bit more problematic and that might need to get revised so you know there was a change to the use of force standard in the state but some of those changes really haven't gone as far as other states so in Maryland under the new legislation you would need to prove that the officer willfully violated the use of force policy in order to charge them under that new statute that was created and as we know in places like Washington state and even the federal standard when you have to prove the officers intent we have to prove that they will fully violate a policy oftentimes it is almost impossible to even charge them under those statutes so clearly there's work to be done to actually strengthen the use of force standard further in Maryland to permit criminal prosecution but on the administrative discipline side it's actually a huge game change in the state and I'm looking forward to seeing how this new law will be implemented in a way that can create a model for other states. So we worked hard working with the House leadership and some of the Senate leadership in Maryland to get this across the finish line shout out to all the incredible advocates and Speaker Jones and Bill Ferguson Senate President in Maryland who like put in a lot of work to sharper this representative Adderberry who led the work group like a lot of really good things like Sam said so just to give it context this is the most aggressive ban on non-accharides in the United States as of today. There's a bill before the New York state legislature that goes a little bit further than this but this bill is amazing they cut down so Maryland right now a search point is valid for 15 days they took that back to 10 you know we'd love for it to be even more restrictive but that was actually that was a good change the requirement for search warrants like all search warrants have to have more information that goes to the judge so that's a good thing officers have to be they have to announce that their officers that wasn't in the law before they can no longer use flash bangs or stun devices when they do when they execute search warrants they can't do nighttime search warrants they have to be in uniform like there's all this stuff that just literally wasn't like it's so basic common it's sort of common sense just not common practice whenever they execute any search warrant they have to have a body camera which will protect people and then they also have to there's a really robust reporting requirement Maryland was already the only state that had robust reporting route all search warrants a long time ago and then it sunsetted and they didn't put it back so this one sort of puts that back and makes it a little stronger and like Sam said you know the accountability framework with the administrative charging committee is really incredible because what happened what will happen now in Maryland is that there is a non-police body that will be able to see the vast majority of complaints that come in about the police and can actually make a decision about whether you should charge the officer or not and like this scenario that was created in Maryland literally doesn't exist anywhere else i was inspired by this because i think when you look at for example the legalization of marijuana right once one state does it it starts the wheels turning and other states and it enables model but it just makes police accountability possible for people who i think have felt like it hasn't been possible for a really long time i also you know i've fundamentally believe in collective action and the varied coalitions that it took to bring this together to me reminds us that the people have power legislatures have power for sure but when people are working together for a common cause we can make big things happen and you know it was legislators it was former prosecutors you know moms who were affected by this it was lots of different people working together and i want to remind people that like the people united can't always be defeated maybe not never but can't always and so to me it like there are a series of things happening that are reminding us that even with the republican governor you know even with a strong police union we can accomplish things one like really curious piece of the legislation that was interesting to me was a provision that restores the baltimore police department to local control and it has not been under local control since 1860 and so when we think about all of the things that have happened in the last few years around policing in baltimore i wonder dorei maybe you have some idea about what implications does this have for baltimore police to be under local control yeah it's sort of a it's an interesting topic we'll see you know because right now the mayor can already appoint the police chief and you know because you were somebody appointed that's a big power right that's not like a that's not like an insignificant power the mayors have historically stood behind this idea that they need to go to the legislature to like change things about the department they've sort of stood behind that as opposed to just holding the police chief accountable for changes so a part of me is like mmm this is a little scamtastic right like the second thing is i'm interested to see what the city council do because the city every city council's been able to punt they've been like well we can't do so and so we can't do so you know will they reign them in i don't know like i'm hopeful but the plan i think is still staggered it's not you know they're going to get control back but it's still going to go to voters and there's going to be like a longer probably this isn't going to be a one-year thing so i'm interested to see i think um i think the the question is there and you know i am i will say just for the record i am nervous remember that the state took away the school system from being run by the city because of fraud and because of mismanagement and because of exploiting the resources of the school system so a part of me is trying to figure out how do we make sure that like the giving this the police department back doesn't actually encourage corruption which the city of baltimore has been plagued by for ages yeah i mean it's interesting because under state control it's not like they're doing so much better you know i i just wonder what it means but it was astounding to me that it's been under state control since 1860 wowser my news comes from a political article that talks about california teachers and one of the newest wrinkles in school reopening in california um california teachers are about to go back to the classroom many of the different districts have negotiated a variety of provisions in order for teachers to feel comfortable um going back and um about a week ago the teachers union the united teachers unions of los angeles has put a new demand on the table they are the state's largest union and they have said that they don't want to go back until there is free child care for teachers children and this is an unprecedented ask it is sending parents into a tizzy because parents and and community members frankly are saying well listen frontline workers health care workers emergency workers they don't have free child care for their kids and so why should we allow teachers to have free child care they didn't have free child care before the pandemic and teachers are saying child care before the pandemic was an issue and is still an issue and so you should take care of it now while you're taking care of other things and i think the reason that i brought this to the table is because this was something that i had no idea about didn't even know you could ask for things like this and i think as i watched the school reopening saga and at a moment where it finally feels like we have agreed that for families who want to be back in school that kids need to be back in school and this feels quite unfair to throw up at the last minute and to me what it is it's illustrative of i think a fraying coalition where parents were quite supportive of parents and teachers at the beginning of this pandemic and let me be very clear many teachers our parents shared many of the same concerns about the safety of their kids going back to school and whatnot and that coalition is fraying many parents who have to go back to work who have you know who are operating under conditions where you know things are getting back to normal they don't understand some of the demands and so i've seen some of the teachers union leaders on television sort of saying parents and teachers need to work together but parents are saying i don't have free child care at my job and so why do you get free child care at your job and i think you know i understand from a negotiating perspective that you want to get as much as you possibly can in this particular moment but the question for me is how do we remain fair to teachers which i think everybody wants to do and remain fair to parents and to districts who have a responsibility to you know educating children and and the many children who want to get back as soon as possible and so i lift this up to say that like there are times when you can take opportunities to win things that you didn't win in other places and i am worried frankly that when the parent teacher coalition phrase i mean i think some of the best parts of pandemic schooling has been the rebuilding of relationships between parents and teachers right that has been one of the strongest parts of this pandemic schooling experiment but like we need parents and teachers to be on the same side in order for our kids to get what they need and this just feels like an unforced error yeah kya thanks for bringing this to the pod i think reading through this and just seeing the context it feels like you know this is what happens in an environment with scarcity where everybody is fighting each other over the resources that they all deserve and like yes like the teachers should have free child care and the parents taking their kids to school should have free child care also and by the way like it is not either of their fault that that isn't the case it is the government's fault and not only the state government california but i mean the federal government as well right and we look at what's happening in congress right now around the various different rounds of relief legislation that have been planned we just got the first sort of round that was passed a few weeks ago it sounds like there are one or even two packages sort of still in the pipeline that democrats in the senate think they can use reconciliation or no now because of parliamentarian told them they could that they can use reconciliation to push these bills through with 50 votes but there's been a lot of conversation around the first of those next two packages being focused on jobs and infrastructure but conspicuously leaving out a lot of investments in child care we still need universal child care like nationwide like not just in california not just for teachers in california for everybody and the that's the federal government's job to provide those resources and this is something that obviously it was a part of the campaign where it was a campaign promise and something that you know democrats have the votes to deliver i'm not sure why it seems like that might be pushed to the third package now instead of the second package but we need that urgently and i'm interested to see more from not only senate democrats but also from the biden administration just on you know why would child care be in the third package and not the second package can we make sure that those investments are targeted in a way that they actually reach families as quickly as possible in a way that actually meets the scale of the need because i think this is this is just going to keep happening in an environment with scarcity and where the federal government just doesn't do its job to provide basic resources for everybody so my news is something that i was legitimately i did not know about it's about essays so there's been a big conversation especially in the middle of covid people have been sort of just examining the role of standard assessing do we need standard testing should we be test optional when we go to for college admissions this study of six thousand applications found that the essay characteristics correlated more closely with family income than the s a t scores and it sort of leads to this idea that like if you get rid of s a t scores the essay will become even more important and the essay is actually potentially more reflective of socio-economic status than the s a t scores were and i hadn't even i don't know i just didn't a i hadn't thought about that the bauden has been testing optional for so long that to me i made sense uh like i hadn't thought about the other components of the application process besides visiting the school for instance where socio-economic status would would show up so clearly and even in the study they wrote it says i quote essay content is far more predictive of s a t scores than is for example high school gpa and like i just didn't i literally didn't know that i didn't know that the s a i didn't think about the essay being such a big deal but i also didn't make the relationship between s a content and socio-economic status in a way that makes me think even more about how if we shift away from tests what do we need to put in place it actually is a driver of equity like how do we do that if the s a isn't going to be one of those things in its current iteration what does that look like so i just want to bring it here because i was shocked by this uh and it was new to me yeah this was really surprising to me as well you know i remember applying for colleges this was in 2008 or so and this was like the first year that they had started to implement the writing section in the s a t so it used to be you had the reading section you had the math section it's the first year that they had the the writing section and at that time because it was the first year they sort of alluded to like the college admissions won't really heavily weight the writing score they don't really know about it or how it might affect scores moving forward so really concentrate on the math and you know the reading and you'll be all right and that was like the advice we were given at the time but reading through the study what the study showed was that it was actually the writing section the s a writing section of the s a t was contributing substantially to the disparities in the s a t scores between folks from different socioeconomic statuses so you know we talked a lot about the s a t in the history of the s a t and standardized testing and how that like it was a tool designed to be an exclusionary tool to keep out people of color to keep out um jewish students to keep out a whole host of people who weren't sort of like this waspie like white archetype um and it just didn't occur to me that like the essay writing component of the s a t could actually be like the most egregious part and that that's actually new like that was a decision that was recent that like i lived through and that like the ripple effect of that i felt i feel like probably wasn't fully anticipated given like what we know now in the research um so you know always this article is really or this study is really important because it pushes us um to think beyond just like what is bad and what needs to be repealed and to think more closely about like if we repeal the standardized testing like what are we actually replacing it with because in the absence of standardized testing then like the s a's get more heavily weighted and that outcome could be even worse um so just really want to want to do a deeper dive and not now i'm sort of curious to think about and what are all of these different components is gpa there's the subject matter um like which classes which courses you had access to which courses you took there's the college visits like there's the s a there's a legacy and all of these other aspects of the admissions process and really you know i'm interested to deconstruct each of those and figure out what are the core components that are the most equitable what are things that need to be introduced to replace some of the things that are not equitable but clearly just like removing standardized testing is not by itself going to be a solution i was not surprised by this at all like the s a is the subjective part it's the part that you can get coaching on it is i mean and that's what rich people do they make sure that their kids are prepared by getting them writing coaches or getting them you know this was this was the whole i i used to sit on the board of trustees for the college board and i was there when they went to the new s a t and the point of the new s a t i don't think it landed this way i don't think everybody understood it to be this way but the s a t was completely jacked up because it wasn't anything that you learned in high school so in order to get a good score you had to pay for a prep course or a coach or whatever learn a completely different set of things right and then take this exam and the new s a t sought to test kids on what they should have learned in high school things like the founding documents being the documents for reading comprehension things that you should have done in high school the new s a t was supposed to be the kind of end of course exam for high school and at least that way it was relevant and it provided more opportunities for kids who could not access you know these expensive prep courses and whatnot to do that and you know the college board teamed with Khan Academy which shows tremendous test prep effectiveness and made Khan Academy free to people and they tried to do all of these things to try to even the the score but we were so far down the road on standardized testing is bad well gpa's are subjective given how counselors put kids into courses and how teachers grade recommendations are subjective like everything is subjective one of my worries with all it is test optional thing is for a lot of young people the test was the only way that they got a halfway fair shake to show what they know and to provide access to schools where they've been undermatched where their counselors didn't think that they could go but I mean if you think about there was a a study that came out some months ago about racial bias in grading amongst second grade teachers right and what they did was they gave teachers two essays right that literally said these two second grade essays that said the exact same thing except one said when I was hanging out with my friend day Kwan and the other one said when I was hanging out my friend Connor right besides that the essays were completely the same and the essays who were hanging out with their friend Connor or brother Connor whatever it was Connor those were marked on grade level and the ones who you know where the friend had a more ethnic name they were marked below grade level shut up really oh I'm telling you and white female teachers showed the most bias wow second grade essays right with all the inventive spelling and all that you know whatever but it like literally ordinary schoolwork and so if teachers are grading the exact same essay right as below grade level versus on grade level based on cultural context what the heck do you think is going to happen in these essays where kids are really writing about stuff that goes on in their lives and whatnot like come on this this is not surprising at all to me and I think it goes to show how you know you're damned if you do you're damned if you don't right the standardized tests were were to provide some level of objectivity and they became subjective or too aligned or too designed to reflect socioeconomic status instead of knowledge but throwing them out is not the answer either because what we have on the other side is the same if not worse don't go anywhere more potting the people's coming and now a check in with janetta lc is she gives us an update about what's happening with the protests hey what's up everybody it's me netta la sheriff's deputy shot someone again but let me read these two la times headlines to y'all headline number one man is shot in an encounter with la county sheriff's deputies headline number two man is shot by la county sheriff's deputies in unincorporated witter headline number one is from when I first read the article and number two is what it was changed to but honestly they're both trash one of the county's biggest newspapers apparently stopped using the vague quote officer involved shooting nonsense but what exactly is this headline even talking about what are the actual details as short as the article itself is you would think that the headline might include the fact that the man was likely considering hurting himself or you know the officers shot at the man during a standoff and this is literally less than a month after an la county deputy shot a 25 year old autistic man who's still in the hospital right now fighting for his life the la times could have tried something like this la county shared of deputies fire at man experiencing mental health crisis or eight to one standoff leaves man with mental health crisis hospitalized with gunshot wound after police opened fire I mean what's that thing in journalism oh the code of ethics that says seek truth and reported do better la times do better imagine this a black couple uses their hard-earned money in 1912 to buy land in california to create a black beach resort where black people could socialize and swim safely willa and charles bruce call the portion of the land they own on manhattan beach bruce's beach and if you don't already know racist white people segregated beaches in addition to pools for decades then of course it was just too much for the white people who had already had the world is their oyster so they started vandalizing the resort harassing and attacking black visitors in their cars traveling to bruce's beach and the kkk couldn't miss out on the action so they attacked the beach in 1920 imagine in the government instead of protecting bruce's beach condemned and snatched away the property that was rightfully owned by willa and charles they tried to fight the city in court knowing that it was a racially motivated removal campaign but y'all know how it goes when it's awred against theirs the city claimed they needed the land to build a park that was in 1924 and this allegedly desperately needed park didn't get built until 1960 y'all now i'm already salty but let me put some more allowries on it for y'all the black at the park credits a white man with helping the bruce's buy their land i mean what in the white savior supremacy is this foolishness so fast forward to today where a member of the bruce family said it's time for them to be able to get their land back and collect their coins for decades worth of income that the family would have made had their thriving beachfront resort actually been left alone but the sad thing is you can't put a price on the memories and moments black people throughout california could have made if they had just had one safe space to enjoy themselves but because nothing is simple or really fair for black folks in this country in order for this to happen it will take a state bill to release the land because l.a. county owns and uses it for a lifeguard training center i also want to know i really love manhattan beach and now that i know that the land was actually owned by black people maybe it makes it even make more sense but i really really love that area check my instagram lots of pics from manhattan beach y'all i'm not even sure how this story is a story but apparently tom is webster a retired nypd cop accused of beating choking and trying to gouge the eyes out of a d.c. police officer on january 6 is in shock that he's in jail with other people who've committed crimes websters lawyer specifically said people serving time for inner city crimes y'all just the white audacity of it all excuse me you committed trees and babe what's not to understand my darling not you the former police officer can't hang in jail little old jail you probably sent so many folks to in good old new york oh okay this screen's white fragility and i just cannot i was gonna have a beautiful closing to honor the life of dmx one of the best rappers new york's greatest this man was truly like he was a whole decade of my life like in the early two thousands dmx was that guy and so i really do and honestly hope that the spirit of erl simmons is safely transitioning to the other side and i know our people are telling him job well done but in the meantime while i was writing this beautiful closing for him i also woke up to the news that in between writing the script recording it police have killed another black man his name is dante right and he was only 20 years old i am reminded of philando castill walter scott and sandra bland in this moment all targeted traffic stops that turned into executions to white people especially white police officers black people's humanity is not worth as much as bragging rights dollars or quotas in the words of donald glover this is america i hope next week we can end on a higher note talk to you all later hey you're listening to pate the people don't go anywhere there's more to come and now my conversation with allua i learned so much i didn't even know what a death doula was but allua is a recovering attorney a death doula in the founder of going with grace an end of life planning and death doula training organization that exists to support people as they answer the question all my side do to be at peace with myself so that i may live presently and die gracefully i learned a ton here we go allua thanks so much for joining us today i'm pate the people thank you i'm happy to be here okay so i've been waiting to talk to you forever i have not let you respond to me when we talk personally because i wanted it to be here because i have so many questions but you're a death doula i am and can we just start with the basics what is a death doula and how what was your journey to this i've been wanting to ask i mean i've asked you this before but i've had turned my ears off me so talking because i wanted to be on the podcast but please like help like introduce us to this work and to you so death doula somebody who provides all the holistic non-medical care and support for the dying person and the circle of support the families through the dying process but we work with three groups in particular when people are healthy we help them complete comprehensive end-of-life plans when people are getting close to death where they know what it is that they're going to be dying off we help them create the most ideal deaths for them under the circumstances and then after a death we help family members wrap up affairs as i love dorms life and so while one big focus of our work is on when people are getting close to death we're also working with anybody who's coming to awareness that one day they're going to die like if you think that you're going to die one day which you will you should probably seek out a death doula how did you get to this work i'm a lawyer by training and i developed a really serious clinical depression and i went on a legal vaccine to work because i just i couldn't anymore and during that leave of absence i found myself in kuba where i was you know just like searching for answers i was just looking anywhere for healing and for to crawl myself out of this hole that i was in but i was running through the street and trying to make it to return jumping to a woman that i'd met the day before before i had to make it to the bus stop because i was running late because i'm always running late and a car was hit me in the road and i like you know gathered my self and got my bearings and made it to the place that i wanted to go and made it to the bus stop and in line for the bus stop i met a woman who told me that i need to be in a different line and we chatted briefly and she offered to hold onto my bags to make like a get onto the bus and she did she asked her to fool if she could get on and then i got on right afterwards we started chatting she had uterine cancer she was a fellow traveler from germany trying to see the top six places in the world she wanted to see before she died naturally i leaned into her and asked all types of questions about her disease the conversation about death was already sitting in between us and i don't know how to leave a juicy conversation on the table so i started asking her a bunch of questions and for her it was one of the first times that somebody was asking her questions about her death because when she talked about death people had asked her to focus on life instead and so it was an opportunity for her to dig into these things out loud and explore ideas about the afterlife and what was undone in her life and you know what if this disease killed her what meaning she would have made of her life and it was also one of the first times that i've had one of those serious conversations with myself but particularly in the midst of a disease that depression is necessary to constantly be like checking in to see what's going on here because for some it's nearly chemical but for me it was like a stirring within my spirit to get my life on a track that felt good to me so that i couldn't meet my death feeling like i made the best use of my life the point of this whole story is that we got off the bus during that bus ride i got very very clear that i wanted to support people preparing for death no matter where along the process they were because i saw the conversation so healing for myself but we got off the bus together she stayed with me she's supposed to get off after seven hours but she stayed for an additional seven hours and as we're going to bed that night in the guest house that i've rented off so if we want myself and i got the stranger in the house with me and she says to me she remembered when i almost got hit by a car before we left the town prior and i asked her how that was possible because we hadn't yet met and then she says she was in that car that had almost hit me so i was on a direct crash course really with my life's work and didn't know it at the time like i was just you know following the old breadcrumbs of life that led to me and was getting it by a car and ultimately loved me to discover this passion that i have for helping people not prepare for death i came back to the states like really rip or ready to go seeking out every death anything that i knew of process doctors i'm going to medical school i was just going to do whatever i needed to and um about six months after i came back from kuba my brother and my older sister bosomos husband peter felt ill and i got to support him and bosomon and my knee slayed out to the last three months of his life and saw practically what the work of the death doula is and that's how i found it going with grace which is the end of life planning and training organization that i met so this woman in no small way changed her life yes how did you find because you're a certified death doula what does that even mean like how do you get certified did you you know i know you it seems like i think you run your own certification program now but you obviously didn't certify yourself so like how did that path happen when i was deep in searching for how to do the work in the way that felt most honest and true to me rather than becoming an estate planning attorney because i already had legal background or becoming a hospice nurse or working in the funeral industry i met a woman who had heard of this death midwife training course it was like an intro course and so i went for the evening it's called sacred crossing seren los angeles and i took that program it was over the course of three weekends over the course of about three months and that provided me with a lot of the practical information i needed and then i got my practice started and i hung out a shingles thinking people would start running through the door to see me who people who needed the death doula but turns out that's not the case so it took a little bit more work for me to get to the point where people sought out my services there is no such thing as a certified death doula amusing air quotes because there is no official certifying body for a death doula to be certified means that you've received a certificate of completion of your program so you've done a training course and you completed it but we don't have any formal organizing or certifying bodies we do have a national end of life doula alliance which organizes us it's a 501 c6 organization but they provide standards of practice and ethics etc in order to become a death doula there's a number of different ways to do it sometimes people become death doulas because they are the one in their community that people go to when somebody's dying or because they have taken a training program such as the one that going with grace offers or they have volunteered a lot for hospice and have mentored under a death doula who's working in the field already there are a lot of different ways and I think it's really important that people who have a call within their spare a deep stirring somehow follow that call because there is some a big pot of gold at the end of that rainbow got it okay can you walk us through some scenarios because this is so like that was the framing i get it in the frame level so say say my somebody in my family is as a terminal illness and i call you like hey i know your death doula can you help what happens next well first what i would do is ask how you are doing with the information and the news and then i would ask how comfortable the person in your life has become with the idea of their death like are you making this call on their behalf like hey they really need you but i haven't talked to them about this or have they expressed some awareness that their life is ending because that's the key component in me being able to work with somebody and then we talked through what their needs are and then i would come visit in the before times before pandemic times i currently come and visit now we can do visits virtually and then i'd sit with your six family member and talk to them about what their needs are what type of death they would like to envision for themselves and also if there's anything that's still undone to see if i can support them in wrapping those things up and the needs are varying you know for some people it's about their practical affairs like they want to figure out what to do with all their possessions and their money and their financial accounts and they need to get all their passwords cataloged and nobody knows where the safe is or how to open it stuff like that for some people it's very emotional they are struggling with the idea they're struggling with deep fears of death and the idea of no longer being around it made somebody to discuss those ideas with so other people are spiritual they have concerns about the afterlife where they believe aren't really nailed down and then for a lot of other people it's relational there are some relationships and their lives that fill me some attention before they die and so no matter what the needs are for practical emotional legal spiritual psycho spiritual psycho social the death you look and support with so sometimes the work is a lot of talking well for me it's a lot of listening it's a lot of listening and it's a lot of paying attention to the works that aren't being set like the music behind the lyrics to try to glean where somebody actually is in the process because it's a big one to undertake you know not pun is completely intended but trying to get your head around the idea that your life will soon be ending is not an easy one and people need support through the process and so that's what we try to do i didn't even realize there was such a range in that when you said it i was like that makes sense to me but is it like people who need to come to terms with the fact that that life will end is is that the hardest or the people who i don't even know what your role is with the people who need to clear up some things in their relationships like do you help them work through it and then you i don't know like what does that look like i have a lot of questions i'm like what you know is the logistics thing is that the easiest like the logistics piece are you there with them when they take like is that something you talk about like do you want me here at the end or like i don't know all of it i got answer whatever whatever hit your spirit can you answer it so much of it so much of it let's start with the question about relationship sometimes people will say that they're ready to die yet the body hasn't started uh the process of them moving into imminent or active dying in their particular signs that you can tell and so the people with the serious end stage disease that say that they're ready to die air quotes but nothing is happening i'm like what's going on what are you holding on for what's still undone would we need to get up as one client who was nonverbal she had lost the ability to speak years prior after a stroke and certainly ask the disease progress of the other bodily functions went along with it i'd ask her if she knew she'd done she'd not vigorously are you ready not vigorously twice the whole being on far away look in her eyes if there's something still undone far away look in her eyes how are your relationships far away look in her eyes you have children far away look in her eyes you know i just like keep asking and so we start uncovering it and turns out that she was estranged from her oldest daughter she hadn't seen her in 30 something years and really wanted to repair that relationship and so through the help of her granddaughters who was there and her squeezing my hand we're able to get a letter written to her daughter to apologize for how she was as a mother where she'd abandoned her she said all her saris and please forgive me and i love you because we'd reached out to the daughter and she was not trying to see her mom before she died and so we're able to help her get this letter written and then not long after that maybe two days later she started moving into active dying so there was clearly something she was holding on to and it shows up in so many different ways you know we have a terrible idea of what this is like because of the movies and how he would like you have dad who's like laying on the hospital bed and he's estranged from the sun and the last minute the sun runs into the room and sounds like dad i love you and dad's like i'm sorry sir i forgive you and then he goes flatline it doesn't happen like that at all often what happens is that people just sit in turmoil about something that they haven't yet said to somebody that they love and that makes it much harder for them to surrender and to let go so that's how the emotional relational work often works you know the four things that we need to remember that things that we don't say that often choke us while we're dying are i love you please forgive me i'm sorry and thank you these are taken from the ho upon upon a prayer out of Hawaii but these four phrases are often the ones that cause a lot of blockage and relationships that make it much harder for people to release when their lives are over you'd also ask about what was easier in the work and no part of it is necessarily easy you know our different skills and give lead us toward being better at one area than another i'd say my gifts are in talking to people about dying overall and what might still be holding them here and helping them clear those blockages and since that is the main thing no matter what falls in under it i'm decent at the practical things might seem easier but the practical things are always evidence of a greater emotional thing and so to do a job to pay attention to what emotional things being pointed at through the practical thing you want an example i do and i want to know how you carry all of this what does it mean to be there in the end for people for so many people and to not be overwhelmed by that i'd say one of my particular strength is in being able to be with people and emotional depth like i'm not scared of the big conversations or the emotions i allow myself to have them all the time and expect that other people will as well like people's discomfort doesn't necessarily make me uncomfortable and so it doesn't seem like a lot to carry also because while the work may seem heavy in nature it's actually really life affirming there's a lot of laughter and joy and a lot of beauty and a lot of magic at the end of life while it is sad while there's grief and pain and sorrow involved people also often end up feeling like they witness the greatest miracle to ever exist when they watch a death similar to a birth and i'm right alongside with them like i'm humbled by the simplicity and the profundity of dying and of death itself magical and confusing is it ever too late you talk about you know thank you and i love you and i'm sorry and the part of me is like is it like i can see that person's daughter being like you had a whole life to say this stuff and at the last minute you want you want me to come so you can give me this letter or story or whatever but you had a whole life to like figure this out and you didn't yeah is it ever too late well that's on the daughter to figure on her own death bed you know mom did what she had to do for her death but now daughter's gonna have to reconcile the choices that she made on her own death bed like it wasn't too late for mom anymore mom said the things mom felt relief around it i'm sure she desired that daughter would have come but she said what she needed to say now the daughter is gonna have to figure out whether or not she made the right choice of not coming i think that as long as we're still living it's not too late so i just don't live it that's it we take tomorrow for granted all right there are differences in the have you have you helped people transition at all ages or is this normally older people all ages well i haven't worked with any children it breaks my heart so you choose not to do children yeah but are there plenty of other doulas i know who do sorry refer them interesting um is there a difference in ages like is 18 to 25 very different transitioning than 75 for instance or not necessarily we all die in similar ways when we're dying from disease i think the challenge is in the people who are around them who will assign a different level of appropriateness of grief based on how old the person who's dying is you know when somebody's elderly and they're dying we say oh well she lives a long life when somebody is young we say their life got cut short whereas the grief is just as great no matter how old the person is but the dying itself looks similar and what do you do about the heart break of the people who are who might have survivors guilt you know like the family members who they're still here and and you help this person transition how do you what's your role with them oh hug them and hold them offer them resources check in on them encourage them to be in their grief remind them that they don't have to hide from the difficult things remind them that their feelings are valid no matter what those feelings are allows them to express their grief in whatever way they need to we've showed up in so many different forms we're used to people crying but we're not used to people getting promiscuous um and it's my job to remind them that however it is that shows up is valid and a perfectly good response to loss and then also practically there are some needs like wrapping up their affairs you know their clothes and their social media accounts and their bank accounts and their paperwork and there's a lot of stuff to be done so i help them with that as well to give them a little bit more space so that they can feel the feelings and be just the feelings and you approach this secularly i think but how often do you see people turn to religion in the end or turn away from religion in the end yeah you know i find that a lot of the very religious people start backing off or start asking questions that side of their main religion because here's my basic understanding is that all of our religious beliefs are just that they're just beliefs there there's no fact or evidence to base them in we don't have any eye we're it's all based on faith and at the end of life we're about to find out the truth and so even the most religious amongst us question our beliefs because we're about to get some evidence for it real quick i find that people who were hysterical and they're living who lived these big wildlife one in particular is in my mind she got baptized maybe 23 hours before she died into the Catholic church or a feminist miracle because she was a devout agnostic throughout her life and we'd often talk about her ideas about the afterlife and then in the very 11th hour she got baptized and i could understand maybe it is a fear that what she believed her whole life was incorrect and she hopes to do the right thing in using air quotes but people like to play around with questions about the afterlife which i appreciate you know it's a big old mystery biggest mystery known to man was there a thing that surprised you in the beginning was it like did you think they're going to be more tears in their world did you yeah did you i want to believe too i mean i don't know this because i've never been there but i'm assuming people probably tell you a lot of things in the end like secrets or like you know they just got to get it out or they want to i don't know they want to make sure the record reflects something even if you're the record you know yeah oh it's so juicy it's so juicy i swear sometimes i think though so reason why i do this job is because i'm nosy because nearing the end of life people are so open they're vulnerable it's intimate there's nothing less to lose and they also become so much more authentic because there's no more mash to wear you know they're not protecting an image largely they're about to die and to me that's part of the invitation when we're thinking constant about our deaths when i think tomorrow i might die i'm not so worried about what other people think of me like i'm just starting to speak and live my truth every day gone day and that's what the dying teach because that's how the dying show up they're not hiding and that's our invitation is to not hide we're gonna die what are you so worried about how do you find race factor into your work i don't do people have all races reach out to death doulas you know if i didn't know you i literally wouldn't even know this was real why do you think there's this isn't as public as it could be do you think that it's shame around dying or maybe not shame i don't know like what's the what's the what's the way how does race factor into this or your essence of justice and then um why do we not know why do some of us not know about this as much as we could so that was job in large part is to honor the unique individual lived experience so the person who's dying that means that we have to look at all elements of who they were look at different parts of their identity to ensure that whoever they are the totality of who they are being honored as their deaths because you know deaths ends a life it puts a period on the end of the sentence part of the challenge that the death of the industry has had so far is that it's been largely populated by old verifite women and everybody dies as you know part of the conversation around death has made it is you know trying to create a beautiful transition and address and we use this language that does not look at the realities of how different people are able to access uh health while they're living and then that elusive am using air quotes again good deaths that everybody should have we don't all die from the same things we don't die the same rate the conversations around the good death and the death through a movement I'd say overall really overlooks that we often call deaths a great equalizer but that it masks the inequalities in society you know deaths is a culturally constructed process that is informed by social power dynamics and because of that it's not equal we will all die yes but we die at different rates we die of different things we have different access to medicine we have different access to health care etc I because of my visibility in this field end up attracting a lot more black clients which I'm very very grateful for oftentimes people call and be like are you the black best doula and I'm like yes and I'm so glad that they found me because that's what they're looking for they want somebody at the end who looks like them who understands that you walk into the room and you don't start calling people by their first name who might understand what to do with their hair like it makes a difference you know one of the suggestions I often make for other doulas that are interested in providing services to people of color and I mean just humans overall is to lead with curiosity like you don't know this person you don't know their background you don't know their belief system you don't know what they care about you don't know who they were 35 years ago just lead with curiosity lead with curiosity so race plays a huge factor I think in the work just like it does in life itself it does also in death it doesn't go away just because we die and except the goes of us that are supporting people through death to pay attention to those elements of people's identity and make sure that we're honoring them probably almost gotten no place here at all why don't people know about that doulas well I think it's because we don't really want to talk about death so much publicly but here's the thing when I go to parties which long time ago we used to do that but whenever I'm in public and somebody asked me what I do there's one of like four responses either they're like oh my gosh tell me everything or they're like wow I wish she was there when my brother mother whatever she's their brother died or what do you think happens when we die like they get all curious like what happens and I'm like I don't know you I'm still here talking to you off this mouse I don't know or they turn the way all together but 75% of people are fascinated and want the permission to talk about death we don't grant that permission so sure people who are grieving feel the need to hide death happens behind closed doors people don't have access to it we hide the elderly away in facilities and such we don't live with dying as though it's a part of everyday life and because of that it makes it harder for people to access services when they actually need them it feels so isolating I don't know if you've ever been through this but it feels so isolating when your family members dying I remember when Peter was dying both of us husband and I remember feeling like we were the only family that was happening to even though I looked it up there were 250 thousand other people dying the same day because that's what happens every single day but why does it feel like we're the only ones like we need to talk about death we need to not make it seem like the scary horrible thing that happens to only terrible people everybody is going to die everybody's going to be touched by death millions of people currently have been touched by it because of the pandemic millions of people are grieving and yet it's not a public conversation the longer we continue to hide it the greater of a detrimental impact is going to have on society it's time we talk about death time we talk about grief time we talk about loss a pain suffering well we continue your friend of the pie can't wait to have you back and I learned so much well that's it thanks so much for tuning in to Potsie and the people this week tell your friends to
