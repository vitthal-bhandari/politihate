    "text": " I am unashamed. What about you? I haven't seen any teal, but there's good water on the dog. There's water up. If you hunt the elbow, if you hunt around the hill on the north side. If you hunt on the north side, there's water on the east side. It's a water round there a little bit, but it's pretty narrow. It's water there. You realize this is the first podcast that we talk about duck hunting, the real deal, in almost a year. We can mention that in a minute. We're missing it right now. We're rolling. We've been talking this whole time. Listen to this. How have we turned it on before Dad knows? Jeff and I were coming back the other day from Texas. Of course, I leave early because of traffic. I left at like five o'clock. As soon as that sun, it was still the glow. We're going out in the middle of Texas somewhere. I said, look, Jeff. Of course, Jeff's looking for a cow or something. A huge bunch of teal. They just flew right in front of me. I mean, literally in gun range. Good. I said, that's the sign. Jeff said the sign for what? I said that it's here. The passage is beginning. I mean, we're in south Texas. So where would you rather start Saturday morning on the dog or you want to try over on the pedal? I don't know. I didn't have any water. Dogs have plenty water. I had the lower to put. I got a refurbished that scaffold there. I had to take a pee wheel done and leave it. I just drive the argo out there. Go around. Come around the other side. I think I'm going to need to look before you leave. I make that decision. I don't want to take a look. There's no, there's no. The food's a mess. The food's a mess. The food's a mess. That's right. That's right. You're correct. So they would just be coming in just to. That's correct. So that's why I just said, you know, it doesn't make me any difference at all. I think we got about as much change as one as the other. Teal, have you seen any teal here? Not a teal. I'm seeing a bit of it. Well, I saw the bunch in two. That was what? Two days ago. There is supposed to be a cool down coming pretty quick. Next, within a week. For our listeners, the cool down is instead of the high-end 95, it's 88. I don't know if I could call that a cool down. It's going to be slightly less hot. It was hanging in the bottom right here this morning. First time I've seen that, it was hanging here early. So it's cooling down. You get a little bit more. And at night, especially when you go to that. That's hot. I'm just telling you, when you see low-hanging fog, and it was cool right here in this bottom right here. I would say it was 69 this morning before daylight. That's still pretty warm. What do you set your central arrow? 75 or 75. It's hot. It's always not in the round. And then I would have... Our bedroom is 72. But just that was... We need to explore this. Now, what... It's really the short exploration. If you put it at 75, it won't run all day. You put it on 72. It'll sit there and run for 10 hours without going off. It ain't got the juice to cool it down. You need a bigger unit. A little more of what they put in there. They run out of... Whatever they run out of. What is that? Now, that... What's it called? Cool it. Free iron. A little free iron. I thought you meant insulate. It hits a little low on free iron. And then trying to cool it down to 72. It's just going to run all day. Caves. I just said, I should get away from that. I'm not going to listen to that thing run all day. The temperature don't change and it runs 10 hours. I don't care. She said, wait a second. I said, I'm not going to get away from that. You need to get some insulation in there now. Maybe a little more insulation. Yeah. All right. Of course, it is the inner structure is the original house that was built in 70. 72. But are you like, man, do you feel like you need to see that first bunch of teal? Before you've... It's like I have to see that. But I saw that on an interstate and now I'm like, all right, we're here. Because usually I've gone dove hunting by now, but you know, the hurricane all messed all that up. Nobody killing doves around here. The hurricane blew them out of here. I guess. I mean, I didn't even think about that. It should have. If I was a bird. If you squirrels at that time, no cranes. Well, Phil, that wind. I literally every morning see a group of squirrels that was in a tree, they're trying to make do. They had a nest in the tree. The tree blew down and they won't just go to another tree. You know, it's in a neighborhood. But I mean, they're like, they're still living in the tree on the ground. But it's, they're bewildered. Yeah. So I mean, I guess, you know, why... Well, I was driving out here today and I took Ikele, which is kind of a, you know, wild. It's kind of a, you know, not many houses, mostly blogging area and hunting area. And I would say there were probably at least a dozen to 15 trees that had obviously come across the road because I could see where they had cut them off. Right down here where we got them. I mean, it was unbelievable. Jase, there are hundreds of trees. Yeah, I wonder about the property. Look like I really liked that sermon I heard Sunday. The guy who filled in for you, Tommy. Tommy, yeah. He was coming out of that place where God took the foolish things of the world to shame the wise and think of what you were when you were called. Because he did. I do a similar thing when I have my speeches or whatever because I, you know, you look at the creation at point to the creator and you look at an acre and compare to a tree. He's like, Hey, I got for all you intellects, all you ones that are saying this all happened by a natural process that you really can't explain. He's like, or they may ask, you know, prove that there's a God or show me Jesus. And he's like, I got something for you. All these trees that are laying down, go make one. Just this side. And you don't get an acre. Yeah. And you get no acre. You get no acre. Because we're looking at acre and saying, okay, some force is causing this to happen. I've never been confused in school. I feel sixth grade. Yeah, they introduced the word photosynthesis. And I thought, no, I need to look into that. Because I was thinking that is what's causing everything to live. Who is this photosynthesis? Oh, it's just a word they made up. It sounds sophisticated. Let me give you a good idea. You can drive over there that 400 acres we just bought added on to the deal. You drive through there and I'm looking out across there. It's old growth timber. And I could just see tree after tree after tree after tree, blown down, broke down. But look, underneath all of the upper story, the lead, just looking out across the tree. And then out across the ground. There literally are, I see the ones laying down that just blew over. There are millions of seedlings. They're about this long. They're about six to eight inches tall. Oak seedlings. Millions. So much. You can't see the ground. It's solid seasoning. It's just solid. And a little bit of trees about six to eight inches tall. I mean, there's a crop coming underneath that thing. They could have all blown down and they'd all give them about 75 years and all of them would be exactly back just like the other one. But he made a good point. He said, to be honest, they can't the most highly intellectual scientific community of the world, most not believing in God. They can't make anything on purpose. Thousands. They can't make, look, they can't make anything on purpose, but they expect you to believe that it all happened by accident. Yeah, by chance. Just think about that. It was quite a state. One acre this big. They're all over the ground out there. Now the wind, the hurricane blew them all off, blew a lot of them off. They're all on the ground. The deer having a big time. Everybody's eating. They lay all over the ground. But if you just look at it, you say one acre turns into tons of wood, one tree, tons. You just think of one little acre creating, just coming up and you look at it and said if I have 80 years and you're like, it's like this. I mean, just you could build a house out of it. One, one acre. Pretty amazing. I'll tell you this. If you were a tree hugger, now is that they need you. Because they are laying down. There's a lot of hugging. Can you imagine if you had just been over there out there walking around when all that was happening? It took two days with a bulldozer leading the way. I had my forewheeled with a good chainsaw and plenty of oil and gas just cleaning up here there and yonder around there. It took two full days to even get down there to where we duck hunt. To cut trees across the road. I mean big trees. We've all heard what it sounded like. It hurt my feelings. I mean, it's a frightening sound when just one tree falls. I mean, they make a racket. Can you imagine all those things? Just one right to the edge. But it is a good point. I'm not a tree hugger, Jase, but it hurt my feelings so many of them. I said one time, the only tree that I hugged the cross of Jesus because of who was on it. But the point is, if you just took an acre, I mean, if you just had a display as far as the evidence of God and went around with an acre and then take people outside and look at the tree and just say, explain this. Sermon over. Experiment over. We just take that for granted. Just like we do when our bodies heal. Nobody really explained that. They'll say, well, the doctors, they patch you up, but they don't ignite the healing process. All the reasons are plant trees. We planted thousands of ball cypress because the world needs more ball cypress. But those ball cypress, we planted those with the help of the, with the, the, the, the Latinos that worked for the government, whatever, they come over there and they plant a lot of them and then we plant a lot of ourselves. And they started out about eight inches long. Look, the little seedlings about like that. You just can't even see them in the grass and you just watch them. And now they're up there about 12 feet tall. You know, like good grief. Man, this is getting prettier as of the day. Each year they get prettier. It's a sight to see. Yeah. And it's, I mean, it's one we all observe. It's just, you know, the thing that struck me about the hurricane and I was thinking about what you just said. I mean, you look at tree growth in terms of decades. That's right. And what it does. But isn't it something how to Tommy Sermon? Cause his sermon was called defeat the thief and he was kind of coming out of John Tim with the idea about the thief is here to kill and destroy. But Jesus came to give us abundant life. And so that passage, but I thought about that one storm came through here and it was just a few hours when it went by here. But look at what it, what it tore down in that few hours of destruction compared to what it takes to build that up over years. And I thought, you know, it, it really is a lot harder to build something than it is to destroy something. And I thought about that the week before might do the thing on shows and video of people out here cleaning up in our community. And they were smiling and neighbors helping neighbors and people got chainsaws and they're cutting their way and cutting it off their neighbor's house. And then I, I, you know, contrasted that to people going down in city streets and just destroying everything inside. Just spray painting it, ruining it. And I thought, man, is that not a contrast that we're looking at about good and evil? You know, here we got a community that says we're going to help you rebuild and build up your property. And another group says we're going to destroy everything on our site. And I thought that's the contrast, you know, when you look at it. The judge that lives up there for the gate is a big tree just failed, missed the gate, got one of my polls, video surveillance, got one of those and knocked it down, brought his fence to the ground. And I mean, you were not getting by there without a chainsaw or a bulldozer or a trackhoe. So red, we went on there, you know, cut that log up and just, well, we could drive through to get out of here. Yeah. We needed to be. But all that other stuff, the energy people come in and said, we'll remove it. We'll remove all that off of that. So they, they took a week to get power out here. Yeah. And they had to rebuild everything. Let's take a quick break. So one of the things that COVID-19, we've been talking a lot about it on the podcast, one of the things that it unfortunately has done is brought up cyber crime. It's up 75% over just six months ago. Because of the pandemic? Well, because there's more people online and so there's more people driving the crooks. They fall in the heading of those who invent ways of doing evil. Exactly. They'll virtually steal your house. I didn't realize. Yeah. And so they can literally do it because the legal title to your home is online. These guys get on there. And so it's home title theft. And that's what they do. They basically forge your signature. They quit claim your deed and then they refowl as the owner of your home. So then they run up all these loans and all of a sudden somebody shows up at your house and says, you're out. You know, you foreclose on your loan. But you never knew somebody got it. It's terrible. But I would love for someone to show up and tell you that. I just want to. I would love to see how that worked out. So the first thing you got to do is you got to go to hometidallock.com. HomeTidallock.com. You register your address to see if you're already a victim. Then use the code field. You get 30 days free for protection of your home. So that's code field at hometidallock.com. But it puts an in perspective about stuff. You know, a lot of people are so obsessed with stuff. So you're just going to be in one storm. Should put it in perspective for you. It should. They don't put you hoping that. But you see it. I mean, people are just, it reminds me of the story about the guy building, you know, he spent his whole life putting all the stuff in the barn and you got to build another barn. Build another barn. Build another barn. I mean, where's it going to stop? For almost time. Let's see. Pandemic. Let's see. Wildfires. Hurricanes. It's just, it's just the way it is. It's always going to suck it up. You just got to suck it up and say, hey, let's put it back together here. Best we can. Rock on. Right. That's true. Yeah, but he had a good point because the simplicity of life is that, you know, when you read the account in Genesis, you know, God breathing life in the man's nostrils. I mean, when, when you see life on the planet, it to me is so simple that there has to be a source for that because to me, and people will look at me and call that foolish thinking. They're looking right now, Jase. When you say, how did it get here and they'll say a large explosion? I'm like the big bang. Yeah, the larger. I said, well, what was there right before it exploded? What was there? Who let that be? And they'll tell you, they'll say there was nothing there. I said, so how does nothing explode? Nothing can explode. Well, it was a fire cracker, but every time I fool a fire cracker, somebody lights the thing and then they go, boom. And when I was a kid, young and stupid, you know, first one I took, I lit it because I was thinking I'd have time to throw it, but I was so enammering this. You didn't do that anymore. You did that anymore. And of course, mom was like, what'd you do? It's like, you know, it's like any other kid, you know what I mean? It's like, it just went off. Yeah. Did you say like some of the boys setting up all those fireworks? Every once in a while, I don't know. Just one of those guys gets on fire. Oh, yeah. They're rolling. And then with a kid that says that, you up his butt because he's lying. But somebody out here saying that all this just went off. I'm like, yep, you need your butt whooped is what you need. Did you see the story from yesterday? Those yesterday was sometime this past, they are to Labor Day weekend, that they have these things now. It's a big turn into big industry that to reveal the gender of your base, a woman's pregnant, and they find out it's a boy or girl. They get all the family and friends together. And so they're now coming up with different ways to tell what that is. It's turned into these big reveal parties. This is a big thing going across the country. So the woman wants you to know whether it's a female or a male? So they got one. Why would that be such a big test? I mean, it's like you can't do anything about it. I don't understand it. But it's the thing. So out in California, there's a couple. California is a tinderbox. You talk about light a match and burn the whole thing. I mean, it's just ready to burn. So they do one of these pyro deals and it's supposed to shoot out either a blue, if it's a boy or a pink, if it's a girl, some sort of firework display. So they fire it off. Unfortunately, something goes wrong and they catch one of them wildfires that's still going. That's how the fire started. And that's how the fire started on a gender reveal party. Look, it's already burned 8,000 acres. The last report I heard on it. And now they've had 6,000 fire. You know, I mean, of course, now they're saying this couple can go to jail. They're responsible to pay. It does beg the question. What were they thinking? I mean, yeah, it just makes it. And then you're like, but I would hate to live in a place where one wrong move and you can burn the whole place down. I mean, I don't know which is worse in that situation. But it does seem kind of trivial over there. When all you had to do was say, it's a girl. You know, just you could do it that way. I've seen ones where they open up a package and then the balloons come out. They're either pink or, you know, which is a lot more safe, I guess, than the pyro. But when you said that about the fireworks, I was thinking, this poor couple just burned and they're still burning. Well, that's kind of sad. It's awful. It's terrible. And now they're going to probably be. I like a good fireworks, but if you like fireworks, you don't need to be living in California. I don't do it because California always burned up every year. You know, they always have a lot of wildfires out there, but it seems to be, of course, they're all saying it's a global one, but it seems to be worse the last 20 years to me. But maybe we just didn't have 24 hour media where every time there's a fire or somebody's watching, you know what I'm saying? Maybe it's for the day. You know, I don't remember it being as bad as it is, but it's not good. I mean, when I went to Yellowstone, you know, in Montana, a few weeks ago, I mean, there were one of the things the guy kept saying is, you know, that was the fire of 2017. There's the fire of 2014. There's two thousand and he kept a lot of wildfires out there. Remember we were in Tahoe playing golf, the same thing. I mean, the whole side of one of them mountains up there, it just torched, you know. I mean, it's just, it's so dry. But the whole point is when you look around on the earth, I mean, you start talking about disease, fires, earthquakes. I mean, I would look if there was the slimmest chance that there was an actual designer and a being that was the author of life. When you at least be open minded enough to say, this place is dangerous. It's combustible. You got hurricanes coming up and typhoons and storms and fires and the bottom line is repairable. Look, I would, to me, it would be more intelligent to look for a way around all that. I mean, to me, that's not foolish at all. They're like, oh, that's simple minded foolish thinking. When he's right, when you scrape everything away, just make a tree. Nope, you do like everybody else. You throw it in the ground, you can call it some big fancy photosynthesis word, and then you get back out of the way and guess what? Something makes it grow that you can't explain. You can't do it. And you can't hardly even stop it. Yeah, it's amazing. You know, one of the things is when we went and filmed for that episode, that Hawaii episode for Dusty, we stayed on the big island. And I just marveled. It was almost like this little creation Petri dish because we're on that big rock and it's the biggest island out of the Hawaiian chain. But on one end of it, you got your close that mantle there has just been cracked. You got lava just flowing out of the ground and into the ocean. You saw it from the helicopter, right? And I mean, it's incredible. That's on one end of the rock. Well, then you go over a little bit this way and remember, we went up into those two mountainous areas. It was like we were in Scotland. Yeah. It was cold. We had to buy jackets. That's when we went hulking. Yeah. We actually, that was the unsung. And it was lush green. Oh, it just was beautiful. I mean, and at the bottom of the prairie, it was like seven inches. Seven inches of rain a year. And up there was like 300 or something. So I'm saying, it is the wettest place. I like Louisiana is number two for rainfall and that island in Hawaii or the backside of it was number one. Yeah. You don't say, is it going to rain? You say, remember that? He said, when's it going to stop rain? I thought that was when Steve Martin was a preacher. I don't think I got the name of that movie. Somebody out there said it right now. That's actually a pretty good movie. That's pretty good. Leave a fate. Yeah. Let's go. And you know, one month a year, they ski almost to mountain. There's enough. It's high enough up where they get actually some snow. Nobody knew you could ski and all that. Oh, yeah. So, but when you look at that, as thought about, that's probably one of the last ones that to come up out of the water. You know, we're talking, you know, however, God did it. But you still can see the creation process because you got all these different climates. Wasn't seven different climates on now. So when I look at that, I'm thinking, man, what kind of being came up with an idea that this molten lava comes up out of the water and forms this rock that then all of a sudden starts growing all this great stuff on it. And you can ski on it or you can go look at the live on the other end. No, the Earth's core over millions of years. He did to a point where it created a duel. You know, I'll give you an explanation. I'm like, yeah, he started the fire. Let's start with the group. You have a fire, you know, like the sun. Who started it? Well, actually, I mean, you just ask people who are smart, those simple questions and just watch them squirm. It just, it ain't, it ain't there. That there's no plausible explanation. Let's take another break. So, we know from running a business, you got a lot of stuff that goes on, a lot of stuff you have to take care of. The bigger your base of employees, of course, we were all really tiny when we first started. But, you know, Duck Commander got up at one time, probably during the show running of having about a hundred plus employees. A lot of people. One of the issues that you have when you get a lot more, you know, people working for you is human resources issues, HR issues. Because you got all these labor regulations, minimum wage requirements, termination, you get all sorts of issues. And if you have to hire an HR guy, it's not very cheap. So, one of our sponsors has come up with a great solution for especially small businesses called Bambi, B-A-M-B-E. And it's specifically made for small business. Basically, they're going to provide you with a by phone, email, real time chat, and HR manager that you don't have to hire. So, you're going to have, you know, you just pay the monthly. No month to month, no hidden fees, you can cancel any time. So, check these guys out at Bambi.com, B-A-M-B-E-E.com slash Robertson. Right now, you get a free HR audit. If you go and you sign up, that's Bambi, B-A-M-B-E-E.com slash Robertson. And to your point, we're going to tell them in California a minute ago, because now, boy, they're always looking, these people start fires. But I think I read the other day, 92% of all fires, while fires started, and any of those western states are lightning. Which has nothing to do with us. I mean, it's drag around, it's lightning, it starts to fire. So, we get to think of sometimes we're bigger than we are in this thing, like you said, but it's really not. I mean, that's a net. That's something we ought to do. It's a natural occurrence, right? No, let's stop lightning. Let's figure out a way to stop that, because it kills people. Not many, but I mean, it does, it starts fires. Let's just stop it. Yeah, we could do that. There'll be some group that they can. Right by high global warming, stop lightning, and then let's fix the earthquakes. And then I'd say get tornadoes. I didn't do anybody any good. Fix it. Fix it. So, anyway. Well, speaking of dynasty, so we know we got a lot of the fans of Unashamed, because I read so many emails. This last couple of weeks, I've been a little hamster in the wheel trying to return emails, which by the way, my new email is owl at restorationproductions.net. So, send your podcast to that, because I got a little help. I need to put up one of those little graphics. Yeah, he's going to put one up on it. But some people just listen to the show. Well, what I realize is from this going back through and trying to answer emails, I'm about, I'm up to about a month behind, is that so many new people are listening to the podcast that they're just now hearing when I gave out my other email three months ago. Because, you know, say, we have a lot of new, we're in a time more. But one of the things I want to talk about was that I know from every time I read something, one is most of your saying that's making a huge impact on your life, the podcast. We're grateful for that. Because we're on Unashamed. Unashamed? We're willing to talk about it. We're talking about the Bible. As Dad mentioned last time on the podcast, a lot of you are coming to get baptized here, which is fine with us. Again, send me an email. I'll connect you to the right people. We make that happen. If you want to come here to get baptized. But get to know Jesus in the meantime. That's right. Make sure if you don't know Jesus, you're just getting wet. You can do that anywhere. I make sure they understand. I wasn't chastised. I was just saying, you know, just remember what it's what it's all about. This is not taking the swim. Immortality is riding on this on how you feel about Jesus Christ. We go through the whole thing. But it's not complex. We've got three or four different locations that we meet at in town. Dad and Mom work at a place over in Monroe, a church plant. Jason and I are in town. We're at the BFR proper. We'll let you know all that information if you want to get baptized. A lot of you said that your first connection to the family was obviously through the show. A lot of you were huge fans of the show. You realize the podcast is just an extension of who we are. I mean, the show was really someone else's idea, but it was about our family. And it was funny. And it was added to an embellished, I mean, to be honest. You know, what's frustrating for me is that I go to events. Of course, the coronavirus has limited those, but they're cranking back up. And, you know, I talk about Jesus, number one. I talk about our family because loving God, loving people. I talk about the duck calls because a lot of people like, well, how did that happen? I usually do a lot of humor around the duck calls. Where did this person come from? How long did Jayce have to sleep on the couch putting mud on Missy because she wore perfume? Well, I don't even know what you're talking about. But look, so I'll talk about those three things and then they'll do a Q&A. Well, here's what's puzzling. I don't really talk about the anxiety, but all the questions are about the show. They're like, what was the question you used to ask? The question is, how long did Jayce have to sleep on the couch for putting mud on Missy because she wore perfume? I don't remember that episode. I do. So that episode was when you and Willie took Missy and Corey, deer hunting, inside Stan. And I guess, I don't remember that happening, but I guess you put mud on her face or something. I've done that many times. So I guess in the episode you were in trouble. So that's a pain on her. Yeah. So I believe the truth is, I didn't sleep on the couch. So that must have been a temporary. You've got to realize in marriage, sometimes you say things that you don't mean in the heat of the moment. So she probably said, you're sleeping on the couch. But guess what? She didn't follow through with that. So here's a question for you. So I got some questions. But I mean, are we going to do something? Yeah, we're going to do some questions. So these are a lot of you send me questions. And so we selected a few of them here. We'll do a few of these just because I know people ask a lot of questions about the show. And we appreciate that you watch the show. And by the way, you know the show is still popular because Fox Nation, which is Fox News, just went and bought the show and now is running it on their streaming. So there's a lot of people still connected to it. So we get that as a new generation. Okay. Here's one for you, dad. Was the judge's pawn really owned by a judge? Then and now it is. Yeah, tell us about that. So he's, is he a second generation owner? Didn't his dad was a judge? No, he's a judge, but he owned the property adjacent to our property. Yeah. And so I know when I was a teenager, he chased me on several occasions. I was going to say he doesn't know that was me, but I know that was him. Now, was this the judge now or the older judge? Because we were. That's his daddy. Yeah, we were. That was a pretty dad. You're going back to the judge's dad. Well, the judge's dad chased me all over the two properties. He's a great guy. Because he is. He is. The we used to go fishing. One day, 75 vehicles came down the road going into my house. And when they all pulled up out in the yard and this was, you know, the traffic was getting out of hand during the dynasty thing. Well, I go up there and I tell the judge, I said, judge, I said, I'm going to have to put up a gate here. I said, no, we've got two choices. I can put it on my property line and you'll be on the outside of the gate. Or I can put it on your property line over here and you'll be inside the gate. I said, but it's your call. I don't care what you want to do. So you want to be inside the gate? I'm going to put up or do you want to be outside? He's got a no brain. He should feel put me inside the gate. He's inside the gate. I said, I should consider it done. So I put the gate. So he's inside the gate and that knocked out because we want people to come. We have a place they can come if they just want to, we want to talk it over. We convert people. You're not going to hear some stories about you're going to hear the steward Jesus. And if you want me to baptize, y'all do it. But back in the day before Doug Dynasty, I could just take them to the river. Take them to the river. Take them to the river. But now there's more so much traffic. I have to curtail it because I have to have some semblance of a life that's in structure. Yeah, we still want to do it, but we want to do it where it's not necessarily. You've got to remember it. I mean, it's just a... You just kind of remember there's a lot of people and there's just us. That's right. Let's take them up, Brad. You know, I said before, if you don't know what you're doing, you need to do it quickly. But in this case, that won't work because if you're losing your hair, it's really not up to you. Well, in the quicker you lose it, the worse the result. So I will add another slogan. If you don't know what you're doing, call somebody who does. I like it. That's a good one. There you go. And call our friends. It keeps. They're the ones that are trying to help us keep our hair. So if you go to keeps.com, that's K-E-E-P-S.com slash door, you get 50% off your first order of keeps hair loss treatments. And they've got a safe product, one that'll come directly to your door. You go online, you don't have to go see a doctor, you don't have to go to the drug store and all the things you would normally have to do. So go to keeps.com slash door, you get 50% off your first order, that's keeps.com slash door. If you don't know what you're doing, call somebody who does. Who? Don't ask why. He has a look now. He cuts the beard off. I did. Leaves the hair. I cut my hair off and leave the beard. There you go. So it's... Do you know what's disturbing? You're the first person that noticed that I actually trimmed my beard. I can tell it's just... I cut half of it all. You got to watch this because this will get tangled up and stuff. So we're asking... Yep. We're asking that. Here's one for you. Okay. This was from one of my favorite episodes. Unlike Phil, I haven't seen these questions. Does the family personally know Haxle, Jim, Doug? Well, yes. And tell how that happened. We didn't know him before the episode. Well, right. I mean, I've forgotten the details, but I mean, he was... So just to set it up, Jason and I and Willie loved wrestling, Mid-South wrestling. Look, when my childhood was filled with wrestling... So, and some of the greatest moves that I ever did, you were a witness to someone. I performed on one with him. Because you look at the size of him, you're thinking, how in the world did you pull those moves off? It's called leverage. A lot of wrestling is about leverage. So what we would do... So we watched Mid-South wrestling and Haxle, Jim, Doug, and has to be our all-time favorite. He was patriotic. He got that two by four. I mean, he was just a redneck, you know. But we would put a quilt down, which was our ring in the living room on Saturday night. And then we would watch wrestling. And then as soon as wrestling was over, then we would do some of the things we started wrestling. We would do the moves. We'd just try it. Jake the Snake. My brother. The problem was we were breaking bones. It's kind of like the honestly. Our show was based on... I know I'm your father who's seated here, but I never even paid any attention to that. I think you're already in the bed by the time I'm on the show. Which shows you our house. One of the questions I get asked at these events that I never have an answer to is a lot of people, usually women, they'll say, where be your parents? When I'll tell a story about what... And I'll say, you know, I don't know. I don't know. You call me Dad. Right. And then the place calls me Phil. Yeah, so as well. And a lot of people say, and Willie calls me Phil. We get that question a lot. I think that's the number one question. The youngest one calls me Dad. You call me Dad. But the two in the middle call me Phil. Like, hey, how you doing? Pretty good. Well, a lot of people think of the matchmades. Well, that is a sign of disrespect. It said not to me. Right. I said, you know, my name is Phil. So tell them that, dear. So, when it's Dad or Phil, you say, what's the deal? So I don't think you know. No, I... The number one answer was that since the business was tied to the personal phone, you wouldn't say, hang on, let me get my Dad. Because they would say... I'd like to speak to you. I'd like to speak to you. Phil Robertson. I'm like, Daddy, come here. I would say, hold on for a second. They were trying to be professional. You know, Phil line one. That explains you. We did do that a lot. And then we just... It just kind of became... I never thought about it until someone asked me about it and said, well, they disrespecting you the two middle ones. And I'm like, no. Well, it's probably true because I do notice since I do a lot of business for you and with you with your books and all that, that if I'm talking with a publicist about you, I may say, I would say Phil, probably. We'll get Phil to do it. See what I'm saying? In a business world, I tend to even do that now myself. But if it's just me talking about you, I would use to say that. You know what's funny is a lot of people that didn't like our show for us. They were like, these people are fakes. We have found pictures of them clean shaven on a beach. I'm like, we posted those. More on. Because, well, now, the only thing dishonest is the exact opposite. What we would do every year since we were the salesman and the manufacturers of the DuckDolls, we would all shave and wear khakis. This is the post-dad era when you and Willie were selling the DuckDolls and go to shows. And you said, well, why'd you do that? Why not be yourself? Because when we all look like we normally do, beard it and scraggly, no one would stop at our booth. And so if you would wear nicer clothes and shave, then they would stop at your booth, talk about these characters who you found who make the DuckDolls, which is us, but they don't really- Because the beards weren't really branded. It was just you're trying to sell DuckDolls. Look, I remember being in a meeting, I think it was Cabela's. I was in a meeting. Cabela's a pretty big deal. I'm trying to sell them the DuckDolls and one of the women said, I mean, where did you find these guys? Because she was looking at the cover of one of our videos, of which I was owned. But that was the bearded version. And I wanted to say, that's actually me. But I just couldn't do it because I thought, I'll just give in to the narrative and I want to eat steak instead of, you know. So I'm trying to get you to buy our DuckDolls. So that was the only thing that we really did coming up that was really not us because I remember, I thought, but I'm trying to sell the DuckDolls and I can't get my foot in the door with the bearded look, which is how I really was. So that's part of that whole deal. My old take on it was, you don't have to worry about talking to them. They want them, they're coolest. It's just really nice. You've got to get a good model. That was not really a marketer or networker. To your credit, you did say. I've never been a business man or a promoter. But you said if God wants this to happen and it was kind of like, you know, when we had our guests rex, I mean, it doesn't mean you're going to be lazy. Well, he's working our butts off, but you were kind of like, if God wants this to happen, it'll happen. But, Dad, you also built a foundation of credibility because you were trying to make calls that sounded exactly like what they were supposed to call. And so your focus was much more on that than on the trying to make it a business or... And back then, marketing wasn't really the driving force. I mean, you weren't sitting around talking about your brain. You did, yeah. You didn't have as many other salesman. He could go talk to the Walmart buyers and they'd have a big band. Well, Jay said the mix of both. I mean, he had enough of the credibility and ability to use it, but then also was kind of a bridge. Jay's from one time went to meet with Walmart. We're all down here saying, boy, you know, hope it goes well. Well, Miss Kay was asking about him while he comes back. We said, Jay's had what happened? I mean, how big is the order? Jay said, nope, no order. He said, I walked away from the table. I said, you did what? I did. He said, I walked away from the table. He said, he'll come around. He said, but he's driving too hard a bargain on that price. And he said, so I'm going to... Which was one of the worst decisions I ever made was telling you the actual truth. Because after that, I never did again. You know, if we'd come back and Kay would call, well, how's the big order? You know, how did it go? I was all went fantastic. I hung up and Missy was like, you didn't tell him that you got up. I walked out and he said, I will never buy your car. As long as I lay up, I'll have that part out. But it was just in negotiations. There was a price. Jay's was quite the negotiator. Well, there was a price that... It's not rocket science. There was a price that I thought, because I'm looking at all the numbers. You all are not. This is not worth it. We cannot survive and make a comfortable living on this price. So it's just out of the question. And Walmart's whole model is to take it down to the... The Walmart buyer ran up on Jay's a few years later and he said, I was just bluffing. He said, I told you. He said, I don't watch him old DVDs. He said, I watch them all. But he said, I didn't want Jay's to think, you know, okay, you got... He said, they trained us to do that. Yeah, he's like, we had to put you to the test. Because they know, if you passed... I'm not caving in. I have the number. And so that's the number. But that's why I was saying that that's why the foundation of all this, every business model, if you got a product, you need to be able to have people that want to want that product. A lot of this stuff now is built totally on just smoking mirrors. They're marketing it. Instead of demand. That's right. They're marketing and branding things that aren't worth a crap. But I will say this Al, I was street smart. But like Willie was more... I mean, when he took over, it was way better. Because he did the same things. He just didn't... He wasn't so very... Well, but Eric, in his approach... And Willie's one of his... I'm out of here. One of his greatest gifts is being able to get in with a group of people and build a bridge. He's great at it. He's really, really good at it. And so that helped us kind of mark that thing. Let's take one last break. So here's a pretty good one. Oh, did we finish with Axl Jim Douglass? We never finished that. So he was on... He was on foggy. So here's the deal. So we had the wrestling and he... They did a surprise reveal. We didn't know he was going to be on the episode. Oh, no, I didn't know. A big truck backed up and you had a couple of wrestlers which were local guys. They were professional wrestlers, but they were from this area. And then all of a sudden you have, you know, Axl Jim Douglass comes out. Of course it was funny. They were the only wrestlers I've ever actually seen in person. Yeah, and look, it was cold. No, let me give you the backstory. There was a few episodes that were filmed from a distance. And that was one of them. None of us knew they were coming because we were doing that for Mia. Right, it's the Mia episode. And we told them because they were interviewed during the week, like what y'all got going like. We're going to do this. You're welcome to film it. And what I mean from a distance is some things we, you know, you would film and then we would have to film it again because in the caramel world they get close up. Got to get out of the infrastructure. So it is, you've already filmed it, but they have to get their shots on that particular deal. It's a one. They shot it one time. They got it. It was an event. All of our family, all the Robertson family was on the episode, all your siblings. I think only Judy was the only one that wasn't still alive. And that was cool to us because all our cousins got to be on it. But it was brutally cold and the wrestlers had these little tight zone and no shirt. And I mean, it is cold. It's one of those losing us about 32 with about an 18, 20 mile hour Northwest wind. Both days we've filmed brutal. And I would just remember being cold the whole time we've filmed. These guys come out and one of them, the local wrestlers came out and Willie said, dude, I don't want to, you know, sound too personal, but right now your nipples could cut glass. Yeah, I've ever that way all the way out. Well, once again, saying what everyone's thinking, because I was like, it's one thing about it. We're all cold. These guys don't have a shirt on. So, so Hacksaw comes out. They do some wrestling. We're going crazy because we didn't know they were bringing him on the show. And he was literally our childhood favorite. And of course, Hacksaw, this has been, you know, 25 years ago. So he's a little saggy. This, you know, he had just some regular shorts on. You know, when they go, it was awesome. He was awesome. And we met him. And so here's what I wanted to tell about us, which is why I wanted to ask this question. So that was the first day of filming the second day. They came back out and I think shot one more scene, wrestling scene. And then they wanted to do a big picture with these guys before with all of us. And we couldn't find Hacksaw. We couldn't find dad. And so I said, I'll go out. The user, they sent some P.A. So I'll go, I'll go live one. So I went up to the house. So dad sitting in the recliner, Hacksaw, Jim Duggan is down on his, just sitting down the floor. And there's a, you know, your kick thing is up on your chair and you've got your Bible laid out. And I just remember walking in. It was just such a surreal thing because I thought Hacksaw, Jim Duggan is sitting on the floor where we used to watch him and redo all his moves. And you were just sharing Jesus with him, which he was, he was already a believer, but you were just making sure, you know, and y'all were having a discussion. So I turned around and went back out and I said, they're, they got a thing going on. We'll do that in just a few minutes. I mean, I wanted that to play itself out. But I just thought that was a really surreal. You know, every story you could tell about guests like that, me could say the same thing was easy taught. We were with them numerous times and they wanted to be a part of the show. Right. And we wanted them to be a part of it and we got to know them and we had the same conversations and we hung out. I mean, I think many times we've listened to their music, I was thinking, you know, going down the road to me, you and Willie, you, we love ZZ Top. And then later, who would ever know 20 years later, we'd all be doing a show. Well, I look back on those were some of the moments I did love about the show is we were just hanging out talking about really what you went just life and, and, and, you know, goofing off. But I'm sure behind the scenes, whoever was making those decisions about getting people on and up, I'm sure it was chaos and all, but from our perspective, it was just enjoying relationships. And I think you think it's, you know, people think it's a bigger deal and we're just everybody's just normal human beings when you, right, when you peel everything back and we like their music. And they like, it was actually a perfect. The race car driver, that's a boyer. He was on an episode. He was a great guy. I mean, we just had a lot of fun every time there was the, the guests were involved. Yeah. It's kind of like this with the podcast. I love when we have somebody on here. Yeah. It just kind of gives you another view of other people's world. Well, I will say this. We're about out of time. I think as I started with this, the, all the stuff that happened on the show and the fun we had doing it and the fun, the audience had, because so many people, I get so many emails to talk about, I was going through the worst time. I just got one this week out, you know, they had a kid in the hospital and, you know, it's just a tough time for them. And then, but the show, it was like, it was like a something they could escape. The two short nose here, the last question, do you miss filming the show? Will you ever reprise the show? No. What do you have to say about that, that's me. He may be on other shows. I mean, you can probably tell we get asked so many questions about the show. I don't really. This is not one of my favorite things to do, but I realize that we get them so much. People want to know. Yeah. And so we don't mind everyone's well answering the question. Well, I tell you the impact I had that. So I met a girl in Iowa and we were signing books and she came to me, she was a college age girl. And she said, I just want to tell you what dies to me. All my teenage years, so her whole high school career, freshman to senior, was the run of the show. And she said, we got together every Wednesday night after church with all my closest friends and watch the show. And when she was telling me this story, it hit me. I thought her whole childhood or I mean her old teenage years, she's going to connect to our show. She'll never forget that. The impact that it was her friends, it was her socially vent of her life. And so when I saw that, I thought, man, there's a lot of people out there that have been impacted more than we know. Well, but I will say this, whenever this comes up, I say the same thing because I believe in 100%. What's refreshing is that Hollywood does not represent middle America shows and the thing, our lifestyle. And so we finally had something and we all know it kind of got on air by accident because they weren't, they didn't want us just to be ourselves and represent middle America. I think the idea was kind of to make fun of us a little bit. I think that's where it started. And but I don't think the show could, I don't think the show would ever air today. I think now with this polarized climate, we couldn't even get on there. So what happened was, and all this day, in the normal making of a show, the talent is threatened. They'll, they call us the talent and their threatened monetarily. But you know, they hadn't met our family. It's like, oh no, we don't. I said so many things about spiritual matters when they would give us those interviews of town. We drive up there, but they never run them. They never, they never ran them. Well, that's me. People always, they're just, they're just didn't like the idea. I wanted to get some, get the gospel out there. But here's where God gets the last. Oh, all we got away with was a prayer and we were more. But here's where God gets the last laugh. But no, I don't want the power of prayer. That's right. Because of that happening though, Deb, even though they never aired it, that's what's created this vehicle for us to be able to, because these are the same folks that are watching. Well, everybody'll run up on, they say the same thing. They say you're way more skinny than you look on TV because TV makes you look better. And you're way more serious. And I'm like, well, every time I was serious or had a spiritual conversation, I knew that wasn't going to make it because the power of editing that, you know, I mean, I goof off some of that. It just sort of graded on me that I would, I wanted to tell people about Jesus. It's all part of the plan. And me, because I think what happened is, is God allowed that to be a success so that later we would have avenues like this to tell what we really believe. And look, we do have a good, we do have a good time because we're not thin skinned, which in our culture, I think is a breath of fresh air. But really, it's because we all truly believe that we're forgiven and that we're going to have them live forever. So we don't take ourselves that seriously. And when you do that, a lot of good times come out of that. I mean, you make fun of each other all the way. I mean, if I didn't, couldn't make fun of Willie, I wouldn't even know. Or relationship with Trump or him or him. Yeah, or him me. And guess what? I can take it. All right. That's all for this edition. Thanks for listening to the Unashamed podcast.
