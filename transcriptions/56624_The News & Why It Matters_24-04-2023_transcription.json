    "text": " Today, nothing really to talk about, just a really slow news day. Oh, wait, Tucker Carlson is out at Fox, and Don Lamont was fired from CNN. All in the same day, how will these ousting shake up mainstream media? We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. Happy Monday. I am Sarah Gonzalez and unless you're living under a rock, you've heard the news. The biggest prime time cable news star, Tucker Carlson, has parted ways with Fox news according to a statement put out by the company, which read, Fox News media and Tucker Carlson have agreed to part ways. We thank him for his service to the network as a host and prior to that as a contributor, Mr. Carlson's last program was Friday, April 21. Fox News tonight will air live at 8 p.m. Eastern starting this evening as an interim show, helmed by rotating Fox News personalities until a new host is named. Curious framing, they agreed to part ways, but if this was a mutual agreement with no hard feelings, why no lead up? No farewell show, no sign off for the last time, no heartfelt words to the audience, just one day here, the next gone. So why get rid of your number one player, the number one player in all of cable news media? So suddenly, when you're at the top of your class, the best of the best and you're saying things the Deep State hates, there are many targets on your back, sure, but interestingly enough, just like to just show you in what ended up being his last show on the air, he ended up blasting the corporate news media for taking advertising money to promote the dangerous COVID vaccines, knowing, of course, that his own network, Fox News, was among those media companies watch. Sometimes you wonder just how filthy and dishonest our news media are. They'll be in the shower and you'll think they're bad, but how bad are they? Well, here's one measure of their badness, you can try this at home, ask yourself, is any news organization you know of so corrupt that it's willing to hurt you on behalf of its biggest advertisers? Anyone who do that is obviously Pablo Escobar level corrupt and should not be trusted. Yikes. Now, being that Tucker was one of the only ones in mainstream news telling the truth about the vaccine, exposing the money laundering scheme that is the proxy war in Ukraine, and just about all the other truths that you're not allowed to say, it's kind of hard to tell. Rumors started flying shortly after the bombshell statement that this must have been a decision attached to Fox's recent $788 million settlement with Dominion voting systems, but former Fox producer Kyle Becker of Becker News stated on Twitter earlier today that he received confirmation this was not in any way related to Dominion, but to Tucker exposing the truth about January 6th. He tweeted out, this just in, Rupert Murdoch is reportedly behind Tucker Carlson being pushed out of Fox News. Murdoch was said to be concerned over Carlson's J6 coverage, the decision is not related to the settlement Fox News agreed to pay Dominion voting systems last week according to a representative for Dominion. Well, if true, I guess it shouldn't be all that surprising. If you're paying attention, Rupert Murdoch's son James gave $20 million to Joe Biden and other progressive groups in the 2020 election. And remember, after Tucker started exposing the truth about January 6th on his show, the swampiest, disingenuous, deep state hack there could ever be Senator Chuck Schumer publicly called on Murdoch to fire Tucker. Watch these lies continue tonight. Rupert Murdoch, who is admitted they were lies and said he regretted it has a special obligation to stop Tucker Carlson from going on tonight. Now that he's seen how he is perverted and slimed the truth and from letting him go on again and again and again. Not because their views deserve such a pro-prium, but because our democracy depends on it. Oh, our democracy depends on it. Well, regardless of the reason one thing is clear, Fox News is no longer relevant here to discuss this and more. My best friend and host of the Chad Prather show, the one and only Chad Prather. Hi, I really do mean that Fox News is no longer relevant. And I hate to use this as a pitch for our own network. But let's. But let's because it's now more than ever. It is so important to remind you guys, cable news TV is dying. Okay, there is no reason to continue to listen to Fox News anymore. Tucker was the only one there willing to tell the truth on a regular basis. We're here telling the truth all the time in case you guys have not subscribed yet, you can go to blazetv.com, use promo code news and you can save some, some moolah, but certainly people are paying a ton of money for cable news. Yeah. I have been saying this for a long time now that you better support independent news makers, opinion havers, these people that you want to listen to because if the Chuck Schumer's of the world have their way, the AOC's of the world will all be silenced. There'll be no platform. I encourage everybody after this show, watch my show because I go into this, some of the stuff I texted you this morning, my opinion on the whole thing. I don't know how much of it's connected actually to Dominion or January 6 or some other things he said about vaccines. I just think that it's an amalgam of all of it, right? It's a combination of things here. And I, we saw Banjino is now gone, Dan Banjino is now gone. Tucker Carlson's gone. We'll see if Jesse Waters is next. I think anybody that in any way hints towards Trump support is gonna be done at Fox. I don't think they're gonna touch Gutfeld because you know, they're not really, they're entertaining people, they're not really really rocking any boats with Gutfeld's show. Did you just burp in the middle of my show? Yeah, a little bit, yeah. The, but I'm a pro. So I just think that what you're gonna see is you're gonna see more establishment pushing on conservative ink, big con. I think you're gonna see more of that type of line up happen and you're right. They're done, they're finished. Fox is no more, they're no longer relevant. Yeah. In regards to anything. Which I think it was, it's so important to note that Glenn saw the writing on the wall. With Fox News, cable TV, we'll get into CNN a little bit being this kind of dying, you know, establishment media and trying to create something like this. And now you see places like Blaze TV, places like Daily Wire, places like Rumble, you know, all of these digital platforms that are really paving the way. So it'll be interesting to see where Tucker goes. Listen, they've made fun of all of this, I get that. And I understand that. Listen, we put ourselves out there as a target. We expect that type of stuff in ridicule to come our way, but we're becoming more and more relevant and important. Just like we've always told you. Now, you know, we've always done this with a level of entertainment to the information of the culture wars that are going on around us. But we're suddenly becoming more and more relevant because again, we're independent. Yeah, yeah, which means we can tell the freaking truth. We're not tied to, you know, Pfizer because our company is paying to promote the code. They're paying our company to promote the COVID vaccine. Right? By the way, our company was the one who filed a FOIA request to find out which conservative platforms were accepting money from the government and from Pfizer to push these COVID vaccines. So we were at the forefront of all of that. By the way, Tucker, call us. Okay, there's a spat for you here at BLEAS TV. So you mentioned AOC pushing to deplatform, you know, people like Tucker and claiming that, you know, Tucker Carlson is inciting violence somehow, which I still can't figure out how she comes to that conclusion in her tiny P-brain. So I wanna play AOC over the weekend, calling for the federal regulation of conservative media while she's talking to, you know, the new view on MSNBC, I guess, but this time it's hosted by the poor man's peppermint patty former White House press secretary, Jen Psaki, watch. Federal regulation in terms of what's allowed on air and what isn't. And when you look at what Tucker Carlson and some of these other folks on Fox do, it is very, very clearly incitement of violence, very clearly incitement of violence. And that is the line that I think we have to be willing to contend with. You know, it's fascinating because she says it's very, very clearly inciting violence. Maybe I'm the dumb one, because I don't see how that actually tracks, but remember it was Chuck Schumer as well, who we played earlier, who said that he needed to be removed from the air because, you know, Tucker Carlson's a threat to democracy, Tucker Carlson's lying about what happened on January 6th. When all he did was show a video of what actually happened, remember Chuck Schumer was invited to come on Tucker Carlson's show to discuss what it was that he was supposedly lying about, and Chuck Schumer said, absolutely not, I won't. They all always are invited on. Adam Schiff back when he were trying to impeach Trump, yet again said he has irrefutable undeniable evidence of Russian collusion and come on the show. Let's talk about it. They never come on the show. Now they'll sit down in an echo chamber with Jen Paseki, and they will talk about this stuff. You're not gonna get any pushback, and if you watch that clip closely, Paseki's reading her notes while AOC's blabbering all about whatever she's talking about. Very clearly, if you say it more times, that means it's so true. And somebody out there in the world is going, oh, it's very clear, it's very clear he was inciting violence. She doesn't back it up with any footnotes. No, they never do. There's nothing. They never do. Give me a sample. Give me an example. I say that all the time to people, to the detractors, to the maceayers, to the doubters, to the critics. Give the example. Let's address it. I will say this. I don't know if you're going here or not today, but you know, Tucker Carlson back March 10th, he was on a podcast where he sat down and he said, I have regrets as a journalist. There are things that I wish I had not been skeptical about, or had been more skeptical about. I wish that rather than calling people names, I had listened and there were things that I got wrong. There were lies that I pushed. You don't hear a journalist do that, not in the mainstream, not ever, ever, ever. And he did it. So you gotta give some credibility there. Yeah, I totally agree. That's why this is so huge for Fox. If this was in fact Fox's decision, such a horrible decision to make. So it's Tucker. It's his executive producer that are both out as the latest reporting at Fox News. And so you talk about how cable news media is changing. And it's not just in the conservative landscape. I mean, I believe conservative media has been permanently altered by Tucker Carlson leaving Fox News. Like this is the catalyst. Yes, this is the catalyst for sure. But over at CNN, things are not going so well for a good friend of the program Don Lamon, who tweeted out earlier this morning. I was informed this morning by my agent that I have been terminated by CNN. I am stunned after 17 years at CNN. I would have thought that someone in management would have had the decency to tell me directly, oh no, at no time was I ever given any indication that I would not be able to continue to do the work I have loved at the network. It is clear there are some larger issues at play. With that said, I want to thank my colleagues and the many teams I have worked with for an incredible run. They are the most talented journalists in the business. Wrong, and I wish them all the best. So very sadly, Don Lamon is gone. By the way, CNN totally contradicted his statement by saying, Now CNN has decided to fact check Don Lamon. Yeah, Don Lamon's statement about this morning's events is inaccurate. He was offered an opportunity to meet with management but instead released a statement on Twitter. And doesn't that sum up the disingenuous nature of Don Lamon just so accurately? And I have to give credit where it's due. Our friend that runs the account for not Kenny Rogers. I won't say his real name because there's a reason he doesn't use it. He made an excellent point on a post today. He said, let's be clear, Don Lamon got fired because no one was watching him. Tucker Carlson got fired because everyone was watching him. Yes, yes. And that's why it's humorous. Yes, yes. That's why this is so insane. These two things are not the same. Well, further, Don Lamon had just a plethora of accusations against him when it comes to being misogynist within the workplace. I mean, we saw some of it on air. He's talking about Nikki Haley being past her prime because we all know. He's past his prime. Apparently he is past his prime. So, you know, it's just, it's really fascinating. I also love that the leftists continue dunking on Tucker Carlson. Whatever he does next is not gonna go out and be the biggest thing ever. It's gonna be bigger than Joe Rogan. He can pick whatever he wants to do. The world is his oyster and somehow they're like, haha, Tucker Carlson's gone from Fox News. I don't know if you saw the clip from The View where they're going, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah, hey, hey, hey. Oh, that's hilarious. Oh, and one of them says, I never wanna celebrate the end of someone's career. But you have no idea what you're talking about yet. I think you plucked a weed. You're about to get a garden baby. I mean, this thing is about to be insanely explosive. He'll have, it depends on how wet route he chooses to take. Whatever he does, he'll be the biggest thing in media. He will, he will. Biggest thing in media. You can't shut that down. Don Lemon, however, I don't think we're gonna be. Yeah, he'll have a little podcast. Yeah, he might take the Brian Stelter out to this. Get a job somewhere. See, that's the thing. And that's the point I want to know. You gotta go to break, but that's the whole deal is, it's not about canceling. He's not gonna get canceled, just like Ann Hiser Bush. They're not gonna get canceled. You're just getting a total lesson. That you're not as important as you think you are, that you can just do anything you wanna do without any repercussion, consequence, or accountability. Right, right. All right, let's go ahead and let's take that quick break. And then I do, we're talking a little bit about the January 6th stuff. I wanna get into the Ray Up story. Very fascinating coverage going on in, again, mainstream media that we're gonna get to next. I wanna thank our sponsor Freedom Project Academy. So, look, if you have your kids in public school, just know they are being taught, left as propaganda, a bunch of pronouns, critical race theory, they're being given sexually explicit books that they can go check out in their school libraries. And the sad thing is they're gonna leave their school not knowing how to do things like read, write, arithmetic. It is so bad, colleges have been dumbing down their courses for years to accommodate the average incoming freshmen who can barely read and write at a seventh grade level. That is why you need to talk to my friends at Freedom Project Academy. They've perfected online learning, they offer live on-demand and homeschool courses for K through 12.

I'm talking about hitting a thumbs up chat. I don't know where your mind went. that you subscribe a comment let us know where do you think Tucker Carlson is going next tell us in the comments below so speaking of Tucker one of the main points that Tucker constantly was making whenever it related to January 6 footage was that we still don't know why Ray Epps the Marine veteran whose actions on January 6 led to claims that he may have been involved a little bit more because we have Ray Epps who is the only person seemingly at the protest seemingly in Washington DC at all at the time of the protest who has somehow skated away from any sort of charges being brought on him even though I would argue he has the most footage evidence against him saying things like let's go to the Capitol let's do this I mean actual evidence if you wanted call someone you know an insider he incited the insurrection that would be the guy that you would hang it all on and somehow magically he has no charges so we're like who is Ray Epps is he involved with the FBI the administration constantly stonewalls this now that we have constant questions about Ray Epps now 60 minutes is somehow running a puff piece about Ray Epps you know and where he goes in and talks about oh well I was a loyal Fox News watcher but now I mean I don't know Tucker Carlson is just obsessed with me and just trying to ruin my life I guess I'm the victim here watch who is Ray Epps that question has animated Fox News host Tucker Carlson for nearly two years Ray Epps he's on video several times encouraging crimes riots breaches of the Capitol Carlson has focused on Epps more than 20 times on his top rated show a half dozen times so far this year he's obsessed with me he's going to any means possible to destroy my life and our lives why to shift blame on somebody else if you look at it Fox News Marjorie Taylor Greene Ted Cruz Gates they're all telling us before this thing that it was stolen so you tell me who has more impact on people than me Epps once a loyal Fox News watcher told us he doesn't understand how he got cast as the villain the Epps version is more mundane they believe the 2020 election had been stolen from Donald Trump and considered January 6th a legitimate protest it was a sloppy election and then the top that off you have talking heads reporting that there's problems with the voting machines and different things like that the election stolen so yeah we had concerns I wanted to be there I wanted to witness this with my own eyes okay so just to be clear because he really is gaslighting the American people right now he says somehow magically it's Marjorie Taylor Greene's fault it's Matt Gates's fault it's it's Tucker Carlson's fault it's all these other people's fault for inciting an insurrection even though he is the one literally inciting an insurrection on camera and somehow he's the victim here watch Ray Epps was never seen committing an act of violence that day or entering the Capitol Epps told us when he saw the violence his fervor to enter the building became a desire to play peacemaker they're not the oh but I appreciate yes and police body cam video backs him up I thought I could stop it so I went back and forth I talked people down and worth the line back and forth step down step down we're good here that kind of thing and I kept it that way for quite some time Oh beautiful you want to get hurt Epps says he left the Capitol grounds to help evacuate an injured man so time I'm gonna stop to free here so magically the footage that they get is a bunch of puff piece footage of Ray Epps pretending to play peacemaker even though what they're mad about is that he has been exposed actually saying we got we got to take this to the Capitol we got to go in we've got to do it this was stolen he's amping people up now all of a sudden he's the victim here and you should feel sorry for him isn't it fascinating that the media has spent two years demonizing every single person who was in Washington DC at the time of the protest and calling for them to be seemingly imprisoned for the rest of their lives I guess they want the book thrown at all of these people you had the QAnon shaman who they were like he oh my gosh he was holding a spear no idiot that was just a flag but you know they want these people throw them away lock them up throw away the key for all of them but somehow this one gets to go on 60 minutes and do an exclusive interview and this so happens to be the one that doesn't add up at all that we have all of these questions that by the way have never been answered yeah well and then there's a lot I mean he's got a text message to his son saying I his nephew or is nephew I mean or I orchestrated this he sure did orchestrate this and so it's convenient that they've got these oh step back step back I was not there for January 6 I was here in this studio when it all went down as were you two weeks prior to that I wasn't Washington DC and a couple of times prior to January 6 I had made visits to Washington DC for various protests I was there want to see what was going on but I was not there for January 6 you know how many people over these last three years have criticized me and said that I was there planning an insurrection helping people organize for January 6 they've tried to make me go I wasn't even there do you know how many people we know I'm talking to the viewers and the listeners how many people you and I know that were there people who are in jail to this day without charge we don't even know where they are being held in confinement in maximum security prisons in solitary confinement we don't know where they are and they're over here and he's going Tucker Carlson's obsessed with me why yeah by your definition anyone that was there and I'm talking to the re-reason on the left the progressive crazies anybody that was there on January 6 I don't care if you're being in the woods or homeless person you were part of the insurrection if you were in Washington DC within a five-mile radius of the capital you were an insurrectionist okay and now Ray Epps Ray Epps is so somehow getting some kind of free pass and then you go on Twitter and you see the same wild-eyed leftist crazy re-reprogressive nut jobs out there who are called for everybody to beat nothing short of a guillotine in the streets those people are defending Ray Epps yeah so you have to sit back and go what the hell is going on because you're willing to completely throw out the script and flip-flop it for this one guy now ask yourself critically ask yourself why the hell is this happening why is it happening what are they trying to pull over your eyes because this is deceptive I mean think about it Donald Trump who they claim incited an insurrection said go let your voices be heard peacefully and patriotically he posted on Twitter and they accused him of all sorts of things he's a traitor he should be locked up I mean just now they're so excited about him being indicted and arrested because they want what they think is going to be somehow some sort of vengeance for the darkest day in democracy history that's how much they care about inciting an insurrection yeah Ray Epps is like yeah hey but I orchestrated it I told people to go there and he's given a pass because he claims oh well I meant I just directed people to the Capitol so nobody else gets that excuse so ask yourself why ask yourself why the mainstream media now is willing to be the man who has the most evidence against him that he instigated this said himself he instigated it now all of a sudden is is having the media do puff pieces making him making you feel sorry for him there's only one reason that makes sense one only one that's right that's right in CBS is going to show you the clips of him walking by going hey you don't want to get hurt they don't want to get hurt let's keep everybody they just happen to have the camera they're filming him keeping the piece almost like a fed you know and then he at a strategic moment before the Capitol was breached he had to leave to take care of an injured person amazingly convenient see this is why we are accused of being conspiracy theorists because when you put this kind of crap out there and it doesn't map out by the syllogism in my head and philosophically you can't make you know two or two equal four and then you happen to have the cameras there in 60 minutes is gonna run a little story like this you have to fill in the gaps somewhere and be like this doesn't make sense it doesn't line up right well I mean I just like to say Operation Mockingbird is alive and well in 2023 clearly if you don't know what that is look at all right we got to go to break first when I think our sponsor relief factor so if you are one of millions Americans who just live in pain you might think this is just kind of life now you just go through pain like kind of in a bad mood kind of grouchy because you hurt all the time don't live like that I know this to be true I had a car accident a while back and I suffer with a whole bunch of disc problems in my back so I understand how it is when you're just in constant pain I also understand how it is when you can get out of that pain because relief factor has worked for me it's a great way to reduce pain and what it does is it reduces the inflammation in your body in your joints and when you take it as directed it could absolutely change your life it's natural it's not a drug it was developed by doctors who you know they realized hey if we can target the inflammation you don't have to take the topical cream that's gonna you know only last 10 minutes you don't have to take all of the the medicine that is really not good for your body and has side effects 70% of the people who keep who take this three week quick start that I'm gonna offer you they keep ordering it because it works that is the majority of people if you're living in pain try the three week quick start it's 1995 it's a trial pack you can go to relief factor.com that is relief factor.com bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly almost 100

And Heiser Bush said it had placed two executives who oversaw a Bud Light collaboration with Dylan Mulvaney on leave this is of course Alyssa Heiner Schneider Heiner Schneider Heiner Schneider third time's a charm this is VP of marketing Alyssa Heiner shied she obviously was the brains behind the lovely very very beautiful Dylan Mulvaney collab with Bud Light now the funniest thing about this to me was that these weren't even cans that like we you or I could go by they weren't even available it was just it was only made for Dylan Mulvaney to celebrate his 365th day of girlhood which we all know does not exist but that's fine and then they promoted a paid sponsorship between Dylan Mulvaney and the company to promote March Madness which was also really dumb because no one who cares about Dylan Mulvaney is watching March Madness and vice versa which Dylan Mulvaney admitted in the paid partnership because he made a joke that he didn't understand what March Madness was until he was paid by Bud Light to promote it you can't make this stuff up so she is unfortunately gone as well as her boss Daniel Blake that many muscular men running around in shorts and tank tops I promise you Dylan Mulvaney knows exactly what March Madness is and so they're both gone the company announced this on Sunday and they look here's what I can tell you and Heiser Bush has said given the circumstances Alyssa has decided to take a leave of absence which we support Daniel has also decided to take a leave of absence but there are some people familiar with the matter who say that the decision to take a leave was not voluntary which I can imagine look here's the thing for me it doesn't even necessarily have to be like oh those conservatives they won we can't give into them because of the boycott she genuinely you just really suck at your job if you think that this is a good demographic for Bud Light drinkers like just based on the decision alone nothing to do with the fallout from conservatives who said screw this we're buying something else you should be fired just on that decision alone true or false true there's a lot of really bad examples I could come with you know the blaze TV suddenly wanted to march the Proud Boys out there and say you know this like that would be stupid marketing right so so you go yeah we tend to be a little conservative leaning let's see how far out there we can go in terms of the public's perception of what people on the right look like right so what they did was they said we're going to take a woke marketing campaign and we're going to go to the extreme now anizer bush is like many things it's a man brand right if they could lose all of their female Bud Light drinkers they really haven't touched their demographic okay it's a man brand so what you see and people say well their stock is holding at a 52 week high I'm sorry that you don't understand how the stock market works but they're still losing money right people are not drinking their product they're not buying their product okay and I'm driving me you and I we've seen it firsthand like we've been out around places having dinner what do we ask people when we go places and it's like you see it in the stores I mean they're like you and I we know all the bartenders around we ask them yes and they're very emphatic they're like oh no but what you saw happen and this is something I'm proud of because again I'm not into cancel culture I'm not into boycotting I've never called for a boycott except maybe once years ago when I had something to say about the NFL but even that was you know I anyway well you put a hurt on the bottom line or you wouldn't be seeing these actions being taken right which by the way is not cancel culture or point of course it's not it's not it's what I said earlier it's consequences you cram something down somebody's throat no pun intended but you did it and we push back now since it's a man brand what you see is men have stood up and said with our dollars we are not going to buy your woke crap that is actually an exploitation of women so I'm proud of that I'm waiting on the feminists to do the same thing I'm waiting on the pink hat wearing you know parade marchers who claimed the hashtags to stand up and say you know what we're not going to be replaced by a biological male either they've yet to do that because she's still doing I say she he is still I was thinking a hydraside when I said it but Dylan Mulvaney who is very much a he trust me it's still doing tampack still doing all the beauty marketing all of the makeup all the different brands that I don't even know you know why because I'm a man brand myself but I know that he's still doing those things and he'll continue to do that until the women stand up now the men have stood up I think we've proven that with Anheuser-Busch yeah yeah oh of course well I mean especially you mentioned the makeup I think Maybelline is his latest partnership with Maybelline Foundation which by the way for those of you wondering you can get makeup at americanbeautybysera.com and you can know that we don't pander to men this is a exclusively women promoted company what's that website again American Beauty by Sarah with noh noh.com and by the way I probably shouldn't announce it but I will just because we're on the subject we are we are in very heavy R&D for foundation mascara blush all of it so that should be coming you know as soon as we can get it to you and know what I love you know what I love pretty women I just I'm just saying I think women are beautiful I really do I do not like women with a five-clock shadow really I don't do you like women with a penis I don't at all really I don't at all in fact I don't know who made the meme but it is genius whatever whenever they said who's gonna be filling in for Tucker Carlson and I there was a picture of Dylan Mulvaney it said Tucker Johnson again that's funny that is funny but I do think it is important to know I think that it's worth repeating cancel culture is when you call for someone's job you call for their head because of something that they said or did I didn't hear anyone calling for her for her job to be removed I heard people saying you know what we're not going to support a company with our hard-earned dollars and we're just going to stop buying the beer that is not cancel culture and that's not I would say boycott culture I guess you could call it a personal boycott and a decision that you're making of where you put your money you and I a cancel culture thing you and I have mocked and ridiculed because I think that's what you're supposed to do we've mocked and ridiculed the people at the top we've done that okay now the people that I feel sorry for and I've been very outspoken about this the people that 18,000 workers the 40,000 distributors that are out there those people who potentially lose because of something that a dummy up at the top of the pyramid did and made a decision on I've had a lot of people come at me on social media saying oh you're attacking this company it's the people it's the it's the rank and file that are going to get hurt I don't think they are in this but again this is why we have to call this out because you know what if they'll do it everybody will do it and then every quote rank and file hard working backbone of America blue collar worker that does enjoy a beer at the pub on Friday night after a hard week's work they're going to suffer too right right which by the way remember people like look I love Donald Trump jr but he was wrong on this one he was wrong on this one he said but they contributed to big con well so he said you know give Bud Lyda pass that's you know don't well look what we've achieved now right we've taught them a lesson into all of the distributors I feel for them too if they are impacted but I would hope that they would recognize the importance of teaching these companies a lesson I think this was a very very important lesson not just for Bud Lyd but for all of the other companies who are looking at that going oh I mean believe it or not I've I've got some friends who are very mad at me for being outspoken on this issue and I've said over when do you hold somebody accountable now I'm sorry that your job could potentially be affected by this but again if you don't hold anizer bush accountable they're one of the biggest of the biggest and they're uncancelable basically you can't get rid of them they're always going to be a staple in the world what's next right forward Chevy Dodge who's next what big corporation is out there is going to make that decision and we're just going to sit there let them all do it so the lesson to be learned here kids is hold the line it works all right lesson here is don't put the camera on me I'm gonna put some more coffee in my cup okay all right we gotta go to break bye it's like put it on him put it on him cnm cut a promo on gun ownership and I think they were like accidentally based on this I don't think it was intentional they followed two single females living in the city they're trying to keep themselves safe from like the growing crime that we see happening in all of these cities because of democrat policies and this is Jen and Shelby who didn't want their last names used they said that they are you know they're looking to protect themselves but it's actually kind of fun to shoot the guns watch meet Jen and Shelby why can't I get it they don't want their last names used they are friends colleagues gun enthusiasts what gun or guns you know I have a Ruger and a Rossi both rifles both from Long Island New York City adjacent both professionals Jen has her permit but is yet to buy a handgun and why do you want to buy a handgun I've been wanting to buy one for years I'm also someone that lives alone for a couple of years now so probably for safety mostly but I do enjoy coming to the ranges and shooting she's trying them out seeing which one is the best fit for her Shelby like many Americans made the decision to arm up during the pandemic do you feel safe for having a gun I do why because I'm not sure the chaos is over and I just feel like a lot of people have guns and it would be good to have on a single female I live on my own so that will why not protect myself do you feel safer owning a gun yes why why why why why why do you think we're in here why do you think we're in this building right now that's the whole point these guys in the media these talking heads man they are just they really think you're dumb they really do well and they do but I think they also they live in these bubbles for so long that they don't understand the average American is like yeah I live in Chicago and I just want to live yeah I just saw that woman trying to get into her apartment the other night and they just take that gang of teams just beat the hell out of her right right and and gosh why do you feel safe for owning a gun well under the Biden administration and all of these uh Soros DAs all of the criminals are literally being released into the streets so yeah I'm gonna feel a little safer with a gun she says she lives outside of New York City right and that would hurt and Eric Adams is focused on making sure that you have a guinea pig ban you can't own a guinea pig or a gun but the rapes and the homicides and the murders are up in Manhattan oh yeah you've got a new that was last week he's got a guinea pig band they're putting a putting a stop on the guinea pigs you can bring like the animal city that little pet yeah why yeah man I don't know okay this is like back in the 70s and 80s when they're flushing I don't know alligators and now suddenly they were in the sewers or something I don't know it's a guinea pig invasion in New York Eric Adams though he's the mayor for our times man it's just a crime invasion in New York yeah and then Alvin Bragg who's reducing everything to a slap on the wrist misdemeanor and turning violent criminals out on the streets and but yet he's gonna send an indictment for you know DJT it is it is fascinating as well because you know you'll notice you keep hearing from the left the rhetoric is clearly you can always spot the people who have never shot a gun in their lives who know nothing about guns because they talk about well the problem is that we have to ban semi-automatic weapons in this country that little handgun that she had right there that she said she was considering for protection for herself those are semi-automatic guys that's that's a semi-automatic and they they do sometimes they say rifles but they'll say no we have to ban semi-automatic and semi-automatic weapons I love that little Henry repeater that she was shooting there on her shoulder that little rifle that's a great little gun and but then but then the left will say well why would you ever need that rifle yeah why would you I mean somebody walked into my house the other day and um and they went past one of my closets and they stopped and they backed up and the light was only they go you have a lot of guns well I'm trying to pick up a Shelby and a gin all right well now's the time we need to go to break we'll be right back just like Jen Paulie yesterday three members of Antifa were arrested outside of Fort Brewery and pizza this is in Fort Worth Texas not too far from here it's just that they held it family friendly drag show which of course isn't family friendly at all and Antifa had to show up acting all tough and um well I'm just gonna tell you it did not go well for them watch the only time I've ever seen the police actually arrest them good bye that's Megan bye she gone oh he's screaming for help that's so cute help it is still Fort Worth in some places anyway watch his little stand so god bless Fort Worth PD the person doesn't play oh we've got all of them for you I wanted to give shout outs to all of these Antifa members who constantly give me grief whenever I show up to make my voice heard at these events call themselves anti-fascist when they are actually the opposite because they are trying to shout down and intimidate anyone from speaking so I wanted to give a shout out to Samuel Folks here you know I mean they're they always have the black mask over their faces so I wanted to make sure everyone knew who they were baby yeah Megan Grant who is just lovely reminds me of Danny DeVito when he played the penguin and of course Chris Gillitt who is the leader of Antifa in Dallas they are still sadly for them raising money for bail and they're so cool yeah in custody so as you said Chad I want to see them Bafo I want to see if I'm Facebook friends with any of those people who is a long time Fort Worth residents I don't know yeah I don't live in Fort Worth I don't live in Fort Worth they came in they came in they don't live there and they found out very quickly that Fort Worth police don't play Tarrant County and Jacking around me no so I a moment of silence for them okay we're done we'll see you guys tomorrow stream and subscribe to more blaze media content
