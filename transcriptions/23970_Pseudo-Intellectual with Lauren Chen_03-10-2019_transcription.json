    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. I'm Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. Big thank you to everyone watching us and a huge thank you especially to the people who are tuning in live. We have an interesting show today. We're going to be starting off with the teacher who got fired for not just misgendering someone but refusing to use a specific set of pronouns. That's an interesting one. Then we have a fake hate crime because we haven't had enough of those in our society. Next we have an entire segment about Tim Poole's dating prospects. I'm not kidding. We're going to be talking about that for a little while. Hi to Tim if he's out there and we're going to be finishing off the show with essentially a discussion about the church of climate change. Crazy times we live in and before we get started though I just want to say that if anyone would like to support the show like share subscribe that whole spiel really does help us out.

We're not on patreon anymore so if you want to help us keep the lights on over here that's how you do it and for anyone who's watching live don't forget we will be going through all of the super chats not during the first hour of the show but afterwards we'll do a little Q&A thing. And of course we have lovely mugs to show you now which if you wanted to get them not only do you support us but you have something cool to drink your coffee out of you can go to shop.theblaze.com also shirts yeah and shirts I was actually wearing one of the pseudo intellectual shirts earlier which I mean it's kind of weird because it has my name but I like the shirt but then I accidentally used the pseudo intellectual mug and I was going to use the blaze mug so I was like it's too much. Do you see what goes into the thought process of sets and what have you? Yeah you know I think about these things. I do feel betrayed that you change your shirt because we just pre-filmed an episode and I've only got the one shirt now so now I'm in two episodes with the same shirt. I think you just don't have shirts. It's but hey maybe it'll be more inclined to buy the merch to be like hey I gotta help this guy get some clothes but I thought we were in solidarity as the point and here she is backstabbing me I mean what the heck. I mean like I'm good with self promotion but I feel like two articles in one shot of my own name on myself is a bit much. A little bit narcissistic but hey. Yeah all right so let's get into this. We've talked about the whole pronoun issue before we've talked about it in full training. Schools before this is kind of like the the epitome of that I just learned about this story recently. So there's a teacher who is fired from his job for refusing to use the new pronouns of a trans student so he's now suing his former school for violating his religious freedoms. There there's more to the story than that we have an article here from NBC News. Virginia teacher Sue school after being fired for not using transgender students pronouns. The article reads a Virginia high school teacher who was fired for refusing to use a transgender students preferred pronouns has filed a lawsuit against school officials and the board. Peter Vlaming or Vlaming sorry if I'm getting that wrong. Who was a French teacher at West Point High School said he was fired because he would not use pronouns such as him and his to refer to a female student who was transitioning to male. According to the suit filed Monday using the male pronouns would have violated Vlaming's conscience and went against his religious beliefs. So we called the student by his preferred name during class and avoided avoiding using pronouns altogether which I mean to me would have sound like a solution to the problem. Yeah. Apparently not. When the school found out administrators told Laming to either use male pronouns or risk losing his job. The suit also states that blaming was accused of using female pronouns when discussing the student to other people and during one incident in class. Vlaming referred to the student as her. Blaming acknowledged the incident saying that it was unintentional and he addressed it with the student after class according to the lawsuit. The suit states that on multiple occasions, Laming explained his religious beliefs to administrators but was still told that by refusing to use male pronouns he was violating the school board's policy. Defendants did not have any written policy regarding using pronouns. Defendants made up an uncompromising interpretation of their policies to compel Mr. Vlaming to take sides in an ongoing public debate regarding gender dysphoria and use pronouns that express an objectively untrue ideological message the suit reads. Okay. So obviously I don't know this professor but from what I can gather about the story he is a I think Christian man who was trying in every way he could think of possible to make the situation work without compromising his own beliefs. So there was a little a little video that went along with the story which I have included here but he talks about he wasn't dead naming or using the wrong pronouns really I mean he did accidentally apparently when she wasn't there or when the person in question was not there. But he apologized to that. He was an accident apparently right so seems to me like someone who doesn't want to violate his moral compass but also was making a really good effort to be respectable. And he talked about that when he was interviewed he said that he doesn't want to be provocative or he doesn't want to offend anyone either so that was his compromise and I think it's something that Ben Shapiro I think follows a similar rule too. He doesn't like to use these pronouns but he says all right you know if you're this is your name that's what I'll call you I just want to use pronouns altogether because I don't want you to feel like I'm disrespecting you. It kind of seems like we're at the point now where it's not enough to just go against saying the pronouns. Yeah to abstain you have to actively participate or else that's discrimination. Yes the whole like it's just like the compelled speech thing in Canada that that got the Jordan Peterson thing you know up and running because basically it was the exact same thing where you have to use certain language and that's what I mean this isn't federally mandated it seems which in Canada it was but yeah I think this is just this is the school board's this is the school birth policy it sounds like. Yeah and one of the administrators was actually discussing how by even though he didn't use the wrong pronouns for the student by not using any pronouns like he uses pronouns for other students that in and of itself was discrimination so I mean they're making it really really hard to not buy into this so this isn't the type of situation where you can just say eh not for me I'm going to stay out of it because I know we get a lot of comments anytime we talk about this trans issue oh wow it doesn't really affect you just stay out of it live and let live these are not people who are happy to live and let live like you that only works if it applies both ways if both parties agree to a you know last say fair you do what I do I do non-aggression principle etc like these people aren't happy enough with that and that's why it's important to talk about. They will attack your livelihood you know they will come after you. This guy fired and I think the suit is asking for a million dollars worth in damages which I want people to be made an example of frankly at this point to show that you can't just fire a teacher who has gone out of his way to kind of do what he can to make the suit uncomfortable and you know the whole thing about them finding out he didn't use any pronouns I'm kind of curious as to how that even happened to begin with because I personally when someone's talking to me I don't really notice whether they use pronouns to refer to me as not or not versus just my first name so right right I don't even know how this came about. Yeah I mean I guess that some of our more libertarian inclined viewers would say well maybe this was a private school board then don't they have the right to fire these people and I don't know I don't know if it was private or public personally but what do you what do you think about that if it was private do you think that they should have the right to do that kind of thing or do you think that this is something that's that is ridiculous and should just not be well I think if it's public they definitely do not like this is ridiculous I take great issue with that but if it's private look you can have mandatory pronoun laws whatever in a private school as long as you don't complain about you know anytime a Catholic school says we'd rather not have teachers that are gay married right so it's like fine hypothetically this is private school they can do what they want but I would want some sort of like reciprocity there for the the Christian schools the religious schools that are out there which we don't see coming from the progressive left right now so you can't eat your cake and have it too as the saying goes which is the correct order for anyone who's going to correct me I'm actually right here. That's all that makes sense. Yeah it's true. Yeah so I think it's also this is a good instance of what non-discrimination looks like to different groups right now because right now the trans lobby LGBT lobby is saying no this trans student was being discriminated against she should be protected whereas this teacher who's a Christian is saying no hang on a second I'm the one who's being discriminated against I should be protected so the difference here is that the Christian teacher is saying hey actually and I'm not even sure if he is Christian he might be Jewish or something so yeah it doesn't matter if it could be an idiot for all we know and he might just think it's a moral to have this true you know that child transitioning maybe so so so what the teacher is saying for wanting his religious freedom to not be violated it did not be discriminated against he's saying hey please don't fire me I won't say this but I won't make a big deal out of it so his position is like you know I'll I'll try to do my best to do this but please don't make me say this whereas the LGBT lobbyists in asserting that they're being discriminated against are saying hey you have to refer to me this way so it's kind of like positive versus negative rights here yeah all all the teachers saying hey don't make me compelled to do this like don't force me to do this yeah that's how you don't discriminate against me whereas the LGBT side of this is saying you must say this or else you're discriminating against me which I think is a really interesting interesting way to contrast that and I don't like frankly there's no way to reconcile those two opinions like there really isn't right if your rights include people having to refer to you a certain way I don't know how you how you manage that without acknowledging that you are being an authoritarian I think that they're perfectly happy with being an authoritarian at this point yeah I mean I don't think they care I don't think they care at this point I think that they think even using words like liberty as a dog whistle to them right now apparently free speech as well yeah another dog whistle yeah as we learned this weekend in particular right so and what's kind of scary about this is that this isn't the first time a teacher has faced consequences for refusing refusing to violate their principles in the name of this kind of transgender ideology this is a story that was from a while ago but it's really relevant now from the federalist we have this article school punishes male teacher for refusing to watch a naked girl in the boys locker room a florida school district allowed a self-described transgender female student regular access to the boys locker room okay I think they mean transgender male so biologically female great yeah that's my understanding with no advance warning to the boys or their parents the first time she walked in she caught boys literally with their pants down causing them embarrassment and concern by the fact that they had been observed changing by an obvious girl says a complaint letter to Pascale County school district from Liberty Council a pro bono constitutional law firm with a gag order school administrators forbade teachers from talking about the change and ordered a male pe teacher to supervise the potentially undressed girl in the chasco middle school locker room the letter says when he refused to knowingly place himself in a position to observe a minor female in the nude or otherwise in a state of undress administrators told him he will be transferred to another school as discipline for not doing your job in the locker room so this almost feels like entrapment I feel like I feel for this perfect like for this teacher they're telling him unless you stand in this room and potentially watch a underage biological girl get undressed you're gonna face consequences like what is the winning situation there only moly poor guy sounds like honestly the best thing happened to impossible go to a different school hopefully the administrators there have a couple brain cells yeah and you know he doesn't have to because that is a situation that could get very hairy I can imagine yeah I mean what are you supposed to do and what's concerning is that this isn't just happening like the first story with the teacher being fired that's in Virginia this case was in Florida this isn't just like New York and California where this is happening right this is kind of seeping into all these school districts so tragic it really is and these people the people who run these school boards a lot of the time they just kind of fly under the radar parents are busy they don't really know what's going on which is fair enough but you if you have a child in a public school or even a lot of private schools now you really cannot afford to not keep up with this and it's it's so scary because a lot of the times like they've mentioned these changes are put into place without kind of any discussion any warning it's just these bureaucrats who are like let me just slide this into our rules and this is where your kids are every day and they control what they're taught you know it is it is kind of dystopian and you have to be very much on your guard as to what's going on with your kids in these programs yeah and we've said it before on the show said again homeschooling if possible of course it's not possible for everyone but the assumption that your children are just being sent off to get a ideologically free education that's wrong like that's objectively wrong so I guess it's up to you to decide how you feel about this when it comes to the teacher who's suing the the school or the school board I hope he wins I mean I don't I don't know if there's been a similar case to that in the u.s. because I mean again he's not dead naming her he's not using the wrong pronouns he's just refusing to use the correct pronouns which is it's absolutely compelled speech I hope he does well and this is we mentioned this in the Daniel Cone case with the father getting trying to get custody of that Rembuktus daughter who's on Instagram at a very young age these are cases where I'm sure people would be happy to crowd fund legal fees if need be because it's ridiculous yeah I mean to me that kind of sucks because if he does win like the school board we'll lose money yeah what's translates him to teachers and and students you know getting less but the people that which is like everybody loses that situation but I think I think those people need to be fired they need to be held in the house that's what's really important here and I do think that the teacher should get some kind of justice it's just a tough situation all around it well I don't think it's a tough situation I think that he should be given the money because he's absolutely been harmed and damaged and then I think like the city or town that when they're looking at the end of the year their bottom line and they're out a million bucks I think they should look exactly to these administrators and say hey guys you cost us a lot of money here you're fired I think that's like that would be a perfect situation it would also show people in the future that you can't do this to educators right these people didn't sign up to be I don't know subjected to any particular type of idea this is a French teacher he teaches like I don't know middle school or high school French why the heck is he being dragged into this crazy gender nonsense makes no sense okay so our next story is about the fake hate crime was it I think earlier this week that the story originally broke a few days ago it might have been over the weekend I'm not sure but there's a reason yeah so there was a story that got a lot of attention a lot yeah there it is September 27th okay yeah so earlier this week some white school boys had allegedly held down one of their female black classmates and cut her dreadlocks while saying racist things and so when this leaked everyone is freaking out a huge major mainstream media networks did stories about this and I just want to say any form of racism or bullying racist bullying put it together like that's wrong and of course the incident would have been terrible what made the story interesting though I think for a lot of people was how quickly it was politicized like immediately yeah well I mean I mean this definitely when I when I heard about this I only heard about it after certain facts had already come to light but it was like this sounds like a caricature of a situation in my opinion it's like everything is perfect it's like a leftist sweat dream you know this is what happened at a Christian school as well it happened at a Christian school wasn't it actually related to to Mike Pence's right in fact it was because and that was part of the way that it was politicized we have this tweet out from raw story with people a lot of people took issue with they said white boys attacked classmate and cut off her dreadlocks at school where Mike Pence's wife teaches so you know a lot of people were saying okay seems like a bit of a non sequitre like what exactly like are you saying that Mike Pence's wife she was supervising the by the way she was making sure that they got all the dreadlocks notice it doesn't really make any sense to like not only are you trying to like pull in I think Karen Pence is her name yeah I'm wrong about that but you're also pulling in her husband so it's like we're six degrees of separation from an allegedly racist hate crime and so I just don't think that the president of like considering how many crimes are committed by students in inner city schools right trying to link teachers to anything that happens or that their students do it's just it's just not good and so in response to that tweet we had a ton of people saying this is wrong like what are you doing obviously there's nothing connected to this but we also had some people who were like yeah you know what I could tell this there the Pence is definitely responsible for that we have an example of this here so one person says aggravated assault with a deadly weapon hate crime this is not the first time racial assaults have been committed at this school okay I don't know if that's true like no citation there whatsoever but he says and no protests from Mrs. or Mr. Pence we must conclude they approve what like what some some problems with the premises there yeah no I have issues with that and I this kind of mentality it frustrates me all the time and I see it from people when we've had we've interviewed someone at some point or like we did a video about soap and how she was banned and I had people saying but what about this thing she said years ago and has since apologized for and you don't even like necessarily condone her viewpoints but like you must because you didn't like what no that this is ridiculous like even if this story was true which we're getting to in just a second it was not Mrs. Pence's fault and it definitely wasn't Mike Pence's fault in fact actually I think you could trace this all the way back to the president himself probably Trump because he chose him as he chose Mike Pence yeah so I think that just freaks of Trump is it does it really does it's a systemic problem yeah and I mean to illustrate how much the story was being hyped up by people kind of made into almost like a coveting coveting the catholic 2.0 or Jesse Smollett thing we even had Rashida Tlaib tweeting about this saying you are beautiful Amari Allen which was the little girl in question who got her haircut you are courageous and strong you are loved you see Amari you may not feel it now but you have a power that threatens their core core core of the evil white voice yeah what power is that's weird I can't wait to watch you use it and thrive stay strong like again I'm against bullying so if it were just you know politicians coming together say hey kids don't bully I think that's an important message especially in the age of social media but this was absolutely like racially motivated I don't think she would be saying a peep if this were like a white student who had just gotten bullied by either black kids or black kids kids bully kids it's like a universal truth yeah and this tweet is actually still up which is funny in relation to the fact that the latest revelation about the story is that apparently it didn't happen little girls come forward and say said yeah this wasn't true which is I mean there was actually a police investigation being launched into this but from the Washington Post Virginia sixth grader now says she falsely accused classmates of cutting her hair the sixth grade girl at a private Virginia school who accused three classmates last week of forcibly cutting her hair now says the allegations were false according to the statements from the girls family and the principal at Emmanuel Christian school in Springfield the 12 year old who is African-American said three white male students held her down in a school playground a week ago during recess covered her mouth called her insulting names and used scissors to cut her hair so I mean I appreciate that the girl has come forward and said it's not true and also the family the family of the little girl have also released a statement saying that they apologize for for all of the controversy that's been caused around this and right now there are a lot of people who are being very harsh on the student this girl who made up the whole thing and obviously making up lies about someone is awful especially I'm not sure exactly okay so she sixth grade so 11 or 12 years old you know at that point that it's wrong to do that and but what should these ideas for I guess that's that's what that's what I find disturbing is that there's a culture for necessarily been the parents doesn't need to be the parents but there's definitely some kind of something that gave her that idea and we just this of course everybody will draw the immediate parallel of this did just see smolier um situation the small situation that happened in Chicago where it was the same thing where you had this situation that was so obviously a caricature right like like you know back like he would he walked around with a new surround his neck they left it on it was this was ridiculous and in this case too it's like you have these three white boys white bully boys that hold down this one white girl in a Christian school black girl in a Christian school pardon me and cut her dreadlocks off in a hateful manner it's like it's too bad to be true yeah you know it just is yeah you're right it wasn't true and obviously like I do think there should be repercussions for lying about this because like I said there was a police investigation that was going to be conducted so these boys could have gone to juvenile hell or something like that it could have been really really serious for them because people like despite what some may think we don't live in a racist society and that kind of thing is not tolerated of course not um but I also want to say that kids do lie like this is a thing that happens it's not good but like 11 12 year old me I was saying stuff and what I'm imagining is that this little girl probably had an existing beef with those boys and wanted to get back at them but but more importantly I think I think that even more importantly is that she could have gotten so much attention for it yeah and that's true and kids do like attention as well everybody does you know but that's she got national attention she got Rashida Tlaib tweeting about her right I mean and if Obama had been in office no I wouldn't have been surprised yeah absolutely so I don't want to condone the little girl's behavior but at the same time this is a thing that happens kids lie who I think we should all be upset about the most are the race baiters who immediately jumped on the story and tried to make it into a nationalist yeah and tried to make it an allegory for racial relations in our society as a whole like that to me is what's kind of more messed up and those are adults because okay let's say for a second that this did happen and besides being like sat in and that rage maybe she gets like a go fun me or something like what was the the point of bringing this much attention to it yeah and I mean okay maybe we just if we put on the colorblind glasses for a second you know maybe it was just an instance of bullying and maybe or maybe she was annoying and they were really and they were asses and kids fight and they fight and then you know whatever it doesn't like so I think that yeah the people that picked this up and made it into a something that justifies their world use something that justifies they're the one who I would be mad about rather than this little girl like yeah yeah obviously she made a mistake but she is yeah but yeah ultimately it's like whatever it's like you're you're basing your entire story is off of something that a 12 year old said you need to rethink your choices especially the the people who are trying to connect it to Karen Pence and Mike Pence like what are you doing with raw story that tweet where they say that a you know girl cut or girls dreadlocks cut by white classmates school that Karen Pence teaches that that tweet is still up in fairness I mean they have corrected the story that it links to but the tweet itself is still up and there are so many people out there who this story like they'll never see the correction and they'll just have it in the back of their mind oh yeah Mike Pence Mike electrics Pence is at it again yeah he's cutting dreadlocks off of little black girl like I know there are people but that will be the takeaway that they get from it incredible isn't it yeah and it's like I don't blame the little girl for that I don't know how like what was going on in her mind but I think we have an irresponsible media who's looking to push a certain narrative and anytime they see a story that kind of fits to it they're gonna jump and I think this story also displays a ton of hypocrisy on the part of the progressive left because we just went through this whole thing this past weekend in Hamilton Ontario okay you guys may have heard about it but there was a Dave Rubin event with Maxine Bernier and Tifa was there and Tifa was protesting we got some footage of a a guy ripping a someone's MAGA hat off got tackled by the place it was a whole thing I think there were four people who were ultimately arrested it was not a peaceful event it was violent and you know there's that footage of and Tifa yelling and kind of harassing this poor little old lady that's now gone by oh my god I love the optics of that video like they couldn't look they couldn't look like like more evil people they know it's not that they look like that that is them no you're right I mean I just something I burst out laughing when I saw them yelling at her and then as she moves up they take a step into blocker even yeah are you serious right now it's ridiculous you know and what what people were also bringing up was like hang on she's going to the event you don't know if she's a PPC supporter and Dave Rubin fan you don't know if she's going because you know her her granddaughter wanted her to go or she's like the family of one of the you don't know why she's there you're still calling her a Nazi even if she was there for the like still doesn't make her a Nazi but people were kind of really coming down hard on antifa for what happened at the event which they absolutely are right to do because it was disgusting I was ashamed to see that happen in Canada because no fence Americans I'm used to you guys acting crazy I like to think that here in Canada we're we're just not like that for better or worse because I think we're a bit too apathetic but we're polite that's like our thing just so to see people acting like fools it was disgraceful but you had so many leftists downplay that like I saw so many people even when we posted our own footage of that guy assaulting the guy with the mag like oh were there people yelling yeah and he feels such a problem like oh no were there were there people throwing milkshakes at you like all those terrorists and their milkshakes like really making a mockery out of the fact that antifa are an organized group of political radicals yeah who consistently target even violently their political opponents and who are intent on depriving them of freedom to congregate and speak their mind like this is serious okay this is like a whole like essentially international network because there are antifa events in Europe Canada US they're everywhere so compare that this kind of dismissive attitude to the absolute I don't know fervor over this fake story of one little girl getting her dreadlocks cut by some of her classmates or even you know one white guy one white teenager smirking at an aid of american so it's like I'm sorry but I don't take your dismissal of antifa very seriously because it's like there's there's a blatant double standard there and I don't think these people even care about it they're not ashamed about it like they're happy to freak out on these actual lone wolf incidents but when it comes to organize extreme leftism they don't say anything and you know right wing terrorism does happen not very often but on occasion it does and it's been deadly before and I'm fine with condemning it when it does because I don't support that but I don't see why so many on the left don't feel the same way about antifa I just don't get it so anyway long story short that that story was false in case you saw it on social media all right so next up we're talking about Tim Poole's dating prospects yeah and we all right yay this is like the bachelor political commentary youtube edition yeah oh my gosh that would be the trashiest reality trashiest and most niche reality show ever and it would probably do well I would watch it I would watch it I would like the Logan Paul versus KSI boxing belt rematch is actually it's so legitimate it's getting enough views that they're actually have legitimate boxing professionals fighting for belts in their undercard it's pretty crazy that that yeah that just blows your mind 10 emojio and whichever Paul brother whatever they did a wedding I've heard it was fake I don't know but the point is they charge I think like 50 bucks or something to live stream that yeah people like will pay for this kind of stuff and maybe you and I should have some like relationship drama we should like try to bank off of it's just not worth it well we'll see okay so Tim Poole he's a youtuber he also has a podcast now he's founder of subverse he's he has his hands in so many things he helps sponsor the minds event that we were at in New Jersey he's very industrious very industrious guy he's very genuine I think someone like we've met him hung out with him several times now I think it's fair to say with Tim what you see is what you get genuine guy yeah he's hard working I watch his show a lot he does 500 videos per day but I watch a lot of them and he recently did a video about dating kind of dating and for context there was a New York Post I believe it was article that was all about how successful career women are kind of lamenting in their 30s having a hard time finding men who are as successful as they are in terms of career in terms of finances and so Tim did a response about that and his whole thing was kind of like yeah there are actually successful men out there like ladies it's not that these men don't exist it's that maybe and at least it was the case for him they're not interested in dating you specifically and he was very respectful to what career women saying like if you want to become a CEO as like it's your choice be free to do it that's awesome whatever you want but just don't expect all men to want to be in a relationship with you if you work all of these long hours and he shares some personal anecdotes I kind of left that video saying okay like completely reasonable I wasn't bothered by it at all um we have a clip of it here that you guys can check out maybe you'll see something offensive that I didn't if I'm going to choose a significant other or a spouse I want someone who's going to take care of the social aspect of our cohabitation partnership and child rearing I don't need someone who's going to be at a board meeting okay I've got a business to run I've got several to run I've worked to do so that means a partnership would involve someone who could fill in the gap on the other side the problem I'm having as an economically attractive male I suppose someone with a job and a career and success is that I can't find women who want to be in families and I mean that look you're gonna find a lot of dudes who are struggling in the economy that's so that's that's that's bad we got to figure out that problem but apparently it's not a problem that women don't want to be in families now don't get me wrong a lot of women want to have it all that's what they say they say have it all right that's the joke you know 30 Rock did a great bit about Tina Fey you know Liz Lemon wanting to have it all go for it I got no problem the problem is I'm not looking for for you know half I'm looking for all um so I just I just want to say quickly before we continue with the story that you know we're seeing you guys giving super chats we really appreciate the generosity you guys are amazing we're going to be going through all of your your questions comments concerns everything and about 30 minutes when the main show ends and we just want to say big thank you we love it okay so that was Tim's video which I thought was I think he's making good points I didn't see absolutely I mean listen the guy the guy has a certain life and he needs someone to complement that lifestyle yeah and and there are people out there that exist by the way that I have the exact opposite look in there they say oh I want to live this kind of lifestyle and I fit really well with him that kind of thing right so there's nothing wrong with that I don't see it I don't see any problems with that in fact you know having your preferences in a relationship seems pretty universal I think yeah I don't know but I that's how I see it but apparently some some people online disagree the just a reminder that this is the internet and people will be upset with anything that you say so there there's this one woman in particular we have her tweet robin pennek pennek kia and that's something I think of Talion um she says I don't know who she is but she's verified on twitter I don't know what that means but she says in response to a clip of Tim's video this is truly the most cringe-inducing thing I have ever seen in all my life Tim Poole talking about how ladies need to realize that economically attractive which by the way was the articles term not Tim's term and it's something that people do say in the day like I I don't know why she made a big deal about about that realize that economically attractive men like him only want housewives and mothers not career women so she obviously took those very very personally and I just want to say that there are there are studies to back this up uh this is not something that Tim has just kind of imagined himself and I don't know to me there's not really any criticism in this tweet is just kind of like I'm mad about this yeah right she's not really refuting him it's just I'm mad right and like darn gravity yeah you know like oh no you want me to say to this and I I think it is important to kind of re-emphasize that this whole video that Tim does it wasn't just him out of the blue trashing career women that's not what happened he was responding to an article that specifically was talking about the preferences that career women have right so this is like obviously we're fine as a society realizing that okay if you're a career woman and you have all this money uh you you may not want to date a man who is like I guess less financially stable than you are which is fine you can have your own preferences but it's only when Tim weighs in with his preferences that me that's what the the tweet sounded like by the way in my mind when I read it just screeching all right um so apparently a lot of other people agreed with this robin though because in in this thread there are a lot of people weighing in and saying yes crew Tim Heidi Moore another check mark says suggested us employment program tell women that if they don't get jobs Tim Poole will try to date them the unemployment rate among women would plummet again there's no there's no reputation of what Tim has said here which is like he's describing his own personal preferences which I'm sorry you can't get mad at someone's personal preferences and you know him also saying that statistically this is what a lot of men do want like you can you can say it shouldn't be like this which is an conversation we can have but just being mad in response to reality oh she's having a hissy fit there Heidi and I think it's funny you know because if you actually look at it statistically from a macro perspective um being financially attractive is one of the greatest attraction of females so I would urge that Tim probably will not have any trouble finding someone um no they have no I mean like you know Tim's he's a great guy and he's a hard worker he's he's set up like I think at this point several companies like I don't know why in response his personal preferences you need to try to put him down I don't think any but like my whole thing is that you can date or not want to date whoever you want and I just I feel like maybe these people had different high school experiences than me I was super used to not being in people's preferences like why are these people so shocked at the idea that some stranger on the internet might not want to date them to me that's not some great big insult we have other tweets though this uh rave white knight totally Kyle says weird because I would absolutely give up my economically attractive career in a heartbeat for a career woman well it's kind of facetious facetious name on twitter is guy doing bicep curls on the squat rack yeah and that's like that's like why people have the death penalty so I mean it's also surprised me those two that name and this comment I find them very highly linked yeah but it's like you can tell that he's kind of like it's being painted that it's a good thing for a man to want to give up his career right to be with a career woman why is it so wrong to think that a man might want the same treatment for himself from a partner right well I mean you're absolutely right and I think that this post from totally Kyle actually has no logic to it is just simply that's so nice virtue the usual virtue signaling saying I am worm jerry and and please find me attractive I will worship you that's that's what I read yeah the sneaky male thing yeah I just I don't get it and then we had this person who was a little bit critical of what Robin I'm not sure if that was her name forget already said he said I find it more amazing and cringeworthy that some women took an issue that is affecting men i.e. that men maybe aren't doing as financially well as women in a lot of age groups and made it about them I think that's very true and actually in response like when that New York Post article detailing these career women's preferences was shared a lot of people were kind of taking issue with the headline you know it was essentially saying men poor women hurt most right it's hilarious because this is a thing where especially I think an R age group men aren't going to school as much as women I think in our age group women do out earn men yeah in in some ways definitely in certain ways I mean you see those stats like you know oh isn't it tragic one out of ten women are homeless yeah one out of ten homeless people are women it's like that's a weird way of saying most homeless people are men exactly so I mean yeah you can't win because if the man does make more money than you then it's some kind of misogynist sexist patriarchy wage gap right if women do make more men than it's sad it's unattractive and they're like I don't want to date you don't make as much money as me right so but and then all that to say of course that you tie that all together with women other victims yeah and it's like you know I'm not saying men other victims I think that this is about both sexes and and a changing in relationship dynamic in a in a time where you know we're not too sure about how things are going to end up economically for a certain I guess population groups and it's just yeah it's it's a lot more complicated than saying women are always the victim and no actually it's not as as this tweet replyer points out Jenna Beth says the quote issue that is affecting men is that women aren't willing to be housewives and instead expect to be treated equally and valued for things other than cooking cleaning and child rearing things men don't want to do please explain how this is not about women will wait so it is about how women are she's got the receipts yeah she does but I mean saying that a man wanting a woman to be a housewife or even more focused on family life didn't say his like he doesn't he won't date anyone that doesn't work he just says he doesn't want someone who works 16 hours a day like him because then when would they hang out and he actually drew on an example of when that happened in a relationship with another woman and like they just never had time to hang out which is a real problem that happens saying that a man wanting a woman who can dedicate more time to the home life is just them wanting someone who cooks cleans and has babies is like saying that wanting a man who's financially stable is just wanting a sugar daddy absolutely and i don't need to be psychic to know this but if we were to click replies on that tweet you about half of them would be women saying that's actually the kind of lifestyle that I would like to live to something right like I would like to be at home child rearing and you know taking care of the household and and you know leading the religious life whatever it is there would be plenty of them that completely disagree with her and say that i would like someone that would be able to help take care of the other half of that lifestyle yeah and it's just weird that the idea that we're going to have a partnership together where we manage different aspects of our lives maybe one person is more in charge of bringing home the bank and the other person is more in charge of things at home how that's not being treated equally like it's really weird how little respect they seem to give to women who were it is still work work all day cleaning cooking raising kids it's it's very strange to me and like ultimately what what you want in a partner that is your call it's not for anyone else to say that that's not right i mean if they care about you maybe they might say hey uh just maybe make sure you think about this i want what's best for you but that's not what these women are doing they they're not worried about like what would be best for Tim and his life clearly they're just upset that someone doesn't want to date them and I think they're so upset because a lot of women who are maybe in their 30s now have great jobs which is amazing for them they grew up with the notion that you can have it all that you can just you know be super successful and that a man will want you just for your success and he doesn't have any desires or aspirations or preferences of his own he'll just conform to you and especially like the super attractive males right the ones that are like you know the young or them the younger rich super successful people they're what i don't think that they as a rule they're known for what marrying trophy wives for repeat six you know it's like they don't go after economically you know well off 30 year olds that's not what they're looking for it's just it's just a almost law of of social nature so yeah i don't know what they're angry at it just it's sad they were sold this dream yeah that i think is ultimately a lie yeah no for sure and it's i like really relationships that are kind of complementary right you and me are very different but we're in a partnership and that's fine if there are two people who are just super successful in their own careers but no one's at home to take care of any potential kids it's just two people being alone with all their money like i i don't know to me i completely understand tim's reasoning like he has money of his own what he lacks is someone who has more of the time to commit to maybe raising kids or helping and stuff like that and it's just yeah i mean tim's made response videos about this clarifying his own position more so i don't need to speak for him the quartering jeremy's made a video about this that's right i am still confused as to why this is at all controversial i i'm still waiting maybe eventually someone will explain it to me our final story of the day is about the church of climate change now you don't like talking about Greta no which i understand because it's a lose situation like we said before and like the comments to that segment by the way displayed you know if you mention anything to do with Greta you're attacking an autistic child and the devil on a climate denialist so this story isn't about Greta it's Greta adjacent but recently the church of sweden or at least one of their diocese i don't know how the church of sweden works uh it's well we're about to find out yeah we're about to find out there's a definite word for characterizes their beliefs i agree we're gonna be they recently proclaimed Greta the successor to jesus christ okay for a successor a successor yeah uh the washington examiner reported the church of sweden declared teen star climate activist Greta tunberg to be an appointed successor appointed by who i don't know uh successor to jesus christ in a 2018 tweet that resurfaced in the wake of her speech before the united nations announcement jesus of nazareth has now appointed one of his successors gretunberg the tweet said on december 1st 2018 the account operated by the limham's church had previously tweeted several sentiments of climate activism the church of sweden has a history of promulgating climate alarmism and gretunberg particularly noting on their official website when the amazon burns we gather to fight for mother earth together after some backlash in december when the tweet was published the church posted a second tweet that suggested success could be interpreted in more than one way shortly after the entire account was abandoned with a sign off message that defended the original celebration of tunberg and suggested everyone has a right to interpret jesus in their own way okay can we just take a minute to appreciate how far christian i'm not even gonna call them christians no they're over there heretical no they are here like this straight up heretical and okay so with this segment this is not about greta herself this isn't even about environment like climate change as a scientific issue that's not what we're talking about and actually daisy cousins um amazing youtuber if you don't follow her go do it she's great she's done several videos about this whole climate alarmism and she describes herself as like a climate centrist you know care about the environment like let's talk about this but let's just not go crazy and literally insert climate alarmism into our religions is how i kind of look at my approach to it and so the environmentalist movement and we we've seen lately a lot of these climate strike marches there was one here and i know i was here i think was it greta that was here yeah greta was here greta was here i i wasn't able to have lunch in china town because of the oh that's right yeah that was unfortunate um but yeah so this is like this movement is really i think reaching a boiling point where there are a lot of people who have a lot of feelings about this and what worries me as someone who i've said it a billion times i consider myself a conservationist in a lot of ways i'm worried that there's not a lot of science being injected into conversation anymore they claimed there is and we did a segment about it where we actually brought up um you know and what's this an environmental economist correct all of his data we talked about it what's most effective at combating climate change for the money you spent and i had all these people calling me a climate change denialist or whatever just because i didn't think we were gonna uh die in 12 years and it's like okay it's like the third or fourth cycle that i've heard we got 12 years i don't know why it's always the magic number 12 yeah because it's like 10 that's a little bit too far like no one's gonna believe that 15 not urgent enough 12 is the stage size it's not a rounded number you know but like it sounds specific um therefore scientific but yeah we've left the realm of science like science is not part of the conversation anymore this is becoming a dogma as we see like this is literally becoming a religion i just want to say like if you are any type of Abrahamic religion i'm bringing in the Jews and the Muslims as well uh Greta is not a savior she's not the the the second coming or if you're a Jew maybe the first coming i don't know and none of that that doesn't mean maybe you can't be a fan of your work but we need to look at this rationally because i i don't think starting to pray to the holy shrine of Greta or anyone else is going to equal just a fact of change she's effectively i mean and she's a child and she's a puppet for you know greater greater forces ultimately you know i even read somewhere that i think that both her parents used to be actors yeah i think that's actually true and like to show that this is like a documented pattern we're seeing here we also have this other story this was going around a while ago i it hurt too much to even talk about it but the i i think union seminary there were these students led by professor who were confessing their sins two plants this is i'm i'm not kidding this actually happened level 10 vegan yes exactly not only you you know you don't eat meat but you actually pray to plants but wait what they be eating them then i don't know that's the thing is like there was uh there's a samsung's joke that i was alluding to there where they said i think the guy said i'm a i exist on air so yeah i don't i don't need anything that casts a shadow yeah um so yeah this is from the washington examiner again absolute theological bankruptcy that is a great way to describe that union theological seminary students confess climate sins to plants students at union theological seminary pray to a display of plants set up in the chapel of the school prompting the institution to issue a statement explaining the practice as many on social media mock them good sometimes i see these ridiculous things and i like want to i don't know curl up into a hole and die but then i see the replies are all saying you're crazy and it makes me feel a little bit better because at least other people recognize that this is crazy and then i go on reddit where our politics is essentially our democrats and i'm sad again but anyway the article continues today in chapel we confess to plants the nation's oldest independent seminary declared tuesday on twitter together we held our grief joy regret hope guilt and sorrow in prayer offering them to the beings who sustain us but whose gift we too often fail to honor what do you confess to the plants in your life the ceremony which is part of a professor claudio carvel haze class extremism a ritual slash liturgical response sorry extractivism a ritual slash liturgical response drew ridicule from many on twitter some of whom accused the seminary and students of having lost their minds in response the seminary's twitter account began retweeting users who defended the ritual and also issued a statement spanning a lengthy ten tweet thread i love the subtle shade by the article we've had many questions about yesterday's chapel the statement read in part in worship our community confessed the harm we've done to plants speaking directly in repentance this is a beautiful ritual we're in the throes of a climate emergency a crisis created by humanities arrogance our disregard for creation the statement continued far too often we see the natural world only as resources to be extracted for our use not divinely created in their own right worthy of honor thanks and care we need to unlearn habits of sin and death how do you unlearn habits of death oh i guess they mean killing things not there anyway uh and part of that work must be building new bridges to the natural world here's okay listen to this part guys and that means creating new spiritual and intellectual frameworks by which we understand and relate to the plants and animal with animals with whom we share the planet encouraging churches to turn from theologies that encourage humans to dominate and master the earth union asserted that we must birth new theology new liturgy to heal and so replacing ones that reap and destroy okay so they are literally advocating for like a new climate religion like this is yep that's actually what they're doing and i kind of looked into what exactly union theological seminary was because it's like i mean aside from heretical and they it's a bit confusing to me at least because i'm familiar with kind of seminaries being like a baptist seminary not a nominal or whatever like to learn a specific thing union seminary it's it's inter denominational non of all religions so there's like buddhist Jewish unitarian universalist which by the way is not a thing if you're one of those it's just you're not um it's like it's it's kind of seems like one of those hippie coexist bumper signs but in the form of a school yeah so essentially they stand for nothing except progressivism drugs actually that's that's all i read in there was we like to do a lot of drugs we like to smoke the plants yeah that's why they're sacred and we're like that's the kind of bond we want to develop with them yeah so just like none of this is biblical and alice stucky whose fellow blaze content host she's great she talks a lot about how social justice this progressivism has been infecting christianity and i think we're just we're seeing that all over and i'll say it again none of this is about denying climate change or saying hey we shouldn't be doing more to for example keep our trash out of the oceans right but when you get to the point where you're confessing your sins to plants we've crossed the line from activism into just delusion like for sure and this is something that we need to have a conversation about because i'm i'm worried i'm worried about these people and this is especially um i guess disproportionately affecting young people we have this poll by scott rass musin a famous polar i i pull so sorry i got to meet him in person he's a really nice guy he's he's very accurate and he has the he asked a lot of questions that the outlets like pew don't think to so from this poll that he did 51 percent of young voters believe humanity could be wiped out over the next 10 to 15 years 29 percent of all voters believe it is at least somewhat likely that the earth will become uninhabitable and humanity will be wiped out okay so 29 percent of voters believe that in the next 10 to 15 years we're done just gone a scott rass musin.com national survey found that 71 percent disagree and find it unlikely the totals include 10 percent who consider it very likely and 37 percent who say not at all likely there is a dramatic difference by age on this question half 51 percent so slight majority here of voters under 35 believe it is at least somewhat likely humanity will be wiped out in the next decade or so only 12 percent of senior citizens agree the data also reveals a significant geographical divide 45 percent of urban residents think humanity may be wiped out by climate change in 10 to 15 years only 23 percent of rural voters and 22 percent of suburban voters agree 21 percent of urban voters consider it very likely the earth will quickly become uninhabitable, uninhabitable just 6 percent of rural voters and 5 percent of suburban voters consider that a very likely outcome so yeah young people and city people you have to get it together right because you can make fun of the climate change denial is being unscientific all you want nobody has said anything about life on earth being wiped out in 10 to 15 years aside from AOC and that's just like this is not what science is telling us no it's not at all what science is telling us i mean there have been climate change scientists who are environmentalists who want conservation and they you know they want to reduce emissions coming forth and saying hey guys i don't know where you got this from like i mean like love the the desire to do action but this is not what it is it's not helpful for anybody really and so i i really would encourage these these i guess younger voters these the bermi enthusiasts yeah to maybe just sit down regardless of of what the you know the the political lobbyists might be saying and just actually look at what the science tells you you you know maybe you're gonna walk away saying like yeah man is contributing to climate change but i think there's a very good chance you're gonna realize we're not all going to die in 10 to 15 years no asteroids aside because i don't know about that none of us do but it's like for the foreseeable future we're okay yeah and um i i can't help but feel that the schools school programs are also contributing to this hysteria but ultimately this is just going to make it a lot harder for any change to get done right because i mean if i genuinely did believe that in 10 to 15 years we were literally all going to die i know that i would be putting forth some pretty radical proposals yeah and that's exactly what we see from these people and you know in gretta's fire and brimstone speech she says like you know you're not caring in the in the pursuit of what unlimited economic growth that's like it's very easy for us in the like western nations to say oh i i can suffer some economic loss in exchange for doing better for the planet and if that is you i encourage you to make green decisions they often are more expensive you can if you can afford it your decision to make but i mean it's a it's a lot harder for us to look at you know the developing third world who still rely on colon say like you need to stop it and i think how about how about these environmentalists just have some introspection for a second and stop with the nuclear hate that they have yes yes you know let's get some thorium thorium reactors developed exactly and i think that i think that will have a lot cleaner planet you know and and you know it's it's it's all mind-boggling because because they're definitely and you can watch talks by people that have environmentalists and they go and talk about the nuclear problem which this is a kind of a separate topic i guess but it's like they're they're so dogmatic these people that they're not even willing to accept slightly different options from what the dog might told them it tells them is necessary yeah and that's one of the problems that i have with these climate change alarmists is that they don't have actual solutions like the only they're they're wanting to us to change entirely to systems that don't exist yet no they want us to live in like little shoeboxes and yeah you know like exist under the government program it's it's just a dystopian view that they have entirely in there they're unwilling to move in my opinion yeah and also they like socialism a little bit will help in that as well of course yeah i don't know i still don't understand how those two are connected but i think in any case that's pretty much all we have to say for now don't forget if you are a live viewer stay on the stream we're going to be back in just a few seconds with some exclusive q&a but aside from that we really appreciate you guys tuning in and we will see you next week"
