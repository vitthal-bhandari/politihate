    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome and everybody Wednesday edition of clay and buck begins right now first up we are watching closely as hurricane idalia has made landfall we've seen the footage Um of what it has done to what they call the big bend in florida that area of the state Uh, i'm down here in south florida a lot of floridines. I know are very on edge about what this is doing to the state It's also moving into georgia and going to be hitting the carolinas. Uh, so we're watching this Uh powerful storm and we'll have updates for you as they come along during The show and of course our thoughts and prayers go out to everybody who is Affected, uh, we also have a number of news stories that we'll be looking at here including Um, the latest on the hunter biden victor shokin joe biden corruption axis Even more emails making it more clear than ever before if that's even possible That there was a corrupt scheme underway here and it tied directly to hunter getting all these illicit payments So we shall discuss Uh, the vague Rama swami Is talked about this was on our friend glen bex program clay may have seen glenn asked trump Uh during an interview what about the vake for vp? And he says that the vake is smart and full of talent So we'll see that would be a very interesting Turn here at some point if vake just said i want to be a part of the trump campaign I know he says that that's not going to happen, but I'm betting right now that at some point that is a conversation that is going to happen We shall see uh if i'm right on that one Uh trump said he's certainly open to it. He's open to it Uh, which i don't think he's open to that many other candidates these days as a vp So that's something that we will definitely get into This just from uh from over the weekend clay we didn't get to it, but 99 This is a daily mail headline 99 of covet deaths recently Are not primarily caused by the virus that's according to the cdc written about the daily mail We should discuss How they're they're still trying to make covet an even bigger thing than any reasonable person could but let's jon Let's dive into this first. I saw this. I thought oh boy Uh, here's a moment and I knew clay you were going to be fired up by this one too because this is I've got it. I've got it. I was zoomed 90 10 issue. I don't know how good the polling is on this Whitehouse was asked about this uh korean john pia was asked about this Yesterday when it comes to women and men and sports competition. This should be going into an election right? This should be The most straightforward obvious This is a pitch right down the middle. You've just got to put that in the upper stance. This is so easy But it's not easy for joe bines white house. It's not easy for his Whitehouse press secretary to handle So instead when i should men and women be able to compete separately in sports Here is the non answer answer you get from the biden regime Does he care that girls are allowed to compete in sports without just uh, you're I read does he think it's fair for girls to have to compete against biological males? I just answered the question. It is a complicated issue It is truly a complicated issue with a wide range of views a wide range of views There is no yes or no answer to this. It is complicated There's a rule that the department of education has put forward and we're going to let that process move forward again We want to make sure that while we establish grog rails with this rule that we also prevent discrimination As well against transgender kids, but again a complicated issue with a wide range of views and we respect that Clay she can say complicated five or six times as she does there It is not complicated and it is a straightforward. Yes or no I so I think it's so interesting if we just go To this is a foundational issue Because if you are unwilling to say that men are bigger stronger and faster than women And that is the reason why we have a difference between men and women's athletics Then I can't trust anything that you're telling me because you were asking me to accept a foundational why? About something upon which I'm an expert and let me just kind of give people a context on this But did you see the little league world series? Any moment of the little league world series in william sport, pennsylvania just ended Okay, you did not see it. I bet a decent percentage of our audience has watched at some point a little league world series game This year's world little league world series ended congratulations to el segundo california That's the south side of la county. They beat karasau Uh to win the little league world series california team wins kid hits a walk off home run 12 year old kid And everybody goes crazy Buck what would happen if it came out that that kid was 15 years old So everybody would have freaked out that everybody was this happened in my new york city soccer league There was a kid who was like two years Too old to be playing and it came out after the game and they had to strike the game as a big controversy in the uh Catholic high school athletic association at the time. It also happened by the way in the new york city area I don't remember the name of the kid But he was like two or three years too old. He was a pitcher and anybody out there who knows There's a big difference between a 15 year old and a 12 year old right first of all 15 year old can have a mustache He can have gone through puberty Uh, he can he can be a flame thrower. There's a big difference Everybody out there would react with indignation if this occurred I went to coopers town, New york for a 12 you baseball tournament people remember I broadcast from up there You had to give the original birth certificate In order for your kid you couldn't even have a copy of the birth certificate In order to verify that your kid was the right age I know this because I lost the original birth certificate in the process of traveling to Coopers town, New york And let me just say Mom does not look fondly upon dad if dad loses the original copy of the birth certificate After being told make sure you do not lose this. Okay, so i Momm may have a point there mom may have a point we lost the original birth certificate We had to get a new one for my 12 year old my point on all this is aggressively You have to monitor for little league sports the age upon which the participants are Because one or two years Can make a tremendous difference in the competitive outcome Now imagine that you have and by by by the way Oftentimes, especially when you get to 12 or 13 years old That's because puberty hits and puberty Changes everything in all facets of life including how big strong and fast boys are okay. So as they become men No one would argue this I don't think there's anyone out there who would argue buck. Hey, I could be trans age I I i'm not 12, but I feel like a 12 year old and therefore I should be able to compete against 12 year old Your age is a biological reality Just like your sex is a biological reality and the refusal of the white house to address this Is I think a foundational failure that should be attacked because it demonstrates How much of their organization and their party right now is built on a foundation of lies Well, it's a reminder of the initial lie and this is what Consistently aggravates me about this The initial lie of the Biden administration Which because I remember the whole thing was while he was hiding in the basement We're all scared of covid and the BLM rioters are looting and destroying and burning things down It was oh good old grandpa joe. He's not an extremist He's not going to take far left positions And some of us were saying it was a common it was actually a common thing at the time to point out That he was a trojan horse that's where we're saying he's a trojan horse for the left We all remember the ancient greek in the ancient greek mythology the homeric epic the horse comes in And a bunch of greeks drop out and they burn troy to the ground right so He was meant to be exactly what he is which is oh don't worry Joe bide good old grandpa joe Doesn't think that you're 12 year old or you're five year old You know should be told that he or she is trans By pant by teachers should be able to have hormone blockers should allow a 15 year old with you know a mustache who's a guy to compete against the 15 year old girl See joe's not going to do that. Of course he is Yeah, and it goes to the power that the activist left has within their party Remember that there are there are whole organizations that have that raised tens of millions of dollars have tremendous power and influence in the legacy media that Need a new crusade they probably don't like that term but a crusade to push And what else are they going to do right? What is the great civil rights struggle according to left of of modern day? It is to think that men are men can be women. When can be men can be women women can be men and This is effectively a state of mind here. Here's one for you klep Why is it that that? Physicality does not determine gender but to be transgender you need to have the trappings of perceived femininity Or being a woman Why must you if it doesn't if having a penis does not make you a man Why do you have to have the penis removed to be a a transgender woman? What difference does it make? They don't have answers for this And again, I think that this is so this really blows up when you go, okay, can you be trans age? I'm 44 If I felt like I was 16 we both look young for age to be fair So we do defy the age Categorization a little bit for your age. I might look old for my age but uh, but If I felt trans age and I wanted to go back to high school And I wanted to play high school football Let's say Uh, should I be able to do that? What about if I woke up today buck and I felt like I was uh, a Filipino Should I be able to identify? Should I be transracial and could I say to everyone? Hey, I'm Filipino and by the way It's not just me acting like it. It's me acting like it and you have to acknowledge That even though it's fundamentally not true, right? I'm a white guy I'm 44 But if I want to be why is it that you have to expect if I say I'm a woman But if I say I'm a 16 year old latino woman, you say oh, you're not 16 You're not latino But you are a woman like why is one lie acceptable and have to be acknowledged as a truth when it is Definitively a falsehood. It is also goes to you know, they they got to this point the activist community of the left with the Trans issue the lgbt qia plus and they have they have truly added numerous Letters to this in recent years. I mean basically the whole alphabet now It's it's a big it's it's so big as an acronym that it no longer serves the purpose of an acronym Which is to make it easier to refer to something correct be easier to come up with some other Some other designation But as as they've done this over time a big way they've gotten to this point And the media demands this a lot of corporations demand this is they say it's a function of being polite It's a function of being nice Why can't we turn this around very simply and say let's not even we don't even have to discuss everything else that is at issue here But can we just agree that it's not polite to let a biological male destroy women in sports and to make a mockery of their athletic achievements? It when does politeness or you know decency? Become something that the other side is expected to engage in here And and I think that that's another place where they have no answer. We've all seen this I mean you see these guys you saw the the champions, you know Quote champion female swimmer for you pen and we've seen now You know the I think there's like a rugby player in New Zealand or Australia is you know like weighs 240 pounds He's like stiff-arming all the women throwing them or I mean the whole thing is absurd Yes, it is the macho man randy savage South Park skit made real and Joe Biden It's not just the act it is this white house this democrat party that looks at the american people and says yeah, this is normal And this is why you have to attack it and and by the way credit to the white house press corps I would say keep asking this question and and I would love to hear someone ask Legitimately joe biden if he ever sits down for a In interview and and I mean I think this is a good way for you all out there to ask as well If we say that it's racist to change your race and I don't think I haven't heard anybody bucks say you can be trans age Why can you lie about your cron? Why can you not lie about your race and your your chronological age? That's unacceptable, but you can lie about your sex Why why like how do you distinguish those three clearly immutable? Biological realities in some form or fashion race is far less of a of a of a And race is actually mixed as we all know everyone has components of different backgrounds Um and and that's actually arbitrary cultural policing that that people engage in when they say you're appropriating it You know, you can't have your hair that way or you can't you know listen to that music or whatever That's completely arbitrary. That's all based on power dynamics. Meanwhile biological gender reality is That is a penis. You are a man. There you go No doubt it's a real thing.

She's a part of the clay and buck podcast She's fantastic former governor candidate from the great state of michigan And we just played a clip from your interview with donald trump Which is up as a part of your podcast Tutor what stood out to you from your conversation with uh with president trump that people can go listen to now You know we had we talked a lot about a bunch of different subjects, but really for me I wanted to find out if he would tell these pharmaceutical companies You have to release your data on the vaccine because I have had so many people say to me We don't know What this is doing to people we we have so many concerns about myocarditis and heart attacks and blood clots And if we had the data we would feel better if we could see that the pharmaceutical companies weren't seeing this that we could Ensure that this is or or if we if it is why are why don't we know that? You know, there's a lot of question around it. Are we really seeing more cases of this or is this like You know when you suddenly? Report on shark attacks and then everybody's reporting in shark attacks and it's not really a higher number We just see it more often We're all wondering and I wanted to get from him what he would do and he said yeah He would ask that they release the data and I think that's going to be key for a lot of people Especially moms and dads out there who are saying we're being told by the Biden administration There's another vaccine coming out. We want everybody to get it including kids And I think all of us are a little leery of what that means Tutor it's buck. I've got your podcast lined up to listen to later. I'm just wondering Did he get into the multi pronged legal assaults that trump is under and and how he's feeling about that and and You know, just what did he say about it? You know, he talked about that From the standpoint of the things that we've heard him say before it either very corrupt This is outrageous We talked about what happened to him and the hollary clinton dossier that was funded by her and what should happen there We talked about those things. I mean you can tell you can actually tell in his voice that it's laying heavy on him And I say that and I you know to everybody else that would be like, oh well, that's obvious But i've talked to president trump several times over the past few years and as these attacks have come I've never Heard it in his voice, but I think that in the conversation we had you could hear it and and of course It it is I mean if you add up all these charges I think it's something like over 700 years that he would be imprisoned if you were convicted on all of these charges and That here's a man who served this country and he was trying to serve again And I just think that as he's going through this and as he's being viciously attacked by the other side And these political prosecutions that are going on I mean it would be hard to every day go out there and be cheerful And yet we see a guy who has these rallies and he's able to talk to the people and he puts the people first And that's the part that I think is the most interesting He always puts himself aside and you'll hear that in the interview too because we talk about some examples of Things that he's done for people that most people don't know And he's his reaction is so funny because he's all about You know, you just do those things because they're right and he he's he is actually very humble, which is something you wouldn't expect Tudor there's a front page article. I'm sure you saw it in the New York Times about the fractures in the Michigan republican party Michigan along with Wisconsin and pennsylvania States that trump won in 16 Lost in 20 and buck and I got into a discussion some about this yesterday You were the candidate for people who don't know your mom of four you barn stormed all over michigan. So uh, how much did abortion impact in your opinion the 2022 governor's race between you and Gretchen Whitmer and how much do you think if at all it will impact? 2024 and what should republicans do to try to address that issue in your mind having seen it directly on the ground yourself So in michigan, I believe 100 percent that it was absolutely the one issue that won the election for the democrats and the reason I say that is because There was no way we could have expected the amount of attack ads that they would play against us and interestingly in michigan It was on the ballot and so we came out and you know As a republican you want to get your your position out there and you heard all the candidates in the debate say i'm pro life i'm pro life and I said, you know, I am pro life. This is what I believe. This is what I believe for my family I've talked to other people and these are the experiences that i've had but in the state of michigan And we were on record saying this you can vote for abortion if you want to and you still don't have to vote for Gretchen Whitmer because it's on the ballot and it will be for the people to choose that didn't matter because the minute they could take my words and twist them and create ads and just porture the People of michigan with these ads endlessly every time you would play a video on your phone some attack abortion attack ad would play and it was I'm I like to say it was deadly because this was Absolutely what they want on it was twisted messaging from them. It didn't matter They knew that the people would make the decision ultimately, but it didn't matter And that's why I say people with republicans have to be so careful on this because niki haley made a really good point I thought what she did in the debate was incredible and it should be watched by other republicans because she said the facts first She said, you know what? I am pro-life, but the people will choose it's in their hands And and you have to understand that no matter who's standing on the stage You don't have 60 senators that are going to put a ban on abortion And you don't have half the house right now and the president can't do that And that is key because it was the same thing in michigan But they attacked anyway, and I don't think that anyone can understand Where women's hearts are on this issue if they didn't live through what we live through in michigan And that's why I tell republicans you have to be so careful Just speak the truth the the president can't do this unless the country is on board The reason niki haley said there needs to be a consensus is because that's truly how the government works It's not because she said I'm I'm gonna wave her on this and there needs to be consensus That's that is simply the facts and it cuts them off at the knees They can't come after her for this because there is no reason to come after any candidate for this The candidate can't do anything on it But they will run the ads and win by manipulating the people's minds and making them believe that someone will go in there And take this away and i'm telling you we lost the hearts and minds of women on this decades ago And that work needs to be done outside of government So just tutor what's different about what niki haley said versus what your approach was in michigan So niki haley was very clear that she believes this is going to be a decision by the people the people will have to come together And it will and if it comes to be a federal answer that it will be that They will come out and it the senators will have to come together the house will have to come together It'll be consensus right she was very clear about the process She did not go out and say these are the reasons that i'm pro life and this is why I believe that Women will have these experiences, but they should still have a baby now if you look at ronda santa's approach I know I can tell you I've had this thing from lip the same thing The the groups came to him and they they clearly said we want you to meet this person and he talked about the woman who was You know on the she was so they tried to abort her several times her grandmother saved her and i'm telling you They will use those stories against you because they'll say This is these people were forced to have a baby. They didn't want to it's a terrible situation a child was forced into it I can just see the ads that they're writing and it And i just i'm just so i'm clear so like your takeaway if you were advising somebody else who is running as a republican in michigan on this issue I mean, yes the left lies they're horrible. They lie on this issue. They probably lie on this issue more than any other So then what's the what's the response to be able to win in the state like michigan on this issue? Well, if you are running for a federal position, I would say that your response should be Look, we know we would if there were some federal decision that would come to on abortion We would come together and I want to be a part of that decision I want to be a part of that discussion And I think it's okay to share if you're a pro life person that you're pro life But to recognize that this is not this is not going to be a decision I'm going to make for someone else. We're going to make this decision together and that's where i'd leave it And you're mom This is this is interesting by the way because I I do think there's so many people out there You know you met my wife. She's got three We've got three kids. You've got four daughters I bet you are also surrounded by other moms And it's like the republican brand for some of them is toxic even though they would agree With you and me and a lot of our listeners on virtually every issue But it's like they can't get past abortion. Do you meet those people? Do you see them? And do you think they're really decision makers in terms of how elections or one are lost in michigan? absolutely because They will likely Never use abortion or they'd never use abortion past the first trimester Past that 15-week point, but they are not going to say i'm going to take it away from someone who had some catastrophic Situation happen. I don't want to be that person that votes to take that choice away from some woman who has an experience that You will never know that we will never experience And so I think that's what people need to understand is these are not cruel and sick women Who are like, you know, we just want to be able to have an abortion wherever whenever we want They are people that feel strongly about the fact that that choice should be there should there be some medical complications Should there be some disastrous situation? And that's what they told that's what they've talked to me about, you know Like this is just something that we can't we feel like we can't vote to take that away And they feel that a vote for a republican right now is a vote to ban abortion And whether it is at six weeks or ten weeks or 15 weeks that term ban is really powerful with women right now And i've tried to talk to people across the country who i'm saying look This does not mean that you are out of taking care of women or taking care of babies or trying to convince people that having their child is the best Option for them. That's not what this means. It means that that work is going to be done outside of elected officials That work has to be done the that has to be the long game that has to be done through Carrying organizations that are outside of elected officials because honestly you're not going to be able to get good policies for working moms Good policies for families good health care for families if you can't get into office You're going to still have these radical policies where moms can't afford school supplies If you can't get into office and they know they can stop you from getting into office with this one issue Toonardixon podcast everybody you can check it out in the clay and buck feed so subscribe to the clay and buck podcast You'll see tutors show they're including her exclusive interview with donald trump tutor.

Thank you christmas crimson tide. Oh, yes Begin their season at home against middle tennessee state university on saturday We need to both get down there. Uh, you would be able to return to tusco lusa I will pretty much guarantee that if this debate takes place on the university of alabama campus that I will be down there And i'll probably try to pair it with a college football game Depending on when the actual debate takes place. They've been on wednesday. I think so far, right? I think that's the day of the week that they're trying to put them because There's nfl or college football games on monday and thursday and they don't want to go head to head with those Wednesday is the best day of the week when there aren't major sporting events that would cut into Potentially the audience of people who'd be watching. I love the idea of nix sabin by the way as the as the moderator alabama crimson tide head football coach I'm not even I think he would do an incredible i'd be happy to vote for nix sabin for president by the way I think he would do an incredible job Uh as the moderator because he doesn't take any slack right any is like dismissive of Of all attempts to make excuses. I kind of love that idea Uh, so that is going on now buck Yesterday also I said I thought there were six candidates who could win one of the first primaries and I said everybody else should drop out Some people disagreed with that. I'm gonna firmly reinforce that again trump desantis vavake Uh nicky haley tem scott chris christie only Those six people have a chance to win one of the first four primaries and if you're like chris christie He's number two right now in new hamsher Okay, and we're going to talk about some of the crazy shenanigans that might happen in new hamsher before all is said and done with who's on that ballot but The vake has moved into a solid number three spot I think it's fair to say buck and has challenged ron desantis for the number two spot overall We had vavake on the show last week in the wake of the uh debate And I thought in terms of candidates on the radio with us He did as good of a job as anybody has to make a case for why he should be the nominee but I definitely think it's worth all of you kind of written an eyebrow raise If you presume that vavake is now in second or third place Trump has attacked ron desantis with every verbal He's in third place like I mean he's third I've never seen a real pole that has him in any kind of solid second place nationally or even in a in an important state Have you seen that I haven't seen he's there are a bit a couple of polls. I think of questionable again polling Yeah, I mean it's more there's polls and there are polls. I don't think any major polling agency has shown him in second place Overall in the contest. I've seen a couple where he is in second second or third. Whatever you want to say he has increased more than anybody else in the republican primary field and yet To my knowledge, trump has not said a single negative word about him And by and large vavake has not said a single negative word about trump Yesterday trump went on our friend glenn bex program He was asked about the idea of the vavake rama swami as his vp. This is what trump said Well, I think he's great. Look anybody that said i'm the best president in the generation I don't know you have to define generation but so long left And uh, he said it a couple of times and he said it in a hundred years So I have to like a guy like that, you know, I can't get upset with him, but he's a smart guy Uh, he's a young guy Uh, he's got a lot of talent. He's a very very uh, a very intelligent person He's got good energy and he he could be in some form of something. I tell you I think he'd be very good I think he's very good. I think he's really distinguished himself He's starting to get out there a little bit. He's a little bit getting a little bit controversial I can tell him be a little bit careful. He's been very nice to me This is okay, honey trump saying whoa, yeah You're a little bit air buddy be careful. Yeah, it's very funny But buck here is the question and I would raise this question for anybody out there listening who wants to weigh in 800-282-2882 What's going on here? Well, trump is only saying super nice things about the vavake The vavake is only saying super nice things about trump I don't dispute it. Look if if if trump's the nominee. I want everybody saying super nice things about each other These guys are running against each other This is totally different. They're not really they're not really running against trump right this they're not really running against each other Okay, so what is your idea of what's going on here? Um, the theory is that uh, this is uh, the vavake would be a phenomenal vp for trump and that's how I mean that's the whole that's the whole game and by being in the race. I think he creates a um, you know, he he creates a sort of trumpian alternative to trump A little bit but not really and I don't think he's really pulling any votes from trump when push comes to shove And it it also creates this atmosphere of why isn't ron desantis or why is it niki haly or why? You know name another candidate doing what vavake does We I see this a lot to which I always want to say Well vavakes not trying to defeat donald trump obviously because this notion that he's going to beat him and trump's going to be his advisor If that was going to happen Um, well first of all, why doesn't trump just say that now it doesn't hold up. It doesn't make any sense to me I'm just look I'm open to being wrong on this one and I I like vavake. I I think he's you know Obviously been incredibly successful and done But I think he's running to be trump's vp. Is that is that a surprise to anybody? Well, I just think I think it may be something other than running to be trump's vp because We've had vavake on I think he's super sharp smart We had him on long before he announced for president as well to promote his books If trump really thought vavake was a threat He would attack him would he as he attacks anybody who's a threat obviously this is this is where we're breaking this Down, okay, we can also that that's what i'm that's what i'm going to if you're out there and you're saying well The reason trump's not saying anything negative about vavake is because vavake is saying nice things about him Okay, but if trump really thought that vavake who let's be clear has risen more in the last two or three months than any other Republican candidate out there he's gone from one or two percent to eight or nine percent whatever you want to say He was the number one google searched candidate after the republican primary debate last week And we had him on and I said Hey, if you think trump's the best president in the 21st century Why are you running against him and his answer is well? I think I can do better. I think I would like to have trump as a mentor Um, I think I could build a motion that's the best let's just can we just deal with it? So there are a few things here. I'm sorry that I wasn't heroes on vacation when vavake came on Um, because I would ask him about this the idea that somebody was the best president Um in in many many decades or over numerous president obviously we're not that deep into the 21st century So it's not that big of a of a statement But um just say that I think he said that trump's the best president of his lifetime as well Am I wrong in saying that I believe he's also oh, I don't I I saw 21st century. I didn't see the lifetime I might I might be yeah, I might be off on that but my point is merely if somebody was a mate like If trump did an a plus job, which I think vavake would say he did and he's a phenomenal president Which I think vavake would say he did In what context do you think that you're going to do a better job than somebody who's been in the job for four years And was the best at it you know, I'm saying it doesn't yeah, it just doesn't hold up I just I don't buy it like people can say they can people can believe whatever they want about it But to me, you know, it's it's it's a dodge and this thing that he did I'm just gonna say it, you know, andry amitra lak. He was pushing him on it where he was talking about how in my capacity as As president of the senate I would have pushed through vote. It's like vavake. That's not That you know, you know, i'm talking about my pence's role on january 6th Because he doesn't want to say what he wrote in his book, which is that he agreed with pence certifying the election Which he always doesn't really say but he actually does believe that so he should just say that now He'll say that he does say that but he'll actually say something that's a little different than that He believes that mike pence did the right thing in that moment and then he added in this But there are all these other things I would have done as well. That's all extraneous If he agrees with the pence move he should just say I agree with what mike pence did and to be clear Everybody he says he does when pushed on it, but there's always this other Kind of fast talking thing that goes on. So that's what I see I think it's super strategic by trump and I think there's an agreement behind the scenes with vavake in some way And let me explain what I mean by this trump is The trump results there are tons of you out there who said I love the trump results But there's a lot of people who say I don't like all of the bull in a china shop trump Aspects and I think trump is smart and recognizes that that element of the population is out there So what vavake is doing is saying trump is amazing. I would be a younger better version of trump Well, that protects trump because it dilutes the I like what trump stands for But I want to go in another direction, which is I think one of the selling points that desantis tried to adopt So I think what trump has done here with vavake And this is why he's not attacking him is he knows vavake is not going to overtake him But vavake takes some of what would otherwise be A vote that would go to others and it keeps it closer in the maga family. Absolutely. That's right That's that's kind of what I was trying to get at You know the beginning we're talking about this here and I also want to be clear again I think vavake is super smart. I like vavake I'm not I'm just looking at the political strategy that is unfolding here And if anyone disagrees with this they have to tell me What do you think donald trump is like if it turned into a vake and donald trump race For some if it really turned into that meaning that there was a chance that vavake could actually you think trump would be saying Yeah, he's great. He's smart. He's a good If he thought there was any possibility that could happen, right? That's even that's an even better way of putting it. I mean, you know, you have to go to that level and i'll just also say From the perspective of a political novice like vavake If he runs this gauntlet which so far he has done He is the standout we don't really hear about rfk jr. Anymore. I'm just saying i'm just saying notice that kind of fizzled I was a little I was a little ad i know guys and everyone's like, oh, he's gonna beat biden. That's not happening Uh, I don't think anybody thought he was gonna beat biden very well some maybe some there were people who were There were people who were saying oh 20% he's gonna beat biden. I'm like guys. I just don't see it I don't see it now. No one even talks about him anymore. Um, but anyway back to vavake If he is successful in this process and let's say he ends up either vp or maybe you know Maybe white house chief of staff or or whatever it may be it's some it's a remarkable success for him Right. Yeah, it's already a remarkable right. It's all it's already a big w I so it's not to say, you know that that this isn't Very well thought out in calculate different perspective of both trump and vavake They are both winning in this process is basically what i'm saying So when you look at it all makes sense because it works well for vavake it works well for trump But if someone's like well, I really think vavake is going to be the guy I got news for them trump has Zero concern that vavake is going to beat him or else he would be taking this in a very different direction right now 800-282-2882 by the way if you disagree with this analysis of the vavake aspect of this run and Also, if you disagree with me that there's six people who are still alive. I think everybody else should drop out Um, and I think if trump's not going to debate there should only be five people on the stage Uh in september when we have that debate out in california Do you think another thing i'll put out? Maybe we'd come back into this well we have we have todardixon joining us as well so we can get her take on some of this She'll be with us shortly, but The numbers didn't move a lot But my my sense is from looking at what the polls are and it's all you know, nothing is Pure science here. There's some art to this, but uh trump lost a little bit By not showing up to this debate now if that's all that it is that's all that it is But there are more debates Yeah, if he loses more in the next debate, does that then put pressure on him to do something different? I don't have an answer, but it's something that i'm thinking about right now I think that's a great question. We should talk about uh later in that in the hour Um and maybe next hour as to how that could play out and I think the fewer people on the stage the more trump's likely to lose Because the more focus there's going to be on a smaller cadre of potential contenders I I yeah and we'll open lines on this one 800 282 282 some products are created by inspiration to be better to help others achieve better outcomes every day That's the essence of what's behind chalks male vitality stack This all natural nutritional set of supplements is specifically designed for men to maximize their every day Deleting ingredient in this formulation from chalk has been proven in studies to improve diminished amounts of testosterone and men by 20 in just three months time That's vitally important because men on average she reduced amounts of testosterone as they age Not only that in a bigger picture most guys today have about 50 of the testosterone their fathers or grandfathers had a half a century ago You can credit diet stress and the pace of life for that get yourself set up with chalk today Do so online at chalk calm that's c h o q dot com save 35 off any chalk subscription when you choose my name buck in your purchase Process that's chalk ch o q dot com use my name buck for 35 discount for the life of that chalk subscription Try chalk you're gonna like the way it makes you feel Play Travis and bucks exton on the front lines of truth All right third hour of play and buck kicks off now Phenomenal guest joining us in this moment Kevin o'Leary Mr. Wonderful from shark tank entrepreneur investor And the guy who says often the most amusing stuff on the shark tank show cabin. Thanks for being here great spear Thank you. Let's start. I know you're up on capitol hill You're trying to advocate for the small business men and women of america, which is uh super important Uh, obviously the really the engine of of economic growth in so many ways What headwinds are they running into right now under this administration like what are they doing? What is this white house or this congress doing wrong when it comes to the small businesses of america? But let me paint the picture because I deal with this every day. I've got over 30 portfolio companies Primarily first and second generation families Uh in america, you know, we think about our economy a lot of people don't know this the s&p 500 Massive companies biggest index in the world, but they only represent 40 Of employers and many of the people at work for the s&p 500 those giant companies Those employers are outside of the united states Almost in some cases half of them depending on the company so Domestically who employs all of us it's small business And so what i'm frustrated about is right now you remember the beginning of this latest banking crisis when silicon valley bank and unfortunately run by idiots Went to zero, but that caused a ripple effect and what's occurring now is the regulators of small regional banks There's about 4,000 160 of them which really bank and provide credit for small business in america Are under tremendous pressure they're being required to change how much capital they have liquid on their balance sheets and basically what that means is they're closing their loan books So it's very very hard to borrow money anymore This is happening at the same time that congress has done a trillion dollars with a paper printing which it even hasn't gone off the dory It is called the inflation reduction act the ira and the other one is the chips and science act All of that money is going to be guys all of it not so much of it all of it 100 percent of it to s&p 500 companies You see ask me why the stock market's doing so well It's because it's got this unlimited lift of printed paper to go to them for free It's basically free money and yet nothing for the small guy nothing absolutely nothing now that is totally screwed up Inbalanced not fair and i'd argue on american Am i crazy and the answer may well be yes So don't be afraid to say that to people out there like yes, you're crazy It seems to me that we have never had a more financially illiterate group of leaders Both republicans and democrats but in particular the democrat party Has totally lost its way when it comes to business as a guy who is focused primarily on business Do we have good representatives from a financial perspective at all in your mind? You know, it's a great question and My answer is having now spent almost a year and a half going to congress and sometimes twice a month It's a mixed bag and it's really about executional skills at the state level and where i look at states I look at the governor you can consider The governor of a state is the ceo a lot of the policy around what happens So i've stopped investing in states like new york for example or massachusetts or california I don't put a dime in those places. They're not open for business and their taxes are too high My new focus is on places like north dakota west virginia, okla home at texas, florida those Let's call the managers governors senators whatever you want They're executing towards pro business whether it be big or small And they've made it that there's a very interesting dynamic occur to after the pandemic We have competition between states Now, why would you ever put money in massachusetts where elizabeth warren wants to take it from you if you're successful Or where aoc makes sure that no new jobs come to her jurisdiction Why would you even go there why fight with those people if they want to destroy their states let them do that I'll take my money and go to where i welcomed where i can sit down with the governor Burgham who's now running for president and say what can we do together here? What can we invest in same with florida same with texas? So i want to encourage people to make economic decisions wisely And to make sure that the people that vote for these individuals and i'm i'm not saying elizabeth warren isn't a very successful politician She is i just hate her policies and i think that's a fair debate to have i'm going to be going to the legislature in massachusetts in october I do i do some work at harvard where i teach you know young entrepreneurs and engineers And i want to make sure that we can get into a solid debate about good policy and veggie If we could get you and some of their staffs actually listened to the show Kevin and we're speaking to kevin ollery mr. Wonderful of shark tank for anybody's joining us in progress here Um if we could get you to sit down with all of the republican Candidates right now at once and you could give them One thing that you believe would be most important useful powerful For helping small business and really with it just a broader economy I mean if you could get one thing right in front of them So whether it's trump or whomever if they end up beating biden they could pursue it. What would it be? Right now i see this tramise I'd call it imbalance between the support that the s&p is getting the big companies in america And what we're not doing for small business and so we we have programs We have two big ones right now and I want to be very specific about this and i've actually done this With both the republicans and democrats sat them down when I get to the hill and very forte They'll take a meeting and their staff just as importantly and say okay. Let me get this right You have authorized a trillion dollars for the s&p 500 in two specific acts the chips and science act and the inflation reduction act the ira Where in those bills because i've looked at them you show me anywhere where you're supporting small business Your own constituents in your own geography With that represents 60 percent of the jobs created in your state Where's the support for them? And there isn't a single active act right now at a time when they need it more than the big guys The big guys have no trouble raising money right now the cost of capital for small businesses 4 to 5 percent All the way up to 11 to 17 percent in a matter of 18 months And nobody cares about them. So the only act I know that's active And I know you guys promote this quite a bit on your on your platform is the employee retention credit I also do that. I've got a business called wonder trust.com and all of my companies have applied for this And hundreds more and i go out of my way to say to those senators and governors You extend this act for me for 24 months for everybody in america that deserves to get access to this capital that they actually paid into Because what's going on here is My companies and many others millions more america during the pandemic 2020 2021 We paid our employees. We paid them even though they couldn't work We kept them on payroll. We invested in them our businesses and america and now you give us nothing I don't get it and that has not fallen on deaf ears I've even gone all the way to the ways means committee and i've talked to the you know the chairman and said Think about this you're going to have to do something for these small guys when things get worse in the months ahead Meanwhile, at the farm you've made sure that everybody in the s&p is just dripping with cash And nothing for the small guy extend this act for 24 months We've talked a lot on this program about red getting redder and blue getting bluer You just kind of hinted at this about the importance of federalism the governor and the ceo of a state I don't know what state your home base is in now. Uh, you can maybe tell people because i'd be curious But if you were advising someone young today and they were saying hey i'm thinking about starting a small business And I could base that small business anywhere in the country Where would you tell them it would make sense to go? And how much of that i feel fortunate bucks now in florida i'm in tennessee We have no state income tax The idea that I would pay 14 or 15 percent of my hard earned income To the state of new york or to california or to any other state is crazy to me But i'm curious we get a lot of questions buck and i do Hey, let's say you're 20 years old and you're about to graduate from college and you're interested Uh, or you're just 20 years old and you're you've got an entrepreneurship bug Where would you tell them if they could go anywhere in the country that you see the most? Dynamic business environments that they should consider Founding a company. Well, I mean, you know, that's you've hit the nail on the head There's a reason nashville has exploded Over the last 18 years. There's very few cities growing as fast as nashville Why a well managed state with no state tax the same things happening in florida the same things happening in texas Same thing is happening in north dakota. They just lowered their state taxes not zero yet But they're on their way there Every state that I look at that has moved towards pro business and lower state tax is growing So if you're starting a business and I advise all of my young entrepreneurs look You can run a business today from anywhere because 40 of your employees are not going to work in your headquarters That's post pandemic. That's what's occurred. That's that's our new economy america 2.0 digital And that means don't stick it in a place where they hate you where they put regulation on you where they overtax you and they don't Want you to start a business. They don't want any jobs Don't put it anywhere near a oc for example And why would you ever do it in massachusetts where the lisabeth one wants to tax you if you're successful What built this country and makes it great is entrepreneurs and that's who applies 60 of the people We now have this fantastic dynamic of states competing with each other Reward the good managers the good governors the senators with your vote and your business And make sure that you're punitive to ones that are not pro business And let's hope they get voted out of power because they are not doing their job and not carrying forward the american dream Anytime you tax someone into oblivion and you just take the government and over regulate rules You are forcing those businesses to do the right thing and that's simply move. That's how it works Kevin how Worried are you about a major downturn in the economy over the next call it year or so? I mean we've been told for many months. I used to see the golden sachs projection Oh 60 likelihood of a recession in the next quarter whatever going back now for a while Under the biden administration's tenure. Are we are do you feel like we're we're out of the woods or are we still just? Hoping and praying you know, that's That is the question for every investor in america trying to figure out this extraordinary situation We're in. I mean, let's just take stock of what we know We know that we have had the fastest rate hike cycle in almost history It's very rare that we've gone from basically zero to five percent in a matter of months that never happens and i'm five and a half percent We also know and this is extraordinary and i've never seen it before We're still at full employment anything under four percent unemployment is full employment So not only is your cost of capital gone through the roof But she still can't hire anybody to work in your business And at the same time we have the trillion dollars of free helicopter money coming in these two acts I talked about the IRA and the chips act and so this is a really strange force We have inflation going up and yet we're still printing money Like a self-american dictatorship. I mean, it's just unbelievable what's going on here We actually don't need all this money at this point But we're trying to do some things and you can blame any administration because they're always trying to figure out ways to print money And get votes. I get that but this situation now is an extraordinary one because we've got a lot of pressure points So when people tell me well, you know, there's a 60 percent chance of a recession in the next six months They have no idea what's going to happen. Nobody does and so when we're planning in our businesses Which we do each week We plan for every outcome right now it looks like a soft landing, but nobody knows that with certainty So you've really got to conserve your cash You've got to make sure that you have access to capital for inventory And you've got to keep an eye on your receivables and run your businesses a good manager same for a state Same idea for the country And so we're at an inflection point where rather a remarkable Presidential cycle coming up here for a million different reasons and you guys have talked about it quite a bit But at the end of the day what you're voting for and I don't care what party you're with Vote for good policy. What drives america is good policy. I've never made money in politics I make money in good policy and capital and money domestic and international follows a path of least resistance You want to make america america and american business the least resistive you want everybody to invest their money here Quickly last question for you What's the best investment you've ever made in your life? What is the one that you regret not investing in because people think a lot about the successes But i'm also curious what you passed on and you're like, oh, I was an idiot. I should have 100% gone all in on that Yeah, that's that's a good one Let me tell you what i've learned and this goes back to shark tank. I've been doing shark tank for 15 years I've seen thousands of pitches. I've looked at thousands of deals and each year I do You know 15 17 20 deals whatever it is and i'm pretty sure when i'm making them i know what i'm doing and i'm saying to myself That's going to be a winner. That's going to be a winner. You basically think you know The truth is you have no idea What happens three four five years later is the ones that you thought were dogs end up being Monster hits i'll give you an example when I just had a huge liquidity event in this woman comes on three years ago Anna sky was her name Skya and a sky and she had a company called base paws You take a swab you stick it in a cat where the sun doesn't shine you send it into the lab and she tells you Your cat dna And it can help the cat have a longer life and I said to her what are you out of your friggin mind I can buy your your sister's 2995. I can buy a new cat for five bucks A lot of cat people didn't like that comment america By us cats. I I invest my wife has cat. I get it. I don't you know anyways What happened was she said she was so compelling such a great entrepreneur such a really driving force on that set No one wanted to invest in it. They thought the whole idea was stupid I gave her the dough Three years later. She sells the business to one of the largest pet Divisions of a giant pharmaceutical company for over 50 million cash It was one of my best outcomes ever and I thought that gives you an example. You just have no idea It's serendipitous luck sometimes so I do a lot of deals and you know I've been working with let me give you example barber for example She doesn't even look at the number looks at it So I like the guy I like the gal. I'm gonna invest in him And by the way, the only reason barber gets to shark tank every year is I buy her a new broom Hahaha Kevin O'Leary everybody mr. Wonderful. That's a great line.
