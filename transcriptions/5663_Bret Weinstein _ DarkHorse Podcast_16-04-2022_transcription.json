    "text": " Hey folks, welcome to the Dark Horse podcast livestream number 120 something 123 123 that's that's a lot and you are. Oh, I am Dr. Brett Weinstein and watch this. You are Dr. Heather Hine indeed rhymes with flying. We are here today. Your friendly neighborhood evolutionary biologists friendly neighborhood. Maybe not your neighborhood, but somebody's. Yeah, and maybe not friendly to you if you are actively not making sense, but yeah, all right. Yeah, but these people in this sense. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So today we're going to talk a little bit about Elon's Twitter play and creeping hospitalization as predicted by the late great evolutionary theorist W. D Hamilton. Whether puberty blockers are actually temporary and therefore harmless and related to that why we are tolerating porn and maybe other things if we get to it. Yeah, other things. Maybe other things if we get to them. But let us start with some some logistics here. We have some we have a lot of craziness in our schedule upcoming. And we will end soon. Hopefully there will be a better way of communicating such things so you can go and look and see what's coming up. But that's not that's not happening yet. Our next dark horse livestream is going to be not this Thursday, but the following Thursday on April 28 sometime in the afternoon, probably around 4 30 p.m. Pacific. After that, we'll miss the following Saturday as well. We'll be back on Saturday, May 7th and then away for a couple more weeks before coming back to you for nearly back to back episodes on Thursday, May 26th and then May 28th. So it is Thursday, the 20 April 28th. April 28th is the next time we'll be coming to you. We got some good stuff coming in that time. And however, we will actually be live streaming to our patrons our patrons in the private Q&A before that. So we will be back on our private Q&A a week from tomorrow Sunday. Sunday, April 24th at 11 a.m. Pacific. So and both of those are going to be off the hook. That is on the schedule. Both of what? Those streams, the private one and the public Thursday. Yeah, there were a lot in the public list. So all of those. Yes. Yes. Well, I was trying to see something. Okay. So next Sunday, if you want to hear from us next weekend, please consider joining me at my Patreon where we have the Dark Horse private live streams. And that too will be improved in coming months. But we're not going to say anything more about that just yet. Now, if you want to riff on something, go for it. No, no, I remember the song by the band X, your phones off the hook, but you're not. No, it's one of the great song titles of all time. And it's lost because we don't put phones on hooks anymore. But you know, it is what it is, I guess. Yeah. It's kind of harsh, isn't it? Your phones off the hook, but you're not really to the point. X X X did that well. Yeah, they did. Yeah, they did. Yeah. Harsh, harsh, but true. Fair. It's clear. Yeah. Harsh, but true. All right. So, we are of course streaming on YouTube and Odyssey is chat is live on Odyssey. You can ask questions for the Q&A to follow this at www.darkhorseemissions.com. Because our schedule is so odd coming up, there may be some of those non-Saturday episodes where we're not doing Q&As, but we are today. And as always, we will start with a question from the people on our Discord server. You can get access to that community, which is thriving and lively by joining either of our Patreons. And also, Brett has a couple of wonderful conversations each month on his. So, this last week on Natural Selections, my sub stack, I posted something that I alluded to last week on Dark Horse about coming of age and what it means in modern times and how Margaret Mead understood it, how many years later Michael Moffatt, an anthropologist at Rutgers, understood it, who was doing kind of a participant observation, acting as an undergraduate even while he was actually in a tenured professor at Rutgers in a professional non-awful way. And I encourage you to go there. And then, so we're going to be hopefully not on the internet for a little while here, but I have already posted to land in subscribers inboxes this Tuesday. This is free if you want to join me at Natural Selections. Some of the questions that we alluded to, I think last week as well, where not, yes, actually, the next Friday is Earth Day. And we not related to Earth Day, but we did a workshop in our evolution and ecology across latitudes, year-long program, which included a lot of domestic field work and also an 11-week study abroad through Ecuador. And we basically asked students a whole slew of questions, many of which are simple, once you know or once you have derived the answers, and some of which are so complex that no one has the complete answers yet. But they are all questions about the Earth, questions about the seasons and the sun and the moon and the biota and the hemispheres and the tides and all of this. And so I have those will for free subscribers. Half of those will land in your inbox for Natural Selections on Tuesday. And then I posted a little bit less than half of them for paying subscribers for Wednesday. Yes, they're the kind of puzzles that make your brain last longer. Exactly. The kind of things, even if you know, like, why are the phases of the moon, what they are, figuring out how to describe it, right, is it will reveal things about what you don't know or things like, you know, if the moon is full, when does it rise, that kind of thing. Exactly. And as I was reminded, actually looking over those questions that we had given to our students early in this year-long program back in Fall of 2015, that we specifically said, you should aim to be able to have an understanding sufficient and a communication style sufficient, such that a very smart and curious sixth grader should be able to understand you. Yes. And that is that is an honorable goal. You know, when people, when you hear people talking about, about complex things or about things that they tell you are complex, and you can find no way in, sometimes it's because you don't speak the language yet, and you should be able to do some back and forth in order to learn the language that they are using. And sometimes, too often, it's because they either haven't bothered to or they actually have an interest in, not actually speaking in a way that you are capable of understanding, that other people outside of their little tiny intellectual tribe are capable of understanding. Of course, this is a form of gatekeeping. This is a, this is a form of making sure that the people with the credentials and the authorities can sort of stand over, lord over, tower over, everyone else, and thus make decisions on our behalf. And this is anti-democratic. It's anti-scientific. It's anti-humane. And we, of course, at Dark Horse, are exactly trying to do the opposite and we did in our classrooms. And we do in our book, Hunter Gatheries Guide to the 21st Century. It's dense sometimes. It's tough going sometimes, but we try to make it accessible because accessibility is not a sign that you're not doing important work. In fact, failure to be accessible can be a sign that you actually don't really understand what you're doing. Yeah, it's actually also it's a great way to make enemies. Being accessible? Yes, making things perfectly clear, right? There's a way in which most people aren't seeking to make enemies, though. That's not really a selling point. Well, you know, it depends. You know, you make your own choices in these regards. But, but yes, it does, it does make enemies, whether you like it or not. And, you know, the intelligent six-year-old is, is, is actually a higher bar than you would think. I mean, it's high. Six greater. Six greater. Six-year-old is, is a little tough for some of these. Actually, we did that with our kids sometimes. But, of course, we did, but that's not, that's not what we established. But these, but a kid, a kid is prone to hold you to a high standard of clarity. And they will find things that you might elide, you know, in your explanation, things you're a little vague on, that they, they will force you to, to describe. That's right. Now, we also, while we are not live streaming the following Saturday, at some point in that general milieu, there actually will be a dark horse episode that, that drops you with a guest. We won't say more about it now, but it should be, yes, it has a little extra complexity in the editing. So I don't want to promise a particular date, but there's, there's one coming, keep your eye out. And I actually wanted to give a shout out also, as you were mentioning Discord. We were invited, we can't go, but we have been invited to a gathering, there are apparently gatherings that are happening. Our Discord people are arranging to meet in person, which is so cool. And I ran into somebody at the supermarket and they, they invited us. So anyway, there's work. Yes, here in Portland, there's apparently quite a community. So, and we actually, we had dinner with a couple of, of people who we did not previously know, and I didn't ask in advance, so I'm not going to say anything more about them, but really extraordinary men. And we were, we're just, we're very grateful to so many of you for, for your being here with us, for being grateful, and for in this case, allowing us to learn from you as well. Yep, absolutely. We should never to stay on their gridside, by the way. Yeah. All right, so, I guess, without further ado, we have, as usual, three sponsors. We do not take sponsorships from products that we cannot either personally vouch for, or have a particular personal attachment to in some way. So, you can be sure when we are, when that green parameter is around the screen, or you hear that tone leading in, and we are actually reading ads, we actually do speak on behalf of these sponsors. All right. All right. Our first sponsor this week is Relief Band, a product that can help with nausea. Under ancient, ancient circumstances, nausea was generally a useful signal that something is off. You had eaten something you shouldn't have, or were near something emanating a bad smell, itself a signal that you should not get near it. In modernity, we still need to track our bodily sensitivities. We should not always choose to simply erase discomfort like nausea whenever we feel it. That said, some of modernity creates nausea that does no good at all. Travel sickness, for instance, can be agonizing and relief would be lovely. Enter Relief Band. Relief Band is an anti-nause risk band that has been clinically proven to relieve and prevent nausea associated with motion sickness, anxiety, migraines, chemotherapy, and more. Relief Band is 100% drug-free, and can be used for as long as you need it. Developed over 20 years ago, it is the only over-the-counter wearable device that has been used in hospitals and oncology clinics to treat nausea and vomiting. There are zero side effects. And now there is Relief Band Sport, which is waterproof, features interchangeable bands, and has extended battery life. We asked a friend to try it out. Here is her testimonial. I used to have nausea on a nearly daily basis from both anxiety and the need to take regular medication. Relief Band relieves my nausea in less than three minutes. Without the side effects, I was experiencing from anti-nause medication. It has entirely changed my life for the better. So if you've got nausea from anxiety, or car, or sea sickness, or something else you cannot otherwise disable, consider Relief Band. Relief Band makes a great gift for any time of year. Right now, they've got an exclusive offer just for Dark Horse listeners. Go to reliefband.com and use the promo code darkhorse to receive 20% off plus free shipping.

Our second ad this week, our second sponsor this week is for Vivo Barefoot, which regular listeners will be well familiar with. And increasingly when I speak about it to people I run into, they know about Vivo. So we know about Vivo Barefoot. These are shoes made for feet. Most shoes are made for someone's idea of what feet should be and be constrained by. And usually that someone doesn't actually know feet or what they can do. Vivo Barefoot does know feet and these shoes are a revelation. We love these shoes. They are beyond comfortable. The tactile feedback from the surfaces you're walking on is amazing and they cause no pain at all because there are no pressure points forcing you your feet into odd positions. They're fantastic. Our feet are the products of millions of years of evolution. Hundreds of billions of years. Billions of years, depending on how you count. Humans evolved to walk, move, and run barefoot. But modern shoes that are overly cushioned and strangely shaped have negatively impacted foot function and are contributing to a health crisis, one in which people move less than they might, in part because their shoes make their feet hurt. Vivo Barefoot shoes are designed wide to provide natural stability, thin to enable you to feel more, and flexible to help you build your natural strength from the ground up. Foot strength increases by 60% in a matter of months just by walking around in them. The number of people wearing Vivo Barefoots is growing. It's an odd little club, easily recognizable because the shoes are a little unusual looking. But once people start wearing these shoes, they don't seem to stop. Go to vvobarefoot.com slash darkhorse to get an exclusive offer of 20% off. Additionally, all new customers get a 100 day free trial so you can see if you love them as much as we do. That's vivo, v-a-r-e-f-o-o-t.com slash darkhorse. Our final sponsor for today is BrightMove. BrightMove is modern recruiting software, otherwise known as an applicant tracking system or ATS. If you're working a staffing company or an RPO company or an HR department, you know exactly what an ATS is. And if you're not using BrightMove, you are missing out on the opportunity to make more placements and hires. Now this is a weird sponsor for us, a bit of an odd sponsor for us since we don't have any reason to use the product. So why are we here talking to you about it? We are proud to be sponsored by BrightMove because it was co-founded in 2004 by the current CEO, David Webb. Brett's experience with David was that during Unity 2020, he showed up to volunteer, took on a great deal of responsibility, and initiative in planning and crafting the technical aspects of the rent choice voting platform, which was fantastic. He's all around a great guy and we have heard from other people whom we now respect that this product is terrific. So BrightMove's co-founder is mission aligned with DarkHorse, but what makes BrightMove the ATS fender for you? New software features are released every three weeks. The BrightMove user base, who are recruiters and hiring executives are the ones requesting new features.

Actually, it raises a pretty interesting question, which is how do you know what to trust? In the case of something where you can't assess the product directly, but you do know that it's produced by somebody who is a stellar human being who has displayed high competence in a similar realm. Competence and integrity. Interesting person, obviously. He has gotten where he has gotten through some very unusual personal characteristics, but in any case, in recent weeks, he has become obviously and publicly interested in the state of Twitter and potentially doing something about it. So he initially took a substantial stake, became its largest shareholder, was apparently headed to the board, decided not to get on the board, which was interesting. There was a reason for that. I'm not sure he has said this exactly, but there was a limit to how much Twitter ownership he could have and be on the board. And so he decided not to join the board and then announced a plan to effectively acquire Twitter by buying up stock. $43 billion worth or something like this. In any case, the reaction to this was an all-out freakout by many, many people and Twitter itself responded by announcing what's called a poison pill strategy. And the poison pill, so taken from the idea of somebody who doesn't want to be captured would rather die than be captured, who might take a poison pill so that they can't be tortured and give up information, the poison pill is a business strategy. They started in the 80s, there are several different flavors, but in this case basically it's a plan in which the acquisition of stock above some threshold will trigger Twitter to issue to stockholders except the one in the triggering position, stock at a greatly discounted price, thereby driving up the cost to acquire it. And this is a very effective strategy to prevent an acquisition. I will point out, I don't know if you will remember this, but our good friend Mike Brown, former CEO of the NASDAQ and CFO of Microsoft, is an accountant. In Microsoft's early days. Yeah, in Microsoft's early days. He is an accountant by training and he once told us a story of an accounting ploy used to prevent acquisitions, went by a very different name, which I remember to this day, which is a prickle ball. And the idea was a prickle ball was another financial structure that would cause the swallowing corporation to gag and cough up the corporation that had been acquired. It's somewhat slimier, but otherwise, the tax, otherwise, the tax, which actually reminds me a little bit of your poison frogs that you studied, which also on occasion would be swallowed by something that would then think better of it and cough them up and they would hop away. I saw this precisely once. They Boa took in a poison frog and chewed on it for a while and finally spit it back out and she went on to become a successful mother. The frog did. Yeah, which is an amazing, amazing to have seen that even once. Yeah, extraordinary. Yeah, especially if you can track the animal and know that in fact it goes on to reproduce thereby telling a rather complete evolutionary story. Luckily for me, I had already tattooed this particular frog, so I did not have to hassle it right then. Yes, you heard her correctly. She tattooed the frog. Yes, yes. Yep. These were not gorgeous tattoos. No, I never got led. I mean, they're small. Frogs only have two layers of two layers of skin to our threes. You have to be really careful not to go that deep. I didn't get to like mom with a heart or anything. They were alphanumeric codes A1, B2, C3, etc. Yeah. Well, in any case, there's a lot we could we could. Prickleball. Prickleball. This is why these people tune in because there's often a hidden evolutionary connection and well, I'm tattooing frogs is the hidden evolutionary connection. Yes, to this counter hostile takeover strategy. Anyway, there are aspects. So as I said before, I think there are multiple different kinds of poison pills, the poison pill that Twitter deployed was this particular that I think it's the most standard poison pill that is typically utilized. I don't I don't know a ton about it. Even though I'm you know that I'm actually quite the investor. The investor. Yeah, I'm a I'm a very good investor investor born into the wrong portfolio. That's pretty much what I've concluded. Is that right? Yes. So you've invested in? Well, not the right stuff, but I would natively invest in the right stuff is kind of the implication. So yeah, I don't think I know what we're talking about. No, I don't know. I was often a cul-de-sac, but the point is or the point that I wanted to make about this is that the whole question about why Elon would acquire Twitter, why he would seek to acquire it. He made very clear as he ran his poll on Twitter about whether or not we users felt that speech rights were properly protected there. And in comments since he's made it quite clear that his purpose isn't exactly about the financial potential of this investment that he is actually concerned about what is happening on Twitter that affects what we do, what in what is clearly our new public square, which is a really interesting phenomenon. He, you know, the wealthiest person on earth at the moment is in a position actually to move pieces on the chessboard of planet earth that others simply couldn't. I wanted to connect it though to a concept that we have talked about here on Dark Horse many times. The tagline is zero is a special number. And what we have meant by zero as a special number is that there are lots of places where you in order to engage in a certain strategy need exactly zero alternatives to be present. So the idea is if there was a American university for example that had declared itself immune to wokeness and intent on simply continuing the practice of teaching people to think scientifically, logically, reasonably teaching them about important facts of history rather than indoctrinating them into the belief that all white people are racist or that the reason that men out compete women athletically has to do with the patriarchy or something like this. If a university declared itself interested in teaching in the way universities used to attempt to teach, it would obviously be the place everybody who wanted their children educated would send them. And so the point is that's the obvious strategy. Why aren't there any? And the answer is there have to be none. If one university declared that strategy and suddenly it was the new Harvard because everybody who had the ability to choose where to go would go there so they would not suffer the cost of paying for their own indoctrination but would actually enhance their minds, then of course that strategy would spread in university after university would pick up the strategy. So there have to be zero because if there was one it would win. Right? It does raise the question of what kinds of mechanisms are involved to keep it at zero. And I'm thinking within the university question, and we will come back to exactly this question in our next couple of episodes actually, but there are some new initiatives in higher ed that look promising. And until I don't know, three or five years ago, the University of Chicago seemed to be holding strong and saying we have the Chicago principles and we are not going to succumb to the crazy basically, but they stopped. So why did they, given that it seems like just at a fiscal level, the existing, in this case, elite university that said not us come to hear if you don't want any of that would just be drawing so many students that they suddenly have resolved any lingering economic issues that they have. Right. So we can talk a little bit about all that we've seen that has pressured people into embracing idiotic policies at their university or wherever else. The basic point is there is so much at stake. Right. For the Woke revolution, and the Woke revolution really is about certain people making a move. Right. They want to change where they are, and they may be justified and wanted to change where they are in civilizations hierarchy, but they're doing it by illegitimate means. And the point is there's so much at stake for them in keeping the number of universities that you can send your kid to at zero. But the point is you should expect them to spend an ungodly amount of effort or resources to intimidate anybody who attempts to evade this puzzle and create the first, you know, you know, to put down a flag that declares independence from from the movement. So the point is zero is a special number because zero has to be the number. If there was a newspaper that was reporting reality, right, we'd all subscribe. Right. So there can't be a newspaper that reports reality. They all have to suffer because zero is a special number. The corollary here, though, the reason that I think this is important in the current question about what Elon is up to and where we are is that zero is a special number and the implication of zero is a special number is that one is an equally special number. So this is a bid to get us a platform that works. Now, is it possible that Elon is not being straightforward and he has some other reason to want us to think that that's what he's doing? I guess. But he has been very clear and I don't see any real reason to doubt him. He's a guy who's made enough resource and has clearly having fun doing things that a person might choose to want to do, choose to want to be remembered for, and this sort of fits with that ethos. I think that's part of what angers people, frankly, but he's having fun at it. Well, and I think it also scares them because one of the things that works in favor of those who wish to hold the number of functional entities to zero is that in general, people who get control of one of these things are subject to the same incentives as everybody else. And so it doesn't mean that anybody's lost control. But in the case of somebody like Elon who can throw, you know, a vast sum at the problem and still not compromise his ability to do what he wants in the world, that's a frightening prospect, especially if what he wants to do is protect free speech rights. Because think about all of the stuff. I mean, given the last two years, I've been a marvelous example of the importance of Twitter not being a free space, right? All of the things that we have false consensus on, right, become very different. If suddenly, you know, you can speak openly on Twitter and nothing bad happens to you. Yep. Let me actually just point out that we're not going to show the video, but there's a video from Morning Joe this week and you can show my screen briefly if you want here, in which the hosts are talking about the bid and they are not pleased. Again, I'm not going to play this through, but one of the quotes, the salient quote from in here is the female host, whose name I've forgotten, says, Elon could actually control what people think. That's our job. Do they hear themselves? Well, probably not. And, you know, there's going to be a lot of arm waving, I'm sure to explain this away. But this is precisely the problem, right? When you reveal the man behind the curtain and you see that they're doing exactly the thing, that they're claiming they're afraid that someone else is going to do, and it seems more likely, actually, that indeed, that was a reveal of how many in the mainstream media view themselves, we are here to tell you what to think, because you plebs are not smart enough to understand yourselves. And if someone else comes along and says, I actually am interested in not letting you do that, it's as if the only possible reason they can imagine for someone to behave this way is with the same ill intentions that they have. Yeah, exactly. Now, what we think we are looking at, let's put it this way, because we don't know what is he's actually up to, this could be very negative, right? In other words, there may be some, as bad as Twitter is maybe it could be worse. On the other hand, it's hard to imagine how it could be, right? And when I say worse, I don't just mean unpleasant and nasty and slanted and all of those things. I mean, actually dangerous. And, you know, Elon has alluded to this. But think about the things that have been contentious on Twitter. I mean, for one, it occurs to me right now, articles of unity, right? Articles of unity was important, potentially, even if it didn't stand an important chance of succeeding in its objective. The point was it was about, hey, we've got a fundamental problem, we've got two broken political parties, and they have frozen everyone out, we've got to do happily that we need to deal with, and this is becoming more lethal by the decade. And grassroots works, and this was, you know, it was very grassroots. In large part, by spreading via social networks until, you know, yesterday, effectively, through actual social networks, not virtual social networks, such that people became aware that there were other people who were interested in solving a problem that maybe they had a little inkling of but couldn't quite put their finger on, or they knew very well that there was a problem, but didn't think that anyone else saw it like them. So this is in part, you know, the tamping down of projects like unity. The importance of that, as you just said, is not necessarily in the, but you know, but we could have one. Almost no one expected that there was a real chance in that first iteration of, you know, unity going to the White House. It would have been lovely, but that much of what it was doing was revealing to as many people as possible. We are out here. There are people who are thinking carefully and consciously and consciously and morally and compassionately and rigorously and logically about the same issues that all of you care about. And if you feel like you haven't seen anyone on the mainstream media about whom you can say that in forever, well, you're right. And here we are. And in the context of the last election, the ability to say that was all the more important because the critical thing at the point that you have two parties who nominate people as old as Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The question is, well, why would a party not be able to nominate somebody who is simply less likely to be mentally compromised by aid? Are there no young people as competent as though to those two that seems really unlikely? And in fact, if you look deeper, you look at highly competent people who couldn't get through the primaries, because that is after all how the duopoly maintains control for their real constituents who are the the corruptors of the system. And so the ability to simply have a place where you can speak the obvious, or you can say, look, we have a corruption problem. This isn't new. Yes, you're being told you have no choice but to vote for Joe Biden because Donald Trump is that much of an existential threat to humanity. But you were also told that about Mitt Romney and now you love it. So, you know, the ability to say that is important. If Elon were to succeed in saving one platform, then effectively he saves social media because once there is one platform in which you can say real things, how do the other platforms continue their campaign of suppression, right? Because the fact is, if you can't say real things on Facebook and you can on Twitter, then people are going to flood to Twitter. Because in general, this is about people wanting to hear things and the way to prevent them from hearing them is to stamp them out. So, they're just not sayable. Which, I don't know what order we were planning to go here, but I would point out that among the things that Twitter blocked the discussion of was Hunter Biden's implication that his father's influence was for sale, right? Specifically with reference to Ukraine, our ability to talk about the decrepitude of Joe Biden was also not permitted on Twitter. And so, the point is, well, you can say, you know, it was an election, there was chaos, but the point is these things are central to the issues of our current moment, right? We had a right to discuss it then because we are now suffering the consequences of not having discussed it. But don't you think it's good for democracy that we aren't allowed to critique our dear leader? Well, I mean, I can't believe that we are placed in the position that we are in. And actually, hold on. Yeah. Obviously, that was sarcasm. But the flip argument is also made. Back when Trump was president, it was, it seemed to be the case that many people thought it was bad for democracy. If you didn't critique the then person in the executive branch, which no one was imagining, well, you know, some people, some people on some people on the right may be imagined Trump in the same sort of, you know, dear leader role. But the, you know, the dear leader reference there with regard to Biden is, you know, this is, this is not what democracies do. We have the leaders that you cannot criticize when when they make errors or when they appear to not be up to the job is is indeed, and this harkens back to what we've been talking about in the last couple of weeks. That's what happens under totalitarianism, not under democracy. Exactly. Now, I want to go back to an error that I made during the election, which I have already acknowledged and pointed out, but it I am reminded of it this week. I said during the election that I didn't think Joe Biden would be sworn in. I thought that there that this was effectively a ploy that he was the person who was going to win the election. And then there would be a shuffle. Now, the reason that I thought that was that, you know, I sometimes say no matter how cynical you are, you're still being naive. I was being naive. I thought there was no way that whatever runs inside the Democratic Party, I thought there was no way that the DNC would put us in the precarious position in a world this dangerous in the middle of a pandemic with as much at stake in the world and as many hotspots that the Democratic Party would put us in a position of having a person who is clearly losing their mental competence at a rapid rate. Have that person be in the role of the presidency? That's so mind bogglingly dangerous that I couldn't imagine that they were going to let it happen. And so I thought they were going to do a swap with Kamala Harris. Now, I will say, and I can't believe that I'm going to say this out loud. Given what we are seeing with Joe Biden, I actually think as terrible a president as I think Kamala Harris would be. I don't think we have any choice. I think the incompetence. And I don't know what you mean. We don't have any choice about what? Zach, could you play the video of Joe Biden from this week? So this is one of many versions of this. I think this is the New York Post's version. All right. What we are going to see is at the end of a speech here. Oh, here we go. All right. Now, that was an obviously confused old man. I take as I keep saying, I take no pleasure. I think he's a corrupt politician. So some people couldn't see that and want to describe what he is a confused man at the end of a speech who turns around and has apparently forgotten what he's supposed to do, reaches out his hand to shake the hand of someone who isn't there. So he shakes the hand with the air. And then he kind of stumbles around and finally exits the stage incoherently. And you know, if this happened once, that'd be one thing. But we have so many instances of this sort of thing. And it was so evident during the election. Right. The point is sad and it's dangerous. It couldn't be more dangerous. It couldn't be more dangerous. So what do you mean by we don't have a choice? I don't know what choice you're taught. An incompetent president has to be replaced and the chain of succession goes through Kamala Harris. Okay. And I don't want Kamala Harris as president. I think it's a terrifying prospect. And were she to become president? I think the other branches need to check her. She effectively needs to be kept from exercising power. And her purpose, therefore, would be to be a coherent person who can have somebody call them up in the middle of the night and say, we have a problem. We don't know if nuclear this, that or the other. We need a person whose mind is still functioning to be able to answer a basic question about what we do on behalf of the American public. And Kamala Harris is in a better position to do that than Joe Biden. Yeah. If she's kept from acting as an ideal on right. And you know, that's not unprecedented that you would have somebody step into the role and that they basically would be there as a caretaker rather than as somebody put in place to to enact imaginative policies or whatever. But we are just we it's hard to believe that in a pandemic with a war by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine that we could possibly tolerate a charade where the person in power is clearly not mentally capable of making difficult decisions. And therefore, we don't really know who is in power. Right. We have an unaccountable structure supposedly protecting our interests in an extremely dangerous moment of history. How could the Democratic Party do that to us? How have they not taken to our side? I mean, in his interest in the country, who's interest is it in to keep him in in that position at this moment? And so this is coming up here because you view, I believe, although you haven't said this here explicitly, Elon Musk's bid, which could be cynical, which could be about something that we can't see, but it has the potential to be a patriotic act. Well, what I know is that during the election, when it was the right time to talk about this, when the answer is no, actually, we can't elect Joe Biden, because even if you would have wanted him in his younger, more competent state, at this point, he is not qualified because he is not mentally there. That was evident during the election. And the point was Twitter was not a place that you could openly discuss it. Right. So, you know, having been on the wrong sides of those discussions, trying to point out, hey, we can't do this. It's unacceptable. Right. This was taken as support for Trump. Right. Support for Trump in a place where that was considered unacceptable. You have a choice between A and B. I don't think so. I want a choice beyond A and B. I don't like A and A, therefore you're for B. I was about to tell you that I like neither option. Nope. That's the choice. If you don't like A, then you must like B. We are forcing you into not just choosing B, but liking it. Right. And so, I guess what I would say is that this has been an interesting week because we have the platform, or one of them, that did so much work to prevent the free exchange of obviously important ideas, like is this person mentally competent enough to be elected to this important office. Right. We have that question reopened by Elon Musk's move, but we also have vindication, even if I wasn't right, that he wasn't going to take office, which obviously I wasn't right, but I was right that his level of infibrillment was significant enough that that was an obvious question. Right. It has now become all the more obvious. And so, we have to be able to discuss the obvious in everything that is like the public square. We therefore need to go from zero platforms, which tolerate it to one. And I think what Elon is gambling on is that if we go to one, it will go to many. Right. Once you have rescued one platform, people aren't going to stay where they're infantilized on Facebook or Instagram or wherever. They're going to go to the place where they can have adult conversations about important things. And, you know, I appreciate whether he succeeds or fails. I appreciate that Elon is trying to do that with Twitter. And I really want to see it succeed. Even if it's a disaster, it is essentially certain to be better than it is. It's hard to imagine how he could make the situation more dangerous. Well, that actually, I think this idea that the duopoly in the, at least, the American political system, which enforces winner takes all and has seemed to trickle down, if you will, into an enforcement at the individual level of if you're not a then you are being not only are you be, but you're going to like it. This is a social construct. This is inherently a social construct. There is absolutely no reason for there to be two and only two options in any political sphere. And, you know, every, everyone above the age of five knows that, right? There are not just two options. And so there is this simultaneous, I will say, and here's the segue, move to force social things, which not only have fuzzy borders, but tend to have lots and lots of instantiations and far more than two categorical states into a binary. And thus make force people into sort of blustering and getting flustered as they say, no, just because I don't like Biden doesn't mean I like Trump, that sort of thing, right? And simultaneously, there is the opposite thing going on, where there are some things in the universe that are binary. And we've walked through it lots of places in our book, many, many places, but sex is one of them in animals and in plants and in other languages on this planet as well for reasons of anti-sogamy of intermediate sizes and shapes of gametes not being stable. We have males and females, okay? And this binary is being up overturned as if it is the social construct at the same moment that we are seeing the binary imposed on a political sphere where it has no place. So there's something very bizarre and so backwards in both directions there, like, can you just flip your assumptions, you know, produce your assumptions as low as possible. But in this case, the entire foundation that you're building both your sort of political understanding of the world and your understanding of the sexual world and therefore relationships and everything else is backwards, backwards. Yeah, it's interesting. It's almost the same phenomenon that we saw with pandemic policy, where it's like at some point you realize this isn't just nonsense, it's upside down. It's upside down. Everything you shouldn't be doing and so I guess what I like your point here quite a bit. If it's binary, we're going to pretend it's a continuum and if it's a continuum, we're going to insist that we describe it in a binary term. Yeah. And you know, I was also, reminded of been watching Andrew Yang do what he's doing and I was reminded, you know, we had people who I am certain are competent, are young enough that they are not going to lose their marbles in office who like America, right? That simple, those three things, I mean, you know, during unity, we laid out three characteristics, but this is even simpler. What were the three against? The three characteristics just now, just now are competent. Yeah. Young enough. Young enough that they're not going to lose their marbles and they like America. Yeah, patriots enough. Right. So my feeling is if you approach Andrew Yang, right, you say Andrew, I got an idea for how we could make stuff better. You know, here's what I know. A, he'd like to make stuff better. He's going to ask good questions like, well, here are some downsides that might accompany such a plan. Are they worth it? Right. So how I just don't understand a universe in which you had somebody in that office forget political spectrum, party ideology. I don't care just anybody who can think and likes America and is trying to do the right thing by it would be preferable to somebody who's losing their mind is corrupt and, you know, has higher priorities. And ideological, you know, beholden to a belief system that is not, we are all Americans. I am the president of you, the other Americans, and you know, we have we have audience all over the world. So I'm not pretending that everyone listening here is an American. But if you are the president of the United States, you need to have a kind of patriotism. You should not be a nationalist. And this is a distinction that you have made very, very often very clearly. But you need to have an appreciation of the country that you hope to lead. Because if that isn't true, there are a whole lot of us. I hope still a majority who think that there is so much worth saving here that if really what you're trying to do is overturn, you don't have any place in the executive branch. And I'm not saying that that's what, you know, Biden is or Harris or any of the rest. But the ideology underlying so much of recent policy on the left does look like that. And when you look at the, you know, when you go in deep on some of the sort of founding principles, not of the Democratic Party, but of places of organizations like Black Lives Matter, you find precisely that. Well, I think what we also find is, and I don't like using these terms, I don't want it to be inflammatory, but I think the point has to be made very clear. If you leave a guy as compromised as to Biden, obviously is in that office during a moment like this in history, you are telling us that you don't love your country, that you are about something else and that this is a means to an end for you. There's something Machiavellian about a party, about the DNC, about whatever it is. I mean, we literally don't know who to call in an emergency, right? Somebody might know, but we don't know. We the public do not know who is acting as our president, because our president obviously isn't, he couldn't, right? And if he is, that's even more terrifying. I guess I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt and I'm imagining there are other people making decisions, and they're just telling Joe where to stand and what to say, but it's got to end. It's got to end. Somehow, somebody who loves America and is capable of responding logically has to be in that office, even just for emergencies. So the segue is to the actually binary system. Oh, yes. Of sex, which if you if you're done. Yep. And we have here this week, not working. No, no, no, please Zach, please take it off. Thank you. Please don't put on my screen until I say so. All right, so we have now you can now you can show my screen. We have from fourth wave now, which is a reference to we need a fourth wave of feminism because the third wave is destroying us. The Twitter account fourth wave now, which is terrific, has tweeted a video, which we will show you a little bit of, called puberty and transgender youth from a an organization called amaze.org, which sells itself as a sex education for young people. Although when you look deep into their site, you find them interested in speaking to people younger than young adults. As fourth wave now says about this video, this is one of the vids that a New Jersey school district is considering for fifth grade sex ed. And then we don't, I won't read the description here. If I may have my screen back, Zach, and I'm going to ask you to show the video in just a minute. Oh, what has happened? Here we go. The YouTube video in question has a, actually, if you could put it up, Zach, I'm going to, I just want to read the description before. Yes, please. If you could put it up but not play it yet so that I can show the description on the video. So I'm going to read the description on the video, which you guys can't see yet. There is. Everyone has a gender identity, a feeling or a sense of being male, female, or somewhere in between. Sometimes people's gender identity matches their bodies and sometimes it does not. Someone may be born with a penis and identifies a girl or born with a vagina and identifies a boy. This person may have a gender identity that is called transgender. What's important to remember is that people deserve to express themselves in ways that feels right for them and to be respected no matter how they identify, look, or dress. So we haven't even watched the video yet, and we're not going to watch the whole thing even though it's short. But they begin with a premise and so many, so many of the arguments over in trans activism land and in let's teach little children sex ed land now are just making claims that aren't true and they say them as if they're the most obvious thing in the world and they connect them to things that are true and it becomes hard for people who are embattled or in any way just tired of it and don't want it to be their main thing to separate these things out. So this begins with everyone has a gender identity. Really? Like that's a new concept. That's a social concept. Gender, as we have talked about in the past, we understand it to be the human equivalent of what in non-human animals is called sex role, which is variously the software to the hardware of sex or in animals, the behavioral representation, the behavioral manifestation of the sex that you are. Gender identity is frankly, if it exists at all, is certainly not intrinsic and fundamental and basic, it is regressive and usually it's going to be frankly misogynistic if it's going against any particular sex at all in that it basically says if you are interested as a child in things that traditionally have tended to be the wheelhouse, the bailiwick of the other sex, well then your gender identity is the other sex. So if you're a Matthew little girl, your gender identity is male. Well, this is sexist and regressive and backwards and horrifying. All right. Two critiques of it. One, the problem is it doesn't, it basically is promoting a wish, which may be transient to a state of being. In other words, you might want to be the other sex, but it doesn't mean that you are the other sex, identify as the other sex. It could be a legitimate want or it could be a passing phase, but it doesn't really make any sense to promote it. As you point out, it's either the behavioral manifestation or the software of sex and so the point is gender is, but gender identity is like a step further in terms of crisis. It means if you wish it, then it is. And that doesn't- As if it's something internal, which right, it doesn't, it does not add up that you would promote it. And the other thing is, the need to have this conversation, right? You may wish that you were the other sex and not be in, and essentially you are, has never been less because the freedom to be whatever you want to be, to do in the world what you want to do, to fall in love with who you want to fall in love with. That freedom is essentially total, at least in the West, right? Or at least it was becoming so. And I feel certain that this begins to undermine and reverse many of those games. So before you keep going, let's just show a little bit of this video. Zach, I think I told you how much of this video to show. Okay. Hi, Fish. Come here. Oh, you need a name. Let's see. Wait a second. What gender are you? A person who is transgender is someone who's internal sense of their gender, being a boy, girl, or something else, doesn't match their physical body. People who feel this way sometimes feel anxious when they begin to reach puberty and their body starts to change in ways that don't match their internal sense of their gender. These feelings are totally normal. If you feel you want more time to explore how you feel about your gender before your body starts to change, it's important to talk with a parent, counselor, therapist, or doctor about the feelings you have regarding your gender. After some discussion and counseling, you may be referred to an endocrinologist. Endocrinologists specialize in hormones, and they are the most likely to prescribe puberty blockers for someone who wants them. Purity blockers are medications that will stop your body from changing. They are usually given as an injection or an implant. They block the production of hormones to stop or delay the physical changes of puberty. The effects of the medication are only temporary, so if a person stops using puberty blockers, the physical changes of puberty will begin again. So the effects of the medication are only temporary. So if a person stops using puberty blockers, the physical changes of puberty will begin again. This is a claim with no connection to reality. And put that together with the claim that was made on the banner but not spoken in the video. So for those just listening, there was a banner across the top near the end of what we just showed you that said, unfortunately, not all health insurance covers the cost of puberty blockers. We are experimenting with children. Those children experimented on will never be the same. Some of them will be okay. Many of them will not. And they will have every right to come asking of the adults, of all of us, what it is that we were doing, what it is, how it is that we allowed giant numbers of children to be halted in their development, pretending that you can do that with complex physiological anatomical, yes, endocrinological systems, and that it will all be fine, that you can just say, stop for a while. And then if I decide I'm fine, I'll go back to it. And you do that furthermore to a child who was already feeling anxious and confused and maybe hopeless and maybe a lot of other things. But no child who's feeling awesome about things and is going through a developmental period in which things are going smoothly decides actually I'm the other thing. So these are children who may be for completely normal reasons and maybe because they are undergoing undergoing other trauma or they have other mental health issues, have decided that they have found the solution. Or maybe even worse, that they don't even know what the solution is, but what is being sold to them is if you aren't sure, here's what we're going to do for you. Having done that to them, they are guaranteed not to be able to walk back into a normal development or a normal life ever again. Yes, it is a case in which we are falling down on our most fundamental responsibility to children. We are supposed to give signposts and beacons that lead children into the state of being that is most likely to be one in which they can be effective and feel fulfilled and rewarded and find companionship. And instead we are telling them things that we know aren't true. Right? There is no reason that it should be true that you can start a puberty blocker and if you change your mind, stop the puberty blocker and just pick up where you left off. Yeah, that was quite something. Yeah, so for those watching and listening, our lights just flickered, hopefully we can finish the podcast. Hopefully we can carry on that was quite the lightning strike, I assume. But anyway, the point is you're talking about a radical intervention into a complex system in which we already know that it's not a stop it will start it will system. We have the evidence of that how bad it is we couldn't possibly have the evidence. We'll find out when hundreds of thousands of people have had their puberty stopped and restarted and we see what the full effects are over the course of a lifetime. But it is radically misinformative. And then we are also just even the way that video starts. Right? Everybody has a gender identity and sometimes people's gender identity doesn't match their sex. And the answer is, look, kids part of what being a child is is getting enough experience and where you can't get enough experience getting enough information from people who have seen a larger part of the world about how common things are. Right? So imagine a child lying in bed looking at a shadow in their room and imagining it might be some terrifying thing. Right? And the adult's job is to come in and say, nope, there aren't any terrifying things here. In fact, in my whole life, I've seen seven things that are terrifying and they were, you know, they were grizzly bears in Clay Shrinach and the park or whatever. They were never in your bedroom. Right? They were never in your bedroom. The thing is that those things don't exist. And so when you tell a child, those things aren't here. They're not under your bed. They're not on the wall. They're not in the closet. They're not in the neighborhood walking the streets. Right? They're not. They don't necessarily get it right away. But the point is, their experience begins to match what you've told them and they will over time to come an adult. Who knows that those things aren't there. Right? Whereas if you tell them, oh, yes, having a gender identity that is out of phase with your morphology is something that happens to lots of people. Right? You are giving them the exact opposite of information so that to the extent that they have a stray thought that doesn't feel like it fits somewhere, they don't gravitate to aha. This is that thing I saw in that video. Right? If I'm a girl who wants to have short hair, I must have a I must be a boy inside. Right? This is I mean, at the moment, I've been I've been flabbergasted and angry at many aspects of this for a for a long time now. But then at the moment, it's the explicitly anti woman, anti female, sexist, misogynistic, regressive part of it that is just that is just amazing because it is coming from the people who brought us the Me Too movement who brought us who are supposedly the standard barriers of feminism. But it is this third way of feminism, which is regressive, which I have for many years called, you know, faux feminism and which for which we have fourth wave feminism, you know, fourth wave now accounts and others suggesting boy, do we need a fix? Boy, do we need to get back to thinking about, you know, why? How it is, for instance, that straight couples can live together in, you know, in love and harmony and not try to make each other into the other thing. Right. Right. Because men are not women and women are not men. And on average, men do tend to, for instance, be better at just style of things and females men know women tend to be better at detail styles of things. And there are some amazing brilliant women at just an amazing, brilliant, brilliant men at details. But pretending that if we're going to live together as equals, in which we both respect one another, we have to be the same thing is backwards. And imagining that what you can do is say, Oh, well, I'm actually good at some of those things that have traditionally been and maybe more likely to be on the domain of men. Maybe I'm a man. No, no, I'm not. And neither is any other woman who has ever been good at math or sports or, you know, anything, a science, like all of these things that are so powerful. And what crazy world would say if you're interested in those things, you're actually a dude. I can't believe we're having this conversation in the 21st century. It's unbelievable. It's crazy. And the fact is, you know, the facts, they're plenty good enough. Yeah. You know what? There are trans people. They are very, very rare. The chances that you are one are very low. The fact is some trans people may not have come out because there was a lot of pressure not to do so. That is back in the day. Back in the day, that has become much less significant. If you think you might be trans, you ought to wait a whole bunch of time and figure out if it clears up because it does for most people. And that's certainly the simplest way to go about it rather than doing some radical medical experiment on yourself that will probably leave you infertile and disrupt who knows what other processes at the same time, right? There's nothing wrong with the facts here. The facts are conveyable. And then a rare case where those facts are salient, they can be conveyed. We don't need to pretend, right? It just is preposterous. Are we where we're going on this? Because something. Well, you wanted to also talk a little bit about pornography. Before we do that, before we do that, I want to do one other thing that just, yeah, wow, more light. That's not so common here. That's not thunder. We're hearing. Well, we're hearing the thunder. But I'm thinking it's the same phenomenon. What did you say? Producer Zach? It is. Producer Zach is 18. Now, we had a birthday this week. Our first born is now an adult by in the eyes of the law. Yes, we can literally not tell them what to do anymore. We have to ask nicely and let the chips fall where they may. That's not a match for anything in our family. No, none of it is. But so I wanted to, I had this incident on Twitter. I think it may even have been yesterday. There was a hashtag game effectively. People start these things. They start a hashtag. And people respond to it and it trends. And anyway, you see what the. Is there a game to it? You said kind of. Yeah, the idea is, so this one was stupid thing women, stupid things women do, which is not the kind of hashtag I would usually respond to. But in this case, an amazingly good evolutionary joke occurred to me. It was perfect in almost every regard, but one, right? Very, very deep. And educational. And the one way in which it wasn't such a great joke is that I knew nobody was going to get it. But. That doesn't always stop you. No, no. And in this case, it didn't. I. What did you do? Well, here's the thing. Should I go look? Yeah, you got you have it, Zach. I can't read it. So the hashtag is stupid things women do. And my response is. My house is. Which you now you know. So here's the thing. All right, making a joke that nobody's going to get isn't the best thing, but not making that joke and living the rest of my life knowing that I failed to make it. How was I going to do that? See, that's that's that's a frankly a male brand condition right there. How will I live not having made the joke that no one was going to get? Well, anyway, just fine. It's not gonna I'm pretty sure it's not going to get funny for my explaining it, but I do think so that people will get the next such joke when somebody else has such a great opportunity. I think I should because it was interesting what unfolded, right? I don't know. I don't know. Several people corrected me and they were like Brett men also do my shirt, right? Of course, of course, of course, that happened. Right. So anyway, cut does he not know? Oh my god. So I here's the but I think you'll see why this is relevant to this conversation. I mean, already kind of do it. But here's why the joke is hilariously funny if you're and therefore what it means. Right. Yeah. So myosis is the process by which a deployed individual that is a person who has two versions of every chromosome produces a sex cell that has only one chromosome of each type and then two sex cells from two different people get together and they restore that deployed state and then as I go or two different zebras. Zebra? Well, you've you've been just talking about humans, right? No. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, definitely. This does apply to zebras. I should have said that. Thank you. All right. Sorry. But okay, here's that's what myosis is. Right. So somebody responded to me, which obviously males and females equally engage in. Right. Right. Somebody responded to me. Men also do myosis and I responded to them. Yes. But what choice do they have, right? Which is really the key to the joke because women do have a choice. Now they now individually have a choice. But here's the amazing strange counterintuitive weird evolutionary underpinnings of the whole crazy state of affairs is that females could clone themselves instead of going through myosis and they could produce an exact copy of themselves. And although that seems weird to us, in fact, it has a huge evolutionary benefit to it, which is that if you produce a clone of yourself instead of dividing your genome in half and only passing half of it onto each offspring, it is evolutionarily twice as fit. So there's a question about why, given that females can double effectively double their fitness by cloning themselves rather than engaging in sexual reproduction as these fancy lizards have done. Yeah, Zach, do you want to put up those fancy lizards? Mm hmm. My screen. Yeah. So these are Whiptail lizards. This is Nemedophorous Uniparents is the species. It's all female. They actually continue to have to engage in pseudococulatory behavior in order to get their eggs to drop basically. There's some complicated intercological explanation, but they are they are an asexual species, which descends from a bisexual species, which has males. But all females lay eggs that are 100% related to them. Now they do engage. They actually do engage in meiosis. And so it's complicated. But they also occasionally get input from stray males. And that keeps things interesting. Yeah. So anyway, at some point, we will go into the details of that story and how it is the exception that proves the rule. But the basic point is there is a mystery, a big evolutionary mystery. It's not a little one. It's a giant one. Why females who have the capacity probably more easily than they do to produce a sex cell and join it with some half genome from somebody else and hope that this brand new combination never seen on earth before of genes is going to function well. That's a big game. And their immune system is going to respond badly to it. Right. That's a big gamble. Whereas I've made it to reproductive age. My genome obviously works. Why don't I just copy it 100% right? That's liable to be a much better bet. So why do females in no animal species do this without some men? We have to go back to the web tails, the occasional population with males. But the point is why, given how much evolutionary benefit comes from dispensing with males entirely and simply cloning yourself, why is this not constantly being attempted by females in every animal species? Right. So. And just to go back to the distinction between the sexes being the gametes that they produce, females producing large gametes that are full of the cytoplasm that is going to be needed to make a new life and also fairly cesial, fairly, fairly immobile and males producing small gametes have been stripped of almost everything, but basically half a genome and a motor and therefore being small and zippy and they do the job of finding and females do the job of bringing all the stuff that's necessary except for that half of the genome that the males bring. We are defined as we have long since defined that sex which brings the large immobil gametes as the females and that sex which brings the small zippy gametes as the males and therefore there are no all male species because male gametes can't produce, can't develop into young because they don't have the cytoplasm in the cell, in sperm or the pollen required. All right. So now the punchline of this whole discussion is that males and females aren't remotely alike. Right. It's not this whole contagious idea that we are the same and it's arbitrary and all of this is nonsense. In many ways, we are opposites and the point is females doing meiosis and therefore condemning themselves to the phenomena, to having to interact with males in order to produce offspring which puts them in one of two conundrums. Right. Females can either attempt to compel males to participate in raising the offspring so that they are not costing themselves by raising half a genome that isn't related to them. Right. Or they can accept the cost of raising a half a genome that isn't theirs which is a giant cost in evolutionary terms. That's the female predicament. So when this person responded, yeah, but males engage in meiosis too. It's like, yeah, of course males engage in meiosis but it's not a stupid thing they do. Right. It's a screaming great deal because they can't reproduce otherwise. Right. The point is females have a choice which they don't take which is interesting. Right. That's why the joke was hilariously funny I think it's good actually. Yeah, it's a pretty good joke for the, I don't know, a few hundred people who get it. But anyway, I thought it was, it's instructive seeing that even something like this for people who obviously know the term meiosis don't necessarily spot the asymmetry between male meiosis and female meiosis in terms of whether it's an obviously great idea or a paradox. Right. Or inherently obligate or at some level not for mammals at this point but but the fact that if at least if you go far back enough. Well, another way to put it is it is a choice but it's a choice that is always a loser if you make what seems like the better choice and therefore selection has stopped experimenting with it. Right. The point is, and asexual species don't persist. And actually this we will end up just saying a little bit about W.D. Hamilton at the end here. And one of you know he was you know one of the greatest evolutionary theorists. He died young, too young at like 63 in 2000. And some of his great contributions to evolutionary theory involved the evolution of sex. And specifically he and it was Marlene Zuck, right, who proposed the idea that this was about invasion of parasite loads. Yep. The Hamilton Zuck hypothesis. All right. I said one thing is we move on from my hilariously funny to a tiny number of people joke. Yeah. Which was it? Oh, yes. Another person commented and I feel because they were not wrong that I do not want to dismiss their observation. Somebody commented that women do not do meiosis that meiosis has done the eggs are produced before females are born. Which technically is largely true, not 100% true. The jury is still out on this one actually. You know what? I got to stop saying that about science because you know it mixes the scientific and the legal as if that's fine. And I've taken issue before where what was a headline said that some scientific result was effectively like a legal standing. So it's not it's not the jury is still out. It's that reasonable scientists disagree about what the evidence means from it might even be drosophila like some other species which seem to have the ability to continue to produce eggs into adulthood. And it's not clear exactly what is true for humans. All right. So the jury has returned on the question of whether it is all right to say the jury is still out within science and the jury has decided it is not acceptable to say the jury is still out within science. That's certainly true. And the jury has now exploded in a puff of smoke from being too ridiculous or something. Yes exactly. But nonetheless the point about when meiosis is done in females is a fair question. But I will just say that it is in some sense the ancestral femaleness that has decided to continue engaging in meiosis despite the annoyance of having to deal with men. And that so the joke still stands even if there is that technical caveat. I rather enjoy it and I rest my case continuing to enjoy continuing to engage with men. Yes and I'm very pleased that this paradoxical is I find it. All right. Did you before we finish up talking a little bit just a little bit about W.D. Hamilton want to say the important or do you want to save that? I can save that one. Okay. On the hazards of right. Okay, which we which we also give just a couple page section to in our book. So you know the position that we understand porn to be bad for people is not is not one that we are producing today. But one that you will say a little bit more about in a future episode. Okay. W.D. Hamilton was as I have said one of the great evolutionary theorists he had many many contributions. He died at 63 after having gone to Africa in search of a the closest living relative of HIV. And he was he was he was looking at shimps and collecting chimp poop. And he contracted malaria. And after many weeks in the hospital back in the UK when after he'd come home he died. And at that point his collected papers were being his signs of the papers to being collected in volumes. So narrow roads through gene land in gene land. I've forgotten that I was looking at it. I was looking at these. I'm embarrassed that I don't I was looking at them so often this week and I've now forgotten which what the the letter is there. I'm with the word is there. But they're being collected. So you can look it up and tell me once you find it. The first volume was already out. I think those are the papers through 1980 and the second volume through maybe 91 something or maybe getting the dates wrong was in the editing mode at the point that he went to Africa. And so for each of these for each of these published scientific papers he was writing a preamble introductory essay. And sometimes the preamble introductory essay was far longer than the paper that it was then introducing. And then there was a third volume that came out obviously without any of his input at all that that completed the set. So is it narrow roads of narrow roads of gene land volumes one, two, and three. And the second volume which focuses on the evolution of sex. He writes an essay introducing a paper on the section of sex called The Hospitals are Coming. Now I was not able to get my hands on the book yet. It's still on its way to us. But I actually came to know to be reminded of this by this you can show my screen for a moment. Here's Zach. This psychology today blog Christopher Badcock PhD writes something called The Imprinted Brain and I actually came to find him. I'm just going to walk you through a little bit here because he had written a piece that I found a little bit actually a lot dismissive of Margaret Mead but it was his understanding of what her informants had had done his reporting of someone else's findings of what her informants had done that really helped clarify for me what some of the arguments in the anthropological literature were it's something I talked about last week. So I went looking at some of his other stuff and it's actually often quite good. And so he has this piece published March 20th 2021. So we're a year into COVID at this point called Global Medicalization has come with selfish herd immunity. And you can give me my screen back here now Zach but I am going to read a two paragraphs I guess from W.D. Hamilton's essay The Hospitals are Coming which was published as an introduction to one of his other scientific papers and was published after his untimely death W.D. Hamilton's Untimely Death in 2000. But written in the late 90s. So this is a piece written in the late 90s. Over the years of my working life W.D. Hamilton wrote, I have been slowly developing a paranoia about hospitals. The growth of hospital buildings and all the infrastructure of clinics, pharmacies, the increasing domination of our universities by medical schools associated with huge hospitals all over the developed world. The unending love affair the public have or a brow brightened have with medicine through the TV screenplays on doctors and on hospital life, accelerant birthing by Caesarean section, the indefinite increase of pharmacies even in the third world, the accompanying increase of our everyday pills that tumble from every bathroom cabinet. All these matters combined to tell us how we are heading. Happy in our progress for the present like children on a fairground roller coaster prattling of the genetic castes to come. Nope, that says castles but it looks like castes would just end up word. I'm just gonna start that sentence again. Happy in our progress for the present like children on a fairground roller coaster prattling of the genetic castles to come. We skim onward, uninformed into the bowels of a great planetary hospital of the new millennium. My dread is even worse. It concerns how by the time our joyride ends we will realize that we have come into the concrete heaven of our TV dreams but only at basement level. That's one. I read the second paragraph. Increate the again from W. D. Hamilton, written in the late 90s. Increasingly electronic upper and admin levels in my hospital would look after us in much the same way as the genome of the carryout of the eukaryote maintains a remnant genome sufficient for the purposes of the overarching nuclear ruled hole requires in the form of its one-time bacterial allies now going by names such as mitochondria and chloroplast. Were the bacteria perhaps learned that the eukaryote cells by chemical temptations analogous to our hospital TV dramas? Were promises held out to them how grand, dramatic and safe life would be once they are inside? Promises of how wonderful would be the biochemical machines they could play with and what dizzying and expert communication they would see flying by them on all sides? Were they told how they would be born aloft and moving palaces, humble denizens of soil and slime no longer nor even of mere least stationery stromatolites? There in the new palaces they would be fed, advised and cossited by the wisest of guides and companions chromosomes out of nuclei. Wow, all this for free a millionaire's life on a cruise ship and all for nothing so the offer to the symbiont may have seemed at first. So he is arguing that the symbiont which may not have gotten quite the deal it was hoping for may be seen as analogous to the world we are being offered with the increasing hospitalization but he further argues of course that our hospitals, the promises of the western medical system can't do what it is promising. It's an odd argument because I agree with him about the hospitals and all of the things associated with him. I don't agree with him about the symbionts. About their being an analogy. I think they got a good deal. Anyway, I think it's almost actually so clear that they got a good deal that it's almost a toptology because the fact is it's not like their relatives, now their ancestors did not get to continue on absent the partners. So let's talk about briefly because we're going along here what the distinction is because it's not, he doesn't say it is analogous but he says maybe this is like that. So in what way do you see the increasing hospitalization? That's hospitalization is the wrong word because that's already a word in use but the increasing medicalization of human health as clearly being an offer as if an offer by a would be symbiont that is one that we should be denying, refusing. I think my concern about it is that the hospital is part is in large part a parasite and to the extent it is not a parasite it is a moron because it is not paying sufficient heed to the down sides. It'll give you a pill that may indeed have a positive effect on whatever your condition is and it will fail to measure all of the downsides that you will experience. In other words, if you measure the effect of this pill on that condition you may see a reduction in pathogenicity but if you measure it all cause mortality mysteriously the person might die early. Right and the point is until you get to the all cause mortality measure you don't know that actually you came out ahead for doing away with your disease and you don't know about the collateral damage of for example prescribing antibiotics and creating superbugs that wouldn't otherwise exist and are much harder to get rid of and so you solved the problem in the short term and you created a problem in the long term. Right well I mean one of the obvious distinctions to my mind is that before two things were in were symbionts were in mandatory symbiotic relationship with one another they both existed. They both had the ability to exist and persist and they may well have if the symbiotic relationship has itself persisted that that is presumably better for both of them but when you're talking about humans being medicalized by being sort of ever pushed towards greater medicalization that thing that is medicalization that is hospitals that is pharmaceuticals that is whatever it is doesn't exist outside of humans so we are we are being invited in a forced in many cases to accept as a potential symbiont if you will something which we ourselves created which cannot exist without us and which does not have the inside of the complexity to to do our to do our bidding especially if we imagine that we are subservient to it. Right now I would argue another way to put that is that at best a hospital is a necessary evil and the problem is that the route from necessary evil to self-elaborating parasite is a very short route and especially when you have a profit-driven entity the point is the perverse incentive incentives make it all but certain that they will make this transition and the point is the cost will be to your health. Right it doesn't mean that the hospital isn't something you should be tremendously grateful for at the point that you've been in an accident and you're you know internally bleeding and there's somebody there who knows what to do about it. Right you should be tremendously grateful but the point is to have that thing that there is somebody who knows how to save me from my internal hemorrhage transmuted into this gigantic conglomerate that will cause you to make Faustian bargains you don't even know you're making and which further would have you believe that you unto yourself have no ability to heal yourself. Right right exactly and you know we talk about this in our book even simple things like I broke my arm and my better off going to my doctor or avoiding my doctor right you know and at the risk of having the usual things befall us there is a question about vaccines right there's a long schedule of vaccines that we give to very young children who are still involved in development and the point is I'm not saying vaccines are bad in fact I think they are fantastic in some cases and in some cases they are by far our best approach to numerous diseases but that doesn't mean that inherently vaccine is the right tool for every disease and it doesn't mean that there aren't important costs and so really the question is is this one justified to the cost benefits and unknowns add up to this one being something that I should you know accept for my child for example. Yeah now I mean it's a category error and it's the intentional I think in some cases abuse of the category to confuse people has worked it's like well vaccine is an amazing concept and some vaccines are brought into the world and are amazing therefore the the the implicit part of the argument goes as it scrolls away underground if you critique any of your your anti-vaxx and this is like saying I like dinner because dinner nourishes me and now it's nine in the morning and you say I need some nourishment you're going to need dinner dinner but it's not nope you're going to need dinner because dinner is the thing actually I feel like this is a category problem again and this is that would be one with you know no ramifications that matter at all but indeed it's like saying also I like dinner oh you're saying all dinner is good and if you're not saying all dinner is good therefore you're anti-dinner actually I've had bad dinners and that doesn't mean I don't like dinner right right and so it is this way with all of it and of course if you're going to have a prayer of making the right choices in a landscape in which you have a tremendous number of medical things that you could accept or reject you were going to make good choices a you would want an expert working on your behalf you would want a doctor and you would want that doctor informed by a system that did not have perverse incentives in it yes and the point is you know our system is so riddled with perverse incentives that why you think you're getting any thing like information in the first place is not clear right that's right it's a it's a system so broken it's guaranteed to fail as it does repeat it indeed well have we arrived I think we have arrived and the sun has come out ish right now it was out for like a minute or two there yeah and our our cat here was watching intently out the window actually went Fairfax went to the edge and I thought I was concerned maybe he was seeing a coyote out there it was a bunch of deer it was watching deer and he has he was not able to tell how far away they were and so he had this thought of but those tastes really get all that I could catch me with those. You see having a little reason to grant her. Yeah that's exactly exactly um all right so we for those of you who are listening and won't be hearing the Q&A we will be on next again on Thursday April 28th we'll be missing next Saturday but we'll be back in the middle of the following week and for those of you who are interested in the Q&A I can find it again we'll be we'll be back in about 15 minutes on Odyssey on YouTube you can ask questions for that Q&A and we'll get to as many of them as we can in about an hour um we'll get to all of them we'll get to many of them at www.darkhorseemissions.com if you have logistical questions uh like I have a thing I want to send them and it's nice you can you can ask darkhorsemoderator at gmail.com where you might send that again we will be having a private Q&A live stream in eight days sooner than we'll be back on the the Dark Horse platform which you can access by joining my patreon and until we see you next be good to the ones you love eat good food and get outside. Be a good one everyone."
