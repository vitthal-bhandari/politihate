Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome back to the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show. We're here in the second hour. We're going to talk to you about the latest in Ukraine and U.S. involvement, Western involvement. What are we going to do with our allies and how is this likely to continue? What's going to be happening here in the days ahead? You have a Russian demand this morning for the surrender of Mariopol, which is a city on... It's a port city. Leave on the sea of Azov, which is connected to the Black Sea. And this would be a land bridge. If they were able to secure this between two other important areas for the Russian invasion here in Eastern Ukraine, it would connect effectively the Donbas region to Crimea. It would be a connecting city between those two areas. It would also effectively block and bar Ukraine from water access, or come pretty close to it. So the Ukrainian government has said no. They've said that they will not concede the city of Mariopol on the sea of Azov to Russian forces, even though it's getting pounded with missiles. The Russian assault continues on. Now, I know that we try to focus on what this means for us here at home as much as possible and take an America-first perspective on our foreign policy in general. This was fascinating to me. I mean, this, I thought, was... It wasn't surprising, but it was worth noting to all of you. I understand it's data for Canada. I would love to see, and my guess is you probably will see similar polling here in the States. But this was done through the Toronto Star and some polling agency. I think it's ECOS. How should Canada respond to the Ukraine invasion? And they break it down by vaccinated versus unvaccinated. And this is for respondents. The vaccinated mind you was three or more shots. So, like, Clayov, and I wouldn't count. You know, if you just get one J and J shot, you're not... I think you're now... You're considered unvaccinated now. For the vaccinated folks, you are unvaxed if you only got the J and J. Let me just throw some of these numbers at you, Clay, because this... This is pretty clear what we see happening here. Imposing tougher economic sanctions on Russia, the vaccinated, 86 percent say yes. Seasoning assets of oligarchs, 85 percent of vaccinated, yes. Cut-off oil shipments from Russia, 81 percent. Sending additional military equipment, 82 percent. We'll go down a little bit here to providing Ukraine with fighter jets, 52 percent. Dispatching military forces to Ukraine, 30 percent. On the other side, you have the unvaccinated respondents imposing tougher economic sanctions on Russia, 13 percent. Seasoning assets of Russian oligarchs, 13 percent. Cutting off shipments from Russia, 21 percent. Dispatching military force to Ukraine, 11 percent. Now, this isn't a perfect snapshot of very complicated issues, but it does seem to indicate, Clay, that for people who are willing to listen to the machinery of state media and the apparatus, there is a correlation between, I will double mask, I will get eight shots if I'm told, and we need to do everything, including send troops into Ukraine to stop this invasion, because that's what our media is telling us needs to happen right now, or that we at least have some moral obligation to do more. Yeah, and this to me is part and parcel of the bigger picture here, Buck, which is not being able to analyze risk rationally, because there's a great story out in the Wall Street Journal today, where they break down everything surrounding the idea of kids ages five to 11 getting vaccinated, and basically the data doesn't support it at all. But this idea of the fear of COVID, what I've called for a long time, the fear porn is so all encompassing that they're unable to analyze it. And I feel like this is the same way. An emotional response to Ukraine is in some way justifying what is an irrational risk. In other words, your your your own individual risk from COVID, you are wildly over rating the world's risk of nuclear war, you are radically under rating and ultimately what it would to me ref reflects is a failure of your own risk analysis to make rational decisions, probably because you're being overrun by emotion as opposed to logic. And it's even there's even a correlation. Now, the no fly zone would be that's that's the most extreme military measure from the US and Canadian side that people have been talking about in a serious way. I don't think you're not hearing people say we should, you know, send, you know, we should land the Marines and then send in, you know, 82nd Airborne, but no flies and they've talked about. There is a correlation here. Can't say cause a correlation here. The more doses of vaccine clay one has received correlate with more extreme positions for intervention in Ukraine. So if you've received three or more doses, so you're boosted, maybe boosted plus 59% on this poll, say a no fly zones, a good idea to doses. It's only 34% vaccine, refuses 18%. So do you think do you think do you buy into this analysis book that it's emotion based decision making almost entirely? And emotion oftentimes. I mean, everybody out there listening to us knows you make a lot better decisions very often if you're emotional about a subject, if you sleep on it, right? Give yourself a little bit of time to think on it as opposed to initially reacting as your emotions might dictate. I always like to use as an example in the world of politics. Abraham Lincoln would hand write every time he got furious, hand write letters explaining exactly why he was furious. And then he would put it in his desk drawer in the White House and wait for a day to decide whether or not to send it. And he said most of the time he never sent the letters. And I love the quote from Benjamin Franklin passion governs and she never governs wisely. Social media age, we allow emotion to dictate almost every American policy action. It feels like this is this is about for people take positions now that the government and in the case of Canada, it is truly state media, which I think is interesting in our country. It's a fact, though, state media. I'm not even just talking about NPR. I mean, you see the relationship between the legacy corporate media and the Democrat party and the Biden administration and how cozy and colluding it all is. When you have 95% of news and journalism supporting one political party, you might you might as well have state media because that's what you're up against. The people that want to go along with this generally, I find are those who want to be a part of the herd. And they also want the validation from the information and political machinery, machinery around them of they're a good person, more than anything else. I believe this. I want to get the shots because I'm a good person. So I'll get three shots. I'll get five shots. I'll get 10 shots. It doesn't matter what the data actually says or what I observe about the efficacy of the vaccine to stop the spread. I do it because I'm a good person. And the same kind of thinking is reflected, I think, in the no fly zone support where people say we should have a no fly zone and it's because what they're doing is so terrible. The Russians are so awful. Putin's a monster and it doesn't matter if it means that we have us playing shot down that there be us soldiers put in harm's way that perhaps. Or perhaps there be open war with Russia. It makes me feel good to hold the position. And that is the way that I think a lot of decision making goes these days in politics. It is also very much pushed by social media and it's who controls the information flow. I mean, we see who gets to ban people for saying a man is a man. It's not Republicans, not conservatives who get to do that. And also, I would say, Buck, as our world is accelerating, it's easier to judge by what's going on. What occurs on social media and sometimes that can lead to awful decisions. And I'll from a humor perspective, we talked about the NCAA tournament going on. Rex Chapman, who is a far left wing loon is now part of the NCAA tournament coverage. And he's just he's awful at it. And the reason why he got that job is because Turner executives and CNN executives liked the fact that he was sharing left wing tweets all the time. And so this Ukraine strategy is driven by the same strategy that motivated BLM, that motivated the idea that you have to go get your COVID shot. And by the way, Buck, coming out of the weekend in Ukraine, are you even more confident that we're headed towards a negotiated settlement? And that the likelihood here is that Russia is going to get a substantial piece of Ukraine in order to win this war. I've from week from week two, maybe even week one of this fight, I've been saying Russia is going to seize. They're going to consolidate in the East. They're going to seize. They can consolidate Crimea, connect them and then decide that they get a by the way, that's where some of the pockets of Russian, primarily Russian speaking Ukrainians live. And they're going to say, well, this is now Russian Federation territory or Russian Federation protector. It that's how this thing ends. Even with a no flies on, which would be great. This thing doesn't end with Ukraine booting out the evil Russian invaders and taking back all of their lost territory. That's just not realistic. So now it's how quickly I mean, right now on CNN, the headline is Zelensky open to Putin talks, but warns of World War three if they fail. I would like it if this guy would stop talking about World War three. I'm just going to put that out there. It's actually not World War three. It's a war between Russia and Ukraine and their international actors who are trying to help and bring it to to resolve it. But we all know World War one World War two, those were different conflicts on a different scale. And I wish he would stop saying he even said we're already in World War three and one of his speeches last week. Like he should calm this down a little bit. That's not helpful at this moment. I also wonder as I'm watching him, by the way, Buck, to what extent is Russia still trying to kill him? Because that's the one that I think could really throw things for an emotional wrench here, right? And the reason why I bring that up is so much of right now the world defines Ukraine through Zelensky. And if he is killed and murdered by Russia, I think that's going to put things on a different emotional pivot because he is the personification of this war. And people who are responding emotionally are going to respond even more emotionally to his death. If it ends up happening, I think it would be the worst thing that could happen. I think it's certainly certainly for that death, but just in terms of acceleration. Yeah, I think the Russians and Putin would view this first to the lens of does it make it more likely that we get a settlement that we the Russian federal meaning the Russian Federation wants. This guy's alive or dead. If he's if it's easier if he's alive and then because I keep saying this, once the bullets stop and there's some kind of ceasefire, negotiate agreement, Russian oil, all this stuff is going to be within six months, maybe sooner. People are going to say, yeah, Russia's bad, but we have to do business with them. And Putin knows that that's what's going to happen. So is it easier to get to that state with or without Zelensky? I think in Putin's calculation, which I don't I don't know how he views that, but I think that's what governs how much they're trying to specifically go. After Zelensky to take him out as a target or not, if taking him out means that they get this thing ends faster. I'm putting would do it in a heartbeat. We'll come back. I'll play. We'll have a little bit of fun because I think you'll enjoy this too. Anytime you go on television and and announce that someone who is actually alive is still is dead, and especially when they're one of your coworkers, not a great place to be must be a shock to them. Yeah. And no doubt, as Mark Twain said, rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. Michael and Dell and Venerimai pillow and his team.

Welcome back in play Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us and there is so much insanity out there. Buck your national championship team Villanova is still alive my national championship team Tennessee was eliminated by Michigan I'm still not over it. My wife is a Michigan grad and as I was sulking over the loss on Saturday she found me and she said well at least one of us is a winner. So yeah so I thought yeah very thoughtful for. But Villanova is still alive but look they've got an absolute idiot in the cell in Rex Chapman who is working right now as a part of the programming. And this went viral after he reported as part of his analysis that Pete Gillin who's a former Providence Friars coach was dead and I'm going to play this clip for you in a minute but but. This guy is only getting his job he's got a CNN plus show now. Rex Chapman stole $14,000 in gear from a Scottsdale Apple store and that's a lot of gear but that's a lot of people out laptops like that's not one or two things. I was trying to figure that out myself because usually an iPhone even if you're paying full for eight is what like seven eight hundred dollars. And the absolute top line Mac laptop pretty much runs you close to two grand I think fifteen hundred. So I mean fourteen thousand dollars he was steal I don't even know how you steal stuff like that from the Apple store because usually they go back right they come out and then they bring your stuff back out. So I don't even know what Rex Chapman was doing or how he managed to do it but he was arrested for fourteen thousand dollars in Apple store theft in Scottsdale. He's a former University of Kentucky basketball player and played in the played in the NBA as well and was a successful NBA player but he's lost his mind he's gone full on you know Corona bro. He's arguing remember back when the Virginia Tech the football season started he tweeted out oh it's the Corona bowl and I mean he's just kind of an imbecile. Well it's not surprising to anybody who's paid attention to his his his work CNN would hire him give him his own show on CNN plus put him on their basketball coverage and he would report that a fellow CBS employee. A guy who is who is also calling in C double A tournament related games Pete Gillin is dead listen the aggressors get the calls the physicality I think plays in favor of Providence and I think Ed Cooley takes Providence back to the sweet sixteen for the first time. Since twenty five years ago when Pete Gillin had God sham God rest in peace Pete Gillin. So he's not resting in peace apparently not walking around hanging out with family he's fine that's what you're telling me. Yes well and this is you know indicative you can kind of laugh it off but this is indicative what we were talking about in the last segment buck which is I think so many people allow Twitter to be the real world that they don't even recognize that they're not. Even recognize what absolute insanity it is to be giving people like Rex Chapman television shows and this guy's an imbecile less than I think less than 2% of the United States is is active on Twitter on a regular basis. And for a lot of people in the media they think that Twitter opinion is representative it's been said before the Twitter is the assignment editor of the New York Times. There's truth to that because the people that work in journalism in particular think that whoever is chirping at them on Twitter is representative of what people actually think across the country and that is not true. That is not remotely turned out that's not accurate. Look there are more and more examples of governments worldwide reaching for income and savings of private citizens. It's a thought that was impossible to conceive some years ago but serves as a reminder that protecting your life savings from all forces is important.

Joe Biden can't hide from the fact that he is the president of high gas prices and they're looking for anyone to blame whether it's Putin, whether it's Republicans, whether it's the energy companies, whether it's COVID. The Democrats have a very big problem with 40 year high inflation. Highest gas prices ever when Joe Biden came into office who was $2.38 a gallon for gasoline. American families paid $1,000 more George for energy last year than the year before. And on polling last week 70% of Americans say more American oil and gas and less emphasis on climate. Less emphasis on climate. And John Barasso there he gets it. This is what has led to so many of the otherwise inexplicably self defeating and absurd policies around energy that the Democrats are always pushing for which the only upside is the fight against the imaginary war with CO2 that we're supposed to be waging all the time. But it really hurts families. I mean $1,000 in extra energy cost. The all time high gas price was just last week in this country was hit last week gas prices are down a down seven cents from last week now but still very high, which means all the products you buy are quite expensive and the things that you need are going to be taking a bigger bite out of your budget all across the country. This is this is reality. Now there are two ways that they're going to go at this because they recognize they got a big problem going into the midterms when the economy is crappy and people are feeling the effects of high inflation increasingly people are talking about stagflation clay and maybe even a looming recession here depending on what economic growth is this quarter when that's happening. You don't have a lot of folks excited to go and vote for the party in power that's made a lot of bad decisions. So what is Elizabeth Warren offering on this? Well, this is actually a flashback to March 13th. She was on MSNBC. You're going to hear a lot more of this. It's those big greedy corporations. Senator White House and I and others have introduced a windfall profit tax that says if you're out there price gouging, you're going to be able to get a little bit of money. They're price gouging. You're going to have to give up a big chunk of your ill-gotten gains. That's the best way I know to be able to push back against these oil companies. This isn't like democratic Western Europe socialism so much as it starts to sound more like straight up Venezuela Maduro socialism for Elizabeth Warren. You're a greedy company clay. You're a greedy oil company. The profits are too high. So we're just going to take it from you. Well, and again, how do you define what a windfall profit is? That is a massive difficulty that would be ripe for exploitation, right? Because if, let's say these oil and gas companies are making more money, again, I go back to the Democrats not really understanding how business works because so much of what they say is, you know, this, they made this much money and they only paid this much tax. The tax code is broken. Let's just say that. I'm sorry. I mean, I am a long-term believer that if you and I are pretty smart people, right, in a grand scheme of things, I have no idea how to do my taxes at this point. I have none. Zero. Yeah. I mean, there are so many different moving parts. I give everything to my accountant and I say, you know, handle it. Let me know what I need to write a check for. Let me know if I'm getting a refund. I have no earthly idea. And I guarantee you the vast majority of people out there who are in any way involved in owning a business or trying to run. I mean, it's broken. So this idea of a windfall profits tax is broken at inception because our tax code really should be. And this is where one of those things, Steve Forbes got right back in the day. You should be able to pay your taxes by filing, you know, like a postcard, right? Everybody should understand what they're paying. Everybody should play it, in my opinion, in an ideal world. We would all pay a flat tax. We would know exactly what we owe. There would be no complexity to it. I have zero confidence in the Democratic Party, which doesn't understand basic business right now, being able to try to make the oil and gas industry better when the reason why we're not producing as much oil and gas as we possibly could, Buck, is because they already have regulated us away from being able to do that. So now when you challenge these oil and gas companies, you're going to further disincentivize them from producing more oil and gas. That's the actual, what the impact of this would be. So you have the demonize the corporations, which is what you're just talking about, taking, taking their windfall profits tax and all this stuff. That's one option for the Democrats because the make things better economically, get out of the way, less regulation, push for fossil fuel energy production to be an absolute asset. The production to be an absolute maximum in this country, Democrats ain't going to do that. That's not going to happen. So they're looking at going into a midterm with a weak economy and people upset understandably about it. So on the one hand, they have the class warfare angle, which Elizabeth Warren, multi-millionaire Elizabeth Warren is great at playing, right? Oh, I care so much about you. She's worth like 14 million herself. Yeah. Then the other one is by a Tesla peasant, or in this case, eat some lentils and take the bus. Peasants. This was amazing. Bloomberg opinion. First of all, with the Captain Obvious Award for Bloomberg opinion for the last month, maybe forever. This is from the piece. Inflation stings most. If you earn less than $300,000 a year, yeah, you don't say. Here's how to deal with it. It turns out millionaires care less clay and even half millionaires care less about inflation than people who are working for wages under 300k. Here's how they say to deal with it. And I'm serious. I'm actually reading to you from a Bloomberg opinion piece here, everybody. Take the bus. Don't buy in bulk. Try lentils instead of meat. And nobody said this would be fun. This is the elites who think they understand economics are like, put that cheeseburger down peasant. Inflation's running high, plus the carbon emissions for the cow are too high. Eat your lentil patty in silence. Here also is a bad idea of why every journalist just about shouldn't live in New York City and LA or San Francisco because to them 300,000, you know this book, if you live in New York City, like $300,000 in New York City is a lot of money, but you aren't rich if you have $300,000 in New York City. If you make $300,000 in 99% of the places that people live in the United States, you're doing really, really well for yourself. But you have this idiot journalist. I don't even know how they picked. You agree with that buck? $300,000. You can see how a journalist in New York could be like, oh, you're not super rich. If you're listening to us right now in Birmingham, Alabama, or you're listening to us right now in Louisville, Kentucky, or in Salt Lake City, $300,000. You're living pretty well on $300,000. In New York City, a journalist might be thinking, oh, you're not that rich on 300k, and it just makes you so out of touch in terms of how the vast majority of Americans are living. They've done studies and our listeners on our WOR family and the New York Trice that already knows this. If you're living in New York City, whatever your income is compared to other cities across the country with a handful of exceptions, San Francisco, LA, but if you're living in New York City compared to, say, Oklahoma City, whatever your income is, goes half as far. If you make $100,000 a year in New York City, you live like somebody who makes $50,000 in Oklahoma City or in Salt Lake City, etc. That's to give folks a sense of just how big that disparate. But, yeah, New York and DC are expensive cities, so they have a very, the journal class has a skewed view of what actually being well off and being able to pay your bills looks like. No doubt, and also there's no doubt that the people who have the most to lose from inflation are the people who have to spend all of their money that they earn to live, because you're actually seeing the price come out of your paycheck. I was talking with my father-in-law about this. He was at the house over the weekend while Laura and I, my wife, were traveling, and he was saying every single thing that he's buying, you know, it's a meatpacking plant in the Detroit area, every single thing that he's buying is the prices of skyrocket. He was like trays, metal trays that used to cost nothing. The cost for those now, for instance, in his business are going through the roof. It's wild. I know a lot of small business owners out there are feeling the impact of here, and a windfall profit tax is not going to make anything better. Many of you are in a spot where you're trying to save as much money as you can for your family. Listen to what Clay and I were just talking about a second ago. I mean, look, we get it. Good for you.

Consumer Cellular. When Freedom Calls, we're here to answer. Call us at 1-888-FREEDOM. Welcome back in. Appreciate all of you. I'm plate Travis. He is Buck Section. Encourage you to go subscribe to the podcast. Make sure you don't miss a moment. We're going to have some fantastic guests coming your way in the third hour of the program, Miranda Divine. If you haven't been paying attention to all of the sudden acknowledgement that the Hunter Biden laptop was real, what Miranda Divine wrote an entire book, laptop from hell, on this. I said earlier that I thought Hunter Biden would end up facing charges. Buck disagreed. We have a stake bet on it. And we'll see which side of that bet. I'm just telling you, if they have that fancy Japanese prefecture wagyu stuff going on, don't think I won't pull the trigger on that, Travis. Also Seth Dillon, by the way, who runs the Babylon B, which is a great, funny satire site. They have been locked. Their Twitter account has over the fact that they criticized Penn's transgender swimmer, Leah Thomas, Will Thomas as a male swimmer, switches to Leah, and becomes a FEMA. I don't even know at this point. Buck, the career now of this swimmer is over, but the report was that there was going to be an attempt to make the U.S. women's Olympic team. And so you finally had some athletes start to speak out against this, and we'll see where that heads, but I'm curious what is going on with Seth Dillon and how long what happens is if you put up a tweet that Twitter doesn't like that violates their rules, they demand that you delete it. What you just said, by the way, could get you banned from Twitter. You know that, right? It's just saying, will, no, just saying will Thomas. That's a call. They call this dead naming on the left, which is where you are using a trans person's former name from their previous gender. And that under Twitter terms of service can get that alone. So if you just, so even with, with Chris Jenner, if you, you know, Caitlyn Jenner, by the way, you can change your name. I'm fine with that. But even, of course, but even noting someone's previous name is called dead naming. You're not allowed to do it. So saying will Thomas was a swimmer, which is an accurate fact at the University of Pennsylvania and was on the wind, the men, the men, men swimming team, and then made the decision to change his name to Leah Thomas and become a woman. That would get you banned on Twitter potentially. Yes. You just dead named and I'm so angry. I'm literally shaking right now. But you, it was, it's funny about the, the, the dead naming concept is so ridiculous. But what is wild about this, uh, buck in general is you can't tell the story of why this is a big deal without telling the story of Will Thomas being a male swimmer first? Because if Will Thomas had just been a regular dude at you pen and had decided to become a woman, he would never have been able to compete at a high level in women swimming, right? Probably. Yeah. The women, the swimmers at, uh, at these schools would swim faster than you and me, for example, by a lot. I mean, I'm an awful swimmer. I would lose by like minutes. Uh, so the idea that you can't say the name Will Thomas makes telling the story of Leah Thomas and why it's significant in the world of sports impossible. But isn't that the point? Yeah. Can't tell the story of the way that you would tell it based on fact clay. You have to tell the story the way they insist you tell the story. Yeah. I mean, it's such a ridiculous policy to put in place, particularly in the world of athletics, where a man becoming a woman's athlete is frankly the antithesis of all competition in general. I think we have a call, uh, that wants to swim a, you know, a female D one, an actual female D one swimmer. Cindy and AZ Arizona also known as thanks for calling in. Hey, thanks for having me guys. It's, uh, it's wonderful to talk to you. And I'm so glad you're speaking out about this because not enough people are. I'm telling it. So I swam competitively through high school and college. And there was no way we could compete against the men's team. We trained with them, but there's no way we could, we could be better than them. Just because of biology. Where did you swim, Cindy? I swim at USC University of Southern California. Okay. So what do you think? Yeah. But what, what, what would you think, uh, if you were, I know you take yourself back in time. If when you were swimming, suddenly a member of the USC men's team had decided you become a women's swimmer and had started immediately. Became the best women swimmer on your team. How do you think the girls would react back then? And what do you think many of the girls are thinking now? We would have, we would have not, we would have had none of it. None of it. We would have all stood up and fought for our rights as female, biological females. Not just want to be females. And it's, it's not fair. I mean, especially what people don't know about, about swimming in general is that when you're 10 and under six, seven, eight, nine years old, the girls times to, to make like state meets and what have you are faster, harder to, to make than the boys times. But when we have puberty, the rules change. Everything changes because those boys take on testosterone. They take on muscle bulk way bigger and faster than the girls. And they're times then start to get faster than the girls times. So in a harder to make these meets. But when my daughter was swimming in she made state at nine years old and, and the little boy, his parents sat like that next to you said, oh, well, Eli just made it cute. And I'm like, what? How do you, you sound a second slower than my daughter did? Well, they're qualifying times. And I didn't get paid attention to boys qualifying times because they didn't have boys swimming. But they were way easier back then. But once they hit puberty, all that's are off and everything changes. And then what Leah Thomas as now calls herself is six foot four. How much difference would there be? Leave aside the biology. Just being that much bigger as a swimmer, longer arms, longer legs. That has a tremendous competitive advantage standing alone, even taking away the testosterone, right? Which is partly becoming a reality because of biology. Yeah, I'm sick, but tall and many of the female swimmers were also tall, but not six four. I never found a woman that was six four. I just, I just, I'm just so upset. And after, after the win of that 500 free and nobody cheered for him and they, they went all crazy for the second place female. Yes. And which is rightly so, but I'm just, I'm just mind boggled by the NT2A and then getting just so wrong. This call was so wrong for us girls and females across the board, not just in saying, but in every sport. This is going to happen across the board and something's got to change. I mean, one year, three years of testosterone suppression. It does nothing. Doesn't change yet. We know Cindy, thank you so much for sharing your perspective on this. We appreciate you listening, calling in. Clay, we got, and ready to vine at the New York Post 100 Biden laptop coming up. We've also got Fauci is back Clay. He missed you. I know.
