    "text": " And we're back with Vaccinate Your Fucking Kids. That's the new name of our show. I didn't think it was possible for me to really have a serious opinion about Jessica Beale but for a long time I wanted her to play the Carly Simon bio-pick and now absolutely not. You wanted her to be Carly Simon. And you have those bangs and that bone structure. Look, we only have a few of you. Any of you can have those bangs. I guess that's true. Yeah. I'm going to say now it's for Lake Bell. Everybody on Big Little Lies has bangs now. No kidding. Yeah. The flattest bangs. You can add them to any woman, any white woman. Uh-huh. Yeah. That should be an FX mini-surg right there. The flattest bangs. Anyway, Jessica Beale, wife of White Devil. That's just in turmeric. Truly insane. Actually, I've been listening to his albums all week which is an unintended side effect of Jessica Beale being in the news, right? Yeah. Because then I'm like, Justin Timberlake's wife, what are you up to? And then I'm like, I want to listen to Rocky body. Bear. Yeah. I was reminded of the time I went to her children's restaurant that is now closed called Off Fudge. Right. Get it? Yes. And I went there when I was a writer, Jezebel, and I wrote about it. And they had a club sandwich that you could add caviar to for like $30. And so of course, because I was not paying for it, I ordered like a $50 sandwich and it was terrible. Now we know that there were just kids running around there. God, if I had known, oh my God, yeah. The shots. I can't believe I ate there. So, uh. The uproar is Jessica Beale had a meeting with RFK Jr. noted anti-vaxxer who has called out the advocacy of needing to Vax children and compared them to the vaccines to the Holocaust. Sure. Yeah. First thing that comes to mind, why not? Probably shouldn't be meeting with him. Jessica Beale. Right. First of all, when she was called out on the fact that, you know, hanging out with him is bad. And is she anti-vaxx? She gave that dumb party line that they always give. The thing that they're not anti-vaxx. They just think there needs to be more science. More pro-conversations with your doctor. And you know, morals, like some people, religions or whatever, like shouldn't have to get that. Well, she specifically was like, I think the bill or whatever that she was going to talk to about was like about forcing people to get vaccines. So she was basically like, we want to like loosen the laws. So she's like, I'm still, I'm fine with vaccines, but like, I want to have more control. And so I think there are against laws that are making it like, no, no, no, like you, you have to do this shit, which is, is like not the same as being anti-vaxx, but it makes me feel like you probably are anti-vaxxed. Yeah. Weird hill to die on or to be incredibly infected. Right. Because if you're fine with them, then like, what are you upset about? Yeah. Right. There are a lot of things that we all should be getting. And so if you're giving people the option to say, you know what, I want my kids to maybe get the measles. What's going on here? I have a measles outbreak in LA right now. Someone like, I got an email from Equinox. Oh, about the mumps. The mumps. Oh, the mumps. The mumps. Both of them start with an M. I mean, diseases, no one like words, we shouldn't have to know. We shouldn't have to know what the mumps are. Like, should we figure it out? Yeah. Things that afflict people in James Joyce short stories. Yeah, we need to not be known about that stuff. Right. Only Pete Buttigieg should know what those are. Exactly. Yes. Anyway, I mean, she's just so boring. It sort of. Who knew she was actually a sinner? I know. Guys, I did like that show though, unfortunately. She showed us about a woman who looks like what's wrong with her. She was in season two of the cinema. Season one of the cinema. Oh, wait. Season one of the cinema. What is that? Why was I thinking Jennifer Love Hewitt was in season one of the cinema? But no, she was in the client list on Lifetime. Correct. Not the center. I liked the client list. The client list was good. What was the center? She was she was how in? Well, the center is a USA series where in the second season and Jessica Beal produced it and she was nominated for an Emmy for it. And then the second season it was Carrie Kuhn. Yes, actually, my favorite thing here about the client list was she's supposed to be the sex worker, but every episode went through great lengths so she wouldn't have to do sex work. Right. Like she was horrified at having to give someone like a hand job once. I was like, girl, what are we really doing here? I liked that she always had about 19 pounds of hair on her head. And I know like. Did she have a kind of the traditional Nicole Kim and big little eyes type wig on? I know. No, she had like an enormous like, I don't even know. I just feel like they were just sewing extensions. And I think this was maybe before white women had gotten into wig technology. And it looked like they were just clipping that shit in. And she was and she's so little. So that's the thing. It was like she had this enormous head with all this hair and then like this tiny little body. But see, look, we start talking about Jessica Beal and inevitable you're talking about someone else because who cares. By the way, a white woman who has always had good wig work, Sharon case who plays Sharon on the young Marcellus. Her hair has been laid for decades. You know, she didn't do that. Yeah. Well, you know, Victoria Royal probably came in and was like, fix this white woman's hair, but it's looked good. So I need to have more of an opinion about who always has good wig work. I really don't. You don't. I mean, I should. Oh, yeah. Should I never have that? Okay. It's fine. I guess I'm maybe sad and by Jessica Beal. Why? I don't know. I really like turn blade three. I really enjoy her on Bojack Horseman because she she's like making fun of herself. Like she plays like she does she plays herself on Bojack Horseman. And like there's all these jokes about like who the fuck is Jessica Beal basically. And so I thought she maybe had a good sense of humor. Now I do not think that the joke is on children. Yeah. Stay away from RFK Junior. Jessica Beal. Stay away from Kennedy's in general. That's dangerous. That's dangerous. That's dangerous. That's dangerous. We have got quite an episode coming up today. We have Warren Morelli joining us from Tales of the City. We're going to talk about that gay show. I'll be screaming the words Ellen Page a few times. Yeah. We're going to talk about new queer ally Taylor Swift. She is she is out there. She is throwing bricks with that Harvey Mill check. And we're going to talk about Kyle Keshuv a young teenager who can't go to Harvard. He just wants to learn you know sadly Harvard is the only school ever. Why we'll be right back. Move over Sean Mendez the gays are obsessed with somewhere else. It's Taylor Swift. So I guess we got to do this right. Hell of a weekend for Taylor. Yeah we are we are all going to be hunted down and murdered after this by the way because I'm sure the Swifties are ready to pounce. But I can fight children. I don't care. Even ones armed with snake. So after revealing herself to be a Democrat and reclaiming her support for the Equality Act on her Instagram. Taylor of course decided to drop a new single and you know become a part of the LGBTQ movement. You know like full throttle here her new song you need to calm down is an ode to pride and LGBTQ allyship. At least one verse but yes. Yeah you know. That's the thing. It's not it's the video. The video happens to have a lot of queer people in it. The content of this song all she did was change the smelling of glad which frankly if you hadn't seen the lyrics you wouldn't have known that she'd done that. Like there's there's nothing else in this song that is helping anyone. So let's get into the song first. I really take offense to the idea that you know we were supposed to know that it's glad like the organization. Just by looking at the lyric video because you can't notice it from the song and there's also the fact that she talks about shade in it right. She says never made anybody less gay. But does it work perplexes right. Does it make any sense. That is referring I guess to the signs people hold up at pride parades you know because like she references people having signs in the song and I just want to get this out there being anti gay calling a gay person a faggot is not shade. Leviticus is not shade. Being an open bigot is not shade. But if there is maybe the saddest thing that white women have done in America it is take the word shade. It is not just white women. I know but take it shade and make it just mean any sort of insult. You got to people with general. It's white men. Yes and what's her on CNN talking about shade multiple communities. There are a lot of people to blame for for ruining shade. I did my best. I tried with shade court. I worked very hard. Oh yeah you're at the forefront of this. Clearly for nothing because you idiots have totally ruined the word. I mean this is like it's fully done. Like shade was already done. But Taylor Swift saying it in a song is like the quickest way or like okay that's out of our hands. She could have done herself a world of good if she had just said hate doesn't make anybody less gay because that's what she's talking about. She's talking about protesters at parades trying to like establish themselves as I don't know straight and above better than pride or whatever. That said I also don't care if they are secretly gay or whatever. So that part of the that component of that line also bothers me a little bit too. Yeah and so here is my largest problem with the song. It's not about the fact that it's also supposed to be this pride song right. It's the fact that that happens for four lines of the song. The rest of the song is about her talking at Twitter trolls. Right. Seven a.m. you're being a troll to me. Yeah. Seven a.m. you're being a troll to me. I'm taking a shot at patrol. Wait here's my favorite. Like can you just not step on my gown? Don't step on his gown. That's that's the second person. No that's the first person. First one. Like can you just not step on my gown. You need to calm down. Yes. She used to be good at writing. Listen I Taylor Swift is someone where much like you know when like lemonade came out and not comparing the two but in all these white women were like it's not for me like I get it. I get it that beyond I'm like Taylor Swift is not for me. That is fine. I and I've that's okay. But at least I was like I get it. You know what I mean? I was like I don't really I'm not into this but like I understand why someone would enjoy it. Like the songs are catchy. The writing is pretty good. Like this is not good song writing. No and in the next verse where she says don't step on his gown. It's just this weird sort of equating the fact that what are all gay people walking around in gowns like are we all Billy Porter and Jonathan Van that's like I don't get it. It seems very reductive just her whole understanding of queer culture and I get that you know she is a big important voice in pop music right and it is important. The fact that her video which we'll get to you know ends with a link to donate to the equality act right and it ends with you know just sort of you having seen so many prominent LGBTQ people in the video and that's important but there's also just sort of doing your basic homework. It seems like she doesn't have any sort of actual queer person in her life who's not famous and diluted who could tell her that this isn't really doing anything right. I think the sentiment of the song again there's nothing wrong with it and I think people are maybe a little bit wrong to say she's centering herself in the narrative when the fact is Taylor Swift is centered in pop culture and she's talking about something. I feel like that's fair for her you know but there is something and Dave Holmes who is just so fabulous all of his writing about pop music put something for Esquire where he reiterated the sentiment. There's something about talking about this stuff in a pop song in 2019 like that makes you sort of feel like someone who's giving yourself a nickname like isn't it cool that I'm the anti gay whatever. That said and then we'll get into this. I thought the video was awesome. I like the video as well in a sense but I will say that I do agree with what you say about she's a pop star. She is centered in pop culture right now in 2019 but it is also weird for this sentiment just to be having in a pop song when we have now so many mainstream queer artists. It seems like there could be something else that's going on here and it's just this just weird idea that so many fans of hers get angry at you for even questioning you know like the meaning or purpose behind this and saying you know it's important we need this now and that's always the party in line and I'm like great but you know sort of at what point do we stop having to ask for you know scratch from pop stars of you popping in with one gay song and then moving on with the other. It feels like she wanted to let people know that she was like she want I feel like she genuinely wanted to do something for the Equality Act and wanted to do something and then worked backwards you know what I mean which you probably could have just done something around the Equality Act and it feels like she you know was like I want to do this and like let me how do I put it into the song that she was probably already writing or something like that I don't know it maybe not but it feels sort of like working backwards. It's a little bit since like reputation it feels like everything that she's done is calculated with sort of marketing in mind right and it's like this song feels like it was you know group think I feel like you know like how can you make it most palatable to so many different people and in the end it just sort of feels like cold what I liked about her former songwriting was it used to be like revealing even it was even when it was petty and like about other girls and music and stuff that she didn't like it said something about her there was emotion in this this song feels emotionless. Specifically also because the lyrical content is so filled with what I would call Twitter cliches you know like the just thing you need to calm down by like the whole state press of it all. Yeah. Which is shade common is clearly meant for her fans to be retweeting that. Yeah exactly exactly so that feels a little bit cold too and also so she made a surprise appearance at Stonewall over the weekend performing allegedly by the request of Jesse Tyler Ferguson who's also in the video so nothing wrong with performing at Stonewall I don't know if you know do you remember when Kate Blanchett just appeared at Stonewall and lip sync you don't own me. Yeah. You kind of rad things at Stonewall Madonna did that once there is something slightly strange arguably suspicious and a Dell were just like pieces recently like showing up at New York gay bars is a tradition of female like yeah icon. There's just and like there's just something about Taylor Swift appearing at Stonewall on the 50th in that moment with a pride related single that felt almost too on the nose you know what I mean. So it's like it was sort of an artless stunt even though again I know her support is very real. That's what I mean when I say the marketing aspect right it's like yes your support is real but I don't feel that in the song right. You know like it doesn't even seem like she's talking about any specific gay person that she knows you know and I mean like one of the most prominent queer people that she does know unfortunately is Todrick Hall who was an executive producer of the video and honestly even though I enjoy parts of the video I feel like why I don't love it is it reeks of Todrick Hall like it looks like that Disney vibe. Yeah. Yeah. Like oh here's a bunch of cameos and it doesn't really amount to anything except trying to show us that you're famous. You know the thing one of the things I find with I feel like Taylor Swift and like Kim Kardashian I'll put in this bucket where people get mad when you criticize them when they're trying to use something good because the bar is on the floor for white women. Like it's just like in doing anything at all and so it's like the shit with Kim and going to law school where you're like I don't we don't need her to do that. She needs to she should donate money and they're like oh but she's doing something good it's like okay fine you can acknowledge that but also look at this in like a smarter way and say is she the the most competent person to be talking about prison reform is Taylor Swift like the most articulate voice to be speaking about the equality act like probably not and it doesn't mean that it says the sum zero it doesn't mean that they're doing something bad it doesn't mean you know it but it's just like you can allow some space to be like this is self-serving in some way and also when you're talking about the bar being on the floor I think people are her fans recall that you know two years ago we were wondering oh is she a Nazi so like now yeah they're like well don't say anything about this and I'm like you still didn't say anything when it mattered and you will beat like frankly people who had like her like the Selena Gomez is I'm like those people you will forever I think have to explain yourself how you let that time pass and said absolutely nothing when you had the reach that you did like frankly forever you're gonna have to explain that to me and you're gonna have to make up for that and if this isn't attempted with that like fine but that doesn't mean we've forgotten it wasn't that long ago right because the idea was that no one ever really thought that Taylor Swift was a fucking Nazi right right but it was the fact that people who were Nazis were upping your music you know talking about how you were connected to them and you like not even a tweet you know yeah right right anyway this video this this todrick hall ish thing yeah I'm gonna say immediately I resist all super celebrity late in videos like this is better than bad blood for sure which is the video what happens in that video like sisley Tyson appears on a hoverboard just everybody comes out going back to what Michael Jackson video am I thinking of that's incredibly star like you're in girl librarian girl exactly what I'm talking about I don't watch it anymore right the end of that video where Michael just appears and is the director who pitched that but oh my god it's Michael when every celebrity is just happy to see him you tricked us right and he's and he's like grinning at nothing but this video has Ella DeGeneres RuPaul Katy Perry Jesse Tyler Ferguson his husband Justin Nikita Billy Porter Adam Lambert Adam Ripot Sierra hilly Kiyoko the whole cast of Queer Eye Ryan Reynolds Laverne Loverr Gox our oh yeah right old Ryan Reynolds wasn't that was the weirdest does he peek out from behind an easel yes painting some painting still wall because Deadpool is gay I was sure sure sure the time you know he's dead pool is pansexual I don't know yeah well he's not really pansexual in the movies he just sort of like makes comments about maybe wanting to have sex with guys but we haven't seen any you know okay do you know what feels like the ultimate well done Taylor stonzo is at the end of the video when she is wearing the fries costume and I thought that was good you know what here's my thing I think she pitched it herself she I mean she to me how boring is Taylor Swift's life where you're still saying shit like snakes and stones you are still talking about that stupid tired bullshit with Kevin Kevin Kanye you're still this shit with Katy Perry and I know whatever you made up but I'm like has nothing else happened in your life where this is what you're still still with this shit Kanye's move on the maga Kim is trying to get people out of prison anyone care you already wrote a whole song you bad blood was Katy Perry it's like who who was still thinking about that feud nobody nobody still cared if Taylor Swift and Katy Perry hated each other because I we haven't heard anything from either of those bitches and years I just it to me it's whatever like font like it just felt so on the nose and like oh my god who cares who cares I disagree I think there is a mystique about her relationships with other pop stars and so I thought it was sort of like a winking with Katy Perry she's always they've been like openly hating each other there's been so little mystique with Katy Perry arguably because think of all the people who she probably years though I mean no I feel like they've they've made up they did that stupid shit on Instagram with the cookies or whatever the fuck which was very clear like okay they're cool now she tagged Katy Perry like to me she's that was to tease the video right she's been most open about her relationship with Katy Perry than anyone else that she arguably did or didn't like to be fair I think Katie has been the most open Taylor has rarely talked about it but you she did but like people knew she didn't correct any of the narratives about like well like you knew bad blood was about Katy Perry well so that's the thing that I meant you know with the Nazi stuff you know like Taylor loves to have narratives existing about her that she doesn't check or correct and then you know they're allowed to subsist I mean I have that same problem with Beyonce when her fans seem like they want to burn someone's house down it's like this you need to sit out a tweet tell your fans about be crazy yeah well she had a bond do it I know right she had a problem it was like y'all chill the idea though that this reunion between Katy and Taylor at the end of this video I feel like sort of deflated the video for me you know because I'm like I thought this was your pride thing now it's just about two famous pop stars like coming back together but I also think it's an like a for me an appropriate day new month to the story of the video which has like the drag queens as the pop stars like competing with one another by the way I do have to say RuPaul was vastly underused in this video it just appears and does some like CGI everyone is overused there's too many people yeah everybody gets five seconds on screen if you got and she rounded up all of West Hollywood in this video you barely like Sierra I missed her in the video like you where is she in the she's married Justin and okay you know I mean like everyone gets like Ellen was like everyone is so quick yeah I've got to say it was an endearing moment for Ellen though because she's getting cruel summer tattooed on her arm and that is one of the all-time buffs yes banana ram stands and also I feel like she's cruel in the summer just journalistic fact so if I could really just sort of sub up the Taylor stuff I mean I love stuff that she donated arms a hundred thirteen thousand dollars to the Tennessee Equality Project right you know I love that she is putting this advocacy out there I will just say that as a person who is constantly a target of Swifties because they have this idea that I just sort of hate her or pretend to hate her it's really just this idea that Taylor is a person who has done things publicly that you should be allowed to criticize her over sure and obviously stands don't understand that you know right you can understand when she does things that are cultural appropriation or when she's like lashing out at Nicki Minaj for things particularly when that was one of the last instances where Nicki Minaj was actually in the right but you can also still be a fan of her music right and I feel like if it seems like I'm extra mad this era is because you've always been able to rely on Taylor for the bops like I like to reputation you know and I think that this album is just sort of meh well that first single flop like that first single flopped hard yeah didn't yeah like yeah this is the same problem to where I feel like it's a single where it starts off like oh maybe it'll ramp up and it feels like you're hearing the first eight bars of a song throughout the entire thing it doesn't go anywhere you know yeah which was sort of what look what you made me do yeah sort of did but I think that that song succeeds a bit more even though as I said we said the past two albums just feel sort of like group think to get people to sort of respond on Twitter with lines and they don't really seem to have that much emotion in them there are you know deep cuts on reputation you know like getaway car and like New Year's Day yeah you know and dancing with our hands tied that I feel are like songs that feel like throwback Taylor because they're about something but right now it just seems like the singles that she's pushing are to put out this image that she wants to convey and it's just not that appealing doesn't it also I feel like in 2019 like Katy Perry and Taylor Swift feel a little like I don't know where they fit in with this right now and this pop in particular Katy Perry like I don't know if she has music coming out soon I'm like interesting because her new single never really over actually has sort of really captured a lot of gays I've seen people lip syncing that thing 70,000 times on Instagram and it is like a pretty remarkably good single but for someone who was like an enormous pop star you're like no that song is not in the way that like you go anywhere you're hearing a Katy Perry song like I wonder with the two of them like the footing that they're gonna find because I just don't I don't know I just I don't see it right now and not that it's impossible but like especially because Taylor's first single was like such a like nothing moment I'm like oh how are you gonna kind of like how are you gonna get back in here right here's that sort of weird relevance question you know it's like you look at the pop star sort of from that era and you can see like you know Beyonce is a person who has moved on from trying to dominate the charts or anything right she's just sort of making personal album she's making it for her fan base really just sort of doing what she sort of wants to do and it seems like the era of trying to get those hits trying to have everybody talking about your music is still what Taylor and Katie sort of want and I just don't know if that is possible anymore Katie sort of came out during Coachella for Zeds set to do their song 365 which I like but it was just sort of like oh okay Katy Perry's here you know it's like yeah they don't really feel like they're making events anymore well they're about to turn into like the 30 something pops I'd be like well someone like Taylor Swift someone like Katy Perry be a pink you know like can they do it it is an interesting question because I honestly think of them as like embodying you know what like being a millennial you know like a young millennial now we're getting older and not just Beyonce but you know like Lady Gaga she went through a phase where you know we were sort of like girl what you do and and she's managed to transform herself and make herself a new kind of like era you know it feels like they're both still trying to come for Ariana and like that's not the fight you want to get in right now even Rihanna has been like I'm moving into this way like Ariana Grande is like the the young Poppy pop star right now and like I don't think I don't think a new Katy Perry single is gonna change that like that's not you're not gonna go toe to toe to with her right now so like don't try to just do something else and Ed Sheeran's gonna stay exactly the same and still beat everybody I'm just sorry it's the truth him and Drake yeah Oh misogyny and the patriarchy always wins sure welcome to keep it when we're back Lauren Morelli joins us Joining us today is writer and co-executive producer of Orange is the New Black you've heard of it and executive producer and showrunner of the new Netflix series Tales of the City welcome Lauren Morelli thanks for having me I'm so happy you're here I'm legitimately so excited to be here I'm not even like the bullshit thing no I am always shocked when someone comes in they're like I've been listening to keep it oh my god wait really I mean now now you have to fight Mandy Moore maybe for our most ardent listener I will fight Mandy Moore I say that every morning just like myself up because I feel like she was like the energy that I'm getting there oh guys are Mandy and I supposed to be friends probably great this is going great for me I'm ready just get together listen to the show yeah Tales of the City is going to say it's so much fun to watch for a number of reasons but the number one thing I want to say is the mix of true legends and people who are just I would probably starting out as actors is so exciting to watch I love seeing them interact I was just telling Ira it is disturbing that Olympia Dukakis looks the exact same as she did in Moonstruck she is a killer I love her on this show she's 87 years old yeah she's 87 aging up yes I 90 and she's took out like the expressions like the delivery I just like everything about her is just cracker Jack can you tell me about like just the mix of these like legends and these like newbies and how much is I hope that's like a really fun atmosphere on set it was so fun it was very much what the show ended up being off screen right so it was like Laura Linney sitting Garcia down who's playing Jake on the show who's like this young trans guy and being like let me show you've never been on screen before let me show you like how to break down a script like let me show you what your angles are and what coverage means I'm gonna cry this is so fun it was so fun and there was such an incredible like air of mentorship and generosity and it was just really cool it was really fun tell me a bit about what it was like even sort of bringing tales of the city back because I remember you know the miniseries and I remember you know reading a couple of the books when I was you know younger and gay and being like what is this gay soap opera the books are wild the books are why yes I keep saying that like because sometimes I feel like people who are watching the current iteration it's it's such a weird specific tone that Armistead our patrons say it delivered and like I'm like you guys in the original series like you think you're watching I don't know like a warm family drama and then in the last episode someone's a pedophile and they get pushed off a cliff so I was like trying to remind us in the room of that a lot because it's just such a weird tone and I was like I don't know what people are gonna make of this but it's just what tales has always been like it's so soapy it's for sure campy but it's also like hopefully warm and like lovely to sit through. Can you talk about your writers room because you had an all queer writers room right which I feel like it is so rare and I mean it's a real Hollywood for not a group of street white men to be writing anything but yeah to have like the actual people being represented on screen making up the writers room is rare for any any group yeah it felt I don't know it just felt important to me it felt like it's so rare that we get chances to tell these stories especially like I think I started thinking about a lot is as queer people when we get shows it's like the gay show the lesbian show the trans show and it felt like a really unique opportunity to have such intersectionality on the show and I was like well I understand how to be like a white lesbian who's 36 and that's it so let me make sure that we're not presenting ourselves as like one thing which we often are right like someone who has a different race or class or gender identity than I do has a very different experience of being queer and I just wanted to represent as many of those identities as I could in the room yeah if I can say one thing about the show and what's so beautiful about it is it's not you know the gay show it's not the trans show it it really is just sort of mixing these different queer stories together and it was great to see you know obviously as a gay band to see um Murray Bartlett and Charlie Barnett dating on this show because they're gorgeous as a lesbian is going to be here and I'm also Fred Swift Matthew Reach oh you are so great in that too what a dream but then you know I thought the trans storyline is just really great in this too and also you have a beautiful flashback episode eight which is set in the 60s and Jen Richards plays Olympia Dukakis as a character and I thought that that was also a really good way to sort of acknowledge that you know like Olympia obviously had to come back you know but you know she was playing a trans woman back when trans women weren't getting roles and now if you're doing a flashback episode about her you can have an actual trans woman playing her and I love just the cast of characters in that too thank you so much yeah that episode was so much work and took us so long in the room to make sure it was just so tricky you know it's like you don't want to you want to tell like really complicated nuanced stories while not doing any harm right like I try to stay away from like getting it right because I think then we just end up with like magical queer people who don't have any flaws are you saying it's hard to write complicated nuanced stories that we did it so well you know yeah yeah I am I'm just so smart in that I'm ahead of that curve that's really difficult it's really hard yeah I mean something that's also just read about this in addition to the LGBT writers room is there's so many LGBT actors you talk about just like what's it like having those people on a show like this you know it's amazing even from like a point of self-protection and making sure that you're doing the best job you can is like when you have someone coming in like Charlie Barnett let's say and he reads a scene and he has his own life experience to contribute to that then you get to keep having the conversation on set right so it's not just like here here are the pages and now you're going to show up and do your job and go home it's like let's talk about like you know when Charlie and Murray are doing a sex scene what you guys want to do and what your own life experience has been and like how do we make this a safe inclusive environment it just it feels like the script is a starting point and then it gets richer from there which is really cool not fucking rules yeah I really did and by the way just every time I see Ellen Page on screen too she just has like a kind of mythically cool quality that is singular I'm always so excited to see her again that's so well said yeah it's like she does this very specific thing that is just like and she never you know like when you read the words on the page she never does what I imagined but what she does is like better than you imagine which is so cool yeah um no it was really interesting seeing this series in SF too you know because I mean I was one of the ten people who watched looking and it was fun just sort of seeing what you know a diverse room can bring out of queer stories it was interesting seeing Charlie just sort of in scenes uh seen in episode four uh where he's at a dinner party with like older white gay men you know who survived AIDS you know and they're from a completely different generation and him you know being upset with them for using slurs they shouldn't be using for trans women and for just sort of coming from a different generation and sort of being racist you know and being able to see a younger black character who's queer um expressing that in this you know series it I thought they were really beautiful moments we sort of got that on Vida too we just had talking to Roger over here um and I just think you know there's something about specificity that we're finally seeing in queer stories on TV yeah it's so exciting can you tell us a bit about or just a new black you know because that had a lot of queer stories blended into it too yeah yeah um and you know it's interesting like so many of those queer stories came out of rather than being like we want to tell queer stories it's just like well it's a bunch of women in prison so they're having sex but you know in retrospect there were I mean I was obviously coming out over the first couple seasons so I was like starting to identify as queer but there was another lesbian in the room so there was a fair amount of representation in the room and um and we had lots of conversations about like season three I got a real B in my bonnet about having a sex scene for Lea Delaria who played Big Boo because I was just like well how do we keep pushing the envelope like how do we see a butch woman having sex because like we get to see them represented on TV but we don't necessarily get to see them sexualized which I think is important how does it feel I mean so orange zing black is coming to an end um and to be I feel like that show not only just it being on Netflix and being like arguably the first huge hit of four Netflix and like this new era and like really ushering in this era of like not just streaming but getting to tell stories more freely because you're at a Netflix you're at an Amazon or what have you and I'm wondering how you look back at being a part of that and then also then a show that had very few men in it yeah yeah you know what's crazy I well first of all I've only ever worked in Netflix which is so weird and when I got hired on orange it was my first writing job and at the time it was like it was orange and it was House of Cards and Netflix was still a DVD company yeah so I had been like trying to get staffed for years and years and years and then it happened and everyone was like oh my god it's like a web series congratulations like fully my parents were like um will they like keep your assistant job for you and here we are right yeah well you just got me reflecting on that very small time in Netflix's history where you just had DVDs lying around like will I get to hotel Rwanda this weekend probably not the movie that I never did and that's actually how I watched queers folk to be honest oh that's all the madmen that way I ordered the DVDs when I was in college um and I like watched them at night uh when my roommate was like such an exercise in hope right such an exercise and like I believe in myself I will get Philadelphia um one thing I actually want to touch on that you said what you talked about being in the writers room for Orange is the new black and you know you talked about coming out as queer yourself during that process do you feel like that sort of made you want to do something like tales of the city do you feel like you have this sort of new responsibility as a storyteller that you might not have had when you first got into the industry as I just want to be a staff right for sure yeah and you know what else I think it did for me that I've just been reflecting on a lot with tales coming out is like I had such an insecurity about coming out I think there was a lot of stuff that came up for me about feeling like I think that we all do in our various corners of the world like I wasn't gay enough because I didn't know for a long time but the community embraced me in a way that I didn't like everyone was just like oh cool you're queer come on in like we are not cheesy people and it and I think I just feel so much joy because of that and like wanting to maybe give back a little bit and like because I have I feel like I have a lot of privilege and being handed a platform and being able to tell the stories I'm like yeah great like if I happen to be a part of the community who can tell these stories and hopefully tell them with some authenticity like that's what I want to do it's so meaningful right it's like I've been thinking a lot about like it's not like fire fighter 19 on CBS it feels you know it feels really great to be able to and especially like with all the TV being made you're like oh how cool that there's space for this now how cool that Netflix is like yeah yeah we'll make this crazy queer like kind of niche show I'd watch a queer fire firefighting 19 on CBS me too and especially if Charlie I was gonna say this Charlie was on it but Charlie was already on a firefighter show oh yeah which one he was on oh god what's the name of it um we should YouTube that's Chicago fire it's Chicago fire oh that's the one I know for my I'll be watching Chicago can I ask a super vague question about writing queer content please there's this show there was a show in Comedy Central that was really great coming back for a second season called The Other Two if there was a story on it where two gay characters are talking about what which one of them is going to eat pizza in the evening because they're gonna have sex and one of them's gonna bother and it's this like coded conversation about bottoming uh-huh legendary in some way because it's a conversation about bottoming it also to me felt too demirre for actual gay people to be talking like they would just be talking about it explicitly right I was thinking a part of me thinks this is turned this is cute in a way for straight people to understand it when you're writing queer content do you ever think this is turned turned too outward for straight people and it's not enough for gay people and what do you how do you navigate that balance yeah I should say that Sarah Schneider and Chris Kelly who made the other two are my dear friends yeah right um yeah I'm really conscious of that actually I'm really conscious of never putting to queer people on screen and having them have a conversation explicitly for the purpose of educating straight people yeah because I think we pick up on it like that right I mean um I think this happens also with like let's to put like two black characters on tv and have them have a conversation that they would never have so that white people are like oh um it's also been done like that was what like Will and Grace is for that is what that's what the Cosby show was for like it was to make people comfortable with seeing these people on their television sets at home and hopefully now you're like okay we're past that like we had all we had this safe like everyone's okay now with like gay people and like you're okay watching the you know whatever and it feels like okay you've had those sort of safer characters and they have now allowed us to have conversations that are more like real life yeah I think that's right and I think it's like trusting also that people within marginalized communities can be humanized just by allowing them to be themselves right like because I think I think about that too like um there's a conversation between Margo and Jake on the show that I think about Margo's a young I'm Jake is a young trans guy uh Margo's in a relationship with him before his transition they would have been in a lesbian relationship right and they have like a pretty nuanced conversation about that in the pilot and I think it would have been really tempting either for Netflix to be like are people gonna understand this which they never did or for me to be like ooh let me dumb this down so that people can get it but it's like or what if they could just google if they could get it like what if they can do the work or what if we just trust them to like be there having faith in people to wiki things is very empowering very empowering but like people will wiki the shit out of a random line in Game of Thrones you know so they can do it for this show yes we can all do a lot more work so Tales of the City was a limited series um I hope I get to see more but um what other stories do you feel like you want to tell like what's next for you what a fun question um I have avoid this is annoying I have a show in development Netflix that I can't talk about yet um but I just I really want to tell stories about women I really want to tell stories about queer people I feel like there's a lot of stuff getting made and that means that we can afford to be more specific um about what we do and I personally want to be really thoughtful about that and and just make sure that like I'm putting stuff into the world that I care about because otherwise like I don't know I'll go live in the cabin and like the woods or something you know um yeah that's what I got great do you have any other favorite stories about women or queer people that you've just seen recently whoa I certainly love the other two a lot I do too it truly is like my new 30 rocker um happy endings where it's like crack like jokes oh my god and like just so fast like fast on a level that I don't understand um I loved special oh yes right no konil the pride parade Marshall yes um yeah I just thought that sex scene when he was just over his virginity I was like oh my god this is like really phenomenal like this is like actual gay sex and that was with Brian Jordan El-Riz who is also fabulous on Will and Grace to bring it back to you um and I'm reading a lot of like queer YA these days which is like most of the market now I have no understanding of children today I don't know I don't know they're the here's what I know they're all queer okay the pretty low lives were all yeah yeah I'm just like fully indulging the like 12 year old in me who didn't know she was gay and just like letting her read about two girls kiss for the first time like it's really lovely is there any we should check out um I just read one called we are okay by Nina liqueur that I really love is just about like grief and I just said it's just about grief it's it's I lost my father a couple years ago and so I'm always sort of in search of some material that's talking about grief in a real way I think we don't talk about grief a lot um especially in westernized cultures and it's really stunning and there's two girls in the center of it which is my favorite brand well it's YA so it's probably less depressing than the leftovers yes correct I think it's all about grief I want to kill myself um Laura thank you for being here thanks for having me uh tales of the city is amazing I've been all 10 of them did you really yes in one day thank you for watching after pride on my camera oh that's like the perfect I was with two friends of mine over the weekend and I was like oh I just had people watch and she was like what are introverted queers gonna do this weekend yes that's our brand we'll be right back where's Laurie Laughlin and Felicity Huffman when you need them I've been asking that for years Kyle Keshuv a parkland shooting survivor and a conservative gun rights activist what a sentence don't put him in any box was recently denied being able to go to Harvard oh he had been accepted intercepted but the offer was rescinded after screenshots of messages between him and his friends revealed his repeated use of the in-word and repeated I have to stress was so many times never has the word repeated been more apropos I saw nigger in these screenshots more times than in a Tarantino script sure was in a series of twitter posts we discovered his offer was rescinded because Keshuv added Harvard and went on a long ass thread questioning their decision attacking them for their own races pass and calling on I guess twitter and middle aged white men to write up ads defending him asking to see harvard's manager etc you know it's it's not funny obviously but it is it's funny um he he he feels it's just always nice when you see the the persecution jump out like he really thinks someone's doing something to him something is being done to him as opposed to consequences for your shitty actions which I know it's hard for teenagers to understand that like the defining characteristic of a teenager is not understanding that your actions have consequences but truly the number of adults because you know what you had no fucking problem with uh finding consequences for Trayvon Martin's actions because that was the argument a lot of you use oh well he got in a fight like what did he expect and now all of a sudden now all of a sudden you don't have consequences for your actions or people like Ben Shapiro's who had no problem attacking other parkland students because they were anti-gun but they love cashew because he is pro-gun um was a member of the right wing group turning point USA with such icons as trolley kirk and kennissom and he went on fox news and like gave speeches at the NRA like he was like oh he was the right wing darling that came out of that unfortunate incident right and they sort of glommed on to him and it's really just sort of exposing this thing that was exposed during the um cavern eye hearings right you know this idea that these sort of white men see these people as a conduit of themselves you know the idea that cashew is responsible for his actions sort of calls him the question the idea that they did some things in their past maybe that you know could harm them or maybe it's sort of like this censorship is coming to affect us you know I mean it the other thing is the way people treat this like and he said something like it was I was my youthful ignorance or some shit it's like calling your classmates nigger jocks it's not like slipping on a banana peel it's like what how did that get out my favorite I love Lucy Biz yeah like that's my favorite avenger yeah nigger jock oh like oh my god it was such an accident it's like no no those weren't accidents that's your fucking character jumping out yes that's who you are because you know what a lot of people managed to do they managed to get through their whole fucking lives without saying shit like nigger jock mmm correctly fem wrong yes harford is the elite institution number one what are they supposed to do not reject you and they they've done this they also harvard has done this before like they have an other not even just harvard like other schools like there's one of my favorite type of story is stories of high school kids getting kicked out of their dream colleges because people found some racist shit that they had said right we literally had the question of our kids gonna be able to go to schools after their parents were scamming to get them into them right so it's like this is an unusual for offers to be rescinded right or bad behavior and my favorite thing about his behavior is the fact that it has gotten people to say things like how are we holding someone accountable for what they said at 16 i'm like bitch isn't the whole point of a college admission being held accountable for what you were doing at age 16 and also by the way what was that a year and a half ago i thought we're telling it was in the 80s my favorite there was an interview he's on fox news oh that it is wild and so he's doing he's like trying to spin this shit and he says something about harvard having owned sleeves like like harvard like people who founded harvard owned sleeves and then the dude on fox news when a fox news anchor is like hold up though didn't you say this like two years ago a year and a half a year and a half he corrected even yeah even the fox news anchor is like sir this is not the argument you want to go with yes uh oh sorry it was it was him who said a year and a half yeah the fox news anchor was like yeah i mean when even that guy is like i don't know man i don't know that this is i don't know that this is the angle you want to play with this right so it's because some racist people went to harvard before um you should be allowed to go because you were racist as well but also in the past and you know time is is is not like a line it's just sort of like it's all there everything like yesterday is the same as what happened in 1776. creepy from was there any advantage to him posting publicly about getting the he literally should make amends do what he can like there are formal ways you can be like i'm not a racist i'm going to do this this this and this and then reapply or whatever but now with this public thing where he's making it a whole other issue it's not because he wants to feel persecuted that's what it is it's like and white men street white men love that shit any opportunity where they have been wronged when other people are wronged on a second by second basis at every second of the day there's a marginalized person being fucked over or injured or actually hurt in a real way and these men just like anytime they get a chance to dig into like i'm being a victim here that's the only reason he did it harvard's not going to change his mind because fucking ben shapiro tweets at them like there's it's he knows that it's done but it i think it it satisfies that sense of like i have been wronged and unlike when it happens to like a black person or a gay person or or you know whoever people are going to feel bad for him well i will posit that he probably did think something would happen it's the same sort of thing that we get you know when you you know tweet at an airline and think that like maybe you have enough followers maybe that blue check mark will get them to like give you that uh refund that uh they wouldn't normally give people i mean and sometimes it works and i think for a teenager who has become sort of this public figure and has had like sit down meetings with president trump like in his mind he thinks that like oh maybe trump will call harvard or something you know and it's like first of all harvard is not taking calls from president fucking trump to trump don't care about your last night because here's the thing these these white people like trump who do this whole we're not racist song and dance right uh they are able to do this overt racism but not get caught saying the one thing right that republicans at least can't pretend is it racist right so you saying nigga a bunch of times means that you are not getting a call from trump sir because you are you are done you're finished he's ineligible wow which is pretty wild i also just another huge fuck you to the person who tweeted you know what barack obama should do is call harvard and try to convince him to let this kid in so he could do something for his image of like good will and as a peacemaker and i tweeted this i'm not saying that he should have gotten the nobel peace prize it did feel a bit early but he has a nobel peace prize there's no other thing he needs to look like a peacemaker and the idea that the first black president of the united fucking states would take a second out of his day to call harvard to defend some little white shit for saying nigga a bunch of times have you people lost your god damn mind he is busy creating a rival podcast company okay is busy i just need the audacity for that thought to even enter your mind do you know what barack obama should do you know how boracal and complaining about this racist kid and then the audacity to tweet it i that it even entered your mind is bonkers and then you said let me put this down for the world to see are you insane well to be fair he always saw the cover of the audacity of hope that's right didn't know what it was about yeah audacity but it's about having Harvard i speed dial so my favorite um thing about this entire incident is just sort of the soap opera way that he was sort of taken down and got his harvard um acceptance rescinded it was because of something completely unrelated to him even going the harvard or even saying the n-word right so there is a video where bill nigh was talking about climate control and he swears in it and it sort of went viral because people are like oh bill nigh swearing etc he quote tweeted that video talking about how bill nigh sounded like you know like a middle schooler like screaming at his xbox or something um that he was sort of degrading himself by using this language that's what caused someone who went to school with him you tweet at him and say if you want to talk about people using language that uh dedicates them let's talk about the language that you don't want people knowing that you've used in the past right so he set himself up and it was beautiful and it was it was beautiful it was like you should have mind your own fucking business and he could have still been at harvard right but because he decided to get cute on twitter with bill nigh of all fucking people he got taken to i mean and also these teams these youths have their receipt i'm like i don't see these children without a phone off on with the red with the with the recording on like these kids have all of your shit documented this isn't going to work you can't get away with this anymore you their entire lives they're just like they have files on like who we got today now obviously i'm afraid of teens period but the fact that they communicate so well in their underground google docs network too what is more frightening right yeah i i mean i threw out all of all of the aftermath of the shooting one of the things that i most admired was like the way that these parkland students were just like coming for people's fucking next they were like oh you know we we have been traumatized we have gone through this thing but like we are angry and we're going to do something about it and we're coming for all of you adults or not and so i like i'm glad that that same energy they're keeping up that same energy for uh for everyone around them bill night he's going to think about that for a long time yes you got taken down by commenting on a bill fucking night video uh uh i love laughing at racist teenagers i can't go to college and here's the thing that's my dear life with abigail fisher he's also he's going to go to college that's the other thing like he's like his life is not his the worst thing that has happened to him has already happened to him right his sad response um to the thread like the final one was well i turned down other colleges because i thought i was going to Harvard what am i supposed to do now so you take that gap year you apply next year yeah go to italy bitch like it's it you're fine teach for america oh my god watch you and you know what i bet i don't know i wouldn't be surprised if he ends up with like a white house internship or some show like that in the meantime or just like joint like is the blaze still open like i don't know does megan kelly need an intern do they need more examining at the washington examiner there are a myriad of jobs for a young racist teenager you know with uh with dreams with with dreams and and and mantis eyes uh when we're back keep it and we're back with our favorite segment of the week as usual it's keep it but maybe it's our least favorite segment oh man this time yeah there's some news yeah kara um this will be my second to last keep it episode um the audience just gas they just gas i know i mean let's be honest i'll probably roll up again um but your project yeah i yeah i'm like moving on to go to go work on some things which i uh will hopefully be able to inform you all about soon um but this is we got to start playing end of the road boys to men and now i'm gonna bring some hannassee next week and just just pour it out pour it out um we'll gather the whole gang oh yeah maybe we'll even let john favro peek his head in he can sit on the there's a chair that sort of off in the corner behind a tripod um he can sit there uh uh if voice demand does come here your sister also has to come here oh yeah yeah well i'll we have a lot of planning to do between now and next week's episode but yeah we'll get on it listen 83 episodes um next week it's a long run it is long run tired it's not quite syndication right you don't get the hundredth episode cake but it's up there i'll take it anyway kara you look perched you are ready for your keep it what is it i don't know if you guys saw recently but we have a we have a new person on twitter which is what we need it is oj simpson oh him oh j simpson fired up a twitter account and he's only been tweeting videos so he doesn't seem to understand what twitter is get a bit of it yeah so oj simpson is out here he did a video where he's like i'm i'm here twitter you're gonna hear all of my opinions on football and politics and then he said very ominously and i'm gonna get even with with a few people which i believe that effect he's known about and i just i'm not sure he understands the quickest way for him to end up back in prison was starting a twitter account like he's for sure he's gonna end up back in prison like a hundred percent a hundred percent you're doing videos he did another video on father's day i think where he just wanted to let everyone know that he's not attracted to chris jennifer never fucked her and isn't cloe kardashian's father that that's that's how he's spending his time and the worst part is i kind of wanted to follow him oh my god i don't feel good about it but i just like you know it's 2019 i'm in the chaos already i might as well lean into it i didn't and i'm not going to follow him but i want to be on top of it when inevitably he you know admits to another crime another murder um and i think the thing with oj simpson that i find most confusing not even confusing actually like i guess if you did get away with murder and in particular as like a black man i guess you would be really fucking cocky about it i guess you're like wow i am invincible i mean like i i guess i get the feeling where he's like what are they gonna do i murdered a white lady and i'm still here that's not even the shit i went to prison for i guess i get why you would feel emboldened by that um but it's terrifying and it just is so apropos um it also we were joined the same the same week like this weekend also on father's day bill Cosby tweeted like a bill Cosby account and calling himself america's dad america's dad so that's where we're at i i don't know yeah keep america's dad away from the pill cabinet once upon a time if you were following oj simpson you were at a private investigator i missed those days you weren't just somebody's cousin yeah i don't i mean i'm not look i'm not gonna follow him um but i am gonna watch those videos it's weird because i was uh tweeting about the fact that he's gonna think that he can be like trump on twitter right just be crazy and say whatever he wants but trump is one white trump is two a president who has the gop falling on swords for him and three it's trump never went to prison like trump's invincibility comes from the fact that his family has been laundering money and pulling scams in new york for decades like they've literally gotten away with so much it makes sense that they act like they're invisible invincible you went to jail for robbing someplace right and so i believe he said it was stealing back what was his or yeah yeah it was like memorabilia guy listen to his psyche uh he's gonna get even with that auctioneer but it's like you went to jail for something really dumb so what makes you think that you will not get caught up again because he didn't go to jail for the biggest thing that he did that's why he felt that way i yeah he even wrote if i did it yeah i mean listen if i were him i would be worried about ron goldman's family i'm not giving in any one ideas but i wouldn't taunt those people yeah with this bullshit yeah a couple of quote tweets from the from that family yeah you may be toast again yeah i i'm not sure that that's the way i go about it but i mean we live it's just like while he was in prison revenge aired on abc so that family may have some ideas look it's just like of course of course in 2019 fucking oj simpson as a twitter like of why wouldn't he of course he does remember when he used to be hot i mean i don't because i was you know four but yeah well occasionally you'll run across on twitter like a clip of him being on dave ladderman is just a funny guest and it really is among those chilling things you can say you know he doesn't look or in old movies yeah like naked gonders he doesn't look terrible for however long he was in prison i gotta say fair um guiltlessness doesn't age yeah apparently not apparently not um evil it's the one time where evil has preserved someone well instead of sarah could be sanders where she's fucking sorry i won't even i can't i don't even learn from death becomes her evil can preserve well you know what she doesn't have a job anymore she doesn't she's gone she doesn't she's gone she is she is hoping to join the view listen maybe oj simpson needs a social media manager that can be sarah hagavis sander's second act go record those videos of oj that he's gonna post on twitter too real luise what is your keep it this week often i run from keep it's and pick something safe that's actually like a cuddly compliment to somebody this is the opposite unfortunately it's a keep it to medana's new album madam x um i don't know if you know this i foremost identify as a medana stand i too am a repressed midwesterner with a catholic background who had a gap in his teeth for a long time and likes pop corn a lot did you know that that's medana's favorite food anyway guys the lyrics on this album and this is a tradition going back to now i'll say 1998 ray of light was the album and that that was the album where she lost faith in herself as kind of just a symbol who can deliver like by virtue of being medana is powerful and decided she needed to be quote wise yes needed to have lessons for us needed to like you know like take the the light from the kabbalah and give it to us via song that was the beginning of that since then her sort of like obsession with like platitudes with like a vague martyr complex etc have just turned into the most not just boring but like incoherent lyrics i just don't know what any of these songs are about really and occasionally she'll say things she'll invoke is real she'll invoke africa as a general concept which is my favorite thing she said i am a woman who has been raped she compared herself to africa she compared herself to a woman who's raped she compared herself to the gays yes to poor people that song killers who are partying is maybe the worst thing she's ever i think it's the number one this album is out it just came out yeah yeah i i mean like i've seen her do the interviews with that fucking eyepatch and i kept scrolling it's like not i can't not today i didn't realize the album has she been have they been pushing this she's gonna tour with it eventually it's it's she's like the queen of the bundling so like now she has a tour where you have to pay seven hundred dollars and you own eight copies of that album yeah um there are a couple songs that wander into disco and wander into like a latin moment that i enjoy but it's all you like that despite what is coming out of her mouth which is often garbled mm-hmm i often can't understand what she is saying and i would i would say her signature attribute is a singer at least in the 80s and 90s through the 2000s was she could really convey joy in her voice and now she can't do that anymore she feels it's it feels tentative it feels strange and very auto-tuned in a way that is not like Madonna yeah so i've obviously been on like a rollercoaster as someone who likes Madonna you know i love the 90s stuff the most i'm someone who defends rebel heart and hard candy uh and i mean i think american life is underrated has its moments however i enjoy parts of this album there's some songs that i think are really good but as a whole as i'm continuing to listen to it it's really just sort of a mess and i will say that her as a pop star you know before um she seemed comfortable letting other people sort of take a driver's seat you know like maybe write songs for her um and she could deliver it you know like she had the charisma the uniqueness the nerve and the talent you know and it's i feel like she is crafting these herself totally yes on the back of some scroll and i i wish she would not right or yeah just allow somebody to edit like change up the very obvious rhymes that don't pay off things like that just lyrically it's so like clunk clunk i you know what we have many great artists who songwriting was not their suit and i think if it's not yours anymore madata move on precisely not just like picked up the phone and called seah and been like girl because she's been writing all these like precisely too much pride and too much of a insane madonna fan base echo chamber that makes her believe that anything that she writes um has the keys to enlightenment because i don't think of her as like an amazing songwriter though she did she's kind of like a mariah where a lot of the signature songs you know about she actually get mariah mariah it's all of her shit like mariah is like a like all like her hits like all like almost all of mariah's hits it's and when you look at her albums like she's writing like those entire albums and allegedly that's the case with madata i mean like she wrote vogue you know the rich joseph act jumped out i mean i just i mean i also i mean i also review got dragged by madonna madonna stand because half of the review was like so she's not as good as mariah's i mean i i i i am i am not i'm not a madonna person so i obviously agree with that uh the best part was that they were just digging through his instagram fighting photos of him in mariah carry shirts it's like you're a mariah fan you're a lamb he's like a no no but he's like a noted mariah fan so like they're not clever i just love the concept of madonna fans in social media because you know we've talked about taylor stands and their insanity but like those make sense because they're used like taylor's been out only for like a decade or so um madonna stands i'm like sorry you should i get off of your android phone i feel like madonna fans are tweeting but like signing their tweets sure yeah also by the way i feel like i mean like i operated as a stand for years and years and years i still am one to a certain degree i always felt like that a strength of madonna fans were that even the most hardcore had a bone to pick with her like okay at that moment you had whatever at the vma is i hate it or whatever but that because that's what's cool about her she's like uh you know provocateur or whatever but i feel like within this era in the past couple years and maybe it's combating you know like the ageism and stuff that happens with her i feel like that sort of i have a bone to pick with her or like being able to be rational as a madonna fan it sort of jumped out the window right you end up defending all these other these other stupid gripes that people have about her i mean i feel like once you had to start defending her like call her karstan and word on instagram it was a slippery slope and you lost sense of reality right yeah all right well do you have a keep it you can you can play too if you want i do have i do have a keep it you know i have uh it's just been pressing on my soul you know it is pride month and um listen um rachel dole's all is actually you know what looks like we don't have time for it today looks like we don't have time anyway that's our shell thank you again to lon marelli for
