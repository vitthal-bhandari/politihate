    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Third hour of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show gets going right now. The economy is going to be front and center in the election and there are some worrying indicators about it. Inflation numbers are going to be coming out later this week. We'll certainly be diving into that with you and talk about how all this could affect them in terms in just a moment. But first, this is really an interesting story and it's one that I think everybody, certainly all the residents of the state of Pennsylvania should be familiar with, that when John Federman back in 2013 was the mayor of Braddock, a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, he said that he heard what he thought was gunfire. There was no gunfire. He saw a man running away. The man was jogging, just going out for a jog. The man was black. He had done nothing wrong. And then the mayor of Braddock, John Federman pulled a gun on him and according to this African American fellow who had done nothing other than going jogging. And these are all the facts of this are not a dispute. He claims that Federman pointed a gun at him and held him there effectively doing a citizen's arrest. This is a news report from back in 2013 on this. And I heard approximately a dozen or more what clearly sounded like assault rifle gunshots go off. Mayor John Federman says he rushed his son inside, called 911 and took off in his truck after a masked man in black he saw running. But Chris Mayeres, the man Federman confronted, turns out to be an innocent jogger who police say had no weapon. There wasn't any assault rifle shots. It was bottle rocket behind the library. Mayor Federman did have a weapon. A 20 gauge shotgun in the under the back seat of my truck, which I pulled out and I showed to just say, look, we're going to wait here and we're going to get this all sorted out when the police arrive. The iris and the mayor tell very different stories. He says Federman followed me into North Braddock and pulled a shotgun and aimed it at my chest. Did you point the shotgun at him? No, I did not. I pointed it, you know, way so that he would see that I was armed, but I did not point it at him. In fact, I didn't even have a round chambered or the remove the safety at that point. Okay, there's so much here. This big deal. Yeah. First of all, there are laws I'd have to check in Pennsylvania, but again, it's brandishing. You can't just pull out a gun and point it to me and say, Hey, I heard something I don't like. So I'm going to hold you here, right? He didn't. It's, it's not like this guy had a gun was firing a he just heard noises. Think about this. You heard noises that were not even gunfire. Apparently, this guy doesn't know the difference. You heard bottle rockets going off, found the nearest guy that he thought was suspicious, who happened to be black, pointed a shotgun at him. Nothing. There was no need for any of this. How is this? Can you imagine? Imagine a Republican, pick the nearest black guy jogging to point a gun at and effectively detain him for no reason whatsoever. And this isn't a, this wasn't a bigger issue at the time. Never mind now. I mean, it's crazy to me. Yeah. Look, couple of things. He got in his car, his truck and chased this random jogger down and held him under gunpoint until authorities arrived. This sounds buck, like what happened down in Georgia that turned into such a calamity. Except the murder of a moderate. You're talking about the murder of a moderate. That's right. That's basically what these guys did is what Fetterman did, except that situation turned violent because they shot the, the, uh, on our brewery because they alleged that he resisted their citizens arrest, but they also hopped in a truck, armed gunman, chased down this guy who claims that he was a, uh, uh, uh, and, and this is essentially the same thing that Fetterman did, except this guy didn't, uh, it fight back to the extent that you believe that he fought back at all. But this was a major flashpoint all over Georgia. These guys are in prison for life. And John Fetterman, who is the Democrat, but let's just break this down further, Buck. You're talking about a guy who is a Bernie Sanders clone in terms of the politics that he supports. Who chased down a black guy who just happened to be jogging in the neighborhood because he thought he heard gunshots and immediately assumed that the black guy was responsible for it. And then also had a stroke and cannot talk effectively, certainly, and is not recovered. John Fetterman is the worst nominee for Senate in many of our lives that is being put forward as the favorite and the guy who is going to theoretically replace the seat held by a sitting Republican senator right now. It's Dr. Oz against Fetterman and Fetterman is just imagine if this was a Republican candidate who had done this. Now, I believe Dr. Oz is running ads pointing out this left wing Bernie Sanders clone may also be racist because that's a, let's be honest, a pretty racist thing to do. So, so also just, just so, just so, just so, just based on the fact we all agree with. Yeah. Fetterman's story on this has changed a number of times over the years. Of course it has. He claims that he couldn't tell the guy was black. I would be, you know, of course, because he's trying to, he's trying to nullify any allegations of, of a racial bias in essentially, I hear meaning Fetterman hears what sounds to him like gunfire. So then he goes and drives after and chases down and holds at, I mean, this whole thing about, I just had a gun and I said, we're just going to figure this out. You know, he didn't tap him on the shoulder and say, excuse me fellow citizen, can we wait here peacefully to figure out what's going on with the help of law enforcement? Do you believe also there's no way he didn't point the gun at him? Of course, of course, of course he pointed the gun at him. There's no way to, I mean, the whole point of, of going to get the firearm is being, look, if he had seen a felony in progress and this guy was clearly the guy, that's a different situation. Now he's stepping in, still a super aggressive thing to do to hop into your car and chase him. Now, if you had seen like a violent felony and he knew that a guy committed a murder or something that's different, he just heard gunfire according to his own story and just hopped in a car and pulled over at gunpoint, the guy running closest to him. When you're doing something like this, you know, you are fully responsible and anybody who's a concealed carry permit holder knows, you know, this is such a part of, of, of defensive handgun or any weapons training you get, you know, I'm sorry he doesn't cut it. You know, if somebody runs out of a store and you say, Oh, I thought, I thought that they were the person holding up a store and you shoot the wrong person. You're, you're fully liable for this. Right. I mean, you know, you better be damn sure if you're going to use lethal force that you know what you're doing. Now, granted, he didn't use any force here. So there's a, obviously that's a huge distinction, an important distinction, but it does go to the mindset here. He grabbed a gun, he went after the wrong person and Clay said that he thought it was a salt weapons fire. He said that. I mean, we heard the audio of that. Did this guy didn't have, I mean, he's out jogging. He clearly, where's he hiding this AR 15 that Fetterman thinks that he heard? Why did he think it was this guy? I think that's the big question. I mean, if, if you hear gunfire and you see a guy with a gun, it's a pretty good indicator of like, I think it's probably this guy. He didn't believe that he ever had a gun. So why, it doesn't make any sense. It goes to the judge mill over this too, right now, running for Senate in Pennsylvania. Wouldn't this be something that you would think the media would be like all over if he weren't a Democrat? Well, the Democrats, Connor Lamb and the other, I forget the other Democrat was running against Fetterman in the primary. They made a big deal of this. I think they were right to it. So interesting though, media hasn't really spent a lot of time focusing on this one. I think we all know why. What a, what a shockingly weak candidate. I mean, you have this bizarre Bernie Sanders asking his policies. I mean, the thing is he's not a law and order guy. He's actually a open up the prisons and defund police guy, or at least he has in the past, who pulls guns out on random people. This case just happens to be a black guy. And everyone thinks that he's going to be a good senator for what reason? Like he didn't have a job in his thirties and forties, but his family paid for him to live. He bought his house from his sister for a dollar. He just had a stroke and is lucky to be alive. He's a Bernie Sanders supporter and he may be a racist, uh, uh, pursuer of a random black jogger. And that's why I say he is the worst nominee for a major political party in a Senate race in, in, in frankly, the 21st century, not just this, this cycle. I mean, he just also on, on, on pure intellectual horsepower and, and health reasons. Oz is just a clearly better choice than Fetterman. I mean, I don't know what else to say. I mean, just, he's, he's healthy, you know, his intellectual faculties are all functioning properly right now. And he's a smart guy who's, you know, been very, very successful even beyond being a, you know, an MD and all the rest of it. Fetterman wears slumpy sweatshirts and looks like a WWE character. And people think that means that he's like a working class guy. That's well, why? I think the whole thing is condescending, honestly. No, no, I, I agree with you. I think it's totally condescending. But if you're, uh, let's say a black guy in Philadelphia or Pittsburgh, you know, one of the urban centers of Pennsylvania, why in the world are you going to be motivated to go vote for John Fetterman to be your next senator? The dude who chased down a black dude and pulled a gun on him because he thought he looked suspicious after he misheard what he believed. And we heard from the guy who swan said that he pointed the gun at my chest. I believe him. And two, he's upset and rightly so. I mean, imagine for everybody out there, you are literally jogging money. And remember this is, there's no dispute. This guy did absolutely nothing wrong. He was just a jogger. Everyone agrees. Just jogging. Your jogger and some, some random loon chases you down and points a shotgun at your chest and says, you're going to stay here till the authorities arrive. I would be very pissed off about that. Yeah. And I'm curious where that guy is now if he's talking to the media because that story goes to the essence of who John Fetterman is. He tries to claim that he's a hoodie wearing Bernie Sanders clone. Maybe he is, but when he thought that there was danger, he immediately expected a black guy did it and pointed a gun and even the argument, like he should get grilled on this. So you had a gun in your arms. He claims you were pointing it at him. Where were you actually pointing it? If you weren't pointing it at him, what would be the point of having the gun if you weren't threatening, like you might shoot him and think about it. This is like saying if you're an interrogation shot him. Yeah. If you're an interrogation, I didn't point the gun on him. I just put the loaded hand get on the table in front of the, the front of the suspect, you know, just to let him know. Yeah. That's a threat. Like we all understand when you chase somebody down in his hands. I mean, he had to have been pointing it out. Of course. This could clearly be Ahmed Arbery. If the guy had fought back at all, Fetterman probably would have shot it. Well, just also look at the way the media treated, for example, the professor Gates. Remember this? I believe it was Professor Gates up at Harvard because the cops are called on this guy. They were called then they didn't just like take him out for no reason. They're called. They say there might be a break in. They have a conversation with him. There is no arrest made. Nothing happens. And it was a national outcry of racism. And this is terrible. And you know, Obama has brought in to have the beer summit and all this stuff. There was there was it was a no harm, no foul situation. But those cops, initially people, all those cops are so racist. Fetterman chased a random black guy with a shotgun because he heard some, you know, party fireworks in the background. And this is just we're all supposed to just forget about this. I don't know. It's a big story. It's one of many reasons why he is completely unelectable.

Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We roll through what should be a hopefully good Monday for all of you. We're talking about many of the different Senate battles that are in place there. We also have a primary going on in New Hampshire. Tomorrow we're going to be joined by Caroline Levitt. She is a congressperson candidate and she is only 25 years old, Buck. So she would be one of the very very progressive congressmen, congresswoman. I don't know what she is going to be potentially a 25 year old soon to be 26 member of that. I believe she would qualify as the youngest of all time, right? Right up there. I mean, it comes down to when we'll ask her where exactly the birthday would would apply here. She's fired up, Buck. I don't know if you've paid a lot of attention to this. We've got some big stories coming up on it soon and we need to talk about it more on this program. Have you seen that the Biden administration is redefining title nine to consider gender identity a protected class? And I'm paraphrasing here because we'll get into more detail on it. We need to have some guests who've really break this down for us. But what it would essentially mean is that title nine, which it which allows women's athletics to compete and have equal roughly scholarship numbers as men, title nine, pegs the number of athletic scholarships that are given to the overall rates of enrollment. So if you're 50% male enrollment, 50% female enrollment, you have to have an equal number of scholarships for both men and women. This would officially make it federal law, Buck, that if you are identifying as a man, sorry, a man identifying as a woman, you get to compete in women's athletics. And there are no choices that are allowed to be made by universities to stop that from happening without it being a federal title nine violation. Yeah, this is the Biden administration using the administrative powers of the executive branch to go around. Because do you think Congress right now would would really do very well if they tried to pass a chance at law? Yeah, you think that like Joe Manchin really, you know, if he wants to keep his job of West Virginia, he wants to put his name on the men can compete against women in sports, or else the government will step in and sue it's this is an even a let's be nice to each other, or you know, they've moved past that this is now the force of the state will mean that your 12 year old daughter has to change in the same locker room as some 12 year old boy who says he's a girl or or else that's what this now turns into. And this is what they've wanted all along. I remember the Obama administration even was I always get it was think it was North Carolina, which one of us getting in all the trouble is the North Carolina with the bathroom bill transgender bathroom bill was a monster issue in Charlotte. Yeah. And they they the Obama administration threatened to cut off funding for federal schools. I mean, for for schools from the department of education. They didn't go to the all star game out of Charlotte because they said you need to use the bathroom that is on your birth birth certificate. My friends was only late June three months ago when Rovers is weighed was overturned by the Supreme Court returning the decision to individual states. One fact hasn't changed though in the past five decades more than 63 million babies have had their lives taken lives never lived. The good people working at preborn pregnancy clinics know this sobering fact all too well. Their mission began over 16 years ago. And that's to provide help to women with unplanned pregnancies by offering free ultrasounds. You see when an expectant mom hears her baby's heartbeat and sees the image of her baby on on an ultrasound, she sees a life created in God's image a miracle. And most of the time she will choose life by positioning their clinics and states where abortions often occur preborn has rescued hundreds of thousands of babies lives. They've become the country's largest provider of free ultrasounds, but they are dependent on help from you the pro life community. One ultrasound is just $28 and $140. $140 helps to rescue five babies lives. I donate. I'm asking you to please donate to all you have to do is dial pound two five zero on your cell phone and say the keyword baby that's pound two five zero say the keyword baby. The midterm elections just weeks away we're looking really at the general mostly now, but for at least one place New Hampshire's first congressional district. It is still for the next 24 hours primary season. And there is quite a battle underway in the state of New Hampshire for that Republican nomination. We've got Caroline Leavitt with us now she is running in New Hampshire's first congressional district. Caroline, great to have you on the program. Thank you guys so much for having me. It's great to be with you. So why is this such a throw down? I'm seeing some of the coverage here the media coverage. It's getting nasty up there in New Hampshire. People throwing some elbows on the GOP side. What's at stake here and why are you in this race? Well, thank you so much for giving me the opportunity to address the six million dollar dirty smear campaign from the Washington DC establishment that has been waged against me in the last couple of weeks. Look, when I got into this race last summer, nobody knew who I was. I had zero bucks in my campaign account, but I had a will to fight for the people of my great home state of New Hampshire. I was fresh out of President Trump's White House at the time. I served in his press office as assistant press secretary to Kaylee McEnany. So I saw the swamp firsthand. I saw the corrupt media in action. I used to fight against them with Kaylee and her infamous press briefings with the briefing book. I came back home and thought we need this fight to continue not only against the Democrats, but the corrupt establishment Republicans too. So I've been pounding the pavement in my home district, New Hampshire's first where I grew up, where I went to school where my family owns two small businesses. And we have now encroached on the plans of the establishment and their hand picked up it in this race. My opponent, Matt Mowers, who is the former chief of staff to Dr. Deborah Burke. He's a longtime political operative for Chris Christie. The guy already lost in the general election last year and the establishment is now spending $6 million to keep his imploding campaign alive to smear me. But I'll tell you, it's not working. Actually, it's backfiring voters in New Hampshire are smart and they understand that when they're attacking you, it's because they're threatened by you. And that's exactly right. They know I can't be controlled. They won't control me. We're going to win tomorrow. We're going to win November and we're going to help take back to house this year. Caroline, you wrote a piece for Outkick. You're a former college athlete. We were just discussing these new proposed Title IX rules that would allow men to compete against women. It's absolute insanity. What are you hearing from people all over New Hampshire about this idea? And what do you think about the fact that this radical proposition even exists in the first place? Frankly, it disgusts me. And I know it disgusts so many voters, especially women across New Hampshire. I've been talking about this issue since the day I launched my campaign last summer because as you noted, it's personal to me. As a young woman, as a former collegiate athlete, I worked so hard and made a lot of sacrifices as so many women and girls do across this country to compete at the highest level possible. I was an NCAA college softball player. And to think about the fact that a man who is bigger than me, stronger than me, physically superior to me, could take my starting position at third base on my college or even high school softball team in America today is disgusting. And so I've taken a very strong position on this. When I am elected to Congress, and I want to be only Republicans, candidates, frankly, in this whole country talking about the issue, and I think that that is not okay. We all need to be speaking up and conserving the basic fundamental value that men and women are different. So when I'm elected, I will propose legislation that will defund any publicly funded, taxpayer funded, college or university across this country that allows for using justices to occur because they are a direct violation of Title IX, which women and girls championed back in the 50s and 60s and 70s to get signed into law. And now all of these leftists in the name of progressivism, right? This is actually regression. And where are all the feminists? It's so disgusting. I've been calling it out. It will continue to do that. I will be a champion for women and girls, female athletes across this country when I'm elected in November. It's been the Caroline Levitt. She's running in New Hampshire's first congressional Caroline. The primary is tomorrow, right? So where should folks go to learn more about you, your positions, your campaign? Yes, the primary is tomorrow, polls open in a little bit more than 12 hours from now. They can go to my website, carolineforconquers.com. It's Caroline with a K. You can find me on Twitter, get our true social, Instagram, Facebook. I run all my social media accounts myself. And if you're in New Hampshire and you're listening to this, don't let the swamp buy this seat. Don't pay attention to the negative attack ads. It's a desperate near campaign because they know I cannot be controlled and they want their hand-picked puppet to win this race. I encourage and humbly ask for everyone's vote tomorrow. Let's reject the swamp and flood the polls. We are going to win. We're going to take back to house. We're going to put America first again as we did under my former boss, President Trump. All right, Caroline, Buck and I are relatively young guys on radio. I'm 43 bucks just turned. I mean, I'm relatively young. I don't know about. He's a different. He's a different general. Buck's a millennial. If you're out there listening and you're thinking to yourself, Oh, this sexy guys far too young. I'm I'm I'm the last year of Generation X. Caroline, what year were you born? I was born in 1997. So I will actually be the first generation the member of Congress. So this is amazing because I think this is important. Everybody out there listening right now. Buck and I know you, Caroline, I it's always funny sometimes to read media and you're attacked as if you are this crazy right wing infidel. And then you come and you meet and you're like very friendly, very easygoing and you recognize how much the media agenda is trying to dictate the way that people perceive. So you're 25 years old. You're fighting so hard. I think a lot of people out there listening right now would be incredibly gratified to go check out everything that you're arguing for because there's a lot of people out there in their 60s and 70s who would love to have a granddaughter who was out there fighting as hard for all of these truths as you are. I'm sure you hear that in New Hampshire a lot, right? That there's this desire for a younger generation to sort of pick up the banner and lead the charge. Yeah, that's exactly right. You know, it's funny because the establishment attacks on me the six million dollars they're spending are trying to paint me as you know, too young or too immature for this job. But they might want to get out of the swamp once in a while and come talk to actual voters in real America because voters are thirsty. I mean, they're dehydrated for young, vibrant, energetic leadership. And that's why I got into this race. I'm from this district. I have a lot of friends and family here. My family's in business here for decades. And before I even announced I was running, I talked to them and I said, what do you think about me running? Every single person said, yes, we need someone exciting. Someone who makes us want to get involved and someone who is going to reach out to their children and their grandchildren because if we don't, frankly, we're going to lose this country. Cultural Marxism is making its way through every institution in America. Our public school system, our higher ed university system, the corrupt one state party media, the big tech companies are all pushing it. If we don't break through that noise, if we don't stop this indoctrination by electing energetic, youthful, conservative leaders like myself, we're not going to just lose elections. I mean, we're literally going to lose America as we know it. And voters love that idea. And so I think it's just so funny that establishments wasting their money on these vicious attacks because they don't actually understand that people want fighters. They don't care how old you are. They want someone who's going to go down there and fight fight for them, fight for their kids, their grandkids. And that's exactly what I've been doing over the last year. I think right now our listeners on Manchester's W G I R and up in Rochester Portsmouth area, W Q S O. You folks listening could make the difference in this primary and in this congressional race in the general coming up. Our friend Caroline Levitt, Carolyn, thanks so much for being with us. Appreciate it. Thank you guys. Get out tomorrow and vote my fellow grandestators. Thanks for having me. God bless you guys. I'm telling you, if she wins, and I think she's going to win tomorrow, she is going to be an absolute rock star. On Capitol Hill. I think she'll win. She's going to beat Chris Pappas and and take back a current Democrat seat in New Hampshire. Phenomenal, phenomenal young woman, just super embullient, you know, full of energy, very much on board with with the Trump policy ideology. And I just say it's amazing. If she wins, she Madison, just yada, and Ohio was a longtime friend of mine who just won her primary and Anna Paulina Luna down in Florida and the Tampa area. Three friends of mine may well be so I'll be very proud three personal friends maybe sitting on sitting in Congress. So I all younger than you two old man. I don't know how you're going to handle that. It's a lot of it's a lot of a lot of millennials in that in that. Well, she's Gen Z. I think Anna Paulina. She's a millennial like me. And you know, I don't know, Clay, we'll have to see what are you Jen? You Jen, what a last time generation. What are you? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Me and Calvin Coolidge. I'm the last year of Gen X. So 79, we were the last year 1980, I believe in millennials officially began my sisters a millennial. I'm Gen X. And that's why I'm so much cooler than she is. Most of you and most of you probably wouldn't describe yourselves as preppers. Even if you do though, that's okay. You're likely to describe yourself. However, what as well informed and aware of what exactly is going on out there, you pay attention to what's important to you and your family and something that might be on your radar right now, likelihood potential food shortages. We saw it a couple of years ago when you would go into your grocery store, you couldn't find things. How about baby formula? Nobody wants to talk about it. But baby formula is out there still hard to find for many different people. This is what the Biden regime does. And now that we got the Ukraine war energy issues continuing as we move into the winter, why not go ahead and prepare your family for the worst case scenario with a three month emergency food kit from my patriot supply.

Preparewithclayandbuck.com one more time. Prepare with clay and buck.com Welcome back in clay, Travis Buck's extended show. Caroline got a lot of people fired up. And Buck, we were talking about during the break that one of the real stories that is out there on the horizon ready to be grabbed is the amount of young, talented, incredibly articulate women that are running in Republican potential new congressional seats, whether it's Myra Flores, whether it's Catalina love, whether it's your friend, Paul and a poll. I can't believe I left off Catalina another friend of mine, Catalina Lauf up in up in Michigan. She also may well be the nice. Is it is it? I think it's is it Indiana? I think we've got her state wrong. And I but I don't think she's Indiana. I think she's Michigan. Look up the state. It's somewhere in the Midwest Illinois. It's Illinois. Oh crap. I got it. I got my I got my Midwest states. Yes, it's it's pardon me. It's Illinois. Yeah. All right. I said Indiana. We got it Illinois. All right. So she could win Anna Paulina Luna. We're running through Caroline, who you just heard from. These are big messages because the Republican Party message, I really believe this is resonating with a large variety of people. Remember they used to do that old SNL skit where they said like the Republican Party, there's room for you. And it was like all these white guys in suits with briefcases. And then they like panned out and it was like one person who wasn't a white guy with the suit and a briefcase. Look, we're going to have a squad, I think here on the right. Yes. Of young super dynamic, conservative women include by the way, I mean, we're not we're not diversity obsessed on our side, but there's also going to be some diversity, I believe, within that group. And I'm just pointing that out because you're going to have, I think, a whole crew of new young female elected officials at the national level who are very smart, who have done this on their own, who are highly telegenic. I think I can say that. Highly telegenic. They will not get vanity fair covers. They will not get the star treatment, but they are stars. And the fact that their stars actually terrifies the left. Well, that's right. And they'll be able to go after the AOCs in a world, frankly, in a way that older white guys can't, right? Because there's a generational divide you have to worry about, are you going to get called sexist? Are you going to get called racist? If you call out AOC, like that ridiculous interview that she did. And I think we're going to see a real throwdown in the marketplace of ideas. It's not getting a lot of attention right now, but you and I have met many of these candidates who have very good chances to win. And they're going to continue to broaden the appeal. And we got one caller who wants to weigh in here. I believe my hometown of Carl in Nashville. What do you think of Caroline? First of all, I am so encouraged. Second of all, I'm a native Nashvilleian too. I want to tell you, when I was 28, this is the key we've got to get. We have to retake the language. And this lady's right on it. You guys are right on it. We have to stop saying we're not a democracy. We are republic. That's what set me free. And then from there, I encourage all this is so I'm 60. Like, when you said 60, I was getting ready to call. And I am telling you, there are millions of us out here hungry. We're so thankful. I still have hope in the young people because for one, they're in the military, but you guys are doing great. Carry on the good work. Remember, we've got to retake this language. We're not a democracy. They're there for the community purposes. Thank you for the call, Carl. And Buck, I'm sure this is something you hear too as such a young man as you are as a member of the millennial generation. I can speak for the millennials clay. Yes. As an old old man, Gen X are here. But I do think there are a lot of people out there in their 60s and 70s who listen to us on a regular basis. And they sometimes get discouraged, not only about where the country is right now, but they think if we're right here now, where are we going to be in 20 years? And I'd like to think that the answer is Buck, you and I'll still be fighting battles. But Caroline here is 25 years old. There are a lot of Carolines people in their 20s and 30s ready to go to war here in the same way that the pollsters and the corporate Democrat media are constantly trying to shade people's thinking, constantly trying to push certain perceptions about the direction, the trajectory of the country and all the rest of this. Yes, the youth that vote tend to vote more Democrat, but we have a lot of young conservative all-stars. And I mean, like young is in younger than us. I'm talking about people that are in their 20s and 30s who are coming up now. And you won't hear about them the same way is my point. You won't, they're not going to get the same kind of celebrity treatment in the media. But you know, somebody like Anna Paulina Luna down in Florida, she's, she's the married to Special Forces veteran. She is Latina. She is totally self made. And you know, she's hopefully going to be the next member of Congress. Catalina Lauf, somebody who's also that Myra Flores, you're noticing that there are a number of women of, you know, Latinx, Latinx heritage who are there in their early 30s, late 20s, and they're going to be superstars. So the lit by the way, the media is going to hate this because they like the dominance that AOC has on Instagram among the influencers, you know, that's, that's something that's going to get challenged. And we're going to try to bring a lot like we just did with Caroline, we're going to try to bring a lot of these new young voices onto this show because as Buck is pointing out, most of them are not going to get substantial amounts of attention from the media. You might not know that they're out there. We're going to bring those voices to you and allow you to see the country is actually going to continue, I believe, to trend back from insanity and in the direction of sanity. And we're going to be leading that charge here. And there's also established voices that will continue to have on like our friend, Senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin in a critical battle in that state for that Senate seat. He'll be with us tomorrow on the show. We're going to talk about the latest CPI data with him. That's right inflation coming out tomorrow."
