    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show and thank you so much for tuning in. If it's your first time here, my name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. We have a very fun show today. First up, we're going to be talking about dating with Tommy Laren. Someone who I bet you thought would not be giving out dating advice while she's gone and done it and surprise, surprise, her dating takes are just as controversial as her political ones. Then a Keelah versus Sargon, there's been a new development in that YouTube centric court case. Next, we're going to be talking about turf wars. Lush has, I guess, pled their allegiance to the trans cause and dictionary.com of all places is calling out trans exclusionary radical feminists. And then finally, the Matrix, did you know, is apparently an allegory for transgenderism. I did not know that. Most people did not, but that is now what the creators are saying about the movie kind of seems like they might be pulling and JK Rowling there. A little bit of revisionism. Before we get into it though, I do want to ask that if you are enjoying this show, please be sure to like, share and subscribe. It helps out so, so much. And if you are an audio only fan, listener of podcasts, you can find us on iTunes, Spotify and Google Play. And of course, if you do want to go the extra mile to support the show, you can of course always find us on Blaestv.com slash Lauren. If you subscribe using the code, Lauren, not only do you help us keep the lights on over here, you also get a ton of other great shows to watch. So, actually before we get into it, we should probably mention that we are bringing back the hour long. Yes. Episodes, you know, we were doing those 25 minute-ish episodes for a while, but I think that there's more demand for the hour long. A lot of people were sad. Yeah. So yeah, we'll be doing that. We're not sure if we're going to go back live for the time being, but yeah, the hour segments are back and we'll have a little bit more digestible YouTube clips. Yeah, we're going to try to make it. As ideal as possible for both the podcast people and the YouTube video people. And let us know if the live shows really are something you miss because I've heard people say, bring them back. I've heard others say they never caught them live anyway. We want to hear your feedback for sure. Any and all feedback is definitely welcome. Unless it's about like our hair and stuff because as we know that is a sensitive issue. Okay. So first off, Tommy Laren, she's on Fox Nation, I believe she went online. I think it was Instagram Live, the other day to give some dating advice for young men and her advice proved to be controversial. We have some clips of it here. I'm just going to come right out and say, I understand why this has been controversial. I do not agree with a lot of what she says here, but I'll let you guys decide for yourself how you feel about it. Here's the first clip. This is a PSA for all the men out there and all the boys who think they're men, but they're actually boys. This is going to be the summer of canceling boys. Now from my own personal experiences and the experiences of all of my friends, which range and age from 24 to 36, we've all got issues. Now I will also say this, all of my friends are attractive. All of my friends are successful. All of my friends have something going on. Almost every single one of them have an issue with men. They're all successful. They're all intelligent. They're all good people. But if all of these women, including myself, are having issues, then I have to think it might not be us. It might be you. It might be men. Yikes. That is not the take I expected Tommy learning to have in 2020. You're sounding a bit like a feminist there. Yeah, definitely. Yeah. The vast generalizations, the PSA, the pants and all men. That definitely reeks of a progressive crazy girl. Yeah. It would be fair to Tommy Larian since that clip kind of blew up. She did do a follow up on her social media account, kind of clarifying. No, she doesn't think all men are trash. This was just directed at certain men. And she also went on to say just to make sure people knew that this was also not directed at her, I think ex-fianc\u00e9. And I think she did a good job maybe clarifying her points in that follow up. But in terms of what she has said here, a lot of people were kind of bringing up that, and this is something similar to what Jordan Peterson has said in regard to incels that if it's all men, you're having a problem with maybe men aren't the problem. Right? Yeah, that is. If it's all women, you're having problems with maybe women aren't the problem. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, for me, another thing that she kept bringing up too is how successful her and her friends are, which I think is great. It's a good thing. That's nice, yeah. I really do not think that that is like, and the checklist for me and most other men I know, that's not like, that's not even present. It's really not present. I mean, the intelligence and attractiveness, yeah, those are probably at the top of the list. So it's good on them. But I mean, the career stuff is actually to some degree a detraction. Like that's like, you know, what does that mean in terms of family life and just how much time do you have for kids, things like that. Yeah. And I think throughout the clips, we have some more of them. She kind of displays this, perhaps lack of awareness of what men want, right? She's talking about female dating market value as if it's from a female's perspective, thinking like, hang on, I have a great job. Why aren't men attracted this? All my friends are super successful. It's like, well, maybe it's because men don't want the same things women want. And just because you possess the qualities you would like to see in a made as a woman, doesn't necessarily mean it translates into men finding that attractive. Yeah. And it's kind of funny because there was actually a piece recently that we covered probably three or four months ago now, I want to say that was literally about it was some progressive piece about women who are becoming more wealthy, having trouble finding men that are wealthier than them of the same status as the hypergamous drive, right? So pretty much men, poor women suffer. Yeah. Exactly. But that's kind of what this felt like to me, to some degree where there was a little bit of that where it was like, you know, the wealthy men that are in our category of or the people that we think that we would like to date or deserve whatever it is. Yeah. They're not interested in us though. They're interested in the 21 year old. And she actually will see, she goes on to say stuff like that. Now I've often talked about the Pissification of America and how men are no longer men. I talked to my mom about this a lot and she says, well, maybe it's just the guys in Texas. Maybe it's just the guys in Los Angeles. It is not just the guys in Los Angeles Nashville Dallas and it's not they're not any better in the Midwest. But I think quite frankly, I think they're trash all over this country and the age range of about 20 to I think about 55, maybe even 60, a lot of men are trash. So despite what she would go on to say in her follow up video, she kind of seems to be doubling down on the idea that just men are trash. And I will say that it's true. A lot of guys are trash. A lot of women are trash. A lot of people are trash nowadays, especially in regard to dating. So I'm not going to push back on that. But I think if you are someone and this is not just an issue, Tommy Laren has where you can't find anybody at a certain point, you need to step back and think, what am I doing wrong? Yeah. Because there are good people out there who do want to date seriously, start a family and all that. And if you can't find any of them, you may be just looking in the wrong place or not putting out maybe the right message or the right signals. Yeah. I find like I've got a fine line to like walk here where I was like, all men are trash is somewhat true. But now I look like a white knight and I have some exception. No, but the idea is like, I think what you said, when we're divided by groups, of course, we'll find that all men are trash because I think today people are trash people in general, like I just don't want anything to do with most of them. So that's how it is. So is that observation incorrect? No, but at the same time, I like the women that I would deem to be caught like call a lady or something like that. It's just like rounded to a percentage, a whole number would be, you know, one or zero percent of people. So I mean, men are trash, women are trash. We're all trash right now here in the declining West. I feel for her to some degree, but I think that looking at it from the lens of just, oh, men are the problem here is just incorrect. Yeah. And especially like I kind of wonder like, what do you hope to accomplish with a video like this? Because she kind of aims it as I'm going to educate you. I'm going to help you see what women want. And it's like, I don't know if you're starting off on the best. But actually this next part of the video is maybe something that like the only part I agree with, she talks about making plans. And I do appreciate this part. This is me backwards for you guys. Make plans. Make a plan. I'm not assume that you can text somebody randomly in the middle of the day. What are you doing or text them at midnight or what I am or two I am or even just within hours of when you actually want to see them and think that they're going to be available. I personally, once I get home and I take my makeup off and I'm watching TV, I'm no longer interested in regard to that. Okay, ladies, including Tommy Larian, if a guy is texting you at midnight or one I am asking, what are you doing? You're being booty called. Okay. No. I'm not going to be on that. That is not that is not a guy looking for a relationship. But to her more broader point, it did bother me when I was single when guys would try to do that. Like no, like what I appreciated about Liam, he was such a gentleman when we started going out is he made real dates, right? And then, you know, he wouldn't do the thing where it's like, Oh, are we going to hang out? I don't know. Should I make plans? Like he would take the time to actually make a plan with me so that I knew that I was a priority. And it's true. A lot of guys. Yeah, because you're just you're just a respectful person who respects my time, right? Yeah, well, I have that same thing where it's like with my time, I hate when people, my time, I really do. And yeah, I value my own time a lot. So it just makes sense for me to plan it out. But I'm happy that also it happens to be that I think the correct thing to do with people is just respectful. Yeah. And when you're dating, when you when you just make someone feel like an afterthought by not planning ahead, it's it's you're kind of putting it out there that you're not that interested. Afterthought. Yeah, that's good. The midnight test. But yeah, I do I do agree with that. And that's something that maybe I think a lot of guys just haven't learned properly from maybe their parents or whatever. And I think a lot of women are just as culpable because they buy into it. They, they're not expecting more from men. They're not giving more to men themselves. So it's like we're both letting each other down. Yeah, that's what I was going to say. Because the lack of courtship does some degree. Yeah, there's a lot of lack of courtship. Like, you know, the first dates tend to go further than they should by a wide margin. But yeah, I do think there's some degree of culpability here in the women's court because I know plenty of women that are happy just for like exactly that kind of thing. And you know what in personal preference, I don't. But at the same time, it's like, I don't advocate for it, but ladies, you like for everybody, you teach people how to treat you. Yeah. Right. By like if you're upset with a guy's behavior and you're still like hooking up with him, you have no one to blame by yourself. Like you're not going to get better unless you demand better, unless you also put out better as well, because I think a lot of it is reciprocal. And if you're not upholding your end of a relationship by being considerate, caring, affection, everything you should be, why would you expect more from your partner is just not going to happen? And then here in this next part of the video, this is where Tommy really displays the fact that in her mind, men want exactly the same qualities in women that women want in men. But that just isn't true value value. Take that in. Just repeat it to yourself until it makes sense. Okay. If you want a data girl that has nothing going on, then that's fine. But please do not mix in people like me and my friends who have something going on with your other girls that have nothing going on. But if you want to mix in people like me and people like my friends who are go-getters, who work really hard, who make their own money, who are talented, skilled, ambitious, please don't mix us in with the Tatianas. We don't want to be there. She's much better than those other women. Honestly, though, I'll be honest with you, I don't have a problem with anything you just said. I really don't. I'm sorry. I don't care. I'm elitist. I don't care. But there is like, you know, I've, I've, I was young. I was, I didn't do crazy things, but I've been around people that I'm like, you know, this is not a respectful human being, for sure. And I don't want what I wouldn't want to associate myself or. She's not like slut-shaming or anything like that. She's saying, don't associate us with these girls that have nothing going on in their lives. And she brings up like, you know, every job is important, I suppose, but don't compare us to these girls who don't know what they're doing with their lives. So she's making it like, like an elitist. An economic thing. Yeah. And economic thing. And I, I kind of take issue with that. Cause it's like, when we first started dating, like I had YouTube as a hobby and I was working at a like family business. It was not a big deal. So it's like, was I less dateable to you as a man back then because my job wasn't as prestigious. Probably more dateable. Yeah. No, but seriously. Like honestly, that's the truth of it. I, yeah, from, from like a job perspective, I don't, I don't agree with what she said. If that's the lens we're looking at it from, but from like a social perspective of like, what these people are like in terms of their values or. Yeah, that I'm like, you know, if you want to separate these two worlds, you know, like that's fine. Yeah. Um, but kind of proving the fact that I am right in terms of what her intent is, we have this next clip where she just really lays it out on the line. There's a lot of women out there that I know that are my good friends who have amazing jobs who work really hard, but who can't seem to find a decent guy, even if they go up an age five to 10 to 15 years, because those guys all want to be with 21 year olds who have nothing going on. It's very unfortunate. I don't think it's going to be fulfilling. But I would say to the men out there, kind of maybe find a woman that you can talk to, communicate with, might actually have her together, might actually be ambitious and have something going on or want to have something going on. See what she talks about having something going on. She means in terms of career, read ambition and stuff like that. No, you're definitely right. And for that, it's like, uh, no, you don't understand the male. No, I'm sorry. That's not how it works at all. I don't care. I don't care about that at all. Yeah. And I think most men are like that, especially if you are a guy that I think would be considered dateable on Tommy Laren's view, you probably, like she said, have the pick of the letter. You could be dating 21 year olds who are willing to make your career their focus. So why, like, you know, if you're a guy who has all the money and career ambitions in the world, why do you need someone who also has money and career ambitions? Right. Exactly. If you're doing, if you're doing the work for two or three people or whatever for the whole family, you kind of want someone that's just able to support you in the rest of your life. Right. So I completely understand those choices that those men are making. I mean, I hope that they're not just a factor of like lust and those kinds of things. But no, it doesn't make sense to me that you would want that kind of ability to, I guess, you know, she's saying to speak with somebody like you can relate to them on a business level. Yeah. That's not something that I think, you know, first of all, first of all, there are other men, right? Like I have friends. We go co workers. We have coworkers. We can talk about those things ourselves. Yeah. I don't need everybody to be to relate to me and every facet. You know, Lauren and I don't need to be different versions of the same people in order to do it wrong. Yeah. Because otherwise you'd be looking for some sort of like philosophy major or something. And that would be the disaster. Yeah. But I kind of, I mean, I feel bad for women like Tommy Laren because, you know, she's good looking. She's successful. But I think she's bought into this narrative that essentially an entire generation has been sold that men and women are the same and we want the same things when we date, which is just not true. And I think a lot of people were kind of surprised when she went on the same. Like I thought Tommy was Tradd. It's like, you could be right wing without being Tradd. And I think even within like the whole maga movement, a lot of women probably feel the same as she does where it's like, well, I'm successful. I have my own money. Shouldn't I be like this huge catch? And it's like, no, and I'm not going to say like get back in the kitchen or anything like that because obviously like I work, I have a job, but it's just, you know, keep in mind that, you know, some of the people you're looking into and that you might want to date, they have their own preferences. So maybe try to think about the situation from their perspective, not just what you want and who you want to date and assume that you must be just this huge catch.

So next up, we have the story about YouTuber Carl Benjamin, who I am a huge fan of. We've had the pleasure of meeting him several times. Well, he's been kind of wrapped up in this court case for at least three years now. If you, if you aren't familiar with it, we have a little briefing here. So this was taken from reason.com. I think they have the official court briefing. It says on November 18th, 2016, Hughes, an internet commentator and filmmaker posted a nine minute and 52nd video titled, we thought she would win to her YouTube channel. The next day, Hughes discovered that Benjamin, a fellow YouTuber, but with a decidedly conservative slash libertarian bent had posted a video titled SJW levels of awareness to one of his YouTube channels. Benjamin's video consisted entirely of six clips from we thought she would win, totaling one minute and 58 seconds spliced together. So a key love this left wing commentator posted a video, Sargon put some clips together and posted it to his video. So how the story goes is that when a keyla saw this, she filed a takedown notice on YouTube to which Sargon wrote back to her saying, Hey, this falls under fair use and he filed like a counter claim or whatever. Anyway, YouTube put it back up. And so a keyla decided to take him to court. Now this court case, like the whole is a copyright infringement thing. This was settled several months ago in Sargon's favor with the court ruling that no, this is fair use. This is transformative. And the reasoning that was given there says that on February 3rd, 2020, the court concluded that SJW levels of awareness plainly fell within the fair use exception to the copyright act and dismissed Hughes complaints. In particular, the court determined that a reasonable observer who came across Benjamin's video would quickly grasp its critical purpose that Benjamin's target audience, generally political conservatives and libertarians is obviously not the same as Hughes target audience, generally political liberals and that the fair use defense clearly applies based on the face of Hughes complaint and a review of the videos themselves. So one of the things that goes into determining whether something falls under fair use is if it's transformative or if it can be actually used as a replacement for the original work. And with Sargon's video, yeah, he pretty much just edited clips of a kilos with no commentary of his own, but the editing itself was a commentary. And if someone wanted to watch a kilos video, they couldn't just go to Sargon's because they're different, right? It's not a replacement one for the other. So it ended up being ruled in Sargon's in Sargon's favor. But now the new development is that not only did Akila lose her copyright claim, she's also been ruled that she has to pay for Sargon's court fees. So we have here this document that says she's going to need to give him around $40,000 US in court fees, which I think is amazing. And he's Sargon did a video about it. He says he's not sure he's ever going to actually see this money. Yeah. I don't know what kind of. I think my understanding is like, if she doesn't have the money up front, she'll pay them like 50 bucks a week for the rest of her life sort of thing. Yeah. Whatever a month. I didn't even know what it would be. But it's more of a principle thing, first of all, these are important lawsuits for people in the YouTube sphere or just any type of creator. Yeah, any type of creator. There's been a few of them that have existed. I think this is the third kind of major one. It's been up there. I mean, I have to give H3H3 credit. They went through hell. And obviously a lot of credit here to Sargon because you have to, well, I mean, he probably was on expecting when he set out this, set out on this to get that 40,000 American dollars back. Right. You have to, you have to spend a lot of time and a lot of energy and a lot of money to fight these cases, which is almost on behalf of the community of creators. So we definitely owe him a big thanks. I think so too. And what's so frustrating is that a lot of time with these court cases, when this all happened initially, even some people who were on Sargon side and believed he had done nothing wrong, we're saying it might just make more sense financially to settle. Right. I mean, we've seen they take literally years and tens of thousands of dollars, but I think this was a principle thing. And thankfully, Sargon has fans who helped, you know, crowd fund some of these legal fees. But I mean, Akila now still has to pay it all back. And actually in terms of being granted legal fee repayment, like Sargon has been, that's not something that happens very often within the US court system because they don't want to, I guess, discourage people from filing legitimate claims over the worry that they're going to be screwed with all these legal fees. But I really liked the reasoning that they gave for Akila having to repay Sargon. The judge in question pretty much said that you were doing this for malicious motivations. Therefore, you should have to pay. We have this clip here. It says improper or bad faith motivations are generally difficult to discern as litigants often have a variety of objectives and may obscure their base or ones behind a veil of legitimate sounding claims. In this case, however, Hughes openly discussed her improper motivations on both Twitter and her website. I.E. it was clear that she had malicious intent because she was talking crap about him the whole time. It says indeed, Hughes admitted to potentially hundreds of thousands of followers that she intended to one bankrupt Benjamin to stymie his attempts to crowd fund his legal costs. I'm pretty sure she claims to have been responsible for getting him booted off Patreon. And also she tried, I think, to shut down his go fund me for his legal fees. Terrible person three use copyright laws to silence her political opponents and critics other posts, including her public boasting about the legal dispute on her social media accounts, even describing her complaint as a Christmas present for Benjamin and her public belittlement and celebrity style feuding with Benjamin strongly suggests that Hughes intended to sensationalize litigation to elevate her own public profile and achieve a secondary financial gain together. Then Hughes public comments reveal an intent to abuse the legal system in order to further a personal agenda that had little to do with the copyright act. Yeah, now I believe that this kind of thing is not like that rare when you're doing these kinds of things to people. I don't think I think a lot of the times if you're suing somebody like this, you might have that motivation of like, I'm going to I'm going to drown this person. No, but I mean, oftentimes you hear people say I can't comment because it's being settled in the States. Yeah, exactly. Well, that's the thing. She's upfront said it. There are videos of this girl just like literally like huge smog smile on her face. I don't care that he has children. She literally said that. It's like you are beyond shooting yourself in the foot. Right. So, I don't share the money to pay this off. I think Carl Benjamin said the same thing. So it's mind bogglingly stupid to go out and just say it like that. Even the court system, how bad it is in the UK. They were at least, I know this was in the US. This was in the US? Okay, forgive me. But still, it's still usually not a guarantee you're going to get justice. In this case, though, I think you made it so easy. It was on the internet. Everybody can see it. The judge sounds like he was a proper man in this case. He was just a beast. Actually, we were going to be getting to the judge in question in just a couple minutes. But first, I wanted to show you this Twitter tirade that Akila went on when this whole payback legal fees story went viral. And she really is just even with this. She just can't stop running her mouth and making things worse for herself. She says, hey, if you follow me on Twitter, you may notice that I'm being harassed by a bunch of white men today. That's because I sued white supremacists for stealing my content on YouTube in 2016. This is like defamatory, right? I'm pretty sure he could sue her just for this alone. Like she's still calling him a white supremacist. It's like, have you not learned your lesson at this point? She says, keep in mind the express purpose of this white supremacist was to arouse his hoarder for Chan white supremacists into harassing me. You're just saying this. Like you could actually be taken to court. I'm pretty sure for saying stuff like this because it's you're assigning intent. You're making declarative statements about someone, their identity and their intent. And it's just like, please stop. She says, for the past four years, this person has made racist and sexist harassing content about me, Trey Melvin, Cat Black, Francesca Ramsey, and more for the purpose of getting his followers to harass us. He was banned from VidCon when they forged badges and yelled over us on panels. I don't, that's, I'm pretty sure not true either. Then Carl Benjamin ran for office in England and was so repugnant. He said his female opponent was too ugly for him to rape. He didn't say that. So she goes into how she thinks her initial lawyer made a mistake with the filing, making it more about harassment than copyright and how the judge throughout the case, she says, this happened in February, then in March, the very same white supremacist decided to countersue for illegal fees because I responded to one of these little boys harassing me, calling him a racist. He claimed my case was there for never about copyright infringement. That's not at all what the judge said either. Right? It's not just about this one claim you made against the person. And she said, so today I found out that because I responded to a racist on Twitter, I am expected to pay this man who is incredibly racist and terrible, $38,000 because I responded to racism directed at me. And she brings up how she tried to contact YouTube about this. And she of course asked them, she says, all of this to say, I've tried to spare this drama on the timeline. No, you haven't. The court document went into how you have it. If you had, this wouldn't be a problem. She says, but this is what the black people you like online have to deal with. You brought this on yourself. Every single part of this was from your doing zero personal response. Yeah, zero self awareness. And that's, yeah, it sickens me. Honestly, even better. She says, and I think at YouTube, it should also have to answer for their role in this because their policy is that you must sue to keep someone's work down. It's like, yeah, because you have no, no claim over it. You can't just remove videos that you don't like. Like Chica, you're not the only person on YouTube to have a response video made about you. It's like, you can't just take down videos you don't like. And I mean, pretty much she says, also, if anyone here has a contact at GoFundMe where he raised 120 for 120,000 for his lawsuit and PayPal where he continues to make money, my lawyer would appreciate it. So she's trying to go after his finances still. Yeah, but also those companies, right? She's putting pressure on YouTube. Go fund me PayPal. All these companies. She's tagging all these companies. They're supporting racism inadvertently or something like that. It's a premise, everything. It's a disgusting grifting. She's being a leech. I don't know what to say. She's getting what's coming to her and I love it. Frankly, I would like to see her get taken to court for the Famitori. Defamation, rather. I'm pretty sure that Sargan is not the last person she's going to try this with. So I look forward to seeing what's the next person. He tries to do and to quote Sargan, you get what you have been deserved, right? I don't know sympathy. You started this every step of the way you've made things worse for yourself. It doesn't look like you have any intention of learning from your actions. So yeah, this, I don't know, this is your bed line it or however that statement goes. Next up though, we're going to be talking about the trans lobby because, you know, for such a small number of people, very vocal, very, I don't know, they've got a lot of emotions that they need to sort through publicly.

And I really love when we have sponsors that actually help our audience and with score master. That is absolutely the case. All right. So we have this news from Scotland and Lush. I feel like Scotland, unless we did this show, I would have no idea how progressive they are. Like because they really are like, yeah, I mean, part of me isn't surprised because it's the UK. Yeah, I guess. But yeah, you don't think of it like a, you just wouldn't think of Scottish Scott. Like they, you just didn't really care about these things. Yeah. Because they have other problems like are they, don't they have like a lot of violence? And then we're on stuff like that. Yeah, I guess there's some of that. But to me, just Scottish man, just someone who doesn't care. Yeah. They just don't care about that stuff. They're just whatever, you know, apparently at least some of them do though. So we have this article from Pink News. One of my favorite sources of news going on in the LGBT world says Lush warns bigots in no uncertain terms. Don't enter with signs of transphobia after store targeted with hate. What is this hate? This nebulous hate. This article mentions wait because you're, you're probably not going to believe it when you hear it that they would actually classify this as hate. But it says, Lush Edinburgh hung a sign in its window Monday warning, please do not enter our store with signs of COVID-19 racism, homophobia, sexism or transphobia. The Scottish branch explained on Facebook that the message was installed after its storefront was targeted by a transphobic group. What, what was that targeting reports on social media suggest that Lush's window was stickred with a key prisons single sex message. Such hatred. It's really just, it's bigoted, it's terrible, it's transphobic. I mean, unless you fully support putting penises in women's prisons, then it's like, you're basically Hitler, basically Hitler. Representatives for the company did not immediately respond to a request for clarification. Lush added on Facebook, our store is a space for compassion and respect for all and we will not condone or support acts of hate. If you are showing signs of COVID, please follow government guidelines to isolate and get tested. If you are showing signs of any racism, homophobia, sexism or transphobia, we recommend you isolate and educate yourself. So it's not just that Lush is standing up to transphobia, it's what they are deeming transphobia that I find so strange. And it's like, you're a store, you make bath bombs. Why? I don't care what you think about trans people. It's crazy. And I love the gala they always have to say, like educate yourself. Yeah. As if they control like, like what education, I mean, they do. They do. But that's the double, like it's the double down. It's like educate yourself with our, yeah, with our like completely compromised source of knowledge. It's, it's, it's disgusting. It's just stuffy. Yeah. It's so dystopian. I can barely wrap my head around it, but at least for the time being, most people, most people see it for what it is. Yeah. Because you see that sign, you'll say, Oh, the transphobia, that's, that's kind of gross. I don't really like that. And then it's like, Oh, well, they said, keep prison single sex. Yeah. And you know, you kind of wake up for a second. You're like, Oh, yeah, back to reality. Yeah. People are wild. And they think that pretty much 80% of the population would be transphobic because not many people are in favor of putting trans people in women. And like I will admit that the whole thing with prisons and trans people, that's hard. I don't have all the answers to all of these problems that come with trying to integrate trans people fully into society with their preferred genders. But I'm pretty sure saying keep prison single sex, not really a sign of hate. The article continues to say Lush's latest act follows a similar intervention by rival the body shop, which was applauded in June when it confronted JK Rowling on Twitter over her view on trans people. After the author criticized trans inclusive language around periods in a series of tweets for shadowing her now infamous turf wars essay, the body shop offered to center a vegan bath bomb and a copy of trans rights by Paisley Cura to read in the bath. Keep in mind what the body shop was mad at JK Rowling for, which is such a strange sentence. But she JK Rowling took issue with the phrase, I think an article mentioned people with periods or something like that or people with services, which I agree kind of sounds demeaning. It almost sounds like something that like a make tower in cell number would say just like, Oh yeah, the menstruators. Yeah. The bleaters, the uterus havers. It's like, yeah, you can call us women, but this kind of follows a trends where this whole quest to completely remove the importance of sex and sex differences to focus solely on gender identity. We recently saw that dictionary.com joined in the war against TERFs. Yeah, the dictionary.com. They have now firmly placed themselves on the side of the, what are the like the trans inclusive feminists, the non TERFs? I don't know. They put out a post on social media saying, beware the turf. Just be aware the turf. And so for the actual definition, they said turf is an acronym for trans exclusionary radical feminism or trans exclusionary radical feminists. No issue with that definition in particular, but what people were kind of confused by seeing as their dictionary is the very biased root of the word that they chose to provide. It says turf is used to describe cisgender women who self identify as feminists, but who are opposed to including transgender women in spaces they reserved for people who were assigned female at birth. Okay, this is where it gets good. This is because they believe trans women are men. And since men cannot coexist with their feminist ideologies, they exclude them from their beliefs and support. That is not what a trans, a turf trans exclusionary radical feminists would say at all. No, not at all. So this is just a very, very one sided explanation of the whole issue. And they continue saying, in fact, they often believe they should be denied rights and sometimes advocate for harm against trans people. Very unbiased. Very unbiased dictionary. Thank you dictionary.com. It says, but well known feminists who have been labeled turf on the internet have come out to call the term a slur because it's associated with violence and hatred. And what my favorite part of this is that they have, you know, examples of the word. So this is the example phrase they use for turf. If as a slur, people say, as if to completely spackle over the fact that excluding and neglecting the existence of a whole group of people is actually bad, but calling it out, they say, is just as bad or maybe even worse, spoiler, it ain't. What? What a, what a great example of just academic neutrality, you know, just trying to be a bit crazy. Because you know that if people are defining words, people will look up. I know. That's the scariest thing. Right? This is an infected, another infected institution. I, you know, hold on to your old dictionaries, people. You know, the paperbacks keep them, keep the old encyclopedias. Yeah, until they start burning them. But those are going to be, yeah, those are going to be valuable because that's where real knowledge is they're going to start, they're going to start changing the definition of women. You know, they probably already have, or they're getting there very shortly. Yeah. Men, there's going to be nothing in there that has any sort of relevance to the real world. They've already tried with racism to actually get the dictionary to change racism to their view of racism, which is power plus prejudice. Yeah. Right. So, and you know, people are going to say, well, words change all the time. It's like, yes, that's true. But what makes this effort by academics and the dictionary different from how language has evolved over time is that usually it's an organic transformation, right? People just start using it, like the term selfie. No one said this is what a selfie is. You all must use this term. Now, we just kind of spread throughout the vernacular through natural means and conversations. That's different than what's happening here, where we have this small group of people who are dictating, this is what the word will mean, even though that is not how the majority of people use the word. So it's a very different concept. And I mean, it's scary how much influence these people have over society considering they're really not the majority. And that's, I mean, I kind of blame all of us for letting this happen. This is a small group of people. Why do they have so much control? And it's like, I understand why in the beauty industry, including places like Lush in the body shop, it's so widespread. It's because, you know, they cater to women and women are way more likely to be progressive. But it's like, all right, you're probably just trying to appeal to your target demographic. But it's like the dictionary. Come on. Come on, dictionary. Not cool. HR departments, they're the death of you. That's all I'll say. Yeah. And you know what? I mean, I think it's a very different way to do women. Like huge majority women, same with psychology. Yes. Another very left wing field. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's good. It's in every institution at this point. We kind of just have to hold on and hope this whole thing shakes out well. And I think honestly, there is a lot of pushback right now. Just like you're seeing a lot more people in the academic realm, at least aware of this. Yeah. But they're not actively speaking out and the political power is definitely, I think, on the side of the progressive left that are pushing this stuff. But I suspect in the end, I just can't see this going the whole 1984 route. But it's all kind of feel like we're already there. We're getting, well, we're definitely trying in that direction. Yeah. I think that the, I don't know, my intuition is that it's going to go awry first. I would hope so because I just, I can't take it anymore. I can't continue with these people who act like they are the sole arbiters of truth who are objectively insane. But our next story actually continues in this same vein of trans issues, the matrix, right? Classic trilogy. People say it's one of Cana Reeves' best roles out there because it's like his whole kind of blank no emotion thing actually plays into. Yeah. Plays into Neo. But wait, how is this a trans issue, Lauren? Well, I'm glad you asked. A lot of people would say it's not what are you talking about. But the Wachowski, I think that's how you pronounce it, the Wachowski siblings. Yeah. Who used to be the Wachowski brothers, but now have both transitioned to being female. So now to the Wachowski siblings who kind of, I think they wrote and directed the series. They have a lot of other credits as well. So they have come out now and said that the matrix was actually intended to be a trans allegory. Now, I haven't seen the matrix in a while, but I feel like that's not the impression I got from the movies. Like, I don't know. I actually quite like the matrix. Which is saying something he hates all movies. No, no, I say like pre 2005 movies were a lot better. I think like somewhere in that range, it was something happened and all movies now are trash like all manner trash coming along. All movies are trash since 2005. But no, I like them. And to the point that I don't rewatch them like I rewatch Lord of the Rings. Like one of the rings I'll rewatch every few years probably the matrix probably every half decade I'll maybe watch them. But I enjoy them. There's like some pop philosophy in there. But I think they're great movies, frankly, particularly the first. Yeah. So you support the idea of the trans allegory is what you're saying. That's where I'm like, what like, how do you get that? I don't know. This feels like to me, like the JK Rowling stuff, the authorial intent is drastically changing. Yeah. And it's not just authorial intent. It's authorial intent mixed with revisionism. Yes. This isn't something that they were saying like as it came out and it's one of the interpretations that's always been out there. Cause I mean, well here we have this gizmodo article that talks about it. They say it says the matrix is regularly lauded as one of the most inventive and influential sci-fi films of all time. It put Lana and Lily Wachowski on the map as filmmakers and remains so popular today. A fourth film is currently in the works, but it's actually so much more at its core. The matrix is also the story of a person who realizes they're trapped in a place where they can't be themselves escapes and is reborn in a new world as their true self. I would disagree with that. Like I don't think the message is you're trapped in a place where you can't be yourself. I would say you're trapped in an artificial world. I saw it more similar to the allegory of the cave. Yeah. Right. You're in this false world and need to be awoken. Right. And like we're being woke comes from the red pill, blue pill thing. You need to be awakened to this true state of the world. And then once you are, you can actually control or better manipulate the artificial state. It's almost like the pro matrix now. Yeah. Like they're pro like the program. You can, you have this idealized version of the world where you can be whatever you want to be. And that's kind of sweet. We're not completely detached from reality. Right. Because that's not what the real world is in the matrix. You can only be whatever you want to be in the matrix. But the message is you need to wake up from the matrix. And to be fair, even at that point, I say that's provisionism. Yeah. Because in the matrix, there are poor people. Everybody's the rich guys. You know, it's that. But if you're woke, like if you've taken the red pill, then you can control reality sort of the matrix. Only, only neo can. Yeah. Only neo can actually. So the other people, they still have to abide by the rules of the matrix, which, you know, yeah. I mean, trapped in a place where they can't be themselves, the matrix is not a story of like self-exploratory. Like it's not just be yourself. That's not the message of the matrix. At least that's not what I got from it. But we have a, I think it's a pretty recent interview from one of the Wachowski siblings. They don't know which one this is. But she is very much saying that, nope, it's trans allegory. It's a message about our transness. Transness, transness, transness. We have a clip here. I'm glad that people are talking about the movies, the matrix movies with a trans area. I love that. How meaningful those films are to trans people and the way that they come up to me and say, this, these movies save my life because when you talk about transformation specifically in the world of science fiction, which is just about imagination, it's like, and world building and like the idea of the seemingly impossible becoming possible, I think is like, that's why it speaks to them so much. And I'm grateful that I can be throwing them a rope to help them along their journey. So the seemingly impossible becoming possible and transformation, maybe that's why it's a trans allegory. Yeah, but that's like the connection with that and the matrix is just as strong as the connection to that and sci-fi. Yeah. There's nothing beyond fiction, basically, and the connections to those things of like just imagination and passability and those things. Yeah. Then there is to the matrix, right? The matrix does not have anything more to do with that. Yeah, because in where Neo goes through this huge transformation within the matrix is only made possible by him being aware of the real world. It's not it's it's if you believe in that, I guess, representation of the matrix, then it's almost like you're conceding that the trans identity is made up, in my opinion, right? Because Neo can't do all of these amazing things in the real world. He's just it. So I, I feel like it just really doesn't work with this interpretation. Yeah. I mean, even if you look at it backwards and somehow like you become whatever you want in the real world after you escape the matrix, that seems just also patently I'm trying to like I'm trying to be as terrible. Yeah. So what is what is the matrix in that allegory is the matrix, the idea that gender is a binary and you need to be woken up from that. Yeah. But then again, you saw no trans representation or anything like that in the actual real world, right? Right. It was basically the same version that they were in the matrix before that for the most part, you know? So and I don't know, I just got if I were to say what's the theme, I would say, you know, be aware of technology and things like that, not just transness, but maybe, maybe I'm just not woken up with this new interpretation. And you know what? I'm a sucker. I like, I like the pop psychology. Yeah. I like the whole allegory and the cave sort of deal, you know, of there was some kind of say, did I say pop psychology? Yeah. So sorry, pop philosophy, like there's a little bit of, there's a little bit of thinking there that's kind of interesting when you're talking about what's real and what isn't real. Yeah. Some basic epistemology stuff. That's kind of fun. That's what I liked about the matrix that I thought brought to the table that was new for a sci-fi because outside of that, it's, you know, a half decent action movie. But that's not, yeah, I would never have expected anything about transness in this. Yeah. But I mean, it's kind of like we did that segment about how Taylor Swift fans are reading into her album saying they're actually like coming out stories of her being queer. I feel like for these people, you can read queerness, transness, gayness into anything. Yeah. So maybe like me saying, remember that little piece of art I did when I was six with the son and the dog, that was actually a commentary on heteronormativity. And you know, these people do stuff like that all the time. Yeah. I mean, that's not the only ones I see it all the time with, you know, white nationalists the longest always written. You could read whenever you're watching a piece of media or just anything, if you're looking at the world through that lens, you can, you can find patterns. We're very good at finding patterns in the world. Yeah. Our confirmation biases are very powerful. Yeah. So I mean, and I don't necessarily blame fans for reading whatever they want into it. What I do take issue with is the Wachowski siblings themselves saying like, no, yeah, this was true. But I meant this all the time. Like, no, you didn't. Even more than that, though, I love the vagueness of it. Yeah. This whole thing, there's no real specific references. It's just super vague RC kind of talk that doesn't leave me thinking much about it. Yeah. We had, you know, the, the matrix stuff was all like about the desire for transformation, but it was all coming from a closeted point of view. And so we had the character of Switch, who was like a character who would be, you know, a man in the real world or, and then a woman in the matrix. And, you know, that's both were where our head spaces were. So that didn't actually end up happening in the movie, though. Like there was no trans character. So I mean, this is kind of like, yeah, we were going to have this amazing trans character to represent where our trans is was that we didn't actually end up doing it. But, um, you know, but the door is gay. Yeah, Dumbledore is gay. And he had like hot, fiery sex with, uh, was that bad guy? Griddlewald JK Rowling actually said that. Nice. Yeah. So I mean, yeah, this is just complete revisionism. And there's this debate going on, um, I guess, authorial in 10 versus death of the author. So it's this different schools of thought as to how we should interpret media. Some people say that when there's a piece of work out there that the author's intent should play into how it is interpreted. Other people say that the work should speak for itself, right? That if, if you've put it to paper and you have all of these other, like visions for it or stories, but it's not actually in the work, then that can't contribute to our interpretation of the work. I kind of fall more on the side of death of the author. I think a work should speak for itself. You shouldn't have to read all these side interviews with the author just to really understand it. I feel like if it was meant to be, you should have put it in. It should be complete. Yeah, it should be complete. Um, this is like, in my opinion, a completely diff, it's outside of it though, right? Because it's like, not only is this going further than authorial in 10, it's like authorial post intense. Yes. Yeah. So it's the way I feel about it too. It's, this is complete nonsense at this point. This is virtue signaling. And I'll tell you what, I'm not watching the matrix four. It's not happening. Yeah, but Keanu. No. Yeah. I don't care. In fact, I was on the key. I had a high train before everybody. I'll go hipster mode here. Now I'm totally like, this is too mainstream. Too mainstream for me. Sorry. Matrix four is going to suck. I'm saying it right now. Yeah, probably. Well, Jupiter is sending really sucked, which was the, I think the last huge project they worked on. We still have John Wickford though. So I haven't even seen number three yet, I don't think. It's on prime. Anyway, we have one more clip from, I think, Lily, which asks you. We always loved this scene that Ned Beatty would do in this movie network, where he would talk about the way the world was. And it was always from this corporate hierarchical, you know, overlord structure. And so I think in our transness, we are always trying to like, and queerness, like incorporate as many things as possible. It's just like trying to visualize within, you know, a much larger infinite scope of the advantage of the imagination. What does that mean? That means that those are just words. Yeah, that was very performative. In our transness and queerness, we were like, what? Vague, artsy words strung together. I've seen like philosophers do similar things. That was, there was no really attempt there to just do anything but just say buzz words. Yeah, trans. Please agree with me. Imagination. It is the correct opinion. Yeah, like that means nothing. And it's kind of, it's disappointing because I respect a lot of the Wachowski's work, right? They've made great movies. I think they've also made bad movies, but there's this, I think, need they have now to not only make some bad movies, but also almost tarnish previous works. And I think it also illustrates how quickly the tides have turn buried because the matrix isn't that old. It's not that old. I think they came out in the 90s, right? Or maybe even more recent. It might have been at the turn of the millennia. I think it was over that period. Yeah, but we already, so it's not that old. And what Kyle cashew, the parkland kid anyway, he was writing about watching old movies on Twitter and he actually mentioned the matrix. And it's like, you, your Gen Z self can just get out of here. But yeah, they're not old movies, but already they're being revised. And it's like, I feel like the way that we look back upon history that's getting shorter and shorter are willingness to relate to history as it was back then. We're constantly changing what is the new acceptable. But I think that's pretty much all we have to say for now. I probably won't go see the matrix for either depending on where cinemas are at because I mean, nothing, nothing's, nothing's open. Nothing's coming out for a long time. And I don't know if anyone's going to want to go with me because everyone's afraid of coronavirus. I'm afraid of coronavirus, but I'm afraid of the matrix for. Yeah. It's one of those things that I wish it stayed dead. You know, it's like that they just make new movies. Like, sorry, they're going to they're making it a lot of the ring series on Netflix. It's going to be like, you're going to, are you trying to destroy everything in my childhood? That was good. Yes. They are. They're not trying. They're doing. They're doing. Yeah. So that is disappointing, but I mean, that's a running theme in the show. I think that's pretty much all we have to say. And as always, thank you guys so, so much for tuning in and we will see you next time. Take care."
