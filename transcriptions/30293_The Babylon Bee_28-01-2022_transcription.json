I'm here to help guide you into the fulfillment of this new way into the fulfillment of your deepest desire, the desire to remember who you are and be that in the world so you can finally reintroduce yourself. Tune into good mornings with curly, Nicky every morning. It's five minutes to peace. Five minutes to the new you. I love you. Justice Steven Breyer announced that he's retiring. If you forget which justice is Steven Breyer, he's the one that you always forget about. Oscar Meyer introduced a baloney skincare face mask. What a bunch of salami. A school in Michigan allegedly provided a litter box for furries. The janitors are drawing straws to see who has to empty it. Two Irishmen carried a dead guy to the post office to collect his pension. They're calling it weak and dad O'Brien's. We talked to John Coople from Skillet. The world's most popular Christian band named after a piece of book. All this and more on the B. Weekly. Hey everyone. One B podcast is here and me and Adam are here and we don't have a guest host. This week. So today we have this is now awkwardly me and Adam talking to each other. How are you? Good. How was your week? Week was good. Yeah. I went to Utah on Monday. Oh, nice. I visited Angel Studios that gave me a sweet. I love Angel Studios. You drive our comedy and yeah. Have you ever done dry bar? I have. I taped one in May and it should come out sometime in the next couple of months. It's kind of going through the final edits now. I have. I saw all the pictures of the comedians on the walls. Did you sign one of those? Is that going to go? I did. Mine's there somewhere. It's there somewhere. I was like taking pictures of it to see if I could see and want to recognize like you or Kellen. Kellen. Her schemes there. Yeah. We've had a lot of driver. Erica Rhodes. She I don't know. Oh, okay. There you go. Yeah. So. I didn't see anyone I recognize but at least you know that I knew personal. Yeah. But yeah, it was a lot of fun. Cool. A lot of Mormons. Lots of Mormons. We drank a lot of like interesting sodas. Oh. Because that's what they do. They didn't cut you off. They're like you've had too many sodas. I asked I awkwardly asked like do you guys have like coffee here? Is that a thing? And so they did have a coffee machine. So maybe that'll get them in trouble. Yeah. Church of Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. But actually you know that article we wrote about the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints this week. Which is member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Which is there was a shorter way to say member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. We wrote that because I was sitting down with them and they were talking about you guys need to do more Mormon jokes. And I was like, oh, we'll do one right now. And we posted it right then while we were hanging out with them. So they seem to enjoy that. Nice. We had a banger of the week this week. Banger of the week. M&M's introduces new trans character who identifies as a skittle. The good old stand by. Good old identifies. It works every time. It's going to be a sad day when we post and identifies joking at bombs. Yes. But this like was based on a real story where M&M's characters are now becoming more inclusive. Yeah. Which is funny because it's just a very basic character redesign that all companies do with their characters. What have they actually changed? Like when I read it said that they were going to make the green M&M less sexy. And then which I mean, I don't know, I'm still attracted to her. And then they said they were going to make the orange one embrace his anxiety. But he's still like, he's still like anxious. That's what I read in one of the articles. Yeah, like it's going to be like a, I don't know, the face, the face of people with anxiety. They said, I think they said with the brown one that we're going to reduce or heal height to a more professional level. That's what I was thinking. I don't know if it's sexist or not. Like if a woman was in the office and you were like, that's my professional change those heels. But this is just wonderful. Everything about this is hilarious. But the article is great and the sketch turned out really well to. Oh, yeah. We actually filmed the commercial of the trans skittle. You want to watch that? Let's go to it. Ever since I was mass produced in a factory, people have been trying to put labels on me. Nutrition labels, expiration dates, telling me I was biologically chocolate on the inside. But deep down, I knew I wasn't who they said I was. I was. I am. A skittle. The people at Mars Inc, they weren't bad people. They were just ignorant. They thought they knew what candy I was just because they knew my exact chemical composition. But we are not our biology. We're holding ourselves accountable for the way in which accurate product descriptions caused hurt and pain to the trans candy community. I just woke up one day and realized I am not defined by the chocolate center I was made with. I am and always was a delicious, great skittle. And I'm proud of it. So Mars has committed to never again assigning an identity to the candy we produce. Instead, we'll let each candy decide for himself or herself or skittle self who they really are. And whatever the candy says, we will force to find nutrition information to make it a reality. Now reality can truly be whatever we want. And just free. Free at last to be me. The real me. We're even offering every peanut M&M a total not removal free of charge because they're free to be themselves nuts or no nuts. Having completed my transition to living as a great skittle, I've been so grateful for the acceptance I found here at Mars Inc. Thanks for accepting a skittle. Like me. Every bit is funny. Right. They shot that so well. I love the operation. Did you like it? Do you wince a little bit when you watch that part? They make you uncomfortable. It's like just a very slow motion like not getting cracked. I don't know. No, I'm just thinking about that green M&M. And we also have the bomb of the week. We should all agree that parents have a fundamental right to direct the upbringing of their children. But this right is under increasing attacks from public school indoctrination. Many schools have enacted policies that allow minor students to change their name and pronouns at school without parental consent. Our friends at Alliance Defending Freedom are challenging this indoctrination and threat to parental rights, but they can't do it alone. They need your help. Preserving parental rights protects the future of our children. And that is why it is vital that you join us in supporting ADF. Just go to ADFlegal.org slash Babylon B and make a tax deductible donation to ADF's Freedom Fund to ensure they have the resources necessary to continue the challenges in court. All the way to the US Supreme Court if necessary. We've seen what happens when Americans stick together. We can make a difference and with your gift to ADF we can help protect parental rights. Join us. Please go to ADFlegal.org slash Babylon B and make your donation today. That's ADFlegal.org slash Babylon B. Bond of the Week. Wiggers burn warriors jerseys in protest, but unfortunately have to start making new ones afterward. I think it's pretty good. See, I like that one a lot. I think it's one of those where it may be the wording is a little time. But when you get what it's saying, I think it's a it's a good pitch. Yeah. So billionaire investor and part owner of the Golden State Warriors and I'm going to butcher his name. Chamath, Paula, Patea said that he doesn't care what's happening with the Uighurs and that nobody else really cares. Did you watch the clip? It's crazy. He's just like arguing with him on a podcast because nobody cares about them. I was wondering if he was just trying to say like people should care, but don't. No, if you because that's what I was confused when I read the headline, but if you actually watched the clip. He's saying like people just don't care that his argument then that he goes on to is that people should care more about like problems here. Then then before we sort of worry about issues in China and that and the like, but it came across very heartless. He said every time I say that I care about the Uighurs, I'm really just lying if I don't really care. So I'd rather not lie to you and tell you the truth. It's not a priority for me. Not backing down at least. Yes. I do like, you know. So it sucks that I disagree with him. It's like he's he's the one who's not apologizing. Like whatever we say, like, oh, don't apologize against the one who's like, I'm going to take a stand on not caring about the Uighurs dying. You just wish it was something a little that you were approved of. Yeah, taking a stand on a little. Exactly. All right. Let's do some weekly news with Adam Yenser. It's time for the weekly news with Adam Yenser. This week we lost another comedy legend, Louis Anderson died at the age of 68, far out living his life expectancy of every time I've seen a picture of him. And on Thursday at a Dallas hospital, Meatloaf passed away. His remains were sent home in a doggy bag. Louis Anderson and Meatloaf are now both in heaven, which is starting to sag under their combined weight. Russia has been moving more troops to the Ukrainian border in preparation for a possible invasion. Soviet Russia will then rename Ukraine, Crane you. Every time you get mad at when I pitch in the slack, I'm going to do it here. Speaker of the house, Nancy Pelosi announced that she will run for reelection again this year. Although she's expected to face a tough challenge from her opponent, Father Time. Grim Reaper, yeah. Due to government censorship issues, a Chinese streaming service altered the ending to the film Fight Club without getting the studios permission. In response, the US has sent them copies of the Star Wars sequels. Valuable service they could provide. Yes, they're eager to see how they change them. Your communist ending is still better than what the studios did. A school in Michigan is denying rumors that they place giant litter boxes in the bathrooms for students who identify as furries. They've also discouraged the students from coming to school as furries by shaking a can of pennies and spraying them with a water bottle. I need to stop taking a drink before each of these. They're not that funny. The Supreme Court announced that they will reconsider whether race-based affirmative action can be used in college admissions. And in lieu of Justice Breyer's retirement, Joe Biden has announced that he will use race-based affirmative action to fill the Supreme Court. 19-year-old Zara Rutherford became the youngest woman to fly solo around the world. Here's Joe Biden congratulating her. Be him sniffing a woman. I like the ones you have to discredit. Yeah. I hope I can find a picture of that somewhere on the internet. Just in time for the Olympics, China has brought back its anal swab COVID test. Can I make a joke about how the male figure skaters will enjoy this? Oh, is this the joke you asked me? You just did, so I guess so. I have no other punchline. Peter Dinklage called out Disney for trying to make their new Snow White movie woke by casting a Latina actress, but still including stereotypical dwarf characters. In other words, he's being grumpy. I just found out that his name is Peter Dinklage because that sounds like a mean name you'd make up to insult a little person. Like, they hear comes Peter Dinklage. What's the matter, Mulp Dinklage? I don't call him that. That's messed up. What's his real name? It's like Willie Dini pickles or something. It's always weird that, like, I know you're not supposed to call them midgets, but that sounds like a more legitimate term. Like, little person sounds more insulting than you. Oh, look, it's a little person! Two men in Ireland propped up a dead man's body between them and took him to a post office to try to collect his pension money. It's the same way Kamala Harris and Nancy Pelosi are trying to run America. Oscar Meyer introduced a baloney skincare mask, which quickly sold out on Amazon. In other news, Chris Christie's skin has been looking fabulously lately. Strip clubs in Washington, D.C. are being warned that their employees, including nude strippers, have to wear face masks. In fact, Matt Gaetz and Hunter Biden have kindly volunteered to go to the strip clubs and warn the strippers in person. Nice guys. SNL stars Colin Jost and Pete Davidson purchased a Staten Island fairy boat that they plan to turn into a comedy club, which will mark Pete Davidson's first foray into comedy. Good luck with that. The Wote purchase also explains why Pete Davidson has recently been seen with two enormous new flotation devices. I don't get that one. Let's see the picture. 76-year-old WWE founder Vince McMahon revealed that he still gets up to work out every morning at 3 a.m. A full 30 minutes earlier than most people his age get up to go for breakfast. And also keep in mind those WWE workouts are completely fake. A man in Minnesota was arrested for killing his roommates emotional support ferrets because their cage smelled bad. He's now in a cage that smells like his cellmate T-bone. That's it for the news. Not a single Catholic joke this week. Alright, well it's been a while since we've done this. We're going to do real things. Blue checks say the craziest things that people have said on the internet this week. Lots of people want to understand the Bible better. A great place to start is the enduring word Bible commentary. For more than 25 years it has helped millions to understand and apply the Bible. It's clear and simple enough for everyday Christians and yet tens of thousands of pastors and teachers also use it. Find the enduring word Bible commentary by David Guzik at enduring word.com. And it's completely free. No costs, no registration, no paid ads that you have to wait for. Find all this and more at enduring word.com. That's enduring word.com. Real things that Blue checks say. The first one's from Robert Reich, which sounds like a Nazi name, but what is he? Who did he serve under? Clinton? I don't know. Tonight Republican senators lined up to shake Christian cinema's hand. Democratic senators should have given her the backs of their heads. I love just Democrats like these women that don't fall online. We should slap them. And they always criticize Republicans. If you mention the word target, they'll be like, oh, they're talking about shooting people. They're always trying to interpret everything as violently as possible. They should give women the back of their heads. He tried to issue a clarification. This is a common phrase meaning turn them away. Just slap a woman in the face. It's a common phrase that means to hit somebody. This one is from Cheryl Hines, Larry David's wife. Larry David's wife on the show. I assume someone wrote that as a joke. Cheryl Hines, my husband's reference to Anne Frank at a mandate rally in DC was reprehensible and insensitive. The atrocities that millions endured during the Holocaust should never be compared to anyone or anything. His opinions are not a reflection of my own. Don't don't don't don't don't. Where have we gotten to as a society in this whole cancel culture thing where you like to disavow your spouse. Yeah. Were you like afraid that you're going to get canceled because something your spouse said? I wonder if they had a conversation about this beforehand or if he found out that she was disavowing her husband's RFKG. Where are you? RFKG. So this Democratic state representative thought he would own the right by making men stay with their baby mamas. But the Republicans actually liked this idea. So Forrest said this week I filed HB 3129 which codifies that a father's financial responsibility to his baby and their mom begins a conception. Okay, we're on board. So far it sounds great. If Oklahoma is going to restrict a woman's right to choose we better make sure the man involved can't just walk away from his responsibility. Yep, another great idea. What is the meme Dan that we always do with this one? Your terms are acceptable. This is like when that Texas bill passed and then they were like who was it? Some big like leftist celebrity was like women should start like remaining abstinent. Yeah, I think it was a monodid the abstinent strike. That's wonderful. Yeah, this one is from the gospel coalition. Do you know who the gospel coalition is? You're a Lutheran so probably go on. I don't know if that was an insult or not. Not really. I just don't see how the ministry of the church is strengthened by showcasing bad examples of preaching on social media. This one is kind of interesting in that like they're talking about like these accounts like woke preacher clips or will make fun of bad woke preaching or like the thing. Like the segment we do here right now. We made fun of these like bizarre sermon things and we just thought it was kind of funny that this account is going like we shouldn't point out really bad preaching in church. Just sweep it under the rug. Let's hide it. We give those preachers the back of our hands. Kathy Griffin wants a woman of color to be on the Supreme Court because that means she will have all the correct opinions. Here's what she said. Supreme Court Justice Steven Breyer just announces retirement. Can we please get a female WOC who is the same age as Amy Coney Barrett? Thanks. And then Hector Ossegera Esquire says Joe Biden should replace Steven Breyer with four Justices. They're still pushing that core packaging. I like that Kathy Griffin is still trying to like get involved in policies. It hasn't gone well. Brian Stelter has different standards for presidential decency depending on who is president. Brian Stelter this is from 2018. It's still true. Biden was wrong to call Ducey in SOB. The press is right to hold presidents to high standards. Biden doesn't berate the media like Trump. So the context for today is different, but it's still out of line. And then in 2018 Brian Stelter said it was wrong when Trump was just a candidate. It's even worse now that he's president. Yeah, Brian Stelter shared a post from 2018 when where he criticized Trump for calling a journalist an SOB. And then he reshared and he says this is still true. Biden was wrong. Trump was wrong. So he's kind of trying to sound consistent. But then he says, but Biden doesn't quite berate the media like Trump did. So the context is quite different. Good old potato. USA Today wants us to understand pedophiles better. They tweeted, we think we know what a pedophile is. There's a lot that we're misunderstanding. I don't think there's a lot to misunderstand. And then the headlines is what the public keeps getting wrong about pedophilia. This is from Jean Wu. This is about meatloaf dying. We mourn Mr. Lofe's passing in the end. He finally let us know what that one thing was that he wouldn't do for love. Get vaccinated. Now I was annoyed with this one because that's not even the best wording of this joke. It's supposed to say. I would do anything for love, but I won't get vexed. Instead he did this clunky. He finally asked, no, what that one thing was that he wouldn't do for love. Get vaccinated. Yeah. Yeah. The joke's real screwed up there. This is the same guy who was taking a picture of his salad when the Texas Democrats went on strike and flew to Washington and he's like, I am a day one of me being a fugitive. This is my meal. I need to get the picture of the salad. Everybody was mocking it. What does DCC see, the Democratic Coalition for something? So this is the Democrats. Republicans have no business interfering in your private medical decisions. Period, but probably not for vaccinations. I mean, I guess that doesn't apply there. This is from Steakum. Steakum's food again. Be fun to others as you would have them be fun to hear. I mean, I like that one. Have you followed the Steakum, like, all the philosophical things that they tweet? No, I barely know how to read these tweets. I'm looking. I'll never go on to it. I don't like Twitter. I don't use it much. It's kind of the worst. So Steakum has this history of tweeting very strange things that are deeply philosophical. So here's one. You can maintain independent critical thinking toward institutions without dipping into fringe conspiracies. They get jump-started by individual anecdotes being virally spread as data. It's not easy, but it's necessary to keep any semblance of responsible online information. Like the Steakum account. That's amazing. It just, like, tweets all this bizarre stuff. But I like that one didn't have any beef puns in it. Yeah, I don't know why. Yeah, that's kind of a weak one from Steakum. Yeah. Very sad. And then this last one is one that I saw and I can't believe this wasn't like... This clip, my jaw dropped when I was watching it. It was Trey Gaudy on Fox News earlier this week. Talking about why he doesn't believe in math. I haven't seen this song very exciting. Yeah. Let's check it out. Question from the LV and Texas who writes, how did you graduate from college without taking a math class? LV with lots of hard work and ingenuity, that's how. I've never been good at math. I took trigonometry in high school and made a gentleman's D. I never understood why I should multiply or divide fractions. Why don't we just wait until those fractions grow up and become whole numbers? I sort of gave up on math when someone told me three times zero is zero. I've never understood that. I have three of something. I'm not doing anything to it except multiplying it by nothing. So how does that three, all of a sudden, disappear? How does that come up? It can't disappear. This is math. Oh my god. In the class, no one could ever tell me that three. When I actually took this one math class in high school and the teacher put letters like X and Y in the math equation. And letters and numbers should never ever be mixed. So I petitioned that Hain to Baylor and after talking with me for a little while, he actually agreed. I probably could not pass a math class. So he made me an offer. I had to take two logic classes in the philosophy department and loo of basic entry level math. So all five went to the philosophy department, took my two logic courses, had the time of my life, and left even more convinced than ever that three times zero cannot possibly be zero. If you have a question you'd like to share, please send us a video or message online. I have questions. I'll email us at gallbiamerica at fox.com. It's crazy because I think he's trying to be funny at the beginning when he was talking about trigonometry. He's trying to make it kind of funny. But I think he's genuinely convinced that three times zero can't be zero. I like that they had a stock image prepped for that too. Just to show the conclusion. And that all of his producers went along with this. You should say this on national television. Everyone will be on your side that three times zero can't possibly be zero. I want footage of him in his math classes at high school, in high school and elementary school now. Yeah. The teacher's like three times zero is zero. He's like, where does it go? And also, where does it go? I know it's not math, but it's weird that he took a logic class and still it convinced him more that three times. You think that would have explained it. It makes sense to me. Does it make sense to you? Yeah, because he's... It's no time. His example in the mathematical sense is one times three because he's saying if you have three of something. That's one times three. The premise is that he already has... His premise is wrong. He's saying... But either way it works. If you say you have zero times three or something, you have zero. You still have three. Or if you have three nothing, it's still nothing. But he can't wrap his head around that. Yeah, it struck me like they were trying to do so much so that he wouldn't take math and argued with the dean to get out of it. It definitely struck me like they were trying to be funny in this segment. Yeah, but it kind of like came through the... He obviously... That's something... I think he's trying to be funny about it, but he's clearly convinced that that's a real thought. This is like a new Fox strategy. Didn't they do that thing about the show you? Yeah, but I hated that thing. But it was like obviously a bit. Yes. But it's not obvious. 100%. Like people thought it wasn't a bit. Yeah, some people thought it was either real. Yeah, some people thought like they really like were arguing over the show you, but I don't know. I didn't find that one very fun. This one I find. Yeah, funny, but not... I don't find his jokes funny. I find it funny that he doesn't believe three times here equals zero. I think it's like a new Fox strategy to get these little clips to go viral and get people to share them and step. We'll help him out. We'll help him out, I guess. Yeah. Well, that's wonderful. That was the best thing that Blue Check said this week. Let's check out. We have a new sketch this week. Yeah, here's something else that should go viral. Hate Me Date Me featuring Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Yeah. Let's check it out. Welcome to Hate Me Date Me. The show where three contestants have the chance to win a dream date with everyone's favorite bartending Congresswoman, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Whether they want to date her or not. AOC, what would you like to ask your first suitor? Bachelor number one, where would you take me on our first date? I'm not a bachelor. I'm a Republican senator and I don't want to date you. I'm married. But I do have some serious issues with economic policy. So, I would probably take you to the nearest econ 101 class and teach you a few things about economics. You want to take me back to school? Settle down, Senator. Come on out a bit too strong. You like me so much? I'm sure you. I do not. Honestly, not even sure why I am here. I thought this was going to be a debate. You want to kiss me so bad? Bachelor number two, if I were a sandwich, what kind of toppings would you put on me? If your socialist policy is passed, we wouldn't even have bread to make sandwiches. As the editor for the conservative national American blog, I disagree with almost everything you've ever said. You're an idiot. You didn't know what a garbage disposal was. You're a Marxist. My family actually came from a socialist dictatorship. I'd love to have you sit down and hear from my father what it was like to go up. Wow, you already want me to meet your parents? Bachelor number two, I'm blushing. Maybe you can meet me up when I am Puerto Rico. I have a house that doesn't fall down on our purse. That's not what I'm saying. Yes it is. You're saying you have a crush on me and you want to have a million of my babies. Bachelor number three, what's your favorite thing about me? Hi, Alexandria. Or AOC. I honestly don't know what to call you. But I'm just super nervous. So I really love your hair. And the way your eyes just get really wide whenever you talk. I mean, it's so hard to pick one thing. Your smile is so beautiful too. Ew, stop calling me you creep. I don't need you degrading me with your toxic masculinity. Pervert? No, no, no, I'm so sorry. I just think you're like really pretty and smart and I really like you. Stop sexually harassing me. I'm not an object. Okay, we are almost out of time. So let's get to our bachelorette's final question. Bachelor number two, so why do you want to date me so badly? I definitely do not want to date you. Right, that's why you troll me on Twitter and write three-page articles debunking every statement I make. You're totally in love with me. You can't believe how hot I am. Bachelor number one, why do you want to date me so badly? I told you, I am a married Republican senator. I don't want to date any other woman besides my wife, my mistress, and my side piece. Well, you can't date me no matter how bad you want to. Because I already have a boyfriend and he's super handsome and has weird feet. If you already have a boyfriend, why are any of us here? What is this show? Why are you hiding her as a select? We already know who she is. None of this makes sense since... Alright, that's enough out of you, Bachelor number one. Bachelor number three, why do you want to date me? Because I'm single and I like you a lot. Even though you have a boyfriend, I think if you just gave me a chance, you actually find that we have a lot in common and I would treat you like the queen that you are. Ah, hashtag me too. You're making me really uncomfortable. I'm scared for my life right now. Like during the deadly fatal insurrection terrorist attack. That sound means it's time for our bachelorette to make her final decision. Alexandria, which lucky fellow will get to go on a date with you? Well, Bachelor two is clearly crazy about me. Clearly not. Which is why I think Bachelor number one is a much better choice. Even though he's a little too into me. I am not interested. Yeah, right. Alexandria, as host, I think he might be telling the truth. You may be wrong about what these men think of you. Ooh, you think I'm wrong? Now you totally want to date me. I knew you couldn't host this show without falling for me. You all want me. That's it for this week's episode of Hate Me Date Me. But tune in next week when AOC has to give Rose to Alex Jones, Tucker Carlson, or Ben Shapiro. Thank goodness that's over. I'm late for dinner with my side piece. Oh, that AOC. So stupid. Oh my gosh. Always thinking people who hate her love her. She's so hot. Stupid. Christian band Skillet has a new album out called Dominion. And we got John Cooper back on the podcast for the second time to talk about it. Do you like Skillet or are you huge Skillet? I heard about Skillet a few weeks before this interview when I was googling Christian lyrics. But he was awesome to talk to. He's a really cool guy. It was funny. It was engaging. I think I would like their music because he said they've toured with corn, I think, if you're a fan of it. Yeah, it's like that kind of music. I like it. Alright, here we go. Let's talk to John Cooper, the artist from Skillet, who's music Adam might like. Yes. If you ever listen to it. Ringing endorsement. And now for another interview on the Be Weekly. Not a rock and roll singer. I didn't commit. Sorry. I didn't commit. I could do it if I only tried John. You could, honestly. You could be anything you want to be. So is this dominionism? Is this about dominion theology? Is that what you're promoting here? You know what? I only actually heard of dominionism recently because I was doing an interview and it came up. And somebody says about it and I had to, it was actually my friend, Alyssa Childers. So I texted her later. I was like, I don't know what dominionism is. And now you're admitting it. Yes. I read a lot, but I hadn't read about that. But anyway, you know, the record is called Dominion. And I sure hope people love it, man. It really is an exciting record to listen to if I can promote my own album. It's just like this record makes me want to go to the gym. I always think that's the standard for a good rock album. Can I go to the gym? Will it make me angry enough to work out, you know, to actually finish the workout? And I think this record does that. So the title Dominion does come from the book of Daniel. His dominion shall be a never lasting dominion. And, but for me, it's a celebration of freedom. And I kind of dedicate on the liner notes. Sometimes young people don't know there used to be a thing called liner notes. It was on a CD. You'd open it up. I thought you were going to say young people don't know there used to be a thing called freedom. Yes. And young people, even if they do know what freedom is, there used to be people who liked freedom. Anyway, yeah, that's pretty clever. That's which is kind of what you guys do. Anyway, but on the liner notes, we did dedicate the record to freedom. We dedicate to liberty. People that put their lives on the line gave up their lives for us and people who still do that today. And, and I think that's now unfortunately becoming broader than only people that serve in the military, which it is a nod to people in the military for sure. Past and present. But also that's all of us. I think that now we're living in a time that if you really want to be passionate about individual rights, if you want to be passionate about freedom of religion, freedom of speech, it kind of seems like you're, you're putting your livelihood on the line sometimes. You know, you're, you're putting yourself out there in a way that it just wasn't like this five years ago. Everything's changing very quickly. So dominion is all about that celebration of freedom. It is not about dominionism. I have learned in the last three weeks. Yeah. So this album will help you get ripped. It will help you lose weight. Have these statements been evaluated by the FDA? Yeah. Does it really matter anymore? I guess. Yeah. Yes. It didn't matter with the FDA or the CDC or the WHO. Nobody believes that anymore anyway. So it wouldn't matter. But it's been approved by me. And I basically am. Let's see. I basically am as, I have as much credibility as the FDA does now. Let's just say that. I don't have something to brag about. Yeah. Yeah. That's going to be on one of these gossip rock sites. Yeah. Get over it. Get over it. Yeah. Could you just say something really controversial please? Yeah. I think I just did. I'm trying to think of what I can't think of anything offhand. That's your guys job. We'll get to something eventually. Yeah. Well, you've got this single surviving the game. It says it's going to be on the upcoming rock band game. All right. Can you play it on rock band? Are you good at rock band? Actually, no, I'm not very good at rock band. It's actually quite hard. It's hard. It's different. It's a different skill set. But I'm just thrilled there is a rock band because guitars are becoming popular again. And I don't want to say that that is a one of the signs in revelation. But it might be. I'm so happy that guitars are coming back in. So yeah, it's a great look for us surviving the games of Ripper too. It's a face melter. I hope that people, you know, I had a great guitar riff that I cannot play on that video. That would be awesome to see the band try to play their own thing on rock band. Rock band is so much fun. But the thing that's so weird about them is you put so much effort into getting good at that. And then you still can't actually play the song. It's like you might as well take guitar less. Still can't do anything in real life. Yeah. That's probably a little peek into the world we live in currently. Everybody can go online and yell at each other about stuff. But when it comes to actual real life, most of the people doing most of the yelling don't know how to live real life anyway. That's what I found out. So last time we talked to you, we were talking about all the CCM artists who are deconstructing their faith. And, you know, they get all these headlines in mainstream press for leaving Christianity. So we just want to check up on your soul. Are you still safe? Do you want to come out and deconstruct on this? I am still saved. I do not want to deconstruct. And by the way, I liked you guys post you did about me a couple months ago. About me not deco. Well, I can't remember what it was. Something like that. Like the shocking the this artist has not abandoned his faith yet. Something like that. Yeah. Exactly what it was. I mean, yeah, you know, the media loves it. They love it when they see somebody from the Christian world finally turn their back on the faith, you know, and they get kind of quite giddy about it. And I think it's a really sad state of affairs because I think that deconstruction. Let's just say deconstruction. Not specifically about Christianity. Let's just say deconstruction about whatever right that could be deconstruction of American values or even political philosophy, whatever. It really is so destabilizing in our culture, but people love it. They just love to see people like leave something and burn it down. And I think that really speaks a lot about the chaos that we're in and that our kids are growing up in there growing up in a culture that enjoys the negativity that enjoys the nature of the culture. That enjoys the destruction that enjoys the chaos of nothing ever being rooted on firm ground. And it's really saddening. And at the same time, those suicide rates are skyrocketing amongst the young people and depression rates and anxiety divorce all this stuff is skyrocketing. And, but we keep doing the same things over and over and it keeps getting worse. So, you know, that's why I'm kind of so passionate about telling people about the truth of Jesus Christ that never ever changes. It is solid ground and don't you want a little bit of peace. I mean, a little bit of peace in 2022 would be pretty nice, but, you know, our culture just seems to prefer the destruction. I find that really sad. And it is true. The media definitely loves when that happens because even as you're saying, I'm thinking about it. Like when I look at like, like CNN or like a mainstream like news website, they'll only report on like a Christian artist or author when they leave the fake. It's like they would never do a story about this person. They've never been featured on their website ever before. And it's like, Oh, hey, look, this person's not Christian anymore. Now we'll give them some attention. It's so lame, isn't it? Yeah. It makes me so I've even done interviews. In fact, I'll do it again right here on the Babylon B. I've done interviews when I specifically asked some of these gossip sites, you know, that they only cover the things when they want to try to like catch me in something that makes me sound crazy. Burn me down for something and they'll try to get me in trouble. I've even said, please report me saying this because they don't want to report any good news. You know, like I'll brag about other bands. I'll brag about bands that are treated as good or did something nice for a fan when they didn't have to, you know. They never want to record that because they don't want to record any good news. They don't record anything positive. We truly are just a culture that just loves destruction. So anyway, I hope that when people listen to the new record, they are going to hear whether you're religious or not religious. It doesn't matter. You're going to hear this very positive message that you can relate to whether you're left, right, center, religious, not religious, anti-religious. It's a positive message about taking your life back and not giving in to like these negativity and this destruction and these dark forces. And I really hope that it's going to sound cheesy and trite, but I hope that it encourages people and makes people's day better because my gosh, everything you see on the news and social media is just people freaking out and losing their minds every minute. It's sad. So you want to lift their spirits while you melt their faces off. That's exactly right. Now that should be my tweet for the day. I want to lift their spirits while melting their faces off. I was thinking a little tagline for skillet maybe. Like if you want to use that, I'll just. Lifting spirits. While melting faces. Yes. You're the wordsmith man. That's it. That sounds pretty good. So concerts are kind of starting back up again. I know they have been for a little while. I was looking at a few bands that are going to play in my area and they all require vaccine cards and negative tests within a certain amount of time. And I'm like, that's not very punk rock. And so I'm just like, man, I can't go to any of these shows. I got to like drive to Arizona to go to a concert now. It kind of sucks. So I guess you have this stance about not playing venues that require Vax cards. Can you even pull off a tour like that? Are you finding any pockets of places where you're able to do that? Yeah, I am. You know, again, it's one of these things that like sometimes I can't believe the things that hurt that I say that hurt my career. Because I'm just like five years ago. No, no, no, no, no, two years ago, literally at the beginning of this pandemic, even when when President Biden became president, he was saying we're not going to be. We're not going to be doing mandates. That's not what America is all about. I remember correctly. I think Dr. Fauci said that as well. Of course, he said everything ever. So it doesn't matter. But the point is, I mean, one year ago, it wouldn't have been controversial for me to say we're not playing shows that have vaccine mandates because I believe it's authoritarian. It's tyrannical. It's anti American. That's I'm just like, that's my little stand. If it cost me, it cost me. And then the market lost their poop. And I'm just like, how come there aren't how come there aren't rock bands that many rock bands standing up against this, but instead it really turned on me, which is a shocker to me. So it's almost like to me that wasn't a political stance. And I think that part of it is how you know how we've kind of, we've kind of understood that all possible. Politics is religion. I mean, everything that you believe about some political opinion, it comes from some sort of core belief. And so all of a sudden people like john, you're being political. That is not political. That is a conviction. I think it's wrong. I think we have to fight this, or you don't know what the government may do after that. If they can, they can force you to do this, then they can force you to do something else. We have a lot of history to look back on upon that about torrent of government. So all that just say, yes, we are into a right now. It does seem like the states that we're able to play in. They are red states, that's just the way it goes, south, the southeast Florida and Alabama and Georgia and Tennessee, South Carolina, places like that, Ohio. We can't wait until everything goes back to normal because people need music. You know, people help music helps people. It's therapeutic. It gives people through a bad day. And little by little, I think that we're getting into that place where there's some hope of playing concerts. But we are playing concerts now supporting the new record. And it's just good to see people having a good time again. How do you handle all the Bible verses that talk about like submitting to governing authorities, honoring the emperor? That's kind of been something that a lot of Christians have been struggling with through this pandemic. Oh, wow, you're going deep on me. You're going deep on me. I'm challenging you. I'm calling you out. I'll have to say about that as this. Melting faces. What was the first? It's lifting spirits. It's melting. Lifting spirits sounds so good. Lifting spirits. Melting faces. You know, it's like a. Anyway, yeah, you know, I do think that this the last two years has really brought that argument back to the fold. It's really something that we haven't had to argue about, I think, in Christianity in America. And kind of a long time. Maybe. Yeah, the Puritan and Hyattism stuff. How I handle that is basically this. I've got a lot of love. A lot of love for Christians that disagree with me on this. I don't. I don't call them not brothers in Christ. I don't want to burn them down. I don't make fun of them. But I do disagree with them. I believe that that aspect of submitting to the government authorities at all costs, no matter what. I would say that's a I see it different. I see I believe in sphere sovereignty. That's the short answer. I believe in the sphere sovereignty model that God has given government the authority to do certain things, but not to do certain other things. But I will say this. I think that we have to know in this situation, we have to count the cost is the government trying to make me do something that I'm willing to go to jail for if I say no. And I would say not everything I'm willing to go to jail for. Do you know what I'm trying to say? So if they come and say you must do. A B or C. And if it's absolutely against my faith, what I go to jail for that. I think it's an issue of counting the costs when it comes to like that sort of government evil. So that's basically the short version of how I would handle that. And I do think that the church has a job to do. To help. I think I would say prophetically teach the government what is righteous and what is not righteous. And that ends up being kind of one of my major issues with the the piotism and Christianity is I think we should be involved. I think that we have the word of God, which gives us the basis for what is wicked and what is righteous and we should be informing. I don't believe that of course the church should step into the role of the state. I do not believe that that's idolatrous as well. Just like the state stepping into the churches, idolatrous, but I do think we should be a prophetic voice to them about what is righteous and what is not. So that's where I stand on that. What if the government told you you could only play folk music? Would that be worth going to jail for him? That would probably not be it might be. It might. I'm trying to think. What about bro country? Bro country. Yes. That's where you draw the line. I don't know. I'm not really sure. I don't mind. I guess I don't mind bro country. Here's what I don't want to do. Here's what I wouldn't do is play rock songs on acoustic. You see, I would rather play folk music than to do like acoustic versions of rock songs. That that feels that's anathema. There's not going to be a skillet unplugged album. Yeah, that's what I'm wondering. Everybody always wants this to and I always try my hardest to not do it because it just doesn't sound right. I mean, people really hear how rough my voice really is. My voice needs a lot of distortion on the guitars so that you cannot hear what's really happening behind that. That's true. I don't mind admitting it, man. Does the Bible seem too big, complicated, and overwhelming?

What are the world? Yeah, so what do you think is that work that's leading this massive crime wave that we seem to be living in right now? It's popping up in around the country, but especially in big cities. Yeah, I'm having a hard time remembering the podcast, but I can't answer the question because I talk so much. We know more about him than he does. But whatever you're going to say, it's right. You have more credibility than the FDA and any other government agency. So what is causing this crime wave? According to expert John Cooper. So when people submit to the governing authorities, they're really submitting to me, it's basically, I think that's what you just said. I'm lifting the spirits and melting. I mean, I think undoubtedly, I mean, again, some Christians say, why are you getting so political? It's not a political statement. It is a philosophical statement. I would say it's a theological statement. Really what's causing it is just humanism. I mean, it's just as simple as that. It is the fact that the prevailing worldview of America has shifted so far from Western civilizations worldview, which as we all know is built on really the Reformation and Christianity. It's moved so far from that that really people actually do believe that we are born good, that we kind of, or at the least, that we're a blank slate, if you will, we can do good things and we can do bad things. And our biggest issue is that we suffer trauma when we're young and this and the other. And that's the only reason we do bad stuff. The only reason somebody goes and steals is because they need to be, they need to have a psychologist speak with them about why they're doing this and what their mom did to them when they were young that caused this greatness fortune. It's really just a denial of human nature, you know, and I know that you guys would agree with that, I'm sure. It's just a denial of original sin that we are not born good. We are born into wickedness. And we all think of brand new ways to do wicked stuff. And that's why Jesus came and died for us, right? So that we could have a brand new heart be given a brand new heart through repentance through Jesus Christ. So I look at this, this stuff that's happening and it's remarkable to me. I think what's really frustrating is that if you are progressive, you can try all these new things out of love for man, you know, like I love people. So we're going to get rid of bail, you know, just let people out of jail. You can try these things. And even when those policies bring more death and destruction like they are now, even though more people get hurt and disproportionately, it is marginalized people of color and yada yada. It hurts those people even more, even after the policies hurt. The people that instituted them never get called out for it. It's always going to be us, Christians or conservatives or whatever. It's always going to be us that hate people, even though what we're saying is, is your policies are going to hurt people. And that's what I think is so frustrating. That's why I don't think it's a political statement. This comes down to core beliefs in either the goodness or the wickedness, inherent wickedness, I would say, of mankind. It's really sad to see that happen, but that's the way it is. All right. Well, we're going to move into our subscriber portion where we're going to talk about some more cool stuff. And then we're going to ask you the 10 questions, the second set of 10 questions, because you already answered the first set of 10 questions last time. Oh, yeah. Well, for everybody that's leaving the podcast now, I love you. I wouldn't mind saying this very quickly to all those people. I got a brag on the Babylon B because I tell you what you guys do for people. I'm sure you know this. It just, when I open up my phone and I see a Babylon B post, it just makes me feel not crazy. I know that sounds maybe dumb, but I know everybody watching this knows exactly what I mean. You're like, I knew I wasn't the insane person. And it's a way to laugh about something so that you don't, in other words, laughing about something is therapeutic. It doesn't make you angry. Then you can begin to laugh at the situation. It helps you get through it in a way that just being rapidly angry is something doesn't really help. I want to brag on you guys. I think absolutely the funniest thing happening in America. And I think it's bringing some sanity to a lot of people. So my bragging portion is done. Everybody go listen to dominion now. I was going to say you used the whole time to plug up. Yes, you promoted us. But then you did add. Yes. Well, you know, I'm a rock star. I can do whatever I want. And they should also check out we have here that you have a book that you wrote called Awakened Alive to Truth. Is that right? Yeah, you can check that out as well. Yeah, you can get on my website, john elkouper.com. I think it's available on Amazon as well as on Audible if you're the kind of person that wants to listen to book. So go check that out, but make sure you listen to the new record Dominion and tell somebody about it. That's all work. Listen to the new album while reading Babylon be headlines and exercising at the gym and exercising. Well, that was a great conversation with John Cooper of skillet and we've got more where that came from in the subscriber portion coming up shortly. So become a Babylon be subscriber. If you want to hear the rest and hear him answer the second set of 10 questions. In the meantime, we've got some hate mail to close out the show with. I really miss Adam Ford. So here's a reply from Robert E. Lark waters on Twitter and he was replying to one of our articles and he says, I can remember when the Babylon be was funny. In fact, I can remember when it had some respect for Christian values and didn't like to bear false witness. But according to this, that's a response to the Hunter Biden Ukraine article. Yeah, like the writing on a like a blasphemous article. Didn't like to bear false witness. But let's like if you think that satire is bearing false witness, then we've always. I wonder if Robert water is secretly Hunter by day. So we have some more hate mail. This hate mail is from the same meals from Brian Stilter. It's not really hate mail. It's fun. MJ who works here. What is your position? She does like our Instagram and she's our funny TikTok person because she's the only one here who understands what TikTok is. Yeah. She tweeted out forms of potatoes ranked one mash two roasted three baked 57 Brian Stilter and he responded. He said, I'm that high up. And she said, yeah, lucky for you. I haven't figured out the 58th way to make up. But that's great. He also retweeted a recent article with the tattoos like the Joe Rogan. Yeah, we had him on like trying to be like Joe Rogan and he replied to it and thought it was great. Yeah. He has a good sense of humor. I like that. See, we're bringing the nation together with all our jokes owning the Democrats. We're going to move into our subscriber lounge now where we're going to finish out the John Cooper interview. And we also have a fun thing where we're going to talk about this lightsaber world record. Yeah. Where a guy supposedly has the world's first fully retractable lightsaber. And Gavin is one of our animators and graphic guys. And he's also our resident lightsaber expert. He is our lightsaber expert. Yeah. And so he's going to analyze the article for us and demonstrate some of his lightsabers and lightsaber skills. It's going to be a packed subscriber lounge. So let's dive in. Coming up next for battle on B subscribers. Guinness World Records recognizes Russian YouTuber. The world's first retractable lightsaber. This reminds us of like an animal segment on a talk over his handlers come in and like what are we going to see next? Bring the ferrets. This is more of a display piece than or a cosplay piece than a dueling piece. Like you're trying to impress a girl you bring this out. Yeah, look at this. Yeah, that's... Nothing's fair. It's belching."
