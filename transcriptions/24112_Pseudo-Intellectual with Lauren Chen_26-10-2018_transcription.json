    "text": " Tonight, the Battle of Ideologies in Europe. I'm roaming millennial and you're watching Uncensored. Hi everybody, welcome back to the show. Tonight we start things off with some news from our based brethren in Hungary. As Yahoo News reports, Hungary's gender studies ban draws university anger. A prestigious Hungarian university on Tuesday blasted a government decree that prohibits gender studies courses as a quote major infringement on academic freedom. The decree signed by Prime Minister Viktor Orban and enforced since Saturday dropped the subject from a list of master's degree programs entitled to official accreditation and financial support. Students are also now barred from launching new courses in the discipline, all those students who have already begun courses may complete their studies according to the decree. So since this was announced, there has been predictably and from exactly the type of people you would imagine, quite a bit of push back to this. And you know what, I'm in favor of academic freedom and the ability to study whatever you want as an academic, but at the same time I think when it comes to government funding, it's important to recognize that these universities are not entitled to that money. They're not entitled to have Hungarian taxpayers pay for whatever the heck they want to spout to whatever type of ideologies they want to try to indoctrinate students toward. And I mean, this is one of the differences between I think most universities and other countries and specifically the states, right? So these universities, they're almost entirely run off of government money, right? The state is one of the few places I've seen that has private institutions. So you know, people might say it's none of his business. It's literally his business though as Prime Minister, what you guys are spending taxpayer money on. Right. And I do think that something that's important to differentiate to is that this is not geology, right? This cannot be conflated to some sort of mathematics or psychology or any other study like that. This is completely different thing. It is an ideology and not every idea that exists deserves to be taught in the highest institutions of learning. Right. And the thing is like, I wouldn't have a problem with people learning about gender studies as a concept. These are actually entire programs, entire fields and courses where it's taught as gospel, as truth, where these principles are presented pretty much unchallenged as if they were just universal. Imagine if you will, if there were just Nazi studies and you just learned about how to be a good little literal Nazi. Yeah, how the Jews aren't fearier. Right. I mean, that's essentially what a lot of these gender program studies are doing with men. So I mean, why is that okay? Do you think this is ever going to happen in the States or Canada or the UK? Absolutely not. We're too far gone, unfortunately. I'm really, really happy that Hungary is doing this. And I think that we absolutely should as well. But I think that this would not be happening anytime soon in our countries. Yeah, which is bad because think we, this is the worst thing. The places where we need it the most, where we need people to stand up and say, no, you can't just indoctrinate our children using our own money. We're the places that would never do it because they've been doing it so successfully for so long that it's, yeah, it's too bad. And I'm the type of person where if you have, you know, a private institution completely private and you guys want to just talk about gender studies, I mean, that's, that's fine. But I mean, to call it an official degree used taxpayer funding, that's to me where I would draw the line. And I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but there is some small part of me that's thinking, okay, we see that the left loves people taking gender studies and loves that kind of stuff. But we also see that there's pretty much essentially zero demand in the job market for gender studies majors. And so, I think that's the most important thing to do is to get people when they graduate, going to have no job, going to have to rely on the state and state assistance. Therefore, perhaps perpetuating, you know, big government welfare states. Part of me is like, is this, is this a master Soros funded plan? Perhaps the perfect cycle. They get taught on Marxism. They find out that they're useless and then that Marxism would be the only answer for that to have any use. Right. It's like, oh my gosh, you're right. The capitalism is rigged because I can't find a job with my, I guess, like 12 year gender studies doctorate. Therefore, we have to rise up and overthrow the system. Yeah. Because somehow in communism, they're going to have a better place for gender study professors. Yeah, no, but gosh, I saw this on Twitter a while ago and it's so true. The people who advocate for this, these marks of systems, I think they're always assuming that they're going to be able to just lounge around in this perfect utopian, you know, pursuing the arts, studying gender when the reality is either they're going to be starving or they're going to be plowing a field very inefficiently because these people, tend not to work out. So that's the idea. And then that will lead to the starving. Then they'll be called. It's like, that's what's going to happen. They'll get called in their own system. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's kind of sad. And I mean, I do support the idea that they're at least letting the people who are in it right now finish it, right? Because that wouldn't be fair to the existing students. But overall, I support this good on you. I wish more universities, even if they're say, not going to ban it, but would at least stand up to the, I guess, far left, hard progressive ideologies. And that's, you know what? That's, that's honestly would be enough to make me happy at this point because it's so far the other way. Yeah. I mean, it really has grown like a tumor, like you've mentioned, where they, you know, at this point they've had so many years of indoctrination that they have a lot more of a following now. It's a much bigger problem to deal with in the West. And we really need to nip that problem in the butt. Yeah, because I mean, it's kind of frustrating, but also incredible just how effectively you can indoctrinate people. If you're in there from high school or even younger up all the way through university, it really is impressive. And I think they'll left their smarter in a way like, yeah, they're not reading themselves because they've essentially shunned any form of heterosexual sex and love abortion. But, you know, they, they have gotten their hands on other people's children in order to propagate their ideology, which is, I mean, got handed to them. That's pretty clever. So a few weeks ago, we did an entire video dedicated to the, I think we called it progressive propaganda of the BBC. And coming up now we have, we have a new video that it's going to make you mad when you see it. It's going to be unpleasant. Your friends hand me your going to tell Thomas White some really idea for Hinton Marley and you. I'm going to go out into that world and find this diversity around them and they'll find that at young age as well. And the more they can be accepted at this age, you're not going to face it further on because the children will be accepted now and will be accepted in this diversity around them. So I have for a long time been a strong proponent of homeschool because I just don't trust educators anymore. And I can think of no, no better example of why it's a bad idea to not take interest or take part in your child's education because they could literally be teaching them anything. And I mean, I'm not an intolerant person. I know a lot of people might, you're not, no, I'm really not. But this is just so incredibly inappropriate. I mean, I don't think even writing straight love letters at six years old, that's still messed up. They're their kids that shouldn't be exposed to any of that. And I love having the video. She explicitly states that it's to make them more accepting later on. Like you're, you're kind of, you're admitting that it's for the end goal of making them behave how you want. Yeah, I mean, there's another word for that is called indoctrination. Right. But yeah, these kids are six years old. And I mean, they would start it earlier if they could, right? It's essentially from the moment they step into these schools, it's boom. Here's a, here's how to be a progressive in 2018. And the thing is, I mean, I often hear from people's like, oh, there, there are gay people around why, why can't kids just like learn about it? I mean, I don't, I have nothing against gay people, but there are some things that children's minds, I just don't think they should have to deal with. They are ready to have to deal with the complexities of that. There are divorced people out there. Do we have to teach six year olds what it means to be divorced? There are people with mental illness out there. Do we have to teach them about that? You know, there are people with, I guess erectile dysfunction as well. Maybe we bring that into the classroom. There are some important. Right. Exactly. There are so many parts of being an adult that there's nothing wrong with. There's nothing bad about, but that don't necessarily belong in a child's classroom. And I think anything to do with sexuality or sexual preferences probably falls under that category of it's, you know, not bad, but why, why do we have to teach six year olds about it? Right. I mean, because these are kids that, I mean, they're not even experiencing like heterosexual feelings or anything like that. Let's just stop sexualizing children here. Yeah. And, but the thing is it's not just teaching it in this case. They're actually writing letters as love letters to, you know, homosexual kind of fantasy that the teacher has, I guess. They're making them take part in this pseudo fantasy homosexual relationship. So they're not just teaching people about homosexual behavior. They're actively encouraging homosexual behavior. And that's a very different thing as well. Right. And you can talk about the validity of that or whatever you want, but I can tell you that that's not the school that I would be putting my kids through. No, absolutely not. And again, like, I mean, this is happening in the UK. So I'm not sure if this is the case where it's a public school, but if it is, if it is, if you tried this in the US, there would be, there would be actual riots in the streets as there should be. Like, I think that would be if I saw that video and I saw my kid in that classroom, I would actually write just because it's so incredibly inappropriate. Like not only are you saying, Hey, this is what it means when, you know, a man loves another man. And even then that conflation of what love is like romantic, but that's a bad idea, but you're making them pretend that they themselves are it's just, it's so wrong. I don't know who possibly could have thought this was a good idea. I hope that person gets fired, honestly. And the UK, I'm so, I'm so scared for you. I'm so scared for them. Another thing that bothers me is since when did schools be, become responsible for teaching kids morality, right? Like, isn't that something that maybe parents should be doing that maybe churches community should be doing? When did it become a school's job to just completely raise the child, right? Because it used to be that schools were there to teach you, I don't know, math, English, you know, stuff like that, but it looks like we've completely pivoted. And now the school, the state has to be the parent. Is it, I don't know, is it because we can't trust parents anymore? Is it just because we trust the schools that much? It's just, it's a bad, bad road to go down. But I guess that warning aside, which I really hope if you guys are in the UK, you know, if you have schools anywhere, please check into what you're doing. Your kids are learning. But aside from that, that's all for now. Thank you guys so much for tuning in and we'll see you next time."
