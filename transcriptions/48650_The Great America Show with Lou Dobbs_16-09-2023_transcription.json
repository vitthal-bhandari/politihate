I'm Lou Dobbs and welcome to The Great America Show. Great to have you with us. Hope you're having a great weekend. The United Auto Workers Union is in its second day of strikes against the three main Detroit car makers. Ford, General Motors and Stellantis as of last night, roughly 11 percent of the 145,000 UAW employees were un-striked. A global research firm estimates that each of the three car makers has a two-month supply of cars or on-route to dealerships. The last strike against General Motors back in 2019 lasted for 40 days. The Biden regime ginning up its vast propaganda machine to defend the indicted son of the president. Special counsel David Weiss indicted Hunter Biden this week on gun charges and the congressional investigation of his father is building. An impeachment inquiry to President Biden has quickened its tempo. The subpoenas are expected to go out soon. Hunter Biden's attorney Abby Lowell wasted no time joining the Marxist media broadcast. Lowell told Good Morning America that the indictment was brought because of, get ready, politics, not because Hunter lied and bought a gun illegally. Our defense has multiple parts to it. The first is that there's a deal in place that should have prevented this. The second is that courts are finding the statute unconstitutional. And the third, if it ever gets that far, and we don't believe it should, there'll be a defense on the facts of this case. And again, I need to point out for people who are paying attention that what's odd about this is the fact that this happened in 2018 law enforcement showed up no charges. The U.S. Attorney's Office has known about this for years, no charges. When they found out about it and made a deal, it was for a diverted agreement. What changed? The facts, not the law, but all the politics that have now come into play. Joe Biden hasn't commented yet on Hunter's indictment, but did tell a group of donors that the Republicans only want to impeach him because they want to shut down the federal government, failing to mention the already overwhelming evidence against him and members of his crime family. Not to mention, the president himself hasn't denied the charges raised against him. President Trump credits a federal judge for Hunter's legal issues. The former president was asked if he still believes there's a two-tiered justice system with Hunter Biden now indicted. President Trump says Hunter was only indicted because of a brave federal judge, Judge Mary Allen Norieka, who threw out Hunter Biden's sweetheart plea deal with the Justice Department. There's no question about it. He had a plea deal that was the deal of the century. The art of the deal, you could write a book on it, the art of the deal. And all of a sudden, that was broken up by a judge who was able to, a brilliant judge, actually, who was able to see through what was happening. And it's a sad situation. I mean, nobody should be happy about this. I'm not happy about it. Nobody is. It's a very sad thing. It's so bad for our country. But if you think about it, I've been under investigation from the day I came down the escalator and a phony investigation, fake investigations, investigations that I beat every single day single time, still under investigations. But it's a very sad thing. And it's a slippery slope. And danger is very dangerous for our country. President Trump straightforward even as he faces four criminal indictments from a crooked corrupt Biden regime. Turning now to a story we've been covering for months here on The Great America Show, the conservative consumer boycott, and the rapid decline of what was once America's beer, Bud Light. As major retailers struggle to sell Bud Light at all and all Anheuser-Busch products, Bud Light sales are still in the tank. The retailer's sales are down 30%, six months after the transgender campaign that the company ran with influencer Dylan Mulvaney. Bud Light has since lost its title of top-selling beer in America to Mexico-based beer modell. Here with us today on The Great America Show is the man whose family built the company and that brand. Joining us is Billy Bush, his author and heir to the Anheuser-Busch dynasty and Billy. It's great to have you with us here on The Great America Show. You have out a new book and I want to recommend it to everyone. The title is this, and it's exact. The extraordinary rise and epic fall of an American dynasty. This latest debacle has to be gut-wrenching for you and the entire Bush family. I will say that I probably was around during Anheuser-Busch's greatest growth. My dad who was running the cut the time, August Bush Jr., better known as Gussie, took the company from 3 million barrels to 35 million barrels in about 25 years, 25 to 30 years that he ran. Anheuser-Busch opened up nine new breweries across the United States and he put theme parks around. Most of those breweries, as you would probably know them as Bush Gardens. He opened up our home Grants Farm in St. Louis to the public and got the idea of opening up the Bush Gardens around the breweries from opening up Grants Farm. He realized the great brand loyalty that brought to the brands that he was selling as well as the advertisement that that brought to the brands. He bought a baseball team, the St. Louis Cardinals. He was a great marketer. He understood how to grow a business. I watched him as he grew the business. I learned some of the principles that he used during that time, how marketing was so important. Grassroots, beer selling was so important. Any detail of the company was very important to him. The employee is right. Giving back to his community, giving back to the country was always important. That's what he did. I think that really helped him grow the company. It's just a different culture. Today, what you see at Anheuser-Busch, it's no longer like that, I don't think. They're seeing that in the advertising that they're doing now with Bud Light. Of course, they've lost a lot of sales because of that kind of advertising. A lot of sales, and I know that the company was sold to Inbev and things are quite different now. To get to the point we are now, where Anheuser-Busch has moved from sort of essential Americana. I'll put it this way, in my generation, every kid ordered a Bud. It was just the beer. And suddenly, to see a transgender image on a beer can took us in a whole different direction. Anheuser-Busch, these people running your company, the company, I should say, just really destroyed a piece of Americana. They did. It's unfortunate because when they bought the company, their advertising was doing well. It was like a big ship sailing down the ocean in a single direction, moving forward, doing well. Now, that big ship is starting to turn. When you make changes like they made, it becomes a political message that you get into. Now you're dividing, you're really advertising to a small portion of the world. My family would not have gone in that direction. They believed in inclusiveness, they believed in the motto, making friends as our business, and bringing everybody together. A beer is a social drink. It's something that you drink when you're bringing people together and you're enjoying life and you're having fun. And to push a political agenda like transgender, like the transgender culture into the beer drinker who doesn't really even understand that culture, who doesn't relate to it whatsoever, was just the wrong message. And I think they're paying for it now. I guess one way to put it, and I'm doing this with a tongue in cheek, but that might be better advertising for the white wine crowd rather than a brewski. I just have to wonder, the rest of your family, you've exited the company, your inheritance and your income no longer as I would guess, depending on how well Budweiser does or doesn't do. But how does the rest of your family feel? You know, I'm the first family member that's ever published a book about the family. And so I really had an opportunity to go back and to research and to really get an understanding of who my great grandfather was, Adolfus Bush, who started the company as well as my grandfather, who ran the company through prohibition and kept all 2,000 employees employed during that time and got to know my father in his younger years when he was coming up and they were writing letters back and forth and I had access to all these letters to his grandfather, to his father, and really got a great understanding of who they were and how they supported this country, how much they love this country. I mean, during the World Wars, they gave up most of the marketing on their products to market in a way that supported America through the wars. They shut down some distribution, especially along the West Coast, so that America could use transportation on the West Coast to move soldiers around and military equipment. And so they always did anything they possibly could to support America. And I really got that incredible sense, knowing that Adolfus came here to live the American Dream, the faith they had in this country. And it's just the family reigns, the book I wrote has that history in it, that great American history, which I think people will really, really enjoy. And then growing up, you know, watching my father, having the experiences I had growing up, both good and bad, I talk about that in the book. And so I am closer to it than my, my, and then I kept the business going, I kept the beer tradition going not too long after the company was bought by Inbev. So I got into the beer business, we're still in the beer business, we have the Bush family brewing in Distilling Company here in St. Louis and in Missouri. And so I'm just much closer to it than the rest of my family. And I think I have a better understanding than they see it. So as far as how they feel about how things are going today, we, in the book, you can see that we had kind of a problem, a division in the family over our home where we grew up, Grant's farm. And it tells you all about what happened during that time too. So I'm not that close to my family any longer. And so I really couldn't tell you, Lou, how they feel about, about what's going on. But I'm sure it's got to affect them negatively also. I think it's, I would hope that it does, but you never know, a family as large and broad as the Bush family are going to have some division is not an unnatural state of affairs for families that large and over a number of generations. I do want to ask you about St. Louis, though. You've watched a lot happen. You've been a part of the country and St. Louis history. St. Louis right now seems to be divided itself. Give us a sense of crime and what it's like to live in St. Louis now versus when you were growing up. Yes. Unfortunately, St. Louis is not thriving like it used to. It's not thriving at all. Actually, a lot of the companies have moved out of St. Louis. There's a few of them left, but we used to be a hub here for the airlines. So you could pretty much go anywhere from here to any other city, any other state directly, and you can't do that any longer. Unfortunately, a lot of the young talent who grows up here in St. Louis and goes to school here are moving away. They go to other states to pursue careers. We're seeing a lot of that. And then of course, the crime that is just full, you know, we have a democratic mayor down there. They're not convicting the criminals that a lot of them are getting away with things and defunded the police in St. Louis city. And so the crime rate is up more than ever. It used to be a great place to go. There are wonderful places in the city, the landing, Central West End, you could go and eat and go to restaurants. It's kind of dangerous going down in those parts now. You know, even going to the St. Louis Cardinal game at the Bush Stadium, there's a lot of people are getting their cars broken into while at the game. And it can be kind of dangerous doing those kinds of things too. So it's taken a terrible turn for the worse. And all we can do is hope and pray that we get the right kind of governance down in the city to bring things back because a lot of people are exiting that area and moving out into the outskirts of the St. Louis area like St. Charles. Well, that's terrible. And everyone is sorry to hear that except there is this. And that is nearly every major city in the United States right now. When we look, turn our eyes away from just a moment from what all the Marxist Dems are doing in the nation's capital, which is a tragedy that is larger than anything we could have ever imagined. These large Democratic run cities, the crime rates are exploding, the poverty levels, the homeless levels are a disaster. And the Democrat Party, they were the ones that were supposed to be able to fix these things instead of fuel and worsen them. It's a sad, sad moment in our history. We're talking with Billy Bush. He's the author of the new book, Family Raines, the Extraordinary Rise and Epic Fall of an American Dynasty. You would get his sense of what he thinks corporate America is all about today and how corporations are getting in the mess that so many of them find themselves. We'll be right back. Stay with us. We're back now. We're talking with Billy Bush. His book is Family Raines, the Extraordinary Rise and Epic Fall of an American Dynasty. And we're talking about the Bush Dynasty in this country. Billy, let's turn to what in the world is corporate America doing in your judgment? Is you're watching what is happening, not just to the Anheuser-Busch Enterprises and your own, but across the country. We are looking at HR departments driving ESG, EID, they're driving, all sorts of nonsense that is just on its face laughable. I'm speaking only for myself. I mean, it's just to me this is a disgusting moment because this is specious. It's sophistry rolled up as some sort of fancy psychosocial doctrine. Your thoughts? Yes, if you look at what Disney is doing, what Target has done, of course, what ABN bev, what's going on with their advertising. These big corporations, it just doesn't make any sense to me. I think they're trying to be, maybe they're trying to be inclusive, but inevitably it becomes divisive how they're advertising. I think it's pushing a woke agenda down people's throats. I don't think people relate to that kind of advertising that they're doing. I mean, girls, guys dressing up as girls in Disney. I have seven kids, Lou, and they're all older now. I've got two grandkids. What I take my little kids are my little grandkids to Disney right now with that kind of advertising, with what they've got going on as far as guys dressing up as girls. It's so confusing. Little kids don't understand that. It's not a wholesome way of going about things like Disney used to have. Then of course, Target's pushing some of the woke agenda. I think gender identity is something that's supposed to be the woke way of going about things using the correct pronouns, all these kinds of things. Now you're taking kids into Target or to Disney or something like that and exposing them to these kinds of radical cultural behaviors. It just doesn't make any sense. That used to be a private issue. Nobody cares if people are transgender. That doesn't matter. Those kinds of things to us. We don't want to push in our face. It's supposed to be a private thing. The great thing about America in which we always love is it's land of the free and people are free to make choices as long as they're not hurting anyone. I'm not against any of those free choices, but don't push it in somebody's face. Yeah. I think those are good words for everyone to live by. The reality is that Disney's lost about a billion dollars on their last number of films because of the woke attitudes, the transgender doctrines are throwing out there. It's not working as a business philosophy and yet they're pushing it because the ideological basis for it all is really anti-American and there's no doubt about that. What is difficult for me to comprehend is why shareholders are putting up with it, why customers are putting up with it in any fashion. I'm beginning to believe and I was always against boycotts, but I believe it's gotten to the point that the conservatives and Republicans and independents working men and women and their families who just want to be Americans and live the American dream. They're being told go to hell by American business. That's when things have to be stopped. It really has to end there because that's the last power these folks have. The elections are rigged. The fact is that they're bringing in labor across that border wholesale to compete for wages, for jobs and the working man and woman in this country is just getting, I mean they're getting destroyed. Your thoughts. There's no doubt about it. In Family Rains, the book that I just wrote, I talk about how my family and the leaders of the company from the Bush family love this country and supported this country. Would they support what's going on right now? Heck no. Would they speak up? There would be a way they would speak up. They wouldn't want to lose any of their backing, any buyers of their brands, but they would still speak up because they believed in this country first. The country always came first. That's why I'm speaking up, Lou, because I knew what this country, I know what this country gave to our family because my family worked so hard to build this incredible beer empire. They couldn't do it in any other country except for this country, America, that we live in. What we see today with what's going on is just, I don't know the incentive behind it, what's incentivizing companies to go in this direction, this woke direction. It doesn't make any sense to me, but what they're doing, they're tearing down this country. I don't know if they're being incentivized, Lou, in some way that we don't see. It's this administration that we have, I don't trust it. I think that there could be, I think there was tampering in the election, whether it was holding the Hunter Biden tapes back or the Hunter Biden computer back so people couldn't see what was going on with the Biden family before the election. That's tampering with the election right there. We know that there was some tampering being done, but what this government is pushing over on, you look and see what went on with the pharmacies and the vaccine and the money that was made by government officials, pushing the vaccine on people. Now we find out that it was all a bunch of baloney. Would they be incentivizing these companies to go against America? It's just a really scary time that we have and why they're trying to break down our culture, what where we came from and tear it apart, canceling our culture and everything that we were founded on, they're trying to make it look like it's so wrong and so bad that yeah, I don't know what the underlying reason for it is, but something's going on. You're right. There's something going on and most of us who've been following this and investigating it for some time, I think it's pretty straightforward now. The Marxist DIMMs are anti-American, they're anti-America and we have to come to the understanding which is difficult for all of us. Right now the Marxist DIMMs are in control of our federal government and the federal government is weaponized against the American people. We're talking with Billy Bush. His book is Family Rains, the Extraordinary Rise and Epic Fall of an American Dynasty. We'll be right back. Stay with us. We're back with Billy Bush and I asked Billy to come on the show to give us his perspective. His book is a book about America and the journey that most of the folks in my generation have taken and which the current generation will continue. It's going to be quite a different path than most of us followed folks in my generation. Billy, I want to just get your sense first of all, exactly where this country is in your judgment. You talked about how serious the situation is but what do you look to for inspiration? What do you look to as a path forward? You don't strike me as a fellow who's either is going to be irrationally optimistic or irrationally pessimistic. Give us your thoughts. Well, I'm the kind of person that looks at things as glass half full. I do believe that we have enough people in this country who understand what's going on right now and the predicament we're in. I think that people are waking up to it more and more that we do have division in this country. It's very polarized that we have one side who doesn't particularly care for this country and what it was built on. They want to tear it down. They want us to become more socialistic. They want to change it in every way. But I still think we have enough people in this country who understand that we're still the greatest country in the world, that we were built on freedom and where dreams can be made possible here in this country. And I think that's why we have this flood of illegal immigrants coming into this country because they see it also that this country is the land of opportunity. And I think because we're built on that strong foundation, I think the opposite side is going to have a really, really tough time tearing it down. I see all this stuff going on with Donald Trump and how he gets every time he turns around, they're looking for a way to get rid of him, to get him out of there. He's a strong guy. He keeps fighting. And I appreciate the fact that he keeps fighting for this country. I really think that he's for this fountain, for what we believe in and for what this country stands for. I've heard a lot like him. So I think we're going to be okay. But I do think it takes people to stand up and not hide from it, not hide from the fact that we're having this problem, but to stand up and speak out against it and stand up for what's right for this country. Well, I think that that's first of all well said. We're at a point where I think people are also starting to realize they've been bystanders. They've been watching this all happen over a series of years, depending on their age and what they're doing for a living. Most Americans just want to go about their lives and rely upon their congressmen, their senators to be good and true men and women representing American values and their family. We've moved a long way from that. We have different cultures in this country, suddenly. We're multicultural to say the least. And I'm not talking about just race here. I'm talking about the values of in Minnesota or Georgia or California and the Midwest. It's a clash. And we are now separate peoples in separate states. It's not just about red and blue. This is a definitive difference amongst our people right now. We're not just simply as President Obama once said, red states and blue states were the United States. We're not. And people have to understand that, I think. Don't you? I completely agree. We're not that way anymore. And before it gets out of hand, I think we need to come together. We need a savior coming in, whether Donald Trump's reelected. But I kind of remember a little bit of an instance similar to what we're dealing with right now during Jimmy Carter's time. And to me, he was not a good president, but then we had Ronald Reagan come in and he unified the country and he helped the economy and he brought strength and courage and faith back to everyone who lives in this country. And it made a huge difference. And I'm just hoping that somebody comes out of the woodwork and can kind of take over like Ronald Reagan did during those days. I a number of people have said that we need a Ronald Reagan. But honestly, I think we need a Donald Trump right now. We have to have a warrior who can take the viciousness of the left who can. I mean, the blows that he has endured over the course of eight years now, the political persecution. I think every Republican, every elected Republican has to stand with him because if they do not, the Marxist left will prevail. And if they prevail, there won't be an election in 2028. I could almost assure you of that. But I think we've really enjoyed talking with you. I want to get, we always give our guests the last word. And if you will, you're concluding thoughts here. Well, first of all, I think it's important. I would just want to reiterate that I think it's important that people speak up. I think we're in a situation right now that is dire and that we that we need to speak up. We need to be for this country. We need to get rid of some of this craziness that's going on, this wokeism, this ultra liberalism that is taking over our country that's turning our country into a socialistic society. There's trying to anyway. And we need to speak up and stand firm against it. And then I'd like for everyone to go out there and purchase the book, Family Rains that I just wrote. I think you get an incredible American history going all the way back to when my great grandfather at all started the brewery all the way up until it was sold and then to where the bushes are today, what it was like growing up in the Bush family when I grew up there, having a pet elephant, traveling in a private railroad car, which I thought everyone did at the time. And then I realized how unique that was. And so there's some great stories in there that people will be able to relate to history, business, family dynamics, succession, all that sort of thing is in the book. I think people will relate to it and enjoy it. So please go out and get that. And you're going to see that in the book that, you know, how my family stood by America and believed in America. And that's what really caused them to be able to build such an incredible beer empire. Billy's been great talking with you. We recommend Billy's book highly. The family reigns, the extraordinary rise in epic fall of an American dynasty. And you just prompted one of my childhood memories, my great dream. You're talking about traveling in a, you're a private railroad car. My dream was to get one of those push wagons that they had, you know, where two guys get one guy gets one in and they peddle the thing down the rails. Yes. That was the coolest thing I had ever seen. That's what I was aspiring to it about the age of seven or eight. So they're all perspectives in this country and there should be room for all of them.
