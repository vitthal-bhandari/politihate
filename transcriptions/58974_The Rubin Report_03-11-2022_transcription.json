    "text": " And America was saved. Embraced by the loving arms of our new president, Joe Biden. Biden has brought back kindness and decorum. That's a lie, man. What's this? No, I wish you were in high school. I could take it behind the gym. Oh, my gosh. Thank you, that was a rush. Biden is a voice of clarity. America is a nation that can be defined in a single word. I was in for a voice of reason. He is the smartest man I know. They're going to put you all back in chains. Andy's good with numbers. Let me start off with two words. May in America. 700 billion and a trillion, 300 million billion dollars. Under his leadership, the Biden administration has brought us safety. It has brought us economic prosperity. It has empowered the next generation. And now, you have the chance to make sure it continues for another two years, this election day. Vote for whoever the Biden administration is asking you to vote for. They know what's best. Together, we will ensure things will continue to go the way they've been going forever and ever. I'm Joe Biden and I approve this way, way, way. You know the thing. MUSIC See, guys, the Internet is not always horrible. Occasionally, it is a fun, funny, irreverent place. A place where memes can spread ideas faster than ideas traveled in past days. It is November 3, 2022. I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report. We are live streaming on Rumble YouTube and Blaze TV. If you have not subscribed to our channels, go ahead and do it. It's like, how many times do I have to tell you this? If you do it, I'll just stop saying it. Not far ready with this. You know what I'm saying? We are mostly today focusing on a Rubin Report, locals, community, Q&A, got a bunch of great questions all over the map, politically, personally, all over. So we'll get to that in just a moment. I wanted to start, though, today with this appearance yesterday. You know, I'm trying to limit the amount of stuff we do with the view. It's a constant internal conflict here. On one hand, it's like, the ladies of the view are insane. The show is awful. We shouldn't pay much attention to them. And then, on the other hand, because there is an influential set of people that do watch the program, it's like we should be exposing this stuff. This is also, of course, how I feel about MSNBC and Joy Reid and a lot of the CNN stuff and everything else. What I would hope is that when we get to the other side of next week, so let's say Tuesday goes pretty well. And, you know, suddenly the Senate is looking pretty red and New York maybe went red and Michigan and Arizona and things are really, really turning. My hope is that, going forward, we can focus more on those constant positive stories related to freedom and economic prosperity and human flourishing and have to focus a little less on the lunacy. But as long as the lunacy is encroaching, which it still is, of course, and as I said yesterday, it's never going to go away. Even if we defeat it at the ballot box for the most part, it's not going to fully go away. But I think as we start winning more and it feels like we're on the precipice of that, we can kind of shift and focus on the new horizon instead of just always dealing with the lunatics. But in any event, Anne Hathaway, actress Anne Hathaway from Devil Wears Prada, she was an interstellar, give me one more Anne Hathaway movie. Princess Dot, wow, you got very excited on that, one guy. You just lit up Princess Diaries. Okay, you have one, you have one. Les Miserables. No, you have to say that properly. Les Miserables. Les Miserables. Les Miserables. No guacamole for you. Anyway, Anne Hathaway, the actress, she was on the view yesterday. And of course, what happens when an actress goes on the view, we're going to do abortion and racism and shopping, kids, genitals off and everything else. So we're going to hit a little bit of that and then we'll get to the questions. Real quick guys, let me talk to you about Bullion Max. You know, as inflation surpasses highs not seen in 40 years, don't tell Joe Biden. The value of the dollar is decreasing with every passing day.

Actress Anne Hathaway was on the view sitting with the harpies yesterday. And you'd think perhaps they could talk about movies or television or the craft of acting. It's a very serious thing. These are very serious people. But no, mostly abortion. We're in the fight every minute. And you mentioned the Teplor's product turning sweet 16. Yeah. Some 16 year old's life has been irrevocably changed. Yeah. Because of the current overturning a Roe v. Wade. Bad to say one other thing and just without going to too many details, my own personal experience with abortion. And I don't think we talk about this enough. Abortion can be another word for mercy. We don't know. We don't know. It's not a world in which we know that no two pregnancies are alike. And it follows that no two lives are like that. Follows that no two conceptions are alike. So how can we have a law? How can we have a point of view on this that says we must treat everything the same? And where I come at it from is when you allow for choice, you allow for flexibility, which is what we need in order to be human. So that anyway, I just wanted to keep that part. Especially for that. It's not it's not said in stone, just because you get pregnant. Doesn't mean you get to keep that baby. Yeah, it's a health decision. And it can be every time the right. Yeah. Right. God, it's so incredible. Almost everything she said right there was completely backwards related to what just happened with Roe v. Wade. So we'll do a quick one on one on this. And this is one of those moments where I know I have a bright audience. So it's like, why do I have to explain it? But, you know, we could be getting some new people who don't know the score. Roe v. Wade did not, the reversal of Roe v. Wade, did not make abortion legal. Did not make abortion illegal. All it did was kick it back to the States, which is exactly how it was before the original decision. I think in 19, what was it, 1972, if I'm not mistaken, that's all it did. So the States then can make choices for themselves. So it's so interesting. She wants flexibility and she wants choice. That is actually the outcome of Roe v. Wade being flipped. Now each state is making choices and offering flexibility to their constituents. So here in Florida, right? Very red, right wing, DeSantis, Stan, Florida. We have a 15 week ban on abortion. And there's still some exceptions after that. 15 weeks, that's three and a half months. Any of you who have been pregnant or know someone who's been pregnant or were birthed from someone who was once pregnant, understand the three and a half weeks, three and a half months is a pretty reasonable compromise. I would argue that that is far more of a compromise than say eight month abortions. That seems rather excessive if you ask me. But the point is that each state, California, can have their eight and nine month and post birth abortions. And if Kentucky wants something more strict, they can do that. You also have the ability to go to different States and do different things. You can have non-profits that will allow people and bust people from one state to another to either have an abortion or to not have an abortion. This is what freedom is all about. So everything that she explained other than she's for abortion, everything she explained was completely nonsensical, which is consistent. No two lives are like, well, of course, no two lives are like, so let's give as much choice as possible. Let's not have the federal government say what everyone has to do. Let's leave it to the States. There was a bunch of guys who used to wear these white wigs and they'd wear these funny jackets and tall socks. And they were into this sort of choice thing. It's very, very bizarre. Anyway, let's now shift because it wasn't just the view yesterday, spouting general nonsense. NBC, there's this thing called NBC now. It's a little unclear to me what it is. I guess it's like they're like, they're trying to be like young hip NBC or it's their LGBTQ plus NBC, something like that. They did a groundbreaking little piece here on how trans people are struggling to vote. Your voters are concerned. They might be blocked from casting their ballots. Yeah, that's because a growing number of states are enforcing stricter voter identification laws that disproportionately impact the community. NBC out reporter, Joe, your Kayba, joined us now with more on this joke and morning to you. So first of all, how can voter ID laws create obstacles for transgender people? And where do we see some of the strictest voter ID laws? Sure, yeah. So voter ID laws disproportionately impact trans people because trans people are more likely to have IDs without the name that they go by and the gender marker that reflects how they present. And recent research shows that just over 200,000 eligible trans voters in 31 states that both conduct their elections mostly in person and require or request ID at the polls don't have IDs that reflect their gender identities and the names they go by. And the states that have the strictest voter ID laws are mostly concentrated in the South and Midwest. So you're Tennessee, Wisconsin, Kansas, so voters there. God, they have everybody. It's like there's all the problems over here and they have everybody looking over here constantly. Having an ID that reflects who you actually are is a key part of securing a democracy. Every Western democracy has this. We are basically the only country at this point in the civilized world who for some reason a certain set of our states have decided you do not need an ID to vote. When I voted last year in the California recall election, I've told you this many times, I tried to show the guy my ID and he kind of freaked out. All they wanted to know was your name and your address. It's very bizarre because I knew at the time my neighbor's name and address and I suppose I could have gone in the very next day and said I am him or I am her and they would have had to let me vote. Are these people implying that these trans people that they're very worried about can't get on planes because you need a plane, you need an ID to get on a plane, which is of course the same thing that they're constantly saying about black people. Black people can't get IDs. I can't find one black person who hasn't gotten an ID. As I said yesterday, it's odd that CNN and MSNBC have not run these videos of all of these black people being turned away. Often I've seen black people on planes. Have you guys seen black people on planes? We've all seen black people on planes. They seem to be figuring it out. It's the soft bigotry of low expectations. These people are just absolutely ridiculous. If you are an adult who transitions, so you're a biological male, let's say you're a 32 year old and now you wish to live as a woman and you transition whatever that means and you go through whatever procedures and you legally change your name and everything else, you get a new ID. You get a new ID. So these people are just creating problems. It's like the whole house is burning down and they're worried about the dust bunny in the corner. It is just so silly. So silly. Guys, there's an election coming and the blaze wants to help you figure out what's going on. As you know, it's right around the corner. This coming Tuesday and the stakes have never been higher for the midterms. Several races across the country have gotten very interesting in the past couple weeks. Will the Republicans win a Senate seat in Washington state of all places? I think it's possible. Is Kathy Hochl really in trouble in New York? Yes. Will voters punish Gretchen Whitmer for her COVID lockdown insanity and finally give her the boot? I hope so. There's a lot to cover this election cycle and we've got you covered. Stu Berger, who kind of serves as Blaze Media's... I can't get this word right. Seetheologist? Seveologist. Doesn't sound right to me. Oh, God. Sephologist. It's a fancy word that means someone who studies elections. Wait, sea-fologist? Se-fologist? That doesn't seem right. We're opening up the comment section to doom today. Well, anyway, Steve put together a comprehensive list to let you know exactly what you need to look out for on election night. Head on over to the Blaze.com slash election guide to receive a free copy of Blaze Media's ultimate guide to the midterms delivered straight to your inbox. That's Blaze the Blaze.com slash election guide and we will send you everything you need to know to be ready for the big election night. And now back to me. I want to try to read that word one more time. I've got it right in front of me here. So if I have it right, and let me... Where's the word? Do I have it here? Sephologist. Does that sound right? Sephologist. That doesn't sound like a real word to me. Anyway, let's move on. We got a Ruben Report Locals Community Q&A. Pooria, if you want, if you're in the chat right now, you can still submit questions. Maybe we'll do some on the fly. That's Ruben Report.locals.com. Chris says, my husband who also happens to be gay. I see what you did there. And I have been married for a year and a half and together for eight. We've both been fairly sure we didn't want children, but I'm beginning to have thoughts about wanting to adopt. What changed your mind about fatherhood and what advice would you give a fellow gay couple? Well, look, I've told you guys many times and you can watch my interview from about three months ago with Jordan Peterson. We have some clips on this channel and the full things on Jordan's channel about how he really, when we were on tour, helped me move on children. David had wanted children for a while. David's a little younger than me. I grew up in a time in the 90s or 80s and 90s where there was no such thing as gay marriage. I never really thought of my future that way. I was putting everything I had into stand up and then what became this career. So I was just distracting myself all the time and it was just, I was just living my life kind of day to day to day. And I suppose in some ways that led to success, right? Because I put so much into it. But I never thought about that sort of long-term stuff. David, again, because he is a little bit younger, he grew up in a time where he knew he was going to get married one day. It didn't seem crazy to have a family and all that. So he wanted kids and we were married. And then I'm listening to Jordan talking about how most human beings, not everybody, but to live a fully actualized, complete life. That having kids and maybe eventually, if you're lucky enough, becoming a grandparent, it's so fundamentally part of the human story that most people need that to live that complete life. And I was hearing that and I'm hearing it from David. And then I just kind of moved on it. And I have to say, I'm at the ripe old age of 46 years old. I'm not the youngest parent in the stable, but actually my knee's been feeling pretty good lately. And I'm enjoying it. I've only posted pictures of the kids in the locals community. I'm not going to be putting it all over YouTube and Instagram and everything else. But I thought we'd just show you this quick 30-second video. This is what we did on Halloween just a couple of days ago. And I think you'll see why a parent is pretty good. All right, first Halloween. We just started trick-or-treating. Here's Justin, the skeleton. Very excited. Little on the chunky side for a skeleton, but still pretty good. There's Luke, a little more skeleton-y. And there's Daddy and Dad. Yeah, oh and Clyde and Clyde. Gressed up as Clyde. There you go. Happy Halloween. Yeah, we were out there with all the other families. And I got to tell you, even here in Florida, nobody was weird that there were two dads and anything. And think about it, if we didn't have kids and we were just two dudes out there pushing strollers with no kids in them, that would have been weird. That was funny, guys. Thank you, Connor. Get nothing out of these two. That was funny. You know what I mean? Just two dudes pushing strollers. Well, I guess it's Halloween. It would have been something there. Anyway, it's been a joy so far. I would say that if your husband is on the fence, you just got to keep talking about it. You got to talk it through. Maybe he won't get to the other side. But you got to talk about it. It's like, what is the point of being in a long-term monogamous, if you're in a monogamous relationship? Like, what is really the point? And I think the point is to build something that's everlasting, that you can then hand to the next generation and the next generation, we'll hand it to the next generation. And that is a little more complex when the biology doesn't fully match up. There are other issues related to that. This is exactly what I got into with Jordan Peterson. It's not just as easy as saying, okay, let's just create a family just like that and see how it goes. Like, you're changing the paradigm a little bit. You're changing what the traditional structure looks like. You're a little outside of that. It doesn't mean it can't be as good. It doesn't mean it can't be better. It doesn't mean that the traditional structure is always great. Plenty of people are born into all sorts of dysfunctional families. But you really got to think about it. Schmoo says, what kind of shenanigans do you think the lefty dems and establishment dems and rhinos will be up to for this midterm election next week? Same old, same old or something new and special? Well, I don't know if you saw it last night. I think we're going to show some clips of it tomorrow. Joe Biden gave a really crazy speech last night, warning people of the threats to democracy, and that the elections, some elections might take a few days to figure out who the winners are. This has been a trend that we've been seeing more and more and more, where people don't concede on election night. Things get dragged out further. It's like, this is why you need secure elections. This is why you need voter ID, because we need to know that night. We need to know that night. It basically is as simple as that. You cannot prolong these things and give more credence to the idea that there's shenanigans. Have people dropping things off in the middle of the night and then cameras go out. It's all the weird stuff that everybody, regardless of your political alignment, we're all kind of seeing and feeling. And this idea that that both sides suddenly are just never going to agree on who won or lost is a huge problem. Look, this year by every estimation, the Republicans are going to crush it. There is no momentum behind the Democrats, right? Even like, who's really a Biden supporter right now? Who really is out there at a rally excited for Biden? Who's out there excited for Charlie Christ? Who's out there excited for Kathy Hochle? Who's out there excited for more government control and more money? Now, I get it. A certain set of people, let's say 30% of the electorate is always going to vote blue, Democrat, no matter what. Maybe it's more than that. Maybe it's 40%. And then you have this other marginal 10% that can push them over or crush them. So there's a certain amount of NPCs and people that are just, you know, completely just duped by the system. But this year, it's like there is momentum what is happening in New York. The thing that started here in Florida has now been exported. And I'm telling you guys, if we can just get through Tuesday and Tuesday is good, look, will they directly answer your question? Will they likely start violence in the streets again if they feel like they're losing power and they need to just like distract the machine or the machine needs to distract the people? Yeah, they'll start some violence in the streets again. Will they claim? I mean, suddenly it will go that you weren't allowed to question elections for four years. And then suddenly they'll all be saying it, right? What's, what is Stacey Abrams who already denied an election last time? What's she doing right now? We played you the clip a couple of days ago. CNN is reporting record early voting turnout at the same time as she's saying there is going to be fraud. There's no evidence of it. Again, just you have to just, what do you see in front of your eyes? Where is the video of all of the black people being turned around? Where is any evidence that anyone that wants to vote cannot vote? They keep saying it. Hillary says she literally, she said she literally has evidence that the MAGA Republicans are going to steal the election. Well, okay, lady, how about you literally show it to me? How about that? Caesar says, what's your latest dad joke you've dropped on the people? Oh my God, well, you guys are bludgeoned with these things all day. I mean, my main dad joke is, you know, there's a lot of poop and pee around here and now we have kids. It's a lot. What else? That's really my main one. That's, I mean, I'm dropping that one two, four, seven times a day. It can be quite, yeah, Daphne's like ready to vomit right now. It's pretty bad. Delaney says, Dave, how conflicted are you with the possible 2024 presidential candidates? Well, look, if you're really asking about the Trump-Desantis situation, first off, let me say one more time. I've said it many times. I have no idea whether Ron DeSantis wants to run for president. I know the guy freaking loves Florida. I know that he is doing a bang up job here. I cannot imagine anyone being a better chief executive of the state. If you think about how quickly the reconstruction of Southwest Florida has gone after Hurricane Ian, I mean, just everything here has been run so well. The apparatus of the state is tight. It's exporting into the cities, guys like Francis Suarez, mayor of Miami who had on a couple of weeks ago. It's like, there is such a culture of freedom here and I'm meeting all sorts of people, all sorts of people who get it. Not only is it the new people who were here, but there were sort of like, half- kind of Democrats, half-republicans, or a lot of the people who came from New York even years ago before COVID who come down here and then they kind of both are the wrong way. They're waking up to it. So it's like, there's some goodness here, but I don't know, well, there's a ton of goodness here, but I don't know what DeSantis wants to do. Would he make an excellent president, obviously? And if there is a massive red wave, as I just said, it will be because it started here in Florida. Right? You guys saw that ad we showed you at the end of the show yesterday. It's like, well, that's the thing that we want to export to America. We want to export Floridian Americanism to America, if that makes sense. And I think we're doing it. But so if there is that red wave and it feels like, boy, the culture is shifting and the politics of all this is shifting and we've sort of defeated the woke at the ballot box in many ways and culturally, like people have had it with the eight month abortions, they've had it with chopping kids, generals off, they've just had it, right? Then it's like if DeSantis could then come in and just be like, hey, I'm the president for everybody. I'm going to do this in more of a Reagan-style way. There's going to be an aspirational meaning to my presidency and I'm going to be competent and all of those things. Look, will the media still try to destroy him? Of course. Of course. Of course. As I always keep saying, he'll be, they'll say he's Trump, but he's competent. So he's double Hitler, right? But there's a real argument that at that point, once the culture has shifted, once the politics game has shifted, that he's the most functional guy to go forward, I think you can make a good argument for Trump too. The good argument for Trump is he came in once, he shook this thing up more than anybody and he could do it again. And this time, hopefully, he would have learned from his mistakes. I think the counter to that in terms of just like the pure numbers of elections is how many new people could Trump bring in? There would be a certain amount of disaffected Democrats, a certain amount of people that are just like Biden's awful, the Democrats are awful, I guess I'll vote for Trump. But there's also, by Trump running, you basically get a certain amount of people who would not vote to vote just because they hate him. So it's a little more complex. I just think that's the reality. That being said, I like them both. I think they should do it on the DL, whatever that arrangement needs to be. But if they have to do it on stage and battle it out, it's like that's okay. That's what politics is all about. Galersh says, which would be easier opening a one time, oh, oh, oh, opening a time portal, Allah, a Avengers endgame to travel back in time to keep the second Star Wars series of movies from being made or getting the federal government to spend less than it takes in just for kicks to see what it feels like. Well, first off, I think by the second set of movies, I actually think you might be in the third set of movies, if you know my feelings on this, because the second set of movies, the prequels, as I've been saying for years, they're actually pretty good and they're looking better over time. If you're talking about these last three movies, which were horrible and ruined Star Wars and all of that stuff, then I went, yeah, which was the question, which would be more difficult, which would be more difficult to do, right? Or which would I rather do? Wait, I got it. I want to get this right. Which would be easier. I mean, getting the federal government to spend less money, it's impossible. I think it would be more worthy of getting out there finding some plutonium from Libyans, building a flux capacitor and getting into a time machine and doing that because the federal government is never going to get, it's never going to tighten, it's just not how it works. Next up, what do we have here? Elizabeth says, besides the freedom, what's your favorite part of living in Florida? Let me try to come up with a different one because okay, there's the spirit of freedom and then I always say it's like the people. They're people are just great. Everyone is just great here. People are happy and functional and decent and warm and nice and down here in Miami area. It's like there's so many cultures here and it's diversity not just because it matters that this guy happens to be Cuban and this guy's white and this guy's whatever but it's like just like all this different food and it's all good. What else is great? I mean, this is obvious. The weather, like right now, first off the summer wasn't bad. It really wasn't bad. My hair was a little lower. Now it's the fall so it's getting higher again because of the humidity. But the weather is great. You know what? The lizards. I like the lizards. I become a reptile guy. You know, there was always one kid in high school that had reptiles and you were like you got to stay away from that kid. Nobody you had, you know, because they were always up to something else. Probably not so great. I like reptiles. Okay. I like iguanas. I like frogs. I like lizards. I don't care what you think. There. There you go. Rebecca says, can the Republicans stand up and ask the Dems to pledge that they will accept the results of this election? We will win and they will try to overturn it. Yeah, you know, it's interesting and you're getting to something from the previous question. Look, look what happened right here in Florida during the Republican Senate debate. There's a woman by the name of Val Demings. I think she was a police chief in Orlando before this. If I'm not mistaken, she's running as the Democrat and she's running against Marco Rubio. Now there's every reason to believe that Rubio will win. He's generally liked here. The state's obviously going very red. He's associated with the scientists. So it's all looking good for Marco Rubio. But again, it's an election. You just never know what's gonna happen. At the debate, which was about a week and a half ago, the moderator asked the two of them, will you accept the results? And Rubio said, yes, we have secure elections here. He said, yeah, I'm going to win. But yeah, we have secure elections here. Of course, I'm going to respect it. Demings would not quite say that. Hillary Clinton running around saying she has evidence that they're planning to steal an election, except she won't show you the evidence. Stacey Abrams, the four years that all of these people pretended that Russia installed President Trump and there were 42 FBI CIA agents who had all signed on to say that something weird happened and a fake impeachment over the whole freaking thing. It's going to be tough. But again, this is why at the very least you would want voter ID. You would want a actual signature match, right? We'd want some cameras in some of these places. You'd want less mail-in ballots, but they want more mail-in ballots. It's like, you just got to see it, man. You just got to see it. Sweetwater says, did you have a hard time finding a home you both liked when you moved to Florida? So, you know, we moved. It's just under a year ago. We got to Florida on December 17th, 2021. A day I will never forget. As I've said to you guys, that moment when we were in the plane and the plane landed and I was lucky enough, we had we had friends who hooked us up and so we we were able to fly private because I really didn't want to put Clyde under the plane, you know, because every now and again, you hear these horror stories of dogs that are under the plane and the pressurized cabins and all sorts of bad stuff. So, we had friends that really helped us out. So, I was sitting in the cockpit of the plane when it landed and we were getting to the landing strip and I'm telling you that the wheels hit the ground. I felt something lift off my chest. I wanted to get out so badly. We were so excited to be here. So, we moved. We got here to December 17th. We found this house. It was Halloween weekend. So, it was literally a year ago right now. And we saw about 20 places. You know, the key thing is we wanted a house that would be functional to have my team working here. So, we needed a certain amount of space and we needed something. This room that we're doing this in that's our studio now actually was a movie theater. The guy who owned the house previously, it was a it was a bedroom that he converted to a movie theater. So, it was fully soundproofed. It worked for the lighting and all that stuff. That's why this all looks pretty good. And we didn't have to do a tremendous amount of work to expand on that. And yes, we saw about 20 places. This was the only house that we both we walked into this house and we were like, this is the house. This is the house. Also, they had in the house, we're not using it right now because of the kids, but they have this this scent stuff. What's that brand? You know what the brand is that has the sense that run through the house? You know, like when you go to a hotel or you go to a casino and you walk in and the air just has a certain scent to it. There's oh, I think it's called a Roma 360 is the company that does it. But we walk in this house and they just had this lovely scent going throughout the house. So, you can get different essential oils and put it in there. But we walked in. It's a beautiful house. Also, it was nice because the house is kind of a V. So, the the portion of the V that we're in right now is sort of our work portion. Although, my bedroom is right downstairs, the master bedroom, but it's a we got all the work stuff going on over here, all the life stuff going on over here. So, it worked out nicely. And we have kind of similar taste and everything. So, it wasn't it wasn't that big a lift. And there was a basketball court. So, I was pretty much willing to buy a site on scene. Roman says, did you find it amazing at how many celebrities don't appear to have eight dollars a month to pay for Twitter verification? So, if you have not seen this, as I always say, if you are not on Twitter, don't get on Twitter. But the big brew, however, the last couple of days, is that Elon Musk originally said that he was going to charge people $20 a month for the blue verification. That's just a little blue check next to your name. And he said that he wanted to charge people for it because it would be a way of generating revenue that then they could perhaps give to creators. Also, he's trying to get the company to be profitable. You know, that's what you do when you buy a company. Anyway, he got a little pushback on that. Then it they somehow came up with eight dollars a month. That's so for eight dollars a month, you could get a little blue check and then you might get some bonus features along with that. Like your notifications might be organized a little bit differently. You might show up and search a little bit more. Listen, I think there's all sorts of reasons that a sort of pay to play thing is not necessarily the best idea, especially when it comes to search and all that. That being said, I also think there's huge amounts of benefits to having a certain level of pay for play, which is exactly why we did locals the way we did. The fact that I only take questions right now from people who put in a couple dollars a month, it makes things more mature. It makes everyone's behavior better. When you have a little skin in it, you act a little bit differently. We don't allow for a million burner accounts. So anyway, I think having some level of subscription, some level of ads, you can figure out how to mix these things all together. And that's what a mature internet, maybe on the other side of all this craziness will look like. But yes, there was a huge amount of celebrities and journalists, etc. That were basically like, I'm never going to pay Elon Musk $8 for a blah, blah, blah. It's like, man, you pay eight bucks at Starbucks for a Venti, Kepicini, Makiyari thing with the ice there and the half of the things ice anyway. So yes, these people just, it's like, look, I would say one thing about the verification verification originally was set up, not as a moneymaker, but just to prove that you were who you were, right? Because there are people who impersonate me, steal my picture, pretend that they're me, they spell my name, one letter were offs, and then they confuse people. So the verification was just really so that, oh, if you saw Dave Rubin at Rubin Report, you knew it was the Dave Rubin. So the idea that you would start selling this so anyone could be verified, it changes a little bit of what verification is. And once everyone is sort of verified, then is anyone verified? That being said, he said that the other piece of this was that he wanted to get rid of bots and spam accounts, and it's like, bots are not going to pay $8 a month to be bots or whoever is sending those bots, right? That's not going to work for them. So yeah, these are all the things he has to work out. But watching people go crazy, $8 a month, I'm not going to. All right, come on. Lynn says, where are you having Thanksgiving dinner and what's on the menu? So Thanksgiving is the one major holiday that we host with David's family and his mom and grandma and sister and brother and sister-in-law and all sorts of people come. Do we have some pictures of some of the food? I am very fortunate to, that is last year's turkey, which, oh, mama me, I just perfect. We got some fresh cranberry sauce right there on its way to cranberry sauce. Looks like some sweet potatoes over there. What else do we got? Anything else? Anything else? Some butternut squash soup with a little chipotle pepper in there. Just absolutely perfect. So yeah, we do host that Thanksgiving here. This will be our first Thanksgiving in Florida, obviously. No. Yeah, no, it will be our first Thanksgiving in Florida, and we are very thankful for Florida. So it should be a good one. I just love Thanksgiving. Just having one day where it's a holiday that's a purely secular American holiday. It's a celebration of America. Nothing else. Just hey, it's pretty freaking good here. Be thankful for it. One of the things that I always think is interesting about Thanksgiving is when you see the reaction online of certain people, because the lefties, unfortunately, and the Wokesters, they're always attacking Thanksgiving now. They're not thankful for anything. And I think a little thankfulness, a little humility, a little understanding of why you should be so freaking thankful to live in this country. It's pretty good. It's pretty good. Talwe says, now that you're a dad, do you think you view the world, the culture wars, and the political world, any differently than you did before you're a dad? Well, it's not differently, but I think it's kind of renewed or doubled down. Like, I really got to make sure that the world is in good shape when I'm gone, right? Because now I have kids that it is my responsibility and my duty to make sure that they live in the best world possible. Another part of just sort of this isn't exactly to what your question was, but I think I said something like this a couple weeks ago. Another part of this whole experience of journey that we're just at the beginning of that's been really nice is so much of my life is about me, right? Like, I do this show. People, I go places, people say hi to me. I am invited places so that I can speak. It's a lot of, it's a lot of me. And that's great in one way and very rewarding and validating that I've done something, I guess, pretty decent here. And that what I'm saying and what I care about actually matters. That's actually really wonderful. But it can be a little maddening too, right? I think that's why so many celebrities go nuts. It's why comedians go crazy. It's why, you know, public people do drugs and like lose their shit. Like, I think there's some connection there between like the endless ego part of it. So, you know, just laying there this morning. Again, this morning I'm up at 715. I'm taking, I take the kids for the first hour and it's just me. Luke was pretty much out this morning, but Justin is up. He's, you know, he's rolling into month three now and he's not talking, but he's making a lot of sounds now. He's trying to talk like there's something going on there and he's smiling at me and I tell him a little bit. I was at the same time I was emailing with Phoenix going back and forth on how we're going to do the show and I just kind of read it to Justin. So, what do you think about this? What do you think? I'm going to do this Joe Biden thing. You think? And it's like, it's been good. It's been good. Kate says, will you be doing any live streaming on election night? Well, I guess we can tell people our election plans. So, on election night, so on election day, which is next Tuesday, I'll be doing a show here and then we are hopping in a car and we are going cross state up north to northwest Florida, which is where Tampa is and that is where the DeSantis campaign will be having their obvious victory event victory party that night. So, I and Lisa Booth from Fox News, you guys know Lisa Booth. We are co-hosting the DeSantis victory party. So, that's going to be awesome. We'll be on and off stage all night. We'll be announcing results as they come in. Just going to be a fun celebration of freedom and America and all that. And I will also do a show from there. So, a little bit of that we have to do on the fly, but we will do a show at some point throughout the evening. Hopefully, I can get Governor DeSantis to join me and there's obviously campaign surrogates and some of my Florida crew that you guys know will be there. So, we're going to do it a bit on the fly. So, I don't know exactly what time it is because I'm also going to have to jump off and be on stage and do the show and all that. And then we're also going to try to simulcast some of that with the guys at the Blaze, Glenn and the whole crew over there who I love. They wanted me to go to Dallas for election night, which I thought would be great and we could do five hours of coverage together. It would be fun and awesome. But obviously, once I got the invite from the governor, I was going to do that. So, yes, party that night, live stream and just bear with us. We'll figure it out, but it is definitely going to be a celebration of freedom that night. Lloyd says, as we tape the last of our seeming 17,000 boxes for our escape from Crazy Cali to Idaho, congratulations. My wife says we have a lot of stuff, not stuff, but a lifetime of memories. When you moved, did you downsize it all? Has it all fit into the new studio, house and studio? Well, first off, congratulations on getting out and I'm sure you're going to love it in Idaho and it's good to get out of Cali. Cali is the most sort of banged up state that we've got. They have made their choice with Gavin Newsom. He's about to be reelected again. There's just no doubt about it. It's a far gone conclusion. New York has a chance. Actually, polls the last two days are showing Lee's Elden in the lead. And as I keep saying about Hochill, nobody voted for her. She was installed, so she loses a little bit of that incumbents. You know, incumbents usually win because people are sort of mindless when they go in and they just click things. Oh, I recognize that name, but nobody's ever clicked Kathy Hochill before. Nobody's ever ticked that, swiped it, checked it, whatever you want to say. So I think Zelda really has a chance. So congratulations, first off on leaving California. It's wonderful. You're going to live in a new place with new people and you're going to flourish and thrive. There's just no doubt about it. And I can tell you that because not only has that worked for me and everybody that's in that studio with me right now that we've all built better lives once we left, but then you start meeting other people that left. And when you're suddenly around some people who leave for a reason, you find common cause in sustaining the thing that you came to. And that is a beautiful thing. That is a really, really beautiful thing. I think it's one of the reasons that Florida is going so red because people are like, yes, I am going to save this freaking thing because you guys saved me. So the question was about memories and all the stuff that we had. You know, we gave away a whole bunch of stuff. Actually, I gave away, we had a whole bunch of outdoor furniture that we had just got in Cali, but I couldn't move everything. We had two trucks gone and it was just starting to get nuts. So I gave a whole bunch of our outdoor furniture to Patricia Heaton. You may remember Patricia Heaton as the wife and everybody loves Raymond. Her and her husband Dave became good friends of ours and they were having, we had a final dinner in Los Angeles, I think two nights before we left with Dennis Prager and his wife Sue and Larry Elder and his girlfriend and Dave and Patricia came by and I was like, hey, you guys want some stuff? So we just started giving some stuff away. But yeah, I gave some clothes away and stuff like that. Fortunately, we've got some, it's a pretty decent sized house here. We've got some storage. So we're still not unpacked. One day we'll get unpacked, I suppose, right before we move again. Jeb says, Dave, you keep asking everyone what their election predictions are, but what are your election predictions? You know, I wrote out a map that they're going to debut on election night for the blaze. But look, I really think Seldin is going to win in New York. That's the that's the one that I think is the big one. Okay. Obviously, Florida will remain red. I think Oz has got to win Pennsylvania. It is almost beyond imagination that Federman could win. Okay. So I think Oz will win there. I do think Lake Masters is going to win in Arizona as well as Carrie Lake. Like, I really think the Senate, it could be end up 54 Republicans. I know that's bullish. And you know, I know we're all in our own little bubbles and all that stuff. But I just think people have had it with the woke. There are no rallies for Democrats. Everyone knows, even the most ardent Biden supporter knows that something is not right with Joe Biden. Like, there's no momentum there. They're prepping us for no momentum. And the ideas were bad. All they had to do was not be horrible. What do you show me here? Real clear politics is now predicting that New Hampshire will even get a Republican senator. So there is real, real momentum here. And again, I just think, you know, it's funny, while the meme out there, if you listen to mainstream media will be, if the Republicans take over, we'll have fascism and homophobia and bigotry and all of these things, it's like, how about we just end up like Florida is? What if Florida just exported Americanism, right? And what if people just started living their lives more the way they wished? You know, like, I don't see any bigotry down here. It's odd. I certainly don't see fascism. I see a government that kind of gets out of your way. And then, you know, what happens when a massive basically category five storm crushes part of the state within two, three weeks, almost all the infrastructure is rebuilt that we do everything we can, the government, when necessary comes in and does the right thing. That's what we can get back to. And I think if we export that, if we export that, the woke thing, it could go away pretty quickly. As I said, it's not going to fully go away. And there'll always be a set of anti-American, hysterical lunatics. But if a couple of the states flip and the Senate goes back and we stop spending money like crazy people, and we honestly start having some of these debates again and we get leaders in who are functional and decent, we could really get back to the dream of the 90s. We really could. It was the dream of the 1890s and the 1990s, actually. Guys, stick around for the cold. Close, as always, if you want to play along during our Q&As and live chat during any of the shows, you can join us at RubenReport.locals.com. We've got a panel for you tomorrow. It's our final panel before the big election. Michael Malice, we haven't had Malice on in a while. I'm psyched for that. Lawyer Ron Coleman, we're going to talk a little bit about, you know, the government and Twitter and big tech coordinating to clamp down on your free speech. What is your ability to get penalties from them, get money from them, sue the government, et cetera? And then Viva Fry, who also is a lawyer, former Canadian, now proud Floridian. So it'll be Malice Coleman and Fry tomorrow. And Viva was just suspended on Twitter this week, post-Elon. So we're going to have to talk about that. He had a theory about Nancy Pelosi that I guess the powers that B didn't really like. And we leave you as we brought you in with the elderly man pretending to be president. See you tomorrow. I just have one thing to say. Hang on here. All right. There you go. Come on. I'll tell you what, if I had to tell them any one of these people, I'd be I'd be elected president by acclamation.
