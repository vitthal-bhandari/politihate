Target and Starbucks push the transgender and that at ceiling inches ever closer. I'm Ben Shapiro, this is The Ben Shapiro Show. This episode is brought to you by Good Ranchers. Fire up the grill on Memorial Day with GoodRanchers.com and use my code BEND for up to 25% off. That's GoodRanchers.com from what code BEND today. Leave us alone. Leave us alone. We want privacy. We want privacy. Okay, so as it turns out, South Park was right yet again, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, it is astonishing how they chase after cameras while claiming that they are attempting to run away from cameras. The latest iteration of this story is that Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are now claiming that they were involved in a near-fatal paparazzi chase in New York City. Now, this is all part and parcel of the broader narrative that has been presented by Prince Harry and Meghan Markle. Prince Harry says that he is able to be sort of in a bimbo idiot near to well, who abandons all family loyalty because the paparazzi killed Princess Di. If you read his memoir, this is his claim is that Princess Di didn't actually, she wasn't killed by the driver of the limousine in which she was riding, who was traveling at a high rate of speed through a tunnel. No, what would actually happen is that the paparazzi caused his mom to be killed and he himself has been victimized by the paparazzi and his whole life is about how the paparazzi victimized him. Meanwhile, Meghan Markle has been cosplaying as Princess Diana in a wide variety of settings. She's wearing outfits that are extremely similar to Princess Diana at the end of Prince Harry's book. She goes to Princess Diana's grave. It's all very strange. Well, now they're taking this to the next step because they've decided that the only way that they can be perceived is victims because they are not victims. They are in fact some of the least victimized people on planet Earth. This is just one aspect of being a prince and then of being a second-rate actress who marries a prince and becomes a princess and then living in California where you make ridiculously narcissistic documentaries about yourself and then get paid by Netflix to do so. Well, now they have to regain victimhood status and attention. And the only way really to do that is to claim that they are being brutally victimized by a way for it, wait for it, wait for it, the paparazzi. So according to page six, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are quote, extremely upset and shaken after being involved in a near catastrophic two-hour paparazzi chase in New York City on Tuesday night. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex were traveling with Markle's mom, Doria Raglin, were pursued by photographers after leaving the Zigfeld Theater where the former actress was honored by Gloria Steinem at the Women of Vision Awards in Manhattan, which sounds absolutely insufferable. An event with both Meghan Markle and Gloria Steinem, wow, I need that like a fish needs a bicycle. The trio left the event in an SUV around 10 p.m. They were immediately followed by around 12 paparazzi, according to page six. This is what they were told. Eventually decided to ditch their original vehicle and jump into a yellow cab in the hopes of evading photographers according to a source. Okay, so first of all, okay, as a person who travels with security nearly all of the time, let me tell you a thing we have never done. A thing we have never done is get from a secured vehicle into a yellow cab to evade photographers. That's stupid, like unbelievably stupid. First of all, you're in the car. So if somebody is trying to photograph you and you're in a car, typically these cars have shaded windows. So what? We're gonna get a picture of the car or picture of you getting out of the car and going back to your hotel. Okay, like where were you planning to go? And I'm sorry for the whole singing in the rain bit where you're like running from car to car across the tops of buses and stuff, but I don't believe you. The insider alleges that one camera and hit a car while another almost ran over at NYPD officer during the near fatal chase. So basically this is now a something out directly out of the movies. It started off with 12 paparazzi and ended up with four chasing Megan Harry and Doria. The insider tells us the insider suspiciously sounded a lot like Megan Markle. The security tried their best to lose photographers once in the taxi. Harry used his cell phones record the ensuing melee. We're told security was also recording together evidence. Paparazzi were confronted by uniform police officers but ignored warnings and continued chasing the trio. We hear a rep for the Sussex claim to page 61. Say last night the Duke and Duchess of Sussex and Miss Ragland were involved in a near catastrophic car chase at the hands of a ring of highly aggressive paparazzi. This relentless pursuit lasting over two hours. So first of all two hour pursuit. How long was OJ's chase with the LAPD? I don't think it was two hours two hours in New York. First of all, you can't drive more than five feet in New York without hitting a red light or traffic. So I'm confused. How high speed was this chase precisely? Have you been to New York? Like where are they going? Eight miles an hour and then stopping dead and bang your head against the back of this relentless pursuit lasting over two hours and apparently involving Jack Bower resulted in multiple near collisions involving other drivers on the road pedestrians and two NYPD officers. While being a public figure comes to the level of interest from the public it should never come at the cost of anyone's safety. One source calls the incident incident absolutely shocking and says Ragland who's 66 years old was particularly terrified by the ordeal. Everyone is still upset to say at least it was horrific. The source tells us. Wow, just just wow. Well, now questions have emerged. By the way, this is happening right as the Duke of Sussex police bodyguards were moved after he stopped being a working royal in 2020. And now they are attempting to get the royals to pay for their security again. So this is all part and parcel of a broader attempt to get other people to pay their bills apparently. So there are now pretty open and obvious questions about this like did it happen and why would anyone believe them? We'll get to those questions in just one moment first. Memorial Day is coming up. It's a time to honor and remember our brave servicemen and women made the ultimate sacrifice for freedom. It's also a time when we typically come together as a nation, gather with loved ones and enjoy some barbecue. What better way to do that than with premium 100% American meat from good ranchers?

Good ranchers is indeed American meat delivered. Okay. So now questions have begun stacking up. Uh oh, uh oh, the NYPD who assisted Prince Harry and Mark with transportation according to Fox News shared their account with Fox News Digital. The renumer's photographers that made their transport challenging said Julian Phillips, a deputy commissioner of public information. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex arrived at their destination. There are no reported collisions, summonses, injuries or arrests in regard. So we had heard that somebody hit a car. Right. And also that they almost hit like an NYPD officer. The NYPD is looking through traffic, camera footage and security footage to piece together what transpired. Apparently there is a video that shows the chaotic scene, the night of Harry and Markle's alleged chase, but it doesn't show any near collisions. At the time of publication, no footage of the alleged car chase hadn't made available. In fact, they went and they interviewed the cab driver, a person named Suk Charn Singh, who told the AP he instantly recognized his passengers. They were following us the whole time he said of the paparazzi, but he said he wouldn't call it a chase. Sing the cab drivers on 67th near an NYPD precinct when a security guard waved him down. Sing pulled the yellow taxi to the carbon, in came Harry, Megan and her mom. Now again, I understand the strategy here. I really don't understand the strategy. So security got them out of a secure vehicle, put them on the street, and then weaved down a passing cab. They had this look on their faces. He said they were about to give their destination when a garbage truck blocked their path. All of a sudden paparazzi came out and started taking pictures, he said. One of the royals told them to circle back to the precinct. They didn't say much, sing said. They asked my name, and then after that, Harry said thanks and have a good day. They paid $17 in fare and they gave a $50 chip, which is nice. So apparently he just kind of went around the block, but that doesn't sound like a two-hour near catastrophic chase involving the paparazzi. According to Royal Watch or Omid Scobie, the paparazzi were confronted by police multiple times they chased the Royal couple who were on their way to a private residence where they were staying. Scobie alleged on Twitter, the photographers drove on a sidewalk, ran through red lights, reversed down on one way street, photographed a couple while driving and illegally blocked a moving vehicle. The mayor was like, he said, the mayor said, I find it hard to believe there was a two-hour high-speed chase, but we'll find out the exact duration of it. If it's 10 minutes, 10 minutes, Chase is extremely dangerous in New York City. So yeah, man, again, the cabbie told the post that he said it seemed like it wasn't scary. He said it was a little crazy they were trying at home, but the kind of notion, he said, he also added, I never felt like I was in danger. It wasn't like a car chase in a movie. They're quiet and seem scared, but it's New York, it's safe. And now the reason all of this is important is because again, claims of victimhood in American society are the new currency of the realm. The way that you get attention is by claiming that you are a victim. And I've noticed there are a lot more pictures of Harry and Meghan in the papers than there have been any time recently. This also changes the narrative from the coronation, where Harry was kind of sidelined. It also allows for the media to do its job and talk about how American society is actually super duper racist CNN correspondent, Salma Abdulaziz, and was talking about Meghan Markle and saying it's actually racist, it's racist to talk about Megxit, right, which is a pun on Brexit because Meghan Markle leaving for a mechs it. But that's racist, apparently. Again, I just have to emphasize how huge that exit was and how much it was criticized by the press here in the UK, some calling it Megxit that was seen as a very racist and sexist way to characterize that exit, pinning it just on Meghan rather than Prince Harry. There was a strong sense among communities of color here that she was being treated poorly by the press because of her racial background. And it's all about it's all about victimhood. It's all about victimhood. Our society has now decided that because victimhood is the currency of the realm, well, you can make a buck off of it. If there's a market, then there is someone to fill that market, right? If there is a desire for victimhood, a victimhood narrative, there is somebody who is going to capitalize on that. And this is where corporate America comes in. So pride month is coming up. Now, I know what you're thinking. You're thinking, wait a second. It didn't already happen. Hasn't been like pride several years. Every other day is like lesbian visibility day or transgender awareness day or transgender lesbian visibility and awareness day. Or as the State Department put it yesterday, the International Day Against Homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia and Transphobia. Wow, that's a lot of phobias. Also, Arachnophobia, the Secretary of State, Anthony Blinken, he actually put out a statement on this yesterday, quote, on International Day with the most hideous flag of all time. This is the Pride Progress flag, which just is bizarre, but it's like a now vertical Pride Progress flag. So it's not like the typical rainbow flag, which was the Pride flag. Then they added in all of the trans and bipoc flags. And then they added in the intersex flag. And so now it just looks like vomit. So Secretary Blinken said, on International Day against homophobia, Biphobia, which I mean, I suppose that you're afraid of bisexuals, not you're not just afraid of homosexuals now. Now you're afraid of also bisexuals, Interphobia. So you're afraid of intersex people and transphobia. So you're afraid of everyone, apparently. You're apparently afraid of like all humans who are in any way not straight. That's the only justification for thinking that, for example, boys can't be girls, girls can't be boys, or believing that not all forms of sexual activity are completely morally equivalent. This is an international day against homophobia, Biphobia, Interphobia, transphobia, and Arachnophobia. We call for an end to harmful conversion therapy practices, including those that attempt to change a person's sexual orientation, gender identity, or expression, or sex characteristics. Now, by the way, think about how Orwellian and Perverse, this is again, this is the panoply of victimhood. This is the flag of victimhood. It's getting really, really crowded as you may have noticed this flag of victimhood. Woo, super crowded. Well, one of the most Orwellian things about this is suggesting that is conversion therapy to say that a boy is a boy. That's now conversion therapy. So traditionally, what people meant by conversion therapy was there was a kid who's having gay feelings and then they hooked him up to electrodes and showed him gay porn or something and then electrified him, right? Like tortured the kid. That's what people think of when they think conversion therapy, not like just normal talk therapy or certainly not. A boy comes in, expresses gender confusion, you say, well, actually you're a boy and we probably should talk about this. No, now it's conversion therapy to tell a boy that he's a boy. It is non-conversion therapy to chop off his and add a couple of breasts. That right there, that would not be conversion therapy. That's gender affirming care. All of the Orwellian nonsense. But again, this is so we can claim that society is victimizing people. It's all about society victimizing people because of their inherent status. Because if you're a transgender person, this means that this is an inheritance, it is not you choosing to believe a thing about the world that is not true and then enact mutilation to your body in order to prove it. In many cases, no, no, no, that is that right there is discrimination by society. We have to go further and further. So if there's a market for discrimination, there are corporate interests who will fill it and they will all get together in a room somewhere and they will all decide that if they move together in lockstep, then none of them is vulnerable. There are safety in corporate numbers. We have an overwhelming tsunami of left-wing social nonsense that is coming down the pipe. You have the State Department tweeting out the Pride Progress flag and then plunking a Pride Progress flag just outside the Vatican because this is our Chief Export. Now it used to be that America's Chief Export was Hollywood and Hollywood was an expression of American culture, which was all about, you know, kind of freedom and American can-doism and the American flag and all the rest of the stuff. This was our Chief Export in America to the rest of the world in the 1940s and 50s meant cars, Coca-Cola, the American flag, apple pie, freedom. Now that is typically the takeaway the rest of the world got from Hollywood. Now what the rest of the world gets is boys can be girls, girls can be boys. And if you don't agree with that, you are some form of bigot. And this is now happening across corporate America. It's being promoted by medical authorities who are lying to our children. The American Academy of Pediatrics, which has nothing to do with pediatrics anymore and has everything to do with woke politics, has now issued a guide to puberty. It is called eulogy, a puberty guide for everybody. And this particular book, again, issued by the American Academy of Pediatrics literally has a section in which they explain that certain people are assigned female at birth. And even though they actually are female, that means that they could still be a boy. Quote, that's why you may have known him in the past as Olivia. David continues, but Oliver is a boy. So that means he's transgender. He belongs in the boys locker room as much as any of us do. It's okay, said David. Now you know, and in general, not everyone who comes into the boys locker room will have the same types of body parts. And that's normal. Ah, that's normal. Again, this is the American Academy of Pediatrics writing and indoctrinating books for children about why boys can be girls. Chapter three, body parts smart. Here's the deal. When someone looks at a baby's genitals and says it's a girl or it's a boy, that's called their sex assigned at birth because well, it is assigned at birth. Makes sense. If a baby is born with a penis, their sex assigned at birth is male. If a baby is born with a vulva, their sex assigned at birth is female. But there are some babies born with a penis who grew up feeling like a girl on the inside. That's called being transgender. So instead of saying she, as we have a new for kids born with a vulva, we say he because that's who this person truly is on the inside. This is the crap that they are teaching your children. This is the crap that the American Academy of Pediatrics, a supposed medical institution is teaching kids. And so this has been picked again. The market has been created by the medical community, which is entirely woke and by governmental bodies. And once that market has been created, corporate America moves to fill it. Now corporate America is relying on one simple thing. Well, too, corporate America is rolling on two simple things. Simple thing number one, in unity, there is strength. So if they all say the same thing, then you can't do anything about it. If they all push forward with a wall of sound, an unbroken wall of sound, then that means you're just going to have to accept it. Because if everywhere you shop is doing pride month, then how exactly are you going to not shop somewhere during pride month? You're just going to have to ingest the rainbow cereal along with the rest of it. Okay, so unity in corporate wokeness is principle number one. And principle number two is you won't get that offended. Because the reality is Harvard Business School studies about this. The left is significantly more annoying than the right is typically speaking. When it comes to their consumption of products, or this has been true at least here to four is a study from Harvard Business School that I've talked about on the show before. This study found that if you take a neutral corporation, a corporation that has no politics, and you have a right when corporation, a left incorporation that the left to incorporation is viewed somewhat positively by the left. The neutral corporation is also viewed somewhat positively by the left because they assume that it's just a left to incorporation. A right when corporation loses 20 to 30 points in approval rating just for not being a left to incorporation. For the right, however, the right doesn't have significant feelings about this one way or another. The right typically will just shop wherever it wants to shop. So corporate America has relied on this. Corporate America has relied on your apathy and my apathy. And the fact that we're like, listen, man, I still got to go to Target. That's what they have relied on. But here's the thing. Alternatives are now available. The entire goal of things like Pride Month, the entire goal of a wave of corporate propaganda on behalf of the Pride Progress flag, on behalf of propagandistic nonsense about the moral equivalents of all sexual activity and orientation, the beauty of all forms of sexual Congress. The idea that boys can be girls, girls can be boys. This entire moral program that is being pushed by the woke relies on one, their unity, and to your apathy. But you don't actually have to do that. You actually have to do that. So what we are about to see during Pride, and we're already seeing it, is again, corporate woke unity in the, in the assumption that you will remain apathetic, no matter how woke and crazy they get. So for example, Target, right, major corporation relies on your shopping. They have decided that it's time to sell products that trans is the kids. This is a TikTok video that's been going viral showing that there are bathing suits in the kids section with tuck options. So your little boy, you're trying to trans, you can get him a girls bathing suit that allows him to take his penis and testicles and tuck them up under himself. Isn't that nice? Really great, great job here, Target. I'm sorry I chose you again. I just needed to do the bathing suit the last bit. I found the tuck bathing suits, the tuck friendly bathing suits. So if you need a women's bathing suit and you have a little extra meat down there that you got to hide, you have one option. That is the only bathing suit that I found in the entire store. And it's in the Pride section. It's not in the kids section, women's section, boy is section, baby section. It is in the Pride section. It was the only one I could find. And I did have another adult with me checking all the tags so that I didn't have to stay in the store for nine hours. That's the only one. Well, isn't that sad? It's the only one they could find. But Target is in fact stacked up with Pride Progress gear that is geared toward children. They have a baby gear that is geared toward gay pride and trans pride. Like for small babies, for like kids who can't walk yet. And Target believes that you won't do anything about it. That's why they're doing it. They believe that they will gain the upside of left being super enthusiastic about them. And there is no downside because the right will just go silent. The right won't pay any attention to it. And it's not just Target. And it's not just domestically. It's a Starbucks in just one second first.

It's also apparently Starbucks and it's Starbucks internationally. So Starbucks has now put out an ad for India. Now India as you may know is pretty socially conservative country. When I say that the chief export of the United States is now wokeness, I mean it. It is now wokeness because it's embedded in all of our corporate product. Starbucks is present nearly every place on the globe and they feel the necessity to lecture people of India about why boys can be girls and girls can be boys and parents need to be tolerant and accepting of their boy pretending that he's a girl. So here's an ad from Starbucks directed at the Indian market. By the way, this actually has not just ramifications for the domestic morality of the United States, of course. It also has ramifications for our foreign policy. You know, it is one thing that people across the world are not interested in the importation of this sort of crap. They're just not interested in it. I remember I was speaking actually is interesting conversation. I was speaking with a very high ranking member of the Pakistani foreign policy establishment at one point. And this person and I were talking and one of the things this person was saying is, listen, we have some commonalities of interest with the United States, there are areas of crossover, but there's one thing we are not interested in whatsoever. And that is your social morality. We think that your social morality is garbage. We think that you are attempting to corrupt our children. We think that you are attempting to import your libertarianism and gender confusion into our country. And so we don't want any part of that. So if your offer is blue jeans, but also transness, not interested, we'll make our own jeans, we'll import it from somewhere else. But that is not just members of the Pakistani foreign policy establishment. That's pretty much everywhere. It turns out there's a very small slice of the human population. And so weird slice of the human population that is very into this stuff. And now wishes to proselytize on its behalf. But if you wish to, it makes it harder for us to form alliances with countries based on commonality of interest. Because what they say is, if we let you in the front door, we're very concerned with what you are going to bring in with you. Again, the export in 1950s America, 1940s America, 1930s America, the export was we're going to bring American military power. We're going to establish your freedom. And we are not going to threaten your baseline level of morality. Because you know, we still believe and we still believe in like monogamous nuclear families, like the things that are the most threatening like rock and roll. That was like the big threat in the 1950s and 60s. We might bring rock and roll to your shores. And that was going to corrupt the youth. Now the big threat is we might come in and tell your son that he should cut off his penis. Well, that's that's a pretty big threat as it turns out. So it actually has ramifications for how we do foreign policy, because who wants to ally with the country that says the condition of us allying with you Saudi Arabia, the condition of us making an alliance with you, Hungary, the condition of us forming a more solid relationship with you, India, is that you fly the pride progress for a flag and also pretend that your son is a daughter. Here's the Starbucks India, India commercial. It says calling our paid is it an older gentleman calling his son on his phone. And the mom is looking at him skeptically. And she says, listen, don't get angry this time, please. They're in Starbucks. And he's he's starting to set and here comes the oh, look, our pit's a girl, but our pit is in a girl. I know, but thanks for meeting me, dad. I know it's been years. But you still mean the world to me. Oh, dad's going to give a warm hug to his coffee. Oh, they're going to get coffee together. And then mom is so accepting now dad's accepting all because of Starbucks's coffee. Oh, the little burn coffee makes you your habits haven't changed, says the dad. Three cold coffees for our pita. And it's for our pita, not our pit. Our pita. And he ordered it because he's accepting her name, guys. Oh, so and that guitar me is going to, for me, you are still my kid. Only a letter has got added to your name. It doesn't say the part where the **** got subtracted. Oh, and the singing now, like Sarah Kamarwaflin, Indian style over here. It starts with our pit, our pita hashtag. It starts with your name. So Starbucks is now exporting the transness to India. Hey, so again, all of this relies, as I said before on two things, unity of corporate wokeness and your apathy. All right. Again, another example, unity of corporate wokeness, Adidas, has now decided that the best way to sell female swimsuits is to put a dude in them. Yes, ladies, but I will never understand how women are not more insulted by this than men are. Men are insulted by this because we just think it's ridiculous. It's absolutely absurd. Men are not women. Women are not men. We all get it. Women are, I will never understand how a woman is not insulted by a man wearing a woman's bathing suit and pretending to be female. I just, it will never cease to amaze me. We are a culture that says that that cultural appropriation is in and of itself bad, right? You're not allowed to wear a garment that is another culture's garment. We're not allowed to do that, but you're allowed to literally appropriate another sex. And everybody goes, Oh, yeah. So here is Adidas. Adidas. Now, I have a question. How much of the market is this? How much of the Adidas market for bathing suits is men who want to wear one piece swimsuits that show off the crotch bulge? How many? I'm going to go like there are seven people. That's not a huge population. But again, they're relying on the idea of the virtue signal to the left. The left will be super enthusiastic about Adidas. And they're relying on you not to stop shopping at Adidas because hey, you got to buy a bathing suit somewhere. Here is the Adidas ad for a male in a female swimsuit. It says love unity on the swimsuit. And this is a man. And you can tell this is a man by all literally all available evidence. Up to and including the obvious and clear biology of this person, the male shoulder physique, the crotch bulge, the whole thing. This is clearly a dude. And this is a dude wearing a lady swimsuit and then sashang around. And Adidas is pushing that. Well, here's the thing. Here's the thing that people ought to remember. One, the corporate woke unity monolith is fake. It's not real. It's not real. They have this tenuous agreement that they will all go woke in orders that you will just give in an acquiesce. You'll have a feeling there's a tsunami that every place you go during June is going to be covered with pride, progress, flags and gay pride flags and trans the kids onesies and all the rest of it. And so you go, Oh God, I can't even deal with this fine. I'll just buy whatever. Listen, I got to go shopping. This is what they are counting on. But here's the thing. It's way weaker than it looks way weaker than it looks. And so the right has to make a point of picking a few targets. You can't do it to everybody picking a few targets and then destroying their stock, picking a few targets and then actively not buying from those targets and making clear why you are not buying from those targets. You can't be everyone. And then people say, Oh, why, why are you signaling a singling out this company? Well, the answer is because we can do all of them. So we will single out a few of them and we'll make examples of them. And we should make examples of them because when you make examples of them, the rest of you will learn not to insult your customer core and not to mimic the worst excesses of the LGBTQ plus minus divided by sign movement that insists on the proselytization of a peculiarly strange ideology claiming moral equivalence and all sexual activity and that boys can be girls and girls can be boys. You don't have to stand up to every single company. You have to stand for a few and you have to show them that there is a downside to this. And by the way, it works. So Bud Light is a great example of this. Bud Light has taken it absolutely on the chin ever since they hired Dylan Mulvaney to be a spokesperson for Bud Light pretending that the best spokesperson for Bud Light would be a gay man, a flamboyantly gay man pretending that he is a woman. Their sales have been down like 20%. In fact, it's been so bad that Bud Light is now attempting to buy it back. It's not going to work, by the way. So Bud Light actually put out a new bottle. They're attempting to, again, buy this thing back. The way they think they're going to buy this back is by putting out a new bottle that essentially starts camouflage. So they put three bottles side by side for Memorial Day. And the idea here is going to be that you are going to forget that they actually attempted to hire Dylan Mulvaney. The brand has seen a 24% drop in sales versus last year in the week ending May 6th. The new bottle is a freedom bottle covered in camouflage. This is because of the brave. Okay, but you know what, you're not, you're not, we all see what you're doing, guys. We can all see what you're doing. It is very clear what you are doing. And by the way, the Adidas ad campaign, this would be a great place to start. Like you don't need to buy from Adidas. There are plenty of other companies. And I understand a lot of these companies are bad. I understand that Nike is doing business with China and that there is woke as hell. I understand all that. But it's not about who you buy from, it's who you won't buy from that actually makes a difference to these companies. Adidas issued a press release in partnership with the trans organization, athlete ally regarding the new women's wear campaign. Quote, our goal is to drive inclusivity and sport, supporting student athletes from the LGBTQI plus and their allies to push for fair access and safe participation in sport. So they're actively pushing for boys to compete with girls. Adidas, that seems like a pretty easy win. So maybe, you know, you're buying some shoes for your kids. Don't buy Adidas. How about that? Just buy from someplace else and make clear that you're buying from not Adidas. Doesn't matter where else you buy from. Sure, those other companies may be just as bad, just like a lot of people bought Miller Lite instead of Bud Light and Miller Lite may be just as woke. But by making a point that you are not buying from Bud Light because of the wokeness, you hurt Bud Light and you are more likely to push people, other people off the point. Here's the thing. All these companies are vulnerable. We are entering a recessionary period. Target is about to experience some serious economic pain anyway. They're attempting to enter into sort of the low cost arena target. They're attempting to enter the low cost arena because people are spending less money. They're attempting to compete with Walmart. There's an entire article today in the Wall Street Journal about target trying to sell affordable joy as consumers pull back, which means that profit margins are down. The profit margins, by the way, these stores are never that high. It's like two, three, four percent maximum. So you can put a serious dent in their profit margin simply by shifting your shopping over to Walmart. And you may say again, well, is Walmart any better? I don't know the Walmart's any better, but I do know that you can say that target is not some place that you want to shop if they're going to do this sort of nonsense. And it does have an impact, even if it's a small impact and an incremental impact. So the latest example of that, we'll get to in just one moment first.

So when there is a pushback against woke culture, woke culture actually backs down. So for example, even in small ways, the LA Dodgers have decided not to give a community hero award to an anti-Catholic drag group after outrage and pushback from Catholics. So the Dodgers had originally planned to present the awards to the LA chapter of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, an organization of men who dress in drag, queen versions of Catholic religious habits and claim to have a ministry according to their website. So the Dodgers actually put out a statement. They said that they still have their Pride Night celebration, because very important that we have a night celebrating people taking pride in their, in their sexual activity. The LA Dodgers put out this statement in the spirit of unity. The LA Dodgers are proud to host our 10th annual LGBTQ plus minus divided by sign Pride Night. On June 16th, this event has become a meaningful tradition. It's true. And when I think of meaningful traditions in American life, I think like July 4th, Memorial Day, people flying gay pride flags to celebrate who they want to, who they want to bang. This event has become a meaningful tradition, highlighting not only the diversity and resilience within our fan base, but also the impactful work of extraordinary community groups. This year as part of a full night of programming, we invited a number of groups to join us. We are now aware that our inclusion of one group in particular, the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence in this year's Pride Night has been the source of some controversy. Given the strong feelings of people who have been offended by the Sisters' inclusion are our evening and an effort not to distract from the great benefits we've seen over the years of Pride Night, we're deciding to remove them from this year's group of honorees. So they are still partnering with LA Pride. They're still doing the Pride Night, but this is in fact a small victory. Even if it is, it's a victory. Any victory is worth noting. If you can push the LA Dodgers off of giving awards to the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, I mean, it shows how far our culture has degraded, that they were even thinking of doing this in the first place. But again, these companies are vulnerable. They are vulnerable to pushback. It makes a difference. Don't believe for a second that when you say I'm not going to shop at Adidas or I'm not going to go to Starbucks today or maybe ever again, because they are pushing this kind of garbage, that it doesn't make it. It does. It opens avenues for new companies to rise up. I mean, it's literally why we launched Jeremy's Rasers and Jeremy's Chocolates. There are in fact alternatives to the corporations that you have been giving your money to. And you should think about that and make examples of these companies. There should be mass movements. I know Matt Walsh has been pushing people not to go to Target. This seems like a good idea to me. Listen, I love Target. Target's really convenient. But if it means that I'm subsidizing tuck bathing suits for children, not going to do it. One of the things that's truly amazing about all of this is again, it's being pushed by the scientific community. But this is particularly true on the trans issue. But now there's a new study out on on transitions beginning under the US military's health system. And it found a 30 percent d transition rate 30 percent. That's insane. Okay. So first, first of all, first and foremost, when it comes to the transition, people on the left are constantly saying there's no, but nobody regrets it. No one. These d transitioners, they're an exception. They're not the rule. They never happens. These are a bunch of weirdos. Not true. According to the study, again, this was published by PubMed. This particular study shows 30 percent d transitioning rate. And this is for people who have transitioned in the military, meaning they're adults. Now that we have wildly expanded, the number of people who are identifying as trans through social contagion. And now that we have greatly broadened the criteria that allow you to go get trans, you're going to see a d transition rate that is way higher than this over the course of time. Now, all of this has some predictable results, by the way, those predictable results are not just related to a woke corporate culture that believes nonsense. And again, it's a scientific anti-scientific nonsense. It also leads to a massive distrust in science itself, because, again, why would you trust scientific institutions who lie to you? If the American Academy of Pediatrics that lies to you, you have the CDC that lies to you, this has some pretty significant downstream effects, because it turns out that when you discredit an institution, you get both the good and the bad of discrediting the institution. If the CDC is discredited, that's good in the sense that we all take a third, fourth, fifth look at the data before we acquiesce to whatever the CDC is telling us. It also means that when the CDC is occasionally right, we tend to ignore them. But with that said, skepticism is entirely warranted, pretty much anything that is presented to you by the narrative, by the narrative crew. And the narrative crew is, again, Democrats, the media, their woke corporate buddies. Speaking of the narrative crew, I have to tell you a story that is not a national news story. Again, the way that we determine whether a story is national news or not is whether it fits the left-wing narrative. So the national news stories are all the ones where a racist killing takes place or an allegedly racist killing takes place, or a killing that has nothing to do with a race takes place, but the victim is black and the perpetrator or alleged suspect is white, right? Those are the ones that are national news. What is never national news is an open hate crime against white people by black people. That is never, ever, ever national news. That is a local news story. To take an example from a local place, there was a shooting and took place in New Orleans, Louisiana, in Jefferson Parish. Quote, this is for WWL reporting. The two men arrested for the fatal shooting of Lawrence Herr in Kenner may have been motivated because he was white, a detective working the homicide said during a court hearing on Tuesday. On April 11th, Kenner police arrested a 23 year old and a 25 year old for the April 10th murder of Lawrence Herr. They are both black, the victim was white. Herr was 66. He was shot and murdered while installing a mailbox outside a home on George Town drive in Kenner. At the time of the killing, the Kenner police chief said one of the suspects confessed to the shooting but didn't have a particular motive. One of the suspects said they were on a random shooting binge and wanted to commit a murder. We think there may be ulterior motives, and that's what detectives are investigating. Well, apparently at Tuesday's hearing, the lead detective on the case was asked why the pair targeted her. The detective said, under questioning, one of the shooters said, quote, they wanted to kill a white person. They wanted to kill a white person. Now, we can all play the game. Imagine for a second the races were reversed here. Imagine for a second. This is a story about two white men who shot a 66 year old black man installing a mailbox. And then during the investigation, it turns out that they said, we wanted to shoot a black person. This would be national news. Joe Biden would be talking about it. The families of the victim would be at the White House tomorrow. But it is not a national news story because again, it doesn't match the narrative. Even though statistically speaking, it is far more likely that a black person is going to murder a white person than the white person is going to murder a black person. Doesn't matter. The narrative doesn't match. I think we've reached the point where the fragmentation of narrative is so broad that it's difficult to imagine how we can hold together as a country because of it, honestly. Like the fragmentation of because data doesn't matter. Reality doesn't matter. Science doesn't matter. And a huge percentage of the population feels like one particular narrative is being rammed down their craniums by the powers that be, in which case, resistance, electoral resistance, resistance in the form of commerce, resistance in the form of use of government power. Those things are going to become far more likely. When you feel like you're getting gaslit, you tend to react. And that's where we are in the right now. Okay. Meanwhile, we are drawing ever closer to the debt ceiling. Joe Biden actually is now giving indicators that he's willing to compromise on the debt ceiling, which of course, he should. And the fact of the matter is that the White House has been playing a double game. On the one hand, they keep going out there and saying that it's Kevin McCarthy refusing to compromise. And on the other hand, they keep saying we're not even going to negotiate. So Senator Sheldon Whitehouse, he has been trying to participate in non-existent negotiations. He says it's just the fault of Republicans. Are you concerned, though, that the president has talked about conceiving work rules for people on federal assistance programs? Yes. And I'm going to wait and see what the actual outcome is before I make any decisions about how to react. The absolutely worst thing that could happen would be a default. That would be, I think, you know, we always use big words on television. But I think it's fair to say that that would be economically cataclysmic, not only in the United States, but around the world. And that Speaker McCarthy is playing with dynamite whose danger he does not fully appreciate. And the sooner he puts the pin back in- He's playing dynamite. And we can go back to regular order and behave like the Constitution suggests we should, the better off we will all be. And these people care deeply about the Constitution. Meanwhile, Karine Jean-Pierre also gaslighting everybody, suggesting that McCarthy is the problem. It's not Biden refusing to negotiate. It's Kevin McCarthy, who's the problem, according to our world's worst White House press secretary. Doesn't it make the president look like he's caving to Republican demands by making this last second decision to cancel it after this criticism from Republicans that come up instead of making a proactive decision to do a few days ago, or just continuing on with the trip and telling Kevin McCarthy, you know, call me with an update. Look, the speaker, the speaker put us in this position, right? Let's not forget, he put us in a position where he is taking the American economy hostage. We are looking at a situation where America could potentially default on their, on paying their bills, which is something that we have never done before. It's Joe Biden refusing to negotiate, by the way. My favorite iteration of this version of gaslighting is the Kim Jeffery's, the House Minority Leader. So Joe Biden is like gallivanting around the globe. He's mostly asleep, but he's being wheeled around the globe and avoiding any sort of negotiations. And he's avoided negotiations for weeks. And he came Jeffery's like, well, now there's not enough time for a debt deal. Dude, why don't you talk to your dude? I mean, go talk to Joe Biden. He's the one who's been avoiding the negotiation. And the right and the practicality is that if we're not going to solve the fiscal health of the American people over the next 10 years in two weeks, that's what Republicans are suggesting they'd like to do. And what we're saying is that we should have a serious discussion about that. But every available tool to engage in deficit reduction, to build an economy, to continue economic growth should be part of that discussion. Oh, okay. So yeah, we don't have enough time. We don't have time. But why? I want, why would this have happened? It does look, by the way, as though Joe Biden is going to cave on this, which he has to, because if we get an actual recession because of the debt ceiling, Joe Biden is going to be the one who pays the political price. According to Politico, Biden on Wednesday left the door open to expanding some work requirements as part of a debt ceiling deal committing only to opposing new restrictions that affect healthcare programs. I'm not going to accept any work requirement that's going to impact on the medical health needs of people. He said before adding it's possible a deal could expand work rules for other federal programs. Primilla Jayapal, who is reliably crazy. She is the progressive from Washington. She said it was confusing. He said he wasn't open to much more than what we had at a team to leave a little door open. But look, I've been clear. This is a non-starter with us. Well, it's going to be fun to watch Democrats battle it out over their unwillingness to do things like make people work when they are able-bodied. House Republicans were asked about Joe Biden saying that he wouldn't accept anything of consequence on the work requirements. They were literally laughing out loud. But he also said on work requirements, he'd accept not anything of any consequence. Where does that happen? I don't understand this ground. Anything that has consequences. This is the senator who voted for work requirements. If he doesn't want to have something that has consequences, he wants to borrow more money from China to pay an able-bodied person who has no dependence, not even to look for a job, not even go to school for 20 hours. Republicans are going to win this fight and go down to Kevin McCarthy. Because again, if he prides anything out of Joe Biden's cold-bed hands, that is a win for Kevin McCarthy.

Time for a thing I like and then a quick thing that I hate. So things that I like today. I don't like this that that Megan Fox has body dysmorphia. What I do like is how the media cover body dysmorphia when it is not gender dysphoria. Okay. So body dysmorphia is a feeling of discomfort in your own body and an inability to see your body as it is. So that sounds a lot like a person saying, I'm a dude in a lady's body or I'm a lady in a dude's body. It's a form of body dysmorphia. It is discomfort with your own body. So here's how Washington Post covers this. This is a wellness section and you'll notice there's a wide gap here. Megan Fox spoke in a recent interview about her struggles with body image and the challenges of living under the microscope I have body dysmorphia, she said. I never see myself the way other people see me. There's never been a point in my life where I love my body. According to the Washington Post, people with severe body dysmorphia disorder can become reclusive, struggle in relationships and suffer from other mental health issues, according to experts. We spoke to experts about body dysmorphia, including how to know if you have it and potential treatment options and risks. Here is what they say. So what exactly is body dysmorphia disorder or BDD? It's a mental health condition. It's defined as an obsession with a perceived flaw in physical appearance, one that is usually imperceptible to others. The disorder can harm people's mental health and self-esteem. Many with body dysmorphia also struggle with anxiety depression and even suicidal ideation. Sounds familiar, does it not? Because as it turns out gender identity disorder is a form of body dysmorphia and everyone knows it and they're lying to you. What causes body dysmorphia? Experts say that disorder typically presents an adolescent a particularly tough time for young people because all of the changes in their physical appearance. Culture can play a role. So here's the best part. Can body dysmorphia be treated? Body dysmorphia is treatable, though it cannot be cured. Treatment options differ for each patient, but healthcare providers tend to recommend a combination of cognitive behavioral therapies and medication. We try, says one of the doctors, to identify, to teach people to identify what are their thoughts and how they can challenge the distortions in their thinking. Oh, is that what you do? Oh, so you mean that if you're Megan Fox and you're actually quite a beautiful person and you think that you're an ugly person or there's a flaw in your physical appearance, you try to teach you how you should interrupt that stream of thought and you should tell yourself that maybe you're wrong. This is what cognitive behavioral therapy does. It's one of the only clinically proven forms of therapy. I mean, that's what you do when you say that you're, again, a beautiful woman, you don't believe you're a beautiful woman, you actually look in the mirror and you see some something that is not beautiful. But if you're a woman and you look in the mirror and you see a man, you say, I'm in the wrong body. If you say there's a problem with my body, we give you cognitive behavioral therapy. If you say, I'm in the wrong body completely, and that's I need to add fake breasts and chop off my penis. If you're a man, then we say, grab the, grab the chainsaw. Let's do this thing. This is, and everybody understands every, all the scientists who are pretending, the pseudo scientists who are pretending that transgenderism, that gender dysphoria is not a form of body dysmorphia, they are lying, and they know they are lying. This is the part that's truly sick. They've decided to turn an actual mental health condition into a political talking point to slap it on a flag and pretend that it's an identity. It's not helping anybody. In fact, it's hurting an awful lot of people. All right, time for a quick thing that I hate. So this is about a few days old, but I think that it's worth commenting on. So Gabrielle Union, who is one of the world's more annoying human beings. She also happens to have trans her stepson and pretended that her stepson is a daughter and she and Dwayne Wade have then pretended they moved out of the state of Florida because of Governor DeSantis, even though they actually have not been living here for like three, four years. Anyway, she seems like kind of a crazy person. And she says that she and Dwayne Wade split their bills 50 50. Here's her explanation. She was on a pod in Instagram called black millionaires. And she's being interviewed. And here she was explaining how she does her financial arrangements with her husband, Dwayne Wade. Did you develop that first sense of security? In this household, we split everything 50 50. But in the other households that each of us have to support, it puts this there's always this like gorilla on your back that is like, you better work. Whatever you work. You know, you're gonna sleep in. Hmm. You know, somebody in my naughty. So she splits her bills with her husband's with her husband. They don't have like a joint bank account. They split their bills 50 50. That's weird. I mean, that's strange. So as I've said, in my own life with my immediate family, we are communists from each according to his ability to each according to his need. That is the way that works in an immediate family. My wife and I, we do not earn the same amount of money, not remotely. All that money is our money. It's not just my money. It is our money because we are a couple and we have children. And we put that money in a joint bank account. I have never once looked at my wife and said, are you paying this bill or am I? Because that's a crazy thing to do. When you don't understand how a family is supposed to work, you end up with idiotic pseudo solutions like this that she pays her by the way, each one of these people is extraordinarily wealthy. So they don't, they clearly don't have to do this. Gabriel Union is worth tens of millions of dollars. And I believe Duane waiters worth like a hundred million dollars. So none of them have to do this. This is a point of principle. Now, let's see how it works out for them long run. This is a, a wild way to live your life. But why, what in the, what in the world? Okay. Don't get it. All righty guys, the rest of the show continues right now. You're not going to want to miss it. We'll be getting into the mail bag.
