    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel Burns and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Miniman standing at the ready to guard a new our life Liberty property focus on everything that matters from civilization to our own bodily autonomy our minds body souls property economy you name it it is all on the chopping block that's why for us here it is all hands on deck back here for a brand new week April 17th sorry about being out you know in and out a little bit less two weeks we'll be here for the full week make the best of it and there's a lot going on but there's one major story the purpose of the GOP is what it always was to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory to ensure that the left escapes annihilation on any particular issue or really most issues after they go too far into territory they can't naturally hold in other words the definition of a controlled opposition Trump came along to change that oh I'm gonna fight this system I'm sick of these establishment Republicans and yet what he does when he cut through the rhetoric he actually delivers the forces of the right end of the Republican Party right back into that GOP establishment I'm obviously talking about this one success we had one successful boycott we finally did it's so hard to boycott major companies because they have monopolies but anheuser bush because there's so many beer companies out there and a lot of our people during beer they were really hurting so there's a coordinated effort between the RNC run by the way by Ronah McDaniel supported and kept afloat by Trump and Don Trump Jr. saying don't be mean there's too many GOP donors at the executive level the anheuser bush don't harm them and folks this is the core of what's wrong this is such an important story because it's all the fact that we need we will never succeed until we have a new party movement and fundraising base and this really demonstrates that because this was the one issue we were actually winning on both a boycott we were winning on but generally this was the one cultural issue that as we slide into Sodom and Gomara and utter degeneracy this is the one issue we were turning the clock back on and actually doing better than we were five to seven years ago on it because because of the overreach and right when we're about to knife them the Republicans come along and save them and Trump and his orbit together with Bruce Jenner are saving them so we're gonna talk about that a little bit later coming up but first we're sponsored very appropriately by Patriot Mobile today this is yet another way you could boycott major world companies that provide what's considered a must-need service I wish it weren't frankly but mobile service obviously our judicial system resembles a third world banana republic we have American companies helping the government with surveillance helping them enforce political targeting for years big mobile companies have been dumping millions into these causes AT&T Verizon T-Mobile Patriot Mobile is America's only Christian conservative wireless provider they offer dependable nationwide coverage with with all three major networks so you get the best possible service without having your monthly fee go towards the leftist agenda destroying the country and in fact Patriot Mobile supports pro-family religious freedom and sanctity of life second amendment values go to Patriot mobile calm slash CR today to make the switch or call them at 878 Patriot and you'll guaranteed you're guaranteed to get an American on the phone unlike any of the three that are all based in India get free activation today with offer code CR again patreon.com slash CR or call 878 Patriot free activation with offer code CR so folks Congress has been offered two weeks they're finally back in and they're resuming their probing agenda their agenda you know their hearings and subpoenas nope it's not probing the politicized DOJ the FBI sting operations among Americans January 6 or COVID fascism the two things on the agenda for hearings probing the Pentagon leak about Ukraine and Afghanistan withdrawal you got to be kidding me Afghanistan we all agreed that withdrawal was wrong but there's I mean unlike almost every bad thing government does does that was one and done so what are you gonna do at this point the reality is Republicans are upset that we pulled out of Afghanistan they want to still be there that's part of the problem and then the Pentagon leak I saw Kevin McCarthy put out on Twitter we got a you know what's going on with this administration that they can't control the flow of you know classified information again you could agree or disagree that that might be a problem but why is the bigger problem not the subject matter of that leak that we illegally have boots on the ground without a declared war so again as I mentioned on Friday's show if McCarthy were smart you'd force a debate on declaration of war against Russia if they're really that big of a threat you should be able to declare war otherwise shut up and pull this but again this is where what we said about Kevin McCarthy was proven correct sure he'll indulge our talking points a little bit more than previous speakers but that's just because we're on to new fights it's the same thing that on the fights that matter today he's just as feckless as Boehner and Ryan or subversive even as Boehner and Ryan were on the fights of yesterday you just get confused that you know he'll update the language a little bit to comport more with today's talk radio talking points but they don't do anything and then I wanted to get to the other legislation they're gonna bring up HR 734 would effectively ban transgender whatever dudes from participating in female sports programs I guess that's funded through Title 9 through the federal government and again it's like if you're doing that go all the way and then reverse and this is in effect Biden's transgender bathroom mandate through the Department of Education extra paid from the entire federal government all the funding for trendism whether it's in DOE it whether it's in Department of State promoting it throughout the world through our diplomatic ties but this is part of the general premise of the GOP that they bless the premise they validated they even accentuated but they'll just pick one isolated point that they want to disagree upon oh hey you know you could totally make grooming entire generation to think they're winning that's fine just don't go ahead and screw up female sports really like so this transhumanist hell I mean could you think of the ramifications of brainwashing an entire generation where 20% identify as something other than normal 22% or something according to Gallup of Gen Z and they think that the only problem with that is female sports look I know I'll get hate mail but nothing personal the world could live without female sports it can't live without continuity of men acting like men women acting like men women normal healthy marriages in procreation at its basic level and all the other disruptions that result from twisting that and contorting it upside down but this is all they care about it's just so bizarre but this ties into the whole Trump business with Bruce Jenner Bruce Jenner was just in Mar-a-Lago and and they're promoting him and that's part of what Don Jr. said on a podcast last week that he has no problem with transgenderism it's just don't you know push castration on kids and the female sports but having Bruce Jenner on Fox every day and promoted by the RNC and promoted by MAGA Inc in Trump what do you think that does it doesn't just validated but it validates it from the right the supposed right that's how you get a generation of people that are like this and that's how you get a generation and three generations of Republicans purposely tossing the fight on every winnable issue and again in my lifetime every cultural issue we have lost and lost and lost and lost this is the one issue we've done better on there's a pew pole out we we've said it this before comparing 2017 to 2022 five years later we gained six points on the question of the percentage of people who believe that sexuality is like you know set at birth is immutable and I know that's crazy anything short of a hundred percent is insane but you know we gained six points on every other measure we're losing on any other cultural measure we're winning on this issue and Republicans are purposely sabotaging it this is what a controlled opposition does because if you didn't have any opposition naturally there's a vacuum from which would arise a real opposition because there's just naturally gonna be so much overreach from the left that people even who are otherwise brainwashed into some of their like whoa this is this is crazy and Republicans are there to tamp it down and again everyone's like unvoting Trump I'm sick of the establishment yet now he delivers our forces into the hands of the establishment you have to understand when Trump supports Ronah McDaniel's RNC chair and Kevin McCarthy is house GOP leader house speaker and really Mitch McConnell a Senate leader when it matter now because it became personally opposes him but before then he prevented us from endorsing against him because he preemptively endorsed McConnell's reelection there's stuff that comes along with that that entire donor class that entire donor class I want to get into that a little bit more and then the contrast to Ron DeSantis who will take money from anyone who's willing to you know feel he's a right winning horse and I'll use it to win and then he'll reject their proposals right away is like screw it I'm not I'm not doing that but anyway Tate were sponsored by Patriot Academy in six days I look forward to meeting you at Patriot Academy's inaugural constitutional defense

looking forward to meeting those of you who did sign up for Sunday's course next week so this is from the Daily Beast and it's just truly shocking the National Republican Congressional Committee quietly deleted a fundraising page Saturday that took aim at one of its biggest donors the parent company of Bud Light and Heiser Bush then our CC's backpedaling follows conservative calls for a boycott of the beer after it's promoting Dylan Mulvaney who dresses up like a five-year-old girl on Saturday morning the powerful committee that provides support to Republican Congressional campaigns blasted out a tweet calling for supporters to donate to the NRCC in exchange be given a custom drink Koozie thanks to Dylan Mulvaney we can all finally admit that Bud Light tastes like water with our new Koozie's you can make sure no one confuses Bud Light with real beer ever again but shortly after it was posted around 9 30 a.m. the tweet was taken down later on Saturday afternoon the corresponding fundraising page was also nixed the decision to reverse course is almost certainly to a reaction to the reality that the parent company behind Bud Light is a major donor to the group and comes after Don Jr. urged an end to a boycott of the conservative leading beer and again I will tell you that also comes the same weekend that Bruce Jenner was hanging out at Mar-a-Lago a few months after they had the celebration of mandating gay marriage on the stage I mean what am I supposed to do with this this is see this is something I thought we could all get around because it's not like a legal or policy action it's a boycott it's cultural everyone likes it you know and it was working and the whole point of Trump we were told is that he is wealthy he doesn't need the donors he can tell them to go to hell but time and again we see that everything he says the exact opposite is true now contrast this the financial times just reports top Republican donor Thomas Petterfi is halting plans to help finance the US presidential bid a Florida governor around the Santis due to his extreme positions on social issues I've put myself on hold the billionaire told the financial times because of his stance on abortion and book banning myself and a bunch of friends are holding our powder dry and like I told you a bunch of these donors basically saw basically a DGP donors do not most of them do not share our values now a lot of them still they want for whatever reason this is their point of access they want Republicans to win not Democrats for whatever reason maybe it's financial so they hold leverage over you but you hold leverage over them because they don't want the Democrats the Santis understands that so he's like hey buddy you know Trump can't win you know now I know you guys want Nikki Haley my Pence but you guys know he ain't winning the nomination so it's either me or a Democrat president that's basically what I'm assuming was his pitch to these people but now they're like screw it he's too extreme I ain't doing this and he doesn't care he's not backing down I want you to listen it's a little bit long here about a minute and a half clip of the Santis speaking at at Liberty University take a listen to this right here this day as governor I've never taken a poll about any issue my entire time leaders are not captive to poll results leaders leaders set out a vision leaders execute that vision and leaders deliver results and when you do that it doesn't matter what the polls were before that you can change public opinion people will support you if they see you're doing a good job we also understood that as governor you can make the best decisions in the world you could have the best policies in the world but if you don't have a cadre of people serving in your administration who shares the mission and is going to put the mission over their own personal interests none of this stuff's gonna end up getting carried out so we made it very clear anyone serving in our administration if you're bringing any other agenda other than the best interests of the people of Florida pack your bags right now and we will show you the door we also said that we're not just gonna sit back and try to avoid issues or hope that issues get resolved not want to wait into things because we're worried about creating any type of blowback any decision you make as a leader there's gonna be some people that like it there's gonna be other people that don't and some elected officials think well if I just don't make decisions and I'm just not out and about then fewer people are gonna are gonna disapprove of some of the decisions that you make so folks that's pretty spectacular I never took a poll I lead the polls now there's nothing quite spectacular about the statement get anyone could make it it's coming from someone who is the governor of the second largest red state which used to be a swing state and he actually governed like this mission over personal interests all of his personnel in the administration rowing in the same direction where you don't have the leaks you don't have the people you know every second you have you know a non-maga person supporting manga which has become a joke the contrast for anyone who wants to see it could never be stronger it's not a matter of who do you want to be president we can't wait until January 2025 will be dead it's a matter of what sort of movement do you want a movement that will focus on substance and leverage and ignore the GOP establishment and donor base like he actually does despite them donating to him or do you want the same old the same old package with a couple of flashy bow ties of Trump subverting the decorum of the system but not only not subverting the system but perpetuating the system perpetuating it that's really the question for us here let me give you another example let me give you another example here Tucker recently interviewed Trump and he asked him about Gavin Newson take a listen to what he had to say I used to get along great with him you know when I was president had a long you know got a long really good Gavin well you got along with Gavin I did I really did he was always very nice to me said the greatest things he would say things like he's doing a great job oh he was about you help me that's why I could never hit him because he was so nice to me am I missing something am I missing something Gavin Newson said something nice about me you know he said nice things about me I could never hit him back there's two things he said in those just you know that 15 seconds there number one and and we knew this ready he's all everything is not about what's right or wrong what's about you know what's for the mission it's who talked nicely about him again we don't have time for that garbage but then another thing I could never hit him and you find that so if you have a hardcore like populist conservative but didn't kiss up to Trump he'll trash him but if you have the biggest rhino globalist neo-con Lindsey Graham type well he said nice things about me so I can't fight him that is very destructive to our agenda and what needs to get done to interpose against this fourth Reich that is a very big problem and again this is not speculation headed forward to what a hypothetical Trump administration would look like we live through this and let me give you a great example of this Trump gave a speech at the NRA convention over the weekend area of Friday and I almost fell on my seat he promised to enact concealed carry reciprocity across the states I was like USOB you are president so what happened was Republicans had the trifecta and they did nothing with it it was the most squandered trifecta in the history of America where one party at the house and in the White House and did as little with it and actually all the budget bills were more Democrat than Republican but the one issue that Republicans rally around is what guns can even though squishy Republicans the terrible Republicans subversive control opposition wants they're good on guns almost a point where I've been saying it's like the gun issue itself is almost becoming subversive because it allows all these guys that are killing us and the issues that matter more say I'm pro-gun when we already won on that issue so we thought that the one issue we would get is reciprocity and indeed they had a bill to do just that but the problem is they did it in a funny way that passed the house in 2018 we had Thomas Massey who's the chairman of the Second Amendment caucus on the show and he broke the news that there was a problem with the bill and he said the way they're doing it they're going to hold it in the Senate and they're going to wait until the next shooting when everyone cries for action do something do something the next mass shooting they're gonna strip it of the reciprocity and they're gonna put red flag laws into place and like a profit that's literally what happened meaning this is where Massey was as on target as he was with COVID and we got this is called fix nicks and it's not even so much the guns it's the surveillance state at a time when when we're dealing with DOJ and the FBI it gave the FBI so much authority to red flag people and of course we didn't get reciprocity we got negative people forget even on that issue Trump passed the only gun control measure around passed nothing supportive of it and then executively did a couple of things including banning bump stocks which was which was completely illegal and he has the nerve to get up there and talk as if he was never president and obviously you've seen all these clips around where Trump's like take the guns first due process later and again I want to say something very clear I don't think Trump is a fraud in the traditional sense that he's laughing ha ha ha I think he likes guns it's worse than that it's when the big moments come you listen to the maturity of the Santas he knows the issue he understands the process he understands the budget bills there's a whole clip I'm not gonna play it's like four minutes long of him talking to Morton Blackwell at the leadership Institute about how to use how to pass appropriation bills one by one use them as leverage he understands that type of stuff any other stance had he used leverage use power use the bully pulpit stay on message stay disciplined have all the supporters on message all this staff on message Trump's totality of universe is confined to the circumstances in front of him at the moment so he is pro-gun just like I think generally he wants to get tougher on crime but when you have this panic oh my gosh Kim Kardashian everyone wants to do criminal justice okay okay I'm gonna excel criminal justice reform everyone wants to do pandemic oh I'm gonna pass two trillion dollars I'll give you more ventilators I'll do a warp speed whatever you want I'll do lockdowns that save millions of people you have a mass shooting rather than powering through it and demonstrating that no it's not the guns it's the gun felons and yet at that same time fun fact the same day of the parkland shooting was when the Republicans in control of the Senate Judiciary Committee they had the majority passed the forerunner of the first step act out of committee which back then actually let out the federal gun felons which are really bad those are all your gang dangers MS-13 types people destroying the streets of Chicago he could have jujitsu that hate Democrats you won't gun control mandatory minimums on violent felons caught again with illegally possessing a firearm boom mandatory ten years and I called for it at the time instead he panicked because he doesn't understand the issue so it's like yeah all these people get guns we we we red flag laws he panicked he dropped the reciprocity and went for what was called the fix nicks which gave the FBI more money and surveillance authority and other agencies as well over us and that is being used will be used against us and I supposed to ignore all of this really am I supposed to ignore all of this that's why yeah we're gonna spend some time with on all this today to discuss where we are the state of play with Trump but more you know than others typically do I like this candidate versus that candidate but the vision of what we need to do and how he actually gets in our way and enables the other side first I just want to point out those of you who have not seen Steve Dase's nefarious movie based off of his book nefarious plot first of all you can get the book it's trending again on Amazon is bestseller get your tickets now at who is nefarious calm who is nefarious calm basically you know not to give it away starts off with the psychiatrist who's called to a prison to meet with a convicted killer who's about to get executed the killer says he's a demon named nefarious the psychiatrist doesn't believe it doesn't believe it and pretends otherwise he doesn't believe in God you know good inclinations evil inclinations and he gets a rude awakening so I'll leave it at that and it really is a good almost a good parable good allegory for the time we live in that people don't want to believe our government would do certain things it's a coincidence that's actually a line in the movie oh it's just a coincidence I think we're all learning that a lot of the events that have occurred let's just say Kennedy assassination onward are a lot more than just a coincidence and it really colors the way we view our government it colors the way we should concoct a vision and a strategy and what we need to do to evacuate ourselves from that albatross around our next our life or liberty our property our way of life but anyway this is the time to show that that real conservative movies could actually have staying power because this is this is something if this succeeds this is something hopefully we can do again what if we made a movie a bay you know based off of covid fascism really understanding what the government does it would be great if this succeeds if we showed there's an appetite for it so again who is nefarious calm is where to get your tickets so anyway I was gonna have Pedro on today as special guests but I have to get him on a little later there's a scheduling conflict so we'll just continue this discussion the the problem is when you have a man that fills the vacuum of this of this supposed conservative populism but in fact delivers us into the hands of the donor class of the globalist of the unit party more than ever before it leaves us in the worst state of affairs because the left is activated as if they got their guy it or we have our guy in but in fact they have a guy in that's accomplishing for them more than anyone else could another area you see this with is the federal reserve and monetary policy everyone knows Trump was obsessed with both fiscal and monetary so-called stimulus printing money and it flies in the face of his so-called agenda of the forgotten American I have charts out today detailing this you look at the federal reserve charts for and this is just one of many measures of how crazy things got from COVID the transfer of wealth for years we were told by the left that always it was income inequality is terrible and really really there's always gonna be inherent inequality in terms of people's you know talents effort luck all sorts of things that comes from natural law from God from divine providence but what you don't want ever is income inequality resulting from government from government because that is not natural that's immoral and I wanted to capture just exactly how much that wealth was transferred see they're like oh there's inherent inequality so we need to redistribute from the wealthy to the poor that was the old liberal line now they use the boot of government to redistribute primarily from the middle to middle upper income small business owners the crust of what really held the backbone of the American economy to the uber wealthy and then use some of that to dole out the bottom income earners to be dependent on government that's what communist communism is you take the masses make them dependent on government right out that kind of like self-dependent middle upper middle income small business owners and then of course all to benefit the big guys and nowhere is this more evident than with the federal reserve policies the policies of endless printing money buying mortgage back securities and unnaturally low interest rates created inflation harmed consumers and savers but did benefit the people at the top so the top one percent if you want to look at the share of total assets in the country by wealth percent dials you know the top with wealthiest one percent at what percentage of assets in the country that they own the top one percent just in a year from you know that 2020 covid lockdown fiscal and monetary policies top 1% own nearly 30% of all assets in the country now again I don't inherently have a problem with that if that was natural but the fact is that their share of the pie jumped more than 10% in just one year due to those policies okay 10% their share of the pie grew now what I did is I looked at something interesting I looked at okay what about the 50 to 90% bracket middle middle upper income okay over that it's remarkable over that same period the covid year 2020 well the top 1% increase their share the pie by 10% the middle and upper middle income classes decreased their share by 7% and that's again that's a lot for such a period of a short period of time the share of the assets from the top 1% holds roughly you know what they hold is roughly on par with what all individuals from 50 to 90 hold I forget how many millions of people it is a lot more people they might think well Daniel that's how it is the top 1% have no that's not how it was prior to the federal reserve in Congress's money printing schemes really beginning during the Bush era the upper middle class again I'm defining that by 50 to 90 accounted for almost twice the assets of the top 1% now it's on par and obviously that's exemplified through the 10,000 businesses that permanently went under well that was all transferred to the mass masters the universe then you look at the lower income the bottom 50 their share of the pie skyrocketed by 20% obviously that was all so it's interesting is actually if you look they first took a hit the first mmm first quarter really really in 2020 it wasn't until 2021 when the stimulus checks kicked in so they took a hit too they were crushed too but then the way they prevent mass rebellion is you make the masses happy so that was the you know the stimulus and there we are today M1 that's a measure of all the money in circulation that if you want to know how much money is out there M1 it's called within one year it won from four trillion to 19 trillion that's it right there everyone's talking about inflation Republicans ran on it and now you know doing nothing about it that is why we have it and not y'all yes Biden continued those policies but who initiated them who cheered it on doesn't take a genius to understand why a hundred dollars pre-COVID in 2020 2020 is now worth 86 bucks today that's insane 2020 pre-COVID usually you have to go back 20 to 30 years to get a spread like that a hundred dollars in 2020 is worth 86 dollars today if you go on to the government CPI calculator you could literally see that the purchasing power of a dollar is now down nearly 40% of what it was a generation ago how's that for income inequality all that money printing that benefited the wealthy and well-connected it was worth the inflationary effects for them because their income compensated for it not the rest of us I literally find now I have to transfer from my savings account it's not enough the same lifestyle is you know is not the income is not enough people less fortunate than I am ironically Trump keeps a bust or kept the bust of Andrew Jackson as his hero in the Oval Office when he was president he wrote in his 1832 veto message of the central bank it is to be regretted that the rich and powerful too often bend the acts of government to their self as selfish purposes distinctions in society will always exist under every just government equality of talents of education or of wealth cannot be produced by human institutions right so he wasn't arguing the Bernie Sanders line the full enjoyment of the gifts of heaven and the fruits of a superior industry economy and virtue every man is equally entitled to protection by law but when the law undertake to add to these natural and just advantages artificial distinctions to grant titles gratuitous and exclusive privileges to make the rich richer in the potent more powerful the humble members of society the farmers mechanics and laborers who have neither the time nor the means of securing like favors to themselves have a right to complain of the injustice of their government there are no necessary evils in government its evil exists only in its abuses again I must ask who was president at the time and it's not just that he was president he pushed it so did you know a couple weeks ago Trump noted that where is this he said he would not have bailed out Silicon Valley bank but he said he would have lowered interest rates and he criticized Jerome Powell for raising the interest rates too fast too much but that's a cop out yes we all agree once you hook the economy on the monetary morphine that profoundly at zero interest rates and print that much money for that long and then you choke off the supply and raise interest rates act that fast then you create bank solvency problems but the underlying problem is during Trump's era and preceding him as well but he took it to the next level obsessing about loose money policies all to juice up the stock market and the banks and the GOP special interests that's what created the inflation that they felt a need to then raise it to curve it now you could argue that you know the raising the interest rates didn't really curve it that much and it's not worth it but but screw it don't tell me you're a populist that's what's so ironic about the man this is from Politico um where is this and I go I know people will say well they're they're Daniel this is the liberal media but it but it's not the liberal media this was true this was September 18 2019 so before COVID so this is not even like we all know Trump has this issue where he panics oh my gosh the stock bar is gonna crash let's let's just print money and that's what he did he that's the opposite of a statesman just like he panics when you have these shootings with gun control red flight laws he panics when there's this clamor for criminal justice to form for this Fed for the dream act he's the opposite of what you think but anyway from Politico President Donald Trump has taken over Jerome Powell's life the federal reserves they expect the decision on Wednesday to cut interest rates again we'll spark new questions about whether Powell's chairman is caving to intense pressure by Trump Trump is forcing still more dramatic policy options into the limelight including his latest call on the Fed to cut rates below zero an idea at the central bank as long resisted as an avenue for fighting recessions Trump was pushing negative interest rates because all Trump understands and it's very much in line with Trump's juvenile sophomoric pureeil childish way of thinking just whatever is in front of it oh we're saying juice it up prime the pump just just print the money you know that's what the the water he defined everything literally by the stock market how it did that day but that's what created this long-term death trap of the dependency upon loose money and out of control inflation which is harming the common man this is literally what he ran against but what he is most upset susceptible to getting roped into so I mean he is totally wrong on the federal reserve Trump for his part you know he wants to you know obviously there's been a reawakening on our side to abolish the Fed or at least again get rid of its dual mandate Trump was the most aggressive proponent of using the federal reserve to socially engineer the business cycle all for political reasons and look I'd be remiss if I didn't point this out as well when you look at Pfizer and everything in Trump in the back pocket of the big pharmaceuticals from the Washington Post Trump details business holdings and belated financial disclosure he filed his financial disclosures because Trump's a candidate for president again the hundred page filing enumerates the former president's management positions at a pair of businesses involved in marketing digital trading cards of him and promoting a speaking engagements so you have that but then it turns out that he has major holdings stocks owned in Pfizer as well Johnson and Johnson now you could say well yeah you know everyone's gonna have pharmaceuticals it's the biggest whether you like it or not the biggest company so we all probably have holdings in it but it makes you wonder why you spoke so nicely the CEO of J&J and he's sinking his teeth into warp speed more than even the Democrats are it just really really disturbing at some point facts have to matter again saddling up to the tranny movement to Bruce Jenner homosexual marriage jailbreak dream act covid fascism the federal reserve and and it wasn't a loose enough for him and pro big business and Wall Street for him one after another and guns but it all has the same hallmark it's not even so much that he's contradictory or closet leftist you know I was like oh well he was a lifelong Democrat I don't even think that's the point I think genuinely on a lot of issues if you ask him he's changed his mind or or you know he was always a little bit more of a populist Democrat whatever it is it's that he cannot withstand pressure meaning if it's about decorum you need to apologize for saying mean things oh he won't apologize he'll stand his grandma on that but if it's about policy and the system itself he is too scared to undo the system he is too scared that's the reality and you know what maybe maybe I will play this here this clip of DeSantis with Morton Blackwell the leadership Institute understanding the leverage of what needs to be done we're gonna talk about this later this week more with the debt ceiling and the budget and where the leverage is take a listen to DeSantis right here it starts with your plan of reform seems to me to dwell on the Congress first what should Congress do different well look I mean I think that so I was I was a US congressman for three terms I've recovered from that experience don't worry but what happens is is you have a government that's on autopilot so they will either do massive omnibus spending bills which nobody really reads or has any idea what's in it or they will do what's called continuing resolutions which just keeps the government going whatever the previous years levels of appropriations were the problem with that is that that they're never using that number one constitutional power they have the power the purse to rein in these administrative agencies and so you have something like DOJ and FBI well if you never hold them accountable through the legislative process either through through law or through through budget of course power is gonna accumulate there you've also had kind of a trope that a lot of Republican presidents have accepted over the years that DOJ and FBI are quote independent of the White House and first of all these people have guns they can put you in jail saying they're independent means they're unaccountable no they are executive branch agencies that report to the elected president of the United States and an executive elected executive absolutely has to use article two power to hold those agencies accountable so I think you've had an executive branch that's not wanted to do anything to reel them in by holding them accountable and getting involved in what they're doing and then I think you've had a Congress which is just totally given up on using the purse strings and it's almost like these agencies just have a right to operate in finite them when you send that signal over many decades it's just human nature they are going to abuse their power I mean the founders would have predicted that in a New York minute so I think that a lot of this is an application of Congress if you're scared of a quote government shutdown above all else because you're worried about some bad news cycles just understand you're putting that I would say very small political impulse ahead of doing your duty to ensure that our apparatus is constitutionally accountable I'd rather have the fight to try to discipline the agencies and let the chips fall where they may then just allow the status quo to continue in the direction that it has gone in so folks that's the opposite this is a man who has a maturity understanding the long game this is what 4d chess is not just the checkers in front of you understanding the process the policy and he said this a bunch of times I want to see how I could use my leverage you know I'm gonna demand bills be passed one by one he's gonna use the veto pen this was another bizarre thing I don't know if you guys remember in um throughout his presidency I was writing all these articles on the history of the veto mr. President make the veto pen grid again you can actually find a comment comment of mine with that title like come on use it use it it was the most bizarre thing this a man who made his name his fame and really cemented his appeal with the base upon this notion that he was gonna not just burn it down but you're fired and he wouldn't fire anyone he was scared to fire anyone and he wouldn't veto any bill it was like it wasn't until the final months of his presidency that even vetoed a few bills and that was even when you know democrats already had control but when the GOP establishment the the the Ryan McConnell era I could say this was certitude he did not veto a single not one bill not just a budget bill but any bill of any sort this is a big this is a big problem when I'm trying to present you this is a you know this is not just a tip for tad oh you guys a jerk you guys and by the way it's so funny you have these voices out there I forgot where I saw it some of these voices they're like you know it's not very helpful to our cause all this sniping of the scientists and Trump people we need to just unite and fight dude it's all one-sided if if what bothers you is a lack of unity and intramutment fighting then why aren't you criticizing the man causing it there's only one man dehumanizing the other with disgusting personal attacks every day the most the scientists has done is like okay so one saying you're fat in your meatball right and you're a pedophile and the other one saying I would have fired Fauci I had more discipline in my administration that's kind of like the extent of his attack if you want to call it that one's contrasting we're we're talking about the exact style process and policies that are needed for what we're up against and how Trump failed us we're contrasting records and another one is with personal attacks or just extremely dishonest things notice what I'm doing I don't blame Trump for things like okay he didn't deliver the moon when he was president things that aren't achievable I'm not even talking about things that he didn't get done on talking about negative things that he actively passed that were new you know we could debate the level of what you know when you're present you could roll back but certainly the expectation is that you're not going to add new bad stuff but that's what he did and that's the thing we can't we got to move on from him he is the most destructive thing to our cause if you believe in the tenor and the messaging of what Trump ran on in 2016 he is the biggest threat to fulfilling that that is the reality again no one man including DeSantis alone is the antidote to that but it's if DeSantis is willing to run on our broader movement of what Congress the House Republicans can do now and we're gonna talk about that with how to leverage the the appropriation bills the debt ceiling reauthorization bills as well as another big thing things expiring like Fiza like the pandemic bill that's what you know we're gonna talk about and obviously what the governors and state legislatures and Republican control should be pressured to do that is where it's at substance substance and truth will set you free let me know what you think Daniel Harowitz at start mail calm we have a lot more coming some guests coming up this week let me know who you want as a guest as well we're you know interested in a diverse array of ideas but not a diverse array of values this is not a debating society and like I tell you I don't give the other side equal time you have plenty of time we are the equal time I don't have establishment people on and I hate to say it but Trump is making the establishment great again till next time God bless y'all thank you for listening"
