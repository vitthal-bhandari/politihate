    "text": " I'm Dave Rubin. We are in Washington, DC and joining me today is a US Congresswoman representing Colorado's Third District Congresswoman or Lori Bobert. Welcome back to the Rubin Report. Dave, it is so great to be back in the Rubin Report with you. We were supposed to do this yesterday. Yes. But apparently even a Congresswoman doesn't have the power to stop our endless aviation problems happening in America these days. No, Republicans are in the majority, so we have a little more power, but I'm not as powerful as Tony Gonzalez, who can shut down entire border security bills just with the power of his words. No, I was stuck in airports all day long. I mean, if you're just going to count Eastern time, 8 a.m. to midnight, and I had two of my boys with me, which some people would think that that causes for more stress, more of a headache, but it was awesome. I had my 15-year-old and my 10-year-old, and we walked the airports together. We snuggled on airplanes. We went and ate good food in the airport. They wanted McDonald's. I vetoed that. And so they listened. You get McDonald's anytime you want, but it was really great just spending the day with them and a unique experience. Got home. We got home at 12.30. I put my 10-year-old in the shower. I said, I have been with you all day. You smell? I made you shower before we got on the airplane. I don't think you use soap. We still didn't get bed to bed till after 1 a.m. Do you ever want to do that with some of the Democrats who are debating? You smell, but I'm going to do it in the shower. I don't think you use soap. The mom and stinks come out in me. Individual responsibility. Yes. Usually not their thing. Right. Do your kids and family come to DC often, or is this just like you doing your thing here in and out? Yeah. So I'm pretty much on my own for the most part. But when their schedule allows it, they certainly come up here. We've pulled them out of school to have weeks up here before because I had been traveling so much and just missed the heck out of them and said, why don't you come out here? And they act like they own DC when they come here. They go throughout the Capitol, the office buildings. They know which members of Congress have dogs in their office. They go and storm their offices and hang out. But this is spring break. So I have two boys with me. My oldest son is expecting his son any day. Oh, I remember. So, yeah. So he couldn't come to DC. I know. You're going to be, wait, how old are you? I'm 36. You're going to be a 36-year-old grandma. Yes. I'm a GG, Dave. I'm a GG. How does that feel? You know, I'm really excited. So my mom, she was 18 when she had me. I was 18 when I had Tyler and now he's 18. And one of his first comments to me was, mom, it's hereditary. I said, nice try. It doesn't work that way. But I'm really proud of him and my grandson's mom for being responsible because they could have taken a different route. And both of them chose life. And so it wasn't anything I had to brow beat them with. I very calmly had the conversation when we found out. Just let me know if you think something else. I just want to have a talk with you if you decide to go a different direction. And both of them were very excited and wanted to move forward and welcome this life into the world. Was there any part of that that challenged any of your beliefs before you did that sit down with them and just realizing, you know? Yeah. So, I mean, obviously I'm a Christian and there are standards that we like to uphold, but none of us do it perfectly. One of the biggest things that I look to is him who knows to do right and doesn't, it's sin. And I mean, there's things all throughout the week that I know is right to do and sometimes I don't do them. So we can nitpick what the Bible says is right and wrong, but I think just having that heart posture of wanting to serve God and do the right thing is so important. And I mean, what I've chose a different path, of course, you know? But this is where we're at and we're all embracing it and we're so happy. Great. What do you mean you would have chose a different path? For Tyler, for my son. Oh, yes. Yes. Meaning at this age, exactly. Yeah, he wanted to go to UTI in Florida. He was going to graduate and go to college in Florida. Now, you know, he's looking at petroleum engineering classes, courses at our community college. It's a great community college and rifle, but you know, I get to have him home with me longer and you know, I get to be GG. So certainly there are some beliefs that you, you know, like, wait, this isn't exactly right and exactly what we have taught you, but this is where we're at and we're going to teach you about redemption and how to move forward. So I'm happy that he's close to me and I get to instruct him now on, you know, how to be a loving father and how to raise a baby. So let's do a couple of things about Colorado specifically and then we'll get to the rest of the country. When I did my book tour back in May, I did Denver, I'd stop in Denver and I was shocked at the amount of homeless people there. Like you expected in Seattle. You expected in San Francisco, in Portland, et cetera, but I was shocked by what was going on in Denver, which is such a gorgeous city and people are great and all that. So what is going on in Denver? Democrats. So, I mean, really that's what happened. We had universal mail-in ballots about 10 years ago go through and Democrats started taking over every single election. And unfortunately, it was when we had our gubernatorial race that elected Governor Jared Polis. And after that is when we just saw this dramatic decline in Colorado, our policies infringing on Colorado's rights and then just the crime increase. Marijuana, it's legal in Colorado, obviously. And I think that that did bring in a different... So you connect that directly? Because as a general rule, I'm more libertarian and I do believe in legalizing this stuff and I'm not against people doing what they want with their lives, but even seeing in New York what's going on right now, the whole city just smells like weed, basically. Yes, yes. You can't go outside in Denver and not smell weed. And it's pretty much throughout most of the state, especially in those urban areas. But I think it just brought with it that legalization brought with it a different population and certainly a transient population. And the homelessness is just skyrocketed in Denver when we were having all the COVID lockdowns and everything. I mean, we just had a complete encampment right there at the Denver Capitol. Yeah, I mean, you guys like literal tent cities everywhere, I mean, shock. Yes, and they are everywhere and they're not doing anything to remove them. So they're enabling the problem and it is only increasing. What do you think of... Well, I guess I know what you think. So, Polis, it seems to me that people say when I'm always like, oh, there's no moderate Democrat people are like, well, Polis is kind of, he's not completely insane, but it doesn't sound like the policies are that far from what we think you're... Right, no, the policies are very extreme. And I do like Governor Jared Polis on a personal level. I mean, we've had some interactions and he's been very kind to me, but his policies do not match that moderate or libertarian mantra that people have about him. Even hearing stories of him serving in the House of Representatives is very different than what I'm seeing as him being our governor. And maybe it's his cabinet members who are pushing these extreme policies and he's kind of going along with it. There is a super majority. The Democrats have a super majority in Colorado and the state legislature pushes extreme policies. And unfortunately, those get signed into law, into law, whether that's gun control laws or comprehensive sex ed or vaccine mandates for our children in order to go to school. And so all of this is so extreme. And from the top down, it affects everyone everywhere. The lockdowns affected our businesses. So many were shut down. Our churches were shut down. Our schools were shut down. People were masked up and just lost so much. We didn't have a statewide vaccine mandate for the COVID vaccine. And maybe that's why people look and say, oh, look, he wasn't that bad. But in that circumstance, I kind of see it as an abused spouse. Like, oh, he doesn't beat me all the time. You know, we have good days. Right, because I'm telling you, I mean, his name is on that very short list of like not insane Democrats. And I would love to interview him and discuss some of this stuff. So we shall see. I think you should interview him. And like I said, like, Kena, I've had great conversations together. I brought him to he came into my Washington DC office. And we talked about water. And it was a very productive conversation that we had about water. Colorado doesn't have a lack of that resource. We have an overallocation problem. And so he and I are trying to work together to see how we can store more of that water. It's a low hanging fruit. And you just came from California. Well, California takes a lot of our water. And it's really frustrating when you see hundreds of billions of gallons of water being dumped into the ocean rather than stored in California after we sent that precious resource downriver. Do you sense that Colorado is going to just sort of have what now? Although Colorado, I think, is somewhat purple, it's going to have what the blue states have, which is that the big cities, so mostly Denver, we'll just go increasingly blue and the rural areas will just go increasingly red. And then we'll just have that nonstop tension. Yes. So I do see increasingly blue, but our red areas, I do think that those are turning more purple. I get my race. I won by 546 votes. Our oil and gas industry is gone. We've been regulated into poverty in our communities. The Colorado's third district no longer has that industry like we did. And those companies have left. They've taken with them their employees and their families. And it has impacted us dramatically. And I have all of the tourist towns, most of the tourist towns in my district. I have tell you, right, I've asked Ben, I've gone with springs. We just had redistricting, but I used to have steamboat springs and we have your ray, but Californians are moving into those areas and they're able to afford it. The taxes are cheaper in Colorado than they were in California. So they're like, this is great. But they're taking their policies from California and bringing them to Colorado. Yeah. So are you seeing that for sure? Because it's really interesting. What I've noticed is the people that are coming to Florida and where I live in the suburbs in Miami, it's all new people. But they get it. They really do get it. Everyone, like you can feel it. Like, no, I'm here to keep Florida free. I wear my Florida hat so all the OGs know that I'm cool. But do you sense that it's a different type really that's coming to Colorado? That kind of makes sense in a way. Yes. People are not coming to Colorado for freedom. They're coming to Colorado for a lifestyle that they're accustomed to and even policies that they have voted for in the past. But they don't recognize that they failed them. And that's why they're leaving. So they think, oh, if we try a new form of socialism, right? This type hasn't been tried yet. So we'll try it over here in this state. Socialism with snow. Right. Yes. Socialism with snow. Yeah. And so unfortunately, it's not the same as Florida. Florida is doing amazing. And I mean, I'm envious of how great Florida is doing. You have America's governor and we're just getting more and more blue, more and more liberal in these extreme policies, red flag laws. We were at the top of the list to get red flag laws. And now our state legislature is wanting to increase those or wanting to ban any kind of firearm with a detachable magazine. I mean, first we start off with high capacity magazine bans in 2013. And now it's we want to ban all firearms that have a detachable magazine. It's just as extreme as you can imagine. And I'm doing everything that I can to bring awareness to it, show people, hey, your votes matter. We have the government that we deserve. We have to be engaged. We have to be involved. And then certainly help to strengthen Colorado's third district. So we're not 546 votes away from an election. Right. I was going to say Colorado was it 546 votes? Yes. After a weekend. How long did it take? It was like a full two weeks or? Oh, gosh. Oh, no, it was longer than that. It was in December when we had the final count. I was the last Republicans race to be called. So we had one, it was an automatic recount. And so we had to go in cure ballots. And so if a ballot was rejected because of their signature, we were able to contact that voter and get it corrected. We cured about 700 ballots and then won by 546. So that entire effort to cure those ballots every single one of them mattered. Man, those go the wrong way. You could have ended up in Florida. You could have. Yes. All right. On a less humorous note for a moment, let's just. So we're taping this on Tuesday. Obviously, there was this shooting in Tennessee yesterday. We're going to post this on Thursday. So some of this may move a little bit on the information we find. The basics of what I could see was the way it's just how everything is framed in this crazy media lens. Like now it sounds like this was a biological woman girl who I guess identified as a male or at least used male pronouns. This is going to cause the anti-gun people to go for the guns. It's going to cause the people who are pissed about the woke stuff to go after the trans people. Like is there any way to have a conversation about this in a sane way at this point? Can we just put personal responsibility on people and say this was a terrible person who did a terrible thing? I mean, I do think that we have a mental crisis here and a mental health crisis in the United States that's growing and really being encouraged. But I don't want to go after an entire group of people for something that one person did. Just like the left goes after all gun owners when something like this happens. Look, I'm from Colorado. We're at the epicenter of these school shootings and it's absolutely terrible. But you don't disarm law abiding citizens because of one nut job who did a horrible heinous act. And so also looking at Nashville, who stopped this crazed shooter? A good guy with a gun. And so, I mean, this has to be something that we focus on. I was actually just in a committee hearing. And let me say, I was in the airport yesterday when I went on this broke and my boys and I prayed together just the families and everyone affected. And I know the left goes after that. We don't want your thoughts and prayers and this and that. But I mean, I believe in prayer and that works. And I know the power of the wraparound presence of the Holy Spirit and how he can just comfort and heal broken hearts. And so, I mean, that's something that we did together when we heard about this. And but there's so much I was in the committee hearing on the ATF rule with the pistol brace. And I actually got completely sidetracked because I wanted to say something that I had said in years past and used to believe. I wanted to start off and say, we don't differ in our hearts. We differ in data. But I stopped myself and he said, no, we do differ in our hearts because I don't want any child killed. And they're talking about this as the leading cause of death for our youth is gun violence. And he said, no, not even close. Actually, it's abortion. You know, we're aborting nearly one. One new meme that they're using constantly now. I haven't seen that one yet. Well, that is gun violence. Oh, yes. Yes. But yeah, I mean, we're up to nearly a million a year. And that's never discussed. And so we do differ in our hearts because every life is valuable. This why I'm so proud of my son and his girlfriend for choosing life. And then if you look at rural and urban areas, the teen pregnancy rate isn't much different. But the teen abortion rate is much higher in urban areas than it is in rural areas because we value life. We care about that and do have personal responsibility. So we want to look at data and see what we can do to protect life. And I want to arm teachers. I want to have secure schools. There was an idea I proposed in the last Congress to take some of the unspent COVID money and secure schools, protect our children. We protect Congress with fences and miles of razor wire and tens of thousands of armed national guards because walls work and armed security works. We secure our airports. We secure our banks. Why not our most precious asset, our children? Let me assume about the arming teachers thing because I'm not. There's part of me that's not inherently against it. But then when you see how many teachers are actually left wing activists, how many teachers are actually teaching this woke craziness? How many teachers are clearly not good at their job or actually quite negligent in their response? What do you do about that? Because it's not as if you're just going to hand guns people train them and they're going to be ideologically lined up with you in a way that's going to make any sort of sense. Correct. Those woke teachers are going to be volunteering to be armed. There's certainly circumstances that are always beyond my imagination. But in Colorado, we actually have a law that allows teachers to be armed. It's up to the school board. If the school board says teachers can be certified, then they go through the certification and we have an organization faster Colorado that trains teachers. It's a very extensive tactical training course that they're taught how to be responsible with this firearm. Most have had experience. You have retired military personnel, retired law enforcement. I think that having some presence there able to defend the students is a really good thing. It doesn't have to be every teacher. It doesn't have to be the majority of teachers. But even knowing that there is someone there to stop an imminent threat, I think that is a large enough deterrent because even we're hearing reports, I don't know how true they are, but we're hearing reports that the shooter in Nashville, whom I won't name, nor give pronouns, said this was a soft target. This person knew that this school was not going to be able to stop the shooting. So at what point though, I know you don't want to blame groups and I think that's important. I literally didn't tweet about it yesterday because I was just like, I just don't want to add in the midst of the craziness. No, everyone gets in on it for clicks and all that stuff. But at what point do you think the Democrat rhetoric, and this is what they do to you guys all the time, the Republicans are always defending guns in his air fault. So I don't want to do that same thing. But at what point when you constantly tell this group of people that they're oppressed, that there's a trans genocide, that all of this stuff that is just patently untrue, at what point do you have to look at your colleagues and be like, do you see there is a problem here? You actually are radicalizing a certain set of people. Right. No, I do think that that's true. And that is something that we need to speak of, just as one particular instance, I don't want to blame all of the people. Yes, there is a mental health crisis and the left is only escalating it. They are increasing this mental health crisis rather than addressing it. Gender dysphoria used to be something that you went and got help for. And now it's encouraged and it's pushed on our youth. You know what, what an adult chooses to do, do it. But when you are confusing our children, when you are sexualizing our children, that is where the line has to be drawn. When you are telling elementary students, three year olds, five year olds, you could be a boy, you could be a girl. Well, they could be a mermaid. I wanted to be a mermaid when I was four. You know, I lived in the pool and you know, it's Decepticon. Decepticon. Yes. So, I mean, this is a problem and it is radicalizing a group. We even saw, or I saw a CNN article that says, if you've ever tweeted a meme of a black woman, well, then that's digital blackface face. This is the new, oppress me of the day. You know, oppress me please. And you know, when you're telling someone, you're not good enough. You are oppressed. You are the lesser person. You are the lesser class. Well, and that's going to get in inside of them and cause depression and more mental health crises. So, it is something that I believe that the left is radicalizing and encouraging. So, what do you do to reach across the island? Because I'm doing about 10 or 12 interviews, all with Republicans when I'm here, we reached out to Democrats, not one responded. And I spoke to Senator Ron Johnson yesterday. He basically said, well, none of the Democrats will talk to me. I spoke to Crenshaw and he said, well, kind of on the DL, they'll talk to him and some of them aren't that crazy. Gates gave me a similar version to that. Who are the not crazy ones? Do they talk to you? And is there anything that can be done with them? I mean, if I'm too scary of an interview for them, it's like, I'm not known for the hard wall interview. I try to listen to people. Yes, you do. But they won't sit here. I mean, that's the thing. Yes. Well, I mean, that's the problem because the Democrat party has their marching orders. We saw it during the speakers race. Everyone's yelling at the Republicans saying, you have to get unified. You, this looks crazy. Well, we have independent thought. The Democrats were told what to do. And they did exactly what they were told to do. Right. Even the radicals like AOC, Trump, or Democrat. Absolutely. And even the Congress before that, you know, they had, they were forming a coup to take down Nancy Pelosi. And they took the deal. They said, you know what? My committee assignments. Good enough. Thank you, ma'am. Right. And walked on. And so, in so much of this, they don't want to engage. We see it in debate. They want to say their side and leave. They don't want to hear the opposing views. A lot of times, if I'm debating on the House floor, I'll go early. I'll hear what the Democrats have to say. My colleagues have to say, I'll stay later. I even asked somebody for their time so I could go up and respond. Right. But that- Because anyone else do that, I feel like nobody listens to the talks. Like, someone gets up their talk and that like, nobody's there, but it's on CSPAN or we see the clips. It is very rare. Yeah. Because you do have your scheduled times and our days are really busy here. So I understand it. But usually you go in for your two minutes. That's what you have to speak. Maybe it's five minutes and then you get out and you're on to the next meeting. And it almost feels like it's by design to keep us so busy that we can't engage when our colleagues. And back to the speakers race, that was one of my favorite parts about it. Those four days, we were all together on the House floor debating, engaging in conversations with our colleagues. I talked to Republicans I had never spoke to before. I talked to Democrats I had never spoke to before. And it was a wonderful four days of actually getting to know and understand one another. Were you worried that, I mean, you were at, you know, ultimately you guys got some concessions, were you worried as one of the most outspoken people sort of against McCarthy that you were going to pay a price just personally? Even if you got. Absolutely. But that wasn't going to be what determined what I was doing. I couldn't say, you know, oh, I'm never going to be reelected again. If that's my only thought is my next election, then I have no business being here. I need to do what I believe is right. That's what I was sent here to do. I convinced and promised hundreds of thousands of people that I'm a leader, that I'm strong, I'm principled, I'm going to stand for them and fight for them. And so I wasn't going to sit back and go along to get along and say, oh, my committee assignment, oh, I don't want a primary. I don't want leadership spending money against me in a race or, you know, any kind of repercussions, whatever you could think of. I knew to do what was right. And this was all about these negotiations that we had started in the summer and in good faith. And I'm glad that Speaker McCarthy saw the merit and what we were asking for and gave them to us. I want to use more of the tools that we received. And some of them is just not time for them yet. Like the Holman rule that'll come up more in appropriations. But I don't want to only admire what we received. I want to put these tools to work. I'm interviewing him later today at the Capitol. Is there anything I can push him on for you? You know, anything you need a little nudge on? I actually think because I like the fact that he seems like he's coming alive with this stuff. He does. He really does. I think Speaker McCarthy is doing a really great job. And I'm not just saying that. He is very aggressive on this. Even the January 6 videos that he released, that wasn't part of the concessions. That was a bonus. You know, and so this is amazing. If there's anything that I want to be more aggressive on, it's subpoenas. We had, and this isn't anything against Chairman Comer or Pat Fallon, who's the subcommittee chair and the subcommittee, we had the ATF hearing. We had an ATF hearing without the ATF. I want the ATF in. They are coming in April, but I want to start issuing these subpoenas and being very aggressive with it. The Democrats are. So I'm glad you mentioned that because you were part of the Twitter hearings and there was a great viral moment where you basically were like, you guys did this to me. Like you did it to me and I'm a Congresswoman. And this is what I've asked everyone else who was sat here over the last couple of days. What actually comes of this stuff other than, okay, we can expose some of it. So you bring out a Twitter executive. He kind of did some bad stuff, sort of sometimes did some decent stuff. But what about the government side? Like when are we going to drag or when are you guys going to drag out the government agents who actually were communicating with them as opposed to the Twitter guys who, it's not that I have sympathy for them, but they're private employees who were probably in over their head and whatever. Yeah. And so we did have FBI, former FBI agent Baker that was there, but he was working for Twitter. In fact, we do need to bring in these people, but we called those hearings, Twitter file hearings part one. So we are going to have more. But unfortunately, Dave, I do think that these next two years are two years of exposure. And I want to expose the federal employees who are involved in this more than anything. And then hopefully the inspectors generals look at this and there's some sort of referral that we can actually get criminal referrals for some of the things that have been done. But I don't know if we can do that in this administration. Right. So basically you need a Republican administration to actually do anything. So the hope is you can get people to know enough about it temporarily. Right. Well, all the top guys are Biden's guys right now. So that is our biggest struggle. So we have to build this case. We have to expose what's been hidden from the American people for years. There has been no oversight in the House of Representatives. And there still isn't much oversight in the Senate. The Democrats have the gavel there and they aren't going to bring in serious people to have this oversight. So it's our job to carry the weight of the House and the Senate and make up for those years where there was no oversight conducted. Not to beat a dead horse, but were there any Democrats on that in that hearing that were like, Oh, actually, even though I'm a Democrat, they were mostly going after conservatives. This is a violation of the First Amendment. Maybe like even on the DL, did anyone say? You know, if there were, I didn't hear of it. And so everything was extreme mega Republicans. And you know, I did set the record straight and said, listen, we are not extreme mega Republicans. It is ultra mega. But we were exposing how, you know, the federal government worked with Twitter to suppress the Hunter Biden laptop story. They didn't want to touch that. They, everything is January six. And they're, they're using what they know works because it did work for them in the last election. But now we're exposing what happened during January six, what happened with the censorship, what happened with the lockdowns, the fraud, the waste of abuse with the COVID funds and Afghanistan, other committees are having hearings on that. We, we had a soldier that had the bomber, the suicide bomber in his sights. And he was not allowed to neutralize that threat in his sights. And now we have 13 of our soldiers killed. I mean, absolutely disgusting, but we are exposing what was going on and the American people are going to see it. And I hope in the next two to four years, we have actual accountability. I don't want any show pony hearings like Benghazi. I want people to be held accountable. And so did the American people. Do you think it's kind of funny would Biden keep saying, you know, the extreme mega Republicans or ultra mag or whatever, like he's sort of talking about your wing of the thing as if you guys are completely running the show. And the whole point is that you guys were on the outside and had to fight for a lot of that. But he's, he's basically trying to paint everybody as if you, you and Matt and Gates and a couple of people are talking. If they want us to run the show, let's run it because we have some really great ideas. I mean, look at even the debt ceiling proposal. It was a house Freedom Caucus that came out and said, we have a plan. We aren't going to default on our nation's debt, but we're going to claw back some of this stuff, some of the unspent COVID funding, the, the student loan program, we're taking that back. You know, I mean, if you wanted to do pennies on the dollar, we're not building your $500 million FBI building that you that you need that your brand new building. And so there's a lot of the things they're going for. The FBI needs a $500 million building. Yeah. You know, really important. Oh gosh. So there, there are things that we can absolutely, they worked so hard. You know, it was really, it was really the raid, you know, like they're like, hey, we need a bonus, you know, after this Marlago raid. So we have a plan, Joe Biden's plan, it increases taxes on everyone. They are doing nothing to reduce inflation, to increase energy development. Everything that they're doing will increase inflation and reduce energy. We have 20 million Americans that can't pay afford their utility bills right now. We have a wide open southern border. We want it secure. We want the flow of fentanyl to stop. And so we have a plan. And I told Joe Biden in our press conference, I said, we're meeting tonight on the hill. You want to come here, put down your ice cream, join us. We'll have a conversation and you know, it's funny. The guy keeps coming downstairs and says the only reason I'm down here for ice cream and I'm starting to believe it. Like that's the only reason he's coming downstairs. Like I like ice cream. Yeah. And everybody's like, oh, there's the old man who likes ice cream. Exactly. Well, we hear about the horrible tragedy in Nashville. And he says, I hear there's chocolate chip cookies. He literally did like a five minute stand up routine about ice cream when he came down. Yes. All right, let me ask you one more. I know you hit the gym before you got here. You got a long day of stuff. You got to get out of here. One more for you. So you talked about what's going to happen in two years, hopefully. Obviously, this thing seems to be like going back and forth between the Trump to Santa thing. I know you love Trump. You obviously said some nice things about the Santa's here. I think you have a sense of where I'm at on this thing. What's your general take? And actually, do you think there is a way which would be my preference that it doesn't have to end up in destruction of one or both? Yeah. That would be the best way. But I just don't know if it's possible. Correct. I at this point, I don't know if it's possible either. I think there's room in this tent for both of both President Trump and Governor Ron DeSantis. I would love for this to not end ugly. I have endorsed President Trump. I do endorse President Trump. I believe that he will be our nominee. Obviously, Governor DeSantis has not announced that he's running at this time. But even the way the left is still going after President Trump with the DA in New York, they do not want him to run because they know that he will win. And I mean, think about it. They're not going after Nikki Haley. She's a member of the club. She's paid her dues. They're not worried about her. But they are going after President Trump still. They have not left this man or his family alone at all. And I think Governor DeSantis has great potential to be President of the United States. I just wanted to wait until 2028. Any final thoughts? Or should we end up at that scene pretty clear? I love President Trump and Governor DeSantis. You just keep Florida strong for a while. Well, the funny thing is for me, I'm like, look, if Trump ends up the president and DeSantis stays governor, like, I'm freaking thrilled. I'll be thrilled if DeSantis is the president. It's like, that's why I just don't want the mutually assured destruction. That seems like it's on the way. So we shall see. We shall see. Good luck for the rest of the day. I'll try to nudge McCarthy for you. Thanks. Yes. Let's get some subpoenas. We've issued tens so far. Let's make it hundreds. Thanks, Dave. Thanks for tuning in to The Rubin Report.
