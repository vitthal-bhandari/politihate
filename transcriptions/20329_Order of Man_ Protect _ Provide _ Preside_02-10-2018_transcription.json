    "text": " What does it mean to be a complete beast? This is a question my guest Jack Donovan intends to answer in his latest book appropriately titled a more complete beast. There is a reason the title is likely to resonate with you as a man. Each of us understands that we are both man and beast. Today we cover so much about the subject of masculinity including why being a man has to be an intentional choice, the power of what he calls the conquering eye, how to avoid becoming a victim and how each and every one of us can become a more complete beast. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. You boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Micler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast, the Order of Man. As I say every single week, I am glad that you are tuning in. We need more men engaged in this fight, more fathers, more husbands, more business owners, more community leaders. I mean, you look around in society and it has become evident that the gap or the void of real, strong, motivated, ambitious men is very visible, is fully present. And so it's my goal and my objective and my job to help give you the tools and the resources and the guidance and direction to reclaim and restore what it means to be a man in a society that has a hard time understanding why men are relevant, why men are important. And of course, we know they are, but it's my job to bring the mission to the masses. And so with that said, I ask if you're listening in, if you've got any value from this at all, please go on, leave your iTunes rating and review for the show. We're doing a giveaway between now and the end of this month, which is coming up very, very quickly, September 2018. We're giving away hat, shirts, signed copies of my book sovereignty, one-on-one calls, you name it, we're giving those away, if you'd be willing to go on and leave a rating and review. Very quick and easy way to say thank you for what we're providing here. Again, if you've got any value out of this now, guys, this has been a crazy couple of weeks, just about a week and a half, two weeks ago. Now, we got done with our legacy event, which is a father son event. We did that in the hills of Utah, southern Utah, which is my hometown, my backyard. And man, what an incredible, incredible event. So much so that I'm already thinking about the next one, which is going to be held in spring, in the springtime of 2019. So please stay tuned on that because I guarantee that thing will sell out quick based on the feedback we received, not only from the attendees who a lot of them will be coming back, but also you guys, you listening in and how you can create rights and passages for yourself and your boys. And again, this is called our legacy event. So stay tuned for that. Outside of that, what else? Well, we've got our friends over at Origin Main. I just got a surprise in the mail.

Let's get into the conversation. This is a much requested guest. And I had him on the show about, I want to say it was probably about three years ago is one of my very, very first guests. This is a guy that a lot of you are familiar with. And of course, I've had him on the show before his name is Jack Donovan. He is the author of several books. I know a lot of you have read on the subject of modernity and masculinity, including the way of men, a sky without eagles becoming a barbarian and his latest release, which is a great book. And when we talk about today, a more complete beast, as you may know, Jack is a fascinating man and probably one that you wouldn't expect to hear on this podcast. In fact, I made a joke about Jack, a pagan and myself, a Mormon walking into an axe throwing bar just after this interview that we did. That's it guys. His views on the subject of masculinity and manliness, although controversial at times resonate with so many of us because they're just spot on and refreshing in a time where more and more of society has a hard time even discussing what it means to be a man. So sit back, take some notes, get ready for a fascinating discussion on the subject of masculinity. Jack, what's up brother? Thanks for joining me on the show today. No problem. Here we are live from the amazing what is this red line? Red line? Red line and R L. They've rebranded. R L. Yes, they've done a wonderful job. It's actually kind of nice. I came here once. I think I've been into this hotel once for a conference or something. So I was glad we could connect. We were actually supposed to do this what a couple of weeks ago or last week or something. And I read the book and I was like, no, you're so close. And we can just meet somewhere central. I mean, just do this in person. And I've been doing a lot more interviews. I don't even say interviews anymore. Just conversations in person. It's way better than doing it via Skype, which is what I used to be doing. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. So cool, man. Yeah, I read your book, a more complete beast. So awesome. So good. Thank you. Obviously, that's what we're going to be talking about today. But tell me what that even means. Because I think that'll set the framework and the premise for the rest of discussion that we'll have today. A more complete beast, it comes from a quote from nature to begin with, becoming a more complete man is becoming a more complete beast. The same thing. We are creatures that have our own nature. When I talk about becoming a more complete beast, it sounds awesome. Because everyone wants to be a beast. It does. You've got the marketing and branding side of it down for sure. Because I know guys are going to hear that, even the podcast title, they're like, I want to listen to this one. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I know it goes significantly deeper than that. Yeah, I mean, it's really not about the deadlifting heavier or whatever it is about just becoming more of what you are and that quest to become more of what you are as a man. I kind of wanted to investigate that process and making that decision, I think, is very interesting as well. Because one thing that we've talked about is that in the modern world, maybe you don't have to be a man. It's not a requirement. Yeah, it used to be maybe. Yeah, I mean, there's no bears coming down to kill your family and take your food. Maybe if you live in Baltimore or like, like, like, that's the place where there's take people's foods. Metaphorically, I suspect. If you live in a rough neighborhood, then maybe you actually do have to be a lot more concerned with security. There's more risk involved. Yeah, but I think average guy maybe lives in a cul-de-sac somewhere. No one's out to get you. You know, you can really kind of sleepwalk through life. Never actually have to challenge yourself and be a man and take that role and put yourself in a situation where you're going to be at risk. We're not going to have another great world war where we are all drafted tomorrow to go fight and have this great heroic experience. For the modern man, I think, I guess, contemporary man. What would you say? What's the difference when you say, I just need to interrupt between modern and contemporary? Well, I think modern actually has a kind of place in history, like modernist. Okay, sure. It has a little bit more of a charged meaning. Right, contemporary now. Yeah, contemporary is just right now. Sure. Guy's living right now. You know, if you want to be more manly and be, you know, more complete beast, more of what you are, you're making a choice to do that because no one's forcing you to. Right. You know, he's going to ask you to step up. Yeah, you're not going to have to be initiated in anything. There aren't a whole bunch of people that are going to make you go and behave a certain way. In fact, you're encouraged to not be masculine in many ways. Why do you think that is? I agree with you. I think one of the first things you said is become more of who you are. And yet I think generally society is saying, no, no, no, don't become more of who you are, become less of who you are. Most of the messages you get through the mainstream media is to really become more like women. Right. And they don't frame it that way because well, it's too obvious. Exactly. Exactly. It's too obvious. Because if you said, hey, be a woman, a guy's going to reject that. If you embrace or try to introduce more effeminate characteristics or qualities into men, like compassion, kindness, love, empathy, those sorts of things, yeah, that men certainly can display. But if that's all you're asking men to do and be, that's not as challenging or like you said, confrontational as be a woman. Basically, they don't want you to challenge yourself to be a man. Sure. And I think that that's because it makes you a threat to other people. I mean, it's they view of being a man as being a threat. Is that what you're saying? I think so. I mean, imagine if you're, say, the weakest kid in school and then imagine the people who are the most masculine above you. Sure. There's a mindset feels kind of oppressed by that. In all fairness, throughout history, the oppression has been perpetrated by those types of individuals. Well, sure. Yeah, I mean, the strong. But that doesn't make it wrong. Yeah, I mean, that's, you know, the strong are going to rule the weak. That's kind of what happens. So the better solution is, from my perspective, is not to pull down the strong is to lift up the weak, like stopping weak. Yeah, be better. I mean, I think that that's the choice that we're talking about. Like, do you want to just be the lowest version of yourself? The easy version that lays on a couch doesn't have to do anything, never get stronger, never challenges himself, just watches TV. Or do you want to go out and seek those challenges and become a better man by yourself? I think that's the challenge that we're talking about. And if you become better, then imagine all those other people around you who are sitting on the couch. That's kind of threatening to them, right? Sure. It calls out their weakness. Well, you're asking them now to look in the mirror, which is the other men. And well, I don't look like that guy, and I'm not performing like this guy. And I don't have the relationship or the fitness or the wealth or the whatever that the strong usually acquire. Trying to be better doesn't mean that you're going to end up on the top of the mountain. Of course. You know, you can be a better version of yourself for men being a better version yourself is being more masculine, kind of tapping into those qualities that we have. How do you define masculinity? Because I know there's a lot of people out there who confuse, well, from my perspective, the difference between masculinity and manliness, and we can talk about that more masculinity and men those are not even the same concepts. So how do you define masculinity? That's kind of the whole project of my first book, The Way of Men. And which we talked about, by the way, a couple of years ago, right when I very first got started. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. I always say, if your building was being surrounded by zombies right now, what would you need from the other guys around you? And I think that's very much how men judge each other and always have like those evolutionary characteristics. And I break it down into four tactical virtues, strength, courage, mastery, and honor. Those, I think, are different from cultural ideas about being a man. And that's another distinction I make is being good at being a man, which is that strength, courage, mastery, and honor, and being a good man, which changes from culture and religion. And they're all different rules and they change all the time. Sure. And I think both are necessary to, right? I mean, I think it's important that we have, well, I don't want to say virtuous because there might be some confusion about what we're talking about because you're talking about the four tactical virtues, which is, I believe, application, what a man actually provides and creates versus philosophically being a good man, what he believes in his morals. And that's why I tried to separate him out is because ends up being a big gray area because that's not really about being a man anymore. Because, you know, if you're talking about compassion, well, that could be a virtue, and it could be a good virtue to have. But it's not specific to being a man. Right. But are the others? I mean, if you look at the tactical virtue, strength, honor, mastery, courage, I mean, those aren't really specific to, I would say that they are rooted in our biology. I mean, men are statistically stronger than women. Right. I mean, that is one of the things that distinguishes us. Sure. So that doesn't go away. And the argument people always make is, I know this one woman who could kick those other guys, but of course, cherry picking, you're picking the cream of the crop with one metric strength, with females, and comparing it to the weakest of the men when it comes to a trancling. Yeah, I assure there are female MMA fighters who have trained their entire life who could beat me up. That's not what we're talking about. We're talking about in big groups of people, because that's what we're generalizing. We're talking about big groups of people, historically, and I think in any culture anywhere in the world, strength and masculinity are together. Right. Because it is one of the things that defined us, and men are kind of getting weaker today. And I think the sex differentiation is getting smaller. You mean more, maybe not, maybe you do mean biologically, but just the way that we perform the way that we behave, the way we act, in what ways? Well, possibly biologically, I mean, there is a decline in testosterone that's going down. Sure. And so you can kind of see that in people's faces, I think. But again, it's not everybody. It's a trend. Right. You know, there are a lot of different things that you can talk about in that way. I don't know. I think it is really important that we do talk about the tactical virtues, what makes men men. And I think that people get so, for whatever reason, they get so upset when you talk about what it actually means to be a man, or masculinity in general, or when you start talking about these tactical virtues. The point that we were talking about earlier is that men aren't needed as much. Right. And so I think what you're saying is that this is more of deciding to be a man is more of a decision than a necessity. Yes. How it used to be. Yes, absolutely. How do you begin to step more into this and make it a choice that masculinity and maliness is now a virtue that a guy strives to become more of? I mean, I think, you know, those tactical virtues are kind of a good place to start. I mean, obviously, if you're not very strong, that's an easy one to work on. I mean, you can become stronger. That quote, I think it's a rippet to quote that, you know, stronger people are just more useful in general, or harder to kill harder to kill. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Which may or may not be true, but it depends on where you're trying to kill an individual. Yeah, I mean, I've been choked out with my own bicep before. So I don't know if that works, but only so much muscle can do exactly, exactly. Strength can mean a lot of things. You don't want to go down that rabbit hole, making everything the same. People do that with definitions, especially today that all of a sudden strength can mean anything. I think you actually called me out on that. Oh, because I said, I said something like, what did I say? Oh, I said humility is strength. Oh, and you're like, no, strength is strength. Humility is a virtue or characteristic, which is great. Yeah, yeah. But it's not strength. Yeah, which I thought was interesting. I was fascinating. It made sense to me. And you know, a lot of feminists do that kind of stuff like, you know, strength is whatever we say it is today, because strength is recognized as a high value. You know, men do this, women do this, every does it. And it's a terrible habit. You take a word that has a high value, and then you try and make it mean whatever you already are. Yeah. And that's a it's terrible. Right. It's a bad habit. And you know, it's like, well, strength is strength. And okay, we're going to say that strength is lifting X amount of weight or whatever. Other virtues that you may possess, they're fine too. But they, but they may not be strength. But I think we do the opposite. You see people, somebody to disagree with and they'll say, we are a Nazi. It's like, do you understand what that word means? Because just because I think X, Y and Z does not categorize me as a Nazi. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I think we do it. I think we do it both ways. Like you try to just completely villainize individuals by making them or associating them with words and concepts that have nothing to do with what that individual is thinking or behaving. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. It goes either way. So as far as becoming more a more complete beast, I guess, obviously you can become stronger. And then you can put yourself in situations where you have to do things that you don't want to do. Yeah. You know, for a lot of people, that might be like martial arts and getting punched in the face or even just going to give a toast at a wedding or a speaking book. Yeah. I mean, something uncomfortable. Right. Yeah. I mean, physical is great. You should probably do that. That's important, but it doesn't necessarily have to be only that. Exactly. Exactly. It's just putting yourself in a situation that you feel in danger in some way. My buddy Greg, he's like a former special forces guy and he was like, oh, we should do rock climbing. I'm like, I'm not a big fan of it. Did you do it though? We haven't met up yet. Maybe we'll do it. Maybe we won't. I've done a little bit of delaying or whatever with somebody before or whatever. It's just not my favorite. I'm like, I'd run short of your pants in the face. But you guys are out of trade. He comes and you get to punch him in the face and you'll get a little rock climbing with them. Anyway, doing things that are outside of your comfort zone and pushing yourself, those are the ways that you become more confident with what you're able to do. Right. That's a big issue because a lot of guys deal with confidence and they're like, how do I build confidence? You're not entitled to confidence. There are some people who I believe or maybe a little bit more prideful or arrogant, but I don't even think that's confidence. I think that's an inflated sense of ego. But if you want genuine confidence, you have to earn it by doing things that you didn't previously think you could have done. Absolutely. Absolutely. That's all we're talking about here, really, is gaining that confidence and become a more valuable member of whatever group you're part of. Mastery, I think I used that as a blanket one because I think just men generally appreciate the skills in each other. If you were in a primitive tribe, it's not necessarily the strongest guy or the most greatest guy, but the guy who can use the bow and arrow the best is really valuable. Right. But it's interesting because people have a problem with that. If you look around, I think people want the quality so bad, they're willing not to get better at the bow and arrow, for example, or even metaphorically, but that they will tear the other guy down because they want an equal outcome, even though there's different qualities and characteristics and strengths and virtues that we all inherently possess. There's things that you're better at naturally than I am. So we'll never have a level playing field because we all start at a different place and level. Yeah, life has never been fair. It's never been fair. It never will be. But isn't that, but to me, I hear that I'm like, life's not fair. Well, okay, then that means that I can look at you and think, okay, this guy's got an advantage over me and X, Y, and Z, but yeah, to fill in the blank because that's an incomplete thought. Yeah. The other thought is, then that means I've got an advantage over him in these other areas. Yeah. And I think that's the value of having a band of brothers is having a tribe is having your term a gang. Yeah, yeah. A group of people who work together towards a common objective to achieve something together. Yeah, absolutely. Absolutely. I think by framework for looking at the world was influenced to a certain extent from my father, he had a twin brother. My father got polio right, like right before they invented the vaccine. Yeah. One leg is really small. And he just, there's two ways that you can approach that you can be a victim for your whole life. Right. And there, and there's my dad who tells people he was in a car accident. Oh, yeah, I just have a limp because I was in a car accident. You know what to do with that? Yeah. What he ended up doing, because he couldn't go work on the railroad, like the rest of the family, as he ended up in an office, then he ended up being a really successful electric estimator. Right. And everybody else in the family wasn't, you know, worked in electric, but they're on the railroad. Right. And so he ended up doing really well as an electric estimator. And so he made use of what he had. And that's the beauty of even modern times. Yeah. Is that that option wasn't available 100 years ago. Right. I should say limited. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, there's less things that you could, you know, compensate by doing something else. Sure. But again, I mean, that's not fair. You know, my leg doesn't work. Are you going to live? Yeah. One thing I go back again and again over in the book, living is about thriving. You know, are you going to try and thrive? Or are you just going to complain about how you got a bad, bad hand? Right. I'm going to keep trying to win until I'm dead. Sure. You know, I still want to keep trying to win. And they, okay, something bad happened to you. You can either get stuck in that place, or you can look for, well, what's my next win? What's my next way to move forward? And I think that that's a really important way to think. And that's something I talk about other chapter called the Conquering Eye, I think in the book. And I think that that's a really important way that you need to look at the world. And I think that a lot of winners look at the world that way. Well, and you can see, I mean, you can recognize it. I've got a friend. He's actually coming on the podcast in the next several weeks who he's lost both of his legs. Yeah. He's more active and capable than a large percentage of the men that I know and meet and deal with on a daily basis. Yeah. He just got done with a, a meal deer hunt, shot a really nice buck and to see what he's been able to go through and what he's been able to accomplish. And I never even heard the guy complain. Yeah. I almost wonder, and this is one of the questions I'm going to ask him, if he believes he's better off with the fact that he's lost both of his legs. I'm really curious. Maybe it is. Maybe it isn't. But I'm really curious because the way that I look at it from the outside looking in is he's done an amazing job and he's fully capable as is anybody else. But I think there's a lot of society that, and maybe this is really just self-serving, that will look at an individual like him or anybody who might have some sort of issue like we all have that we've dealt with in the past and want to rescue people that aren't interested in being rescued or they don't even need to be rescued. There are a lot of people who need to nurture something. So they want to reach out and do that. Those people are much more of an inspiration when they lift themselves up. It's good to have help. Sure. And you should be able to accept help. Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. But also know when you need to say no and just do it yourself. Yeah. And I think that's the greater risk. I think more people do that. It's not that they accept help. It's that they cannot or refuse to help themselves. That's the greater danger. Absolutely. Absolutely. Absolutely. So I guess we're going through the four tactical virtues and how to get better. I think because we got to mastery. Right. Well, no, this is all good. It's all the same topic. We're all talking about manliness. So it's all the same thing. So I guess that so that we're keeping it in the framework. I guess the other one, I think this is interesting too because honor has a lot of meanings as well. And that's the fourth tactical virtue. And I use a very simple one because honor has a cultural meaning. I think to me personally, my honor means more than this because that's my cultural sense of honor. And that has to do with my own philosophical code and moral code. So you can find it or use specifically? Yeah. I mean, I think we all have our own version of what that is. We should. Yeah. For me as a writer. And this is something that I struggle with a lot is like I've put a lot of words out there in the world. I'm tied to all of them. So if I change my opinion, I have to find a reason why I can't just say like, I believe one thing, one day, whatever. Yeah. I mean, so I feel like I have a responsibility to at least be attempting on a regular basis to live up to things that I've told other people to do. And so for me, that's that's a huge part of my own personal honor. In the book, and I think is a more general term, I think about honor as do you care about your reputation, basically what the men in your tribe and your group think of you? Because I think you can overextend that to care about what the whole world thinks about you. And then that's a problem. That's a terrible thing. Well, because you're worrying about people that have no relevancy in your life. No investment in skidding the game. Because you hear this and I think you've been addressed this in the book. If I remember correctly, where there's this like zero F's mentality, like I don't care about anybody or anything else. Yeah. Well, hold on. I kind of understand maybe a little bit about what you're saying, but I think there's certain people and their opinions that you probably should care about. Like I care about your opinion because I respect who you are. That doesn't make me any weaker. In fact, now I have another perspective that I can appreciate and take into consideration when defining my honor code. Yeah, exactly. If we're talking about that survival band, you know, if the zombies are coming to survival band and so forth, I mean, those other guys, their opinion has to matter to you. Because if it doesn't matter to you, then you're like, we're all going to go down the road and do this thing. And you're like, yeah, I'm not doing that. Well, if it doesn't matter, I mean, because and then you're on trustworthy. Right. And so if you don't care what they think about you're on trustworthy, well, then you're ostracized from the group. Yeah, exactly. Or you should be. That's the kind of base level of honor being tied into that kind of approval system. And then it kind of builds out into your reputation among men and for us in contemporary times, it's your reputation among, as you said, the men who you respect for some reason, not every person on the street. Yeah. You know, I feel that way about like people who, you know, you're in a bar fights and stuff like that all the time. It's like, is any random drunk, the one who's going to allow that to change the course of your life? Yeah, that's what you're going to use. That guy's opinions matter. So you know, like, if my friend calls me, then we're going to throw it out. Maybe we're going to have a problem. Or if your friend does, you might actually say, maybe he's right. Exactly. I guess I respect his opinion. I mean, you have to choose these people around you who you respect their opinion. And then, you know, if they say something that that upsets you, you have, we have to talk that out. Yeah, it's interesting. Because I see these guys who were like, and I don't know, you know, if you watch like a like a prison show or a, you know, jail, where these, they do the prison tours or whatever and people are in there. This guy disrespected me. I'm like, yeah, who disrespect like only you decide to be disrespected. Yeah. Right. Like I'm not going to give, you know, who disrespects you every day, the prison guard. Right. Think of that. It's what we're doing. That's funny. That's interesting. Yeah. Yeah. But you're cool with that. Right. Yeah. That's that's okay with you. So this is an interesting thought because you're talking about reputation within your, your gang or your tribe. Yeah. But then you're also talking about not really caring that other people disrespect you or don't appreciate you or what they care about. So it's like, it's, I think it's hard for guys to find like who they should care about and what opinions they should value. Yeah. No, absolutely. Absolutely. And then I think that that's really has to do with them not being very rooted and not really having like group that they're identified with. Because I think that if you have a community that you're tied into, you kind of know who's opinion you need to respect. You know, we could talk about a kind of a larger metaphorical community of like, you know, like like minded people who are talking to each other and I would respect their opinion. You know, if you actually have a group that you identify with, I think that that's something very alien to a lot of people in contemporary world because they just, they go to their job, they know a few people, then they switch jobs and they, they're not rooted really in any community or anything. It may also makes it very easy to not live up to any kind of honor because everyone's disposable. Right. You know, but people are and they will know you for very long. Right. There's no long term consequence for your thoughts, actions and ideas. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly. And that's part of being a group. I mean, is working out those problems and it's challenging. But I also think there's, I don't know if this is a trend necessarily or just something out there in society that says we have to avoid being part of a tribe or a quote unquote group think. So where's the line? Is there a line? Well, that comes from a variety of places, I think. One, I would say is American individualism. In America, especially, you have the Clint Eastwood kind of cowboy. Sure. Ideal of he's by himself and he's on his own and he's ever, he's the ultimate individual. Right. And I think that a lot of guys in America, I think, kind of trained to idealize that. Or I mean, you think about Jason Bourne, James Bond, they're by themselves. Yeah. They're by themselves. And that's the romantic side. And then the other side is the political side and the political side is that the modern world is defined by globalism. Globalism is anti-tribal. It's anti-identity group. It's identity group in like a superficial way. Our identity group is going to be offended by this or whatever. As far as being an insular group, I mean, there are very few of them that are allowed to survive. You know, everything's about breaking down borders and breaking down walls and, you know, languages disappear. All these things take, you know, you sure you have insular society to create a new language in a culture. Culture has actually disappeared. So is that, I mean, is that bad? Is it good? Is it? My own culture. Yeah. Like, I like different cultures too. I mean, and different cultures actually can't have it unless they're separate. Language is a perfect example. You know, languages start to sound like the same and the same words are used. They overlap. And eventually, it goes separate languages. For example, go away, go away altogether. Now we have this kind of global monoculture. So everyone watches the same TV shows and everyone watches the same news and everybody has the same almost perspective because it's kind of piped into our minds like all around the world go over to Germany. And as soon as I stumble, desperately to try and speak a little German, they speak back to me in perfect California English. I'm like, where'd you learn that? Oh, family guy. Oh, that's funny. Yeah. Yeah. Like, and it's so, these cultures are disappearing. And I'm like, I would love for the Germans to still speak German. Right. You know, and not what I'm saying. But what's really interesting about this too is that, and I've seen this before and I'll try to think of an example, let's say you really enjoy a particular culture. Yeah. German, for example. Sure. And so you're like, well, I want to be part of this culture. It's really interesting because what a lot of people do is they're like, so you have to change to accommodate me because I want to be part of you. Right. No, this is not the way you want to be part of this tribe or this culture, this group. Yeah. You are the one who has to accommodate to us. Exactly. Except for that is not a popular thought. That's taboo. Yeah. Yeah. That is a modern taboo. I mean, because that's the globalism thing is that everyone is supposed to be welcome all the time. And I think that that comes from commerce. You have two gas stations down the street. And one of them says, we're only serving this group of people. And one of them says, we're to serve everyone who's going to win. Right. Everyone. Yeah. Exactly. And I think that's the way the world works. Yeah. Right now. And that's kind of the driving force. I think that has this mentality of the tribalism is bad or that groups are bad and so forth because it's a lot of people trying to compete for your business. And I take advantage of it too, you know, because we have to live in the modern world and take every advantage we can. You know, it is what it is. I always say, boy, caught as a bourgeois former protest. I don't think that you can say, well, I'm not going to do that. And therefore, it's going to stop because that's actually not how it works. Right. There has to be a lot of people that not have a huge block of people to not do it. But I think that happens to over time. Like I think behavior, maybe this isn't the right term, but I think negative behavior, for example, is in a way corrected over time through the beliefs and actions of enough people. I mean, if you look at any metric, whether it's health, wealth, violence, all of those metrics have improved over time because that behavior is corrected through people, through everybody. Right. Right. Right. I tend to think with this kind of stuff we're talking about, the world is going in that particular direction. Like I said, because I think money is more powerful than people talking. Yeah, to a certain extent. Yeah. And then, which is why I would say put your money where your mouth is, right? Exactly. Exactly. But I think that, you know, like there, if you want to change the world, get a billion dollars. You know, to a certain, there's, there's a lot of things. And even that's not really even that much. Yeah. To play with it. Yeah, it is amazing. Because I used to think like, Oh, a million dollars, I want to be a millionaire. I'm like a million dollars. So that'll buy you a pretty nice house. Right. And what do you do next year? Yeah. Yeah. And people say, well, that's a lot of money. I'm not saying that. It is a lot of yeah. I would like some. I'm just saying relatively speaking to what it was maybe 20, 30 years ago, it's really not as much as it used to be. No, not at all. Yeah. Yeah. Interesting. So, well, let's talk about victims. Because one of the things that you really addressed in the book that I liked is this concept of men as victims. And I've seen that. And I'll be honest, maybe even I've fallen prey to that a little bit, even within this organization is that one thing that I think men fight against is feminism. Right. And oh, feminists are out to get us. And so we got to band together and we were the victims of the victims essentially. Right. And that's a really interesting concept that I had not thought about before. It's tricky because you end up becoming the thing you hate. You end up becoming this like, well, they're always victims. And then you're like, they're against me. Yeah. They're coming to your victim and they are coming to get you. They absolutely are. Sure. They do not want you to live in the way that you would like to live. So what? So what? But I mean, I think that you have to see past that because otherwise you're just stuck in that trap. Yeah. And then you're letting someone else control your destiny and really your identity because if you're, if your whole identity is being anti something, that thing actually holds a huge position in your universe that's almost like you're playing not to lose in a way. Yeah. Yeah. And I think that you need to more focus on playing to win. And that's kind of the whole maybe inspiration of this book is instead of being anti something, anti something like, well, okay, what kind of world do you want to live in? Right. What do you want to see more of in the world? What's your dream? Stop talking about these people who are making you not be able to do it, because you know what? Life has always been hard. You know, if you want to romanticize that you wanted to live a thousand years ago, well, you might have been a surf. Right. People talk about all the times like, no, no, I guarantee you living a thousand years ago, regardless of what socioeconomic status you're in right now, I guarantee living a thousand years ago is significantly worse than you are living right now. Regardless, you don't get to live a thousand years ago. You get to live right now. That's true. That's an exercise in futility. Yeah. Yeah. You get to live right now. And so this is your time. And so you have this time, this is all the time you get. And so what you need to do is figure out what kind of life you want to live and what kind of world you want to create around you to the extent of your power. And not worry about all these big things. I mean, everybody wants to talk about and I don't watch the news anymore for this reason. I don't like these people controlling what my day is about sure, what people in New York or LA have decided we're going to talk about today. And you know, and it's usually just, you know, some writer writes the thing that they've been paid to write and they needed something new to come up with to impress their editor and get more traffic and whatever. And then we're all supposed to talk about that today. And that's supposed to define our day. I'm like, no. But the problem though, I mean, let me look at the other side and play devil's advocate on this a little bit because the alternative, I think to what you're suggesting, I don't know, maybe it's ignorance or oblivion. And how do we reconcile controlling our own destiny yet being aware of what threats are potentially out there that we need to be aware of? I do think that there is definitely a line to write. I think that, you know, like say, if you're running a business, you kind of need to know when the tax laws change. Sure. You need to stay. You can't just like put your head in the sand and like think nothing's ever changed because it will. And you have to see what's coming down the pike. Obviously, you have to keep your kind of ear out there a little bit. But I think there's a difference between kind of keeping tabs on things and then being involved in their cycle every day. And even maybe just recognizing what is relevant and what is not. Yeah. Yeah. What's just noise like with the signal to noise ratio or whatever, like, what's just noise? Long ago, I used to know this guy who made a living as a professional just, he had a thing he used to say was like, you know, if I can't get the president to change the color of his tie, why am I so worried about every single thing that comes out of his mouth every single day? It was something like that. Like you don't have control over these people. Sure. Whether you're mad about what they did or not bad about what they did, you don't have a lot of control. What do you have control over in your life? And you should be spending a lot more time on that than all these things that you don't have any control over you. It is probably good to have a general idea of what's going on or probably in your community, in your state, in the world. With your kids, with your wife, with your body. Well, I mean, that's what's more important. Right. That's the stuff that you can control. That's at least like, influence over it. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I think that that's what you need to focus on, whether it's, you know, your tribe or whatever you're trying to build in life. And that's kind of, you know, again, the idea of the book is, you know, being a creative person and creating a world that you want and investing in that instead of like constantly being defined by this, this anti define yourself like with my thing, like said, tribalism is good. So I found a tribe joining a tribe. I have to be careful because they used to write essays based on the news or whatever was happening and everybody was argued about a day. And now I have to be careful because I've become so insular in some ways that I want to write an article about that argument I had with my buddy the other day. Yeah. You know, yeah. And sometimes that's good. I mean, I've gotten a lot of material out of like, and you're rewarded for it. Yeah. I mean, let's look at from a creator standpoint, I'm talking about content creation, right? Trying to be influential in the community or in the world. You are for better or worse, rewarded for being controversial for jumping on the wagon to talk about the noise that doesn't really deserve much attention. Yeah. Yeah. We're, you know, what everybody's talking about today, I mean, if creating content, I mean, if this is the big issue of the day, what's your take on it? Yeah. That's right. That's the goal, right? I mean, like, that's, that's something I've tried to get away from. So I don't write a lot anymore. I, you know, I try to work on other projects, but creating something that I think is cool. Brought some land and me and a bunch of the guys in my tribe have been building things on it. I'm like, what do I think about the way you're, I saw your chicken coop? Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's pretty cool. Yeah, it's okay. I mean, they're the most expensive eggs in the world because there's no water on the land. So I have to drive out there twice a week to get that should be people always say like, Oh, you know, you go hunting, you're going to save a bunch of money. I'm like, I don't know how these guys are hunting. But like, when I travel and I'm away for three or four days, you know, we have chickens and stuff too. And I go in with my in laws and we slaughter a cow every year. And I'm like, it's not cheaper when you calculate the land and the feed and then this and then that and the time and the attention, like, this is not cheaper, but but it brings you fulfillment. Yeah, you're getting some kind of satisfaction out of it. I think that that's and for me, I'd say I'd never been around chickens. It's fun. Yeah, this is a little project that I'm doing. I go out there and collect little eggs and eat the eggs. It's good to have some kind of connection to the circle of life, you know, yes, and that's why I think hunting is good and all that kind of stuff. I mean, it's because you have to have, I think, appreciation that life comes from death. And I think that that's an important thing to think about and people are afraid of that. People are just afraid of death, right? Is we don't want to talk that's morbid. I want to talk about death. Yeah. Yeah. So they won't have that conversation. Yeah. Yeah. But it's it's so important because then you I feel like much unreason comes from not understanding that life comes from death. Right. Like when you think that chicken comes from styrofoam, you don't understand the world. There's a lot of things that come dealing in reality. Yeah, you don't have a firm grounding in things. And I think that that's very dangerous. And can you make great decisions if you're not looking at things objectively? Exactly. Exactly. Yeah. You're using your own ideas wherever they come from to formulate your plan of attack. And it's doomed from the beginning because you're it's not foundational principles. You're basing it off. I think I talked about that becoming a very, that I'm sure you've maybe heard of the Uda loop. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, your your orient is wrong. Right. Your orient is wrong. And so you can't make good decisions. Your Uda loop is all messed up. Well, you know, what's funny about that is we deal with people like that every single day, every single one of us. Yeah. And we allow them to dictate how we behave. And then we actually get sucked into arguments with people whose orientation is wrong. Yeah. It's like, why would you debate with someone that you don't have some foundational understanding that you can actually debate and have a dialogue with? Yeah. You're starting from different assumptions, right? About the world. And so like that, where are you? There's nothing. Yeah, there's nothing there until you can find that baseline. There's nothing else to discuss here. Exactly. You're just screaming at each other. And I think that's what people love to do. I don't either. And you know, like just long Facebook comment wars and so forth. Oh, well, I think there's this really interesting idea of the outrage culture, right? People just love to be outraged. And it comes back to what you were saying earlier, being a victim as if. And I made a post about this the other day that there's some sort of nobility or honor in being a victim, which is disgusting. It's pretty pathetic. Yeah. Yeah. It's like not even a thing anymore. But you know, the whole Oprah Winfrey kind of like talk show culture and all that, like, you know, everybody airing out their problems and like, and that's not like it's bad to talk about your problems, but maybe you only talked about with the whole world. And the other side, why? Why are you talking about your problems? Like, what is the ultimate objective? See, here's the other thing I hear a lot about is vulnerability. Yeah. Right. Men have to be vulnerable. Why? Why? Now, granted, there may be a certain type. I'll give you an example. If I'm having a conversation with my son and he's having a hard day at school, yeah, and maybe he is going through something with a bully, for example, and I went through that as a child and it came out of it, I can open up and tell him a little bit about my story so that it helps him deal with his own. Yeah. But if I'm just airing it out, just like, get attention or air it out, there's no value in being vulnerable. I mean, I think that's just really being real. This is how life works. And this is what happened to me. And here's a learning experience that I can help with. Yeah. You know, when it comes to being a victim, I mean, I think that, you know, like people, yeah, they do get some kind of social currency out of it. It's kind of unfortunate. But the vulnerability thing, I think, is really interesting because it explains why it's wrong. The word itself explains why it's wrong. Right. You know, like you're vulnerable, the opposite of... Stroll. Fortified. Yeah, exactly. The opposite of fortify. You are, you are, it is literally rolling over and showing your belly. But I think people would say to that, what's wrong with that? I mean, because one of the first things we talked about today was, you know, the threat of you being in some sort of situation where you're actually in some sort of real danger is significantly lower. So I think maybe that's why it is acceptable to be more vulnerable. Well, yeah, absolutely. Because, you know, if you had to worry about being vulnerable, actually, something happening when you're vulnerable, you wouldn't do it all the time. I think a lot of men realize this maybe more than women do on a general basis, you know, it's all big curves. But if you're being vulnerable, there are people who will use that against you. Sure. Like throw out as much information as you want. Right. And someone's going to take that and throw that back at you at some point. They're going to use that to define who you are in their mind. Right. What you want to do, you know, as a man, I mean, obviously, put this idea of who you want to be out there. That should be your face to the world. Who are you trying to be? Who do you want to be? What's the best version of yourself and put that forward and not the, well, this is the time I was sad. Yeah. Gentlemen, let me interrupt you for just a quick second. I want to talk with you about the Iron Council. Very simply, the Iron Council is a band of brothers who want to help you improve in every single facet of your life. Now, you could do life on your own. You may even experience some moderate level of success, but I'd argue along with my guest Jack that there is power in banding with other men in order to achieve more. When you work shoulder to shoulder with other men who have experienced what you are going through, you tap into a powerful perspective that you may not have considered before and arm yourself with a new set of tools to help you succeed in your family, health, business and life in general. And when you join the Iron Council, you have access to these tools like accountability, digital resources, our battle planning system, and of course, so much more. So to learn more and lock in your seat to the Iron Council, head to order of man.com slash iron council. Again, that's order of man.com slash iron council. In the meantime, guys, we'll get back to my conversation with Jack Donovan. You know, what's interesting too is because sometimes I'll post, you know, me working out or me having a bad day or whatever it is. And yeah, I do that to share because I want to help other guys with their stuff. But at the same time, I'm almost just documenting my journey so I can look at it myself and say, okay, here's where I was down. And yet I still did my workout or here's where I overcame this and and it's really just in a way, even the things that I say that are uplifting and positive and encouraging is as much to me as it is to anybody else. Like I need to hear that stuff. Absolutely. You know, I talked about this with my buddy Paul Wagner a lot. We write stuff that we need to hear. Yeah. And that's why it connects with people. If you post something that says, I had a rough day, but I still got something done, someone else is being like, I'm having a rough day. I guess I should go do something. It's inspirational to people. And I think that that's different than being a victim. You know, I think that I think it makes your advice more valuable when you're like, I don't just like, yeah, stuff sucks. I don't like just fall through life and everything great happens to me. You know, like all of us have your hurdles that we have to get past. Yeah. That's so much, I think, more valuable to people than to just just wallow in self-pity I think that's the problem with social media. That's great. And I'm not going to beat up social media. I think social media is great. You know, it connects people and like we've ever been connected. It's magical. Yes. It actually is pretty incredible when you think about the amount of wealth it's built for guys like you and me and other people, the amount of connections that you can make the fulfillment and satisfaction. I mean, there's just so much that comes from it. But I do believe that one of the problems that we see with social media is that everything is supposed to be perfect, right? It's all through a filtered lens and we manipulate the little angles and the little lighting and we put little vignettes and filters on everything. And then the guy who's looking in says he's ripped, he's always doing cool stuff. Ryan's always working out or doing this. And it's like, so what the hell is wrong with me? Because I'm not always feeling like these guys are. Yeah. And there's a huge disconnect, which I think creates a problem for people. Because there's also the other trend. You know, you have people posting their every bad thing. They never have to. Yeah, there's a lot of that on social media too, which is terrible. Yeah, that's true. But I think for the people who try to be inspirational in some way, I always say there are dudes who I follow to make myself feel fat and lazy. You know, like, and I think I think people do that with motivate you. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely motivates me like, Oh, I really need to pull it together. This guy's been in the gym twice, though, right? I mean, I follow a lot of like classic physique competitors. Sure. I'm like, I'll be doing a lot better. But I guess that's up to you as an individual to discern whether following those types of people are inspiring you to become greater or it's pushing you down because you haven't worked it out in your head. I think that's on us individually, not the fitness competitor, but it's on us to decide, is this motivational and inspirational to me? Yes, I'm going to follow. No, it's not. I'm going to go a different path. Yeah, exactly. And that's the magic of that you can follow them or not follow them. Yeah. Don't post that. I'm like, you're on my feed. Yeah, you don't like what I have to share. Don't follow. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Find somebody who says the exact opposite. And there are people out there. And that's great. Yeah. Go do that. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. I mean, I don't think they realize that. No, I think they realize it. I just think they like to be upset. I think they like to be outraged. Yeah. People like to be outraged and also like they want to exert control or there's another thing. There's another factor that goes into this is that people like 75% of your message. And then there's something that bothers them about it. And they want you to change the other the other little thing for them. Yeah. Or they want to share. I had a guy and I was like, go away. This guy the other day who was like, well, I don't like that you do this, this, this. But I think your message is really important. I'm like, if you're afraid to share this with your friends because they might not like me, I probably wouldn't like your friend. You know, it's probably not a good thing. That's fine. It's not a good fit. Yeah. And if there's certain things that you can't get over, yeah, that's okay. I mean, I'm on my journey and I'm doing things that are exciting to me. Yeah. And that's what I'm going to keep doing. You don't have to join me on that journey. The one that's always interesting to me is you'll have people that allegedly agree with 99% of the things that you put out. But the only time they'll engage with you is if they disagree with you. Oh, yeah. I follow you religiously. I love everything you're doing. But you're so wrong on this. I'm like, dude, why aren't you engaging on the other stuff too? I want to have a conversation in the dialogue. If you disagree, agree, whatever. Like, let's do both sides of this thing. Yeah. Well, a lot of times that too, that's also like people have their pet issues. And they want to use your platform as their platform. Yeah. And so like, this is the thing that I'm obsessed with. Yeah. Let's talk about my little issue, take up all the inputs, because then all your your commenters follow them. Yeah. What they're saying. That's true. And so they're getting attention without putting on all the legwork. It goes back to the one of the points you were talking about earlier. And one of the things you say, and of course I say, because it's the title of the book is that I wrote is is sovereignty, right? You're allowing other people to have control their thumb over you. And you're dictating your behavior based on somebody else rather than choosing your own path. Yeah. Yeah. With this kind of stuff that we're talking about, I've always been like, it's almost free to start your own blog. Like you want to talk about something, go talk about it. No one's stopping you. Go do it. But you don't want to do that because that's a lot of work. And so, yeah. And so, you know, I don't care. Yeah. I want to go back to what we were talking about earlier with this idea of vulnerability and whether we should or shouldn't. Because one of the things that you had talked about in the book too is this idea of that somehow masculinity is is a mask that when guys like you and me say, well, it's not always the time and the place to be vulnerable, then somehow that means that we're putting on some sort of exterior facade, right? Some mask. I don't necessarily believe that masculinity in and of itself is a mask. I guess it could be used as one, but not by default. There's a lot of cultural things that are attached that and that's a very old feminist argument. It goes back a long ways. And it's one of the biggest ones that they use all the time. And masculinity is fake. And that's something I talked about in this book specifically. I think that I handled pretty well. They think it's fake because you have to try. Everybody has weaknesses as we've just discussed. Yeah. Everybody has weaknesses. Everybody has trouble. The easiest path is to lay and beg and cry about the path of least resistance. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've had instances in the past six months where I really just want to go curl up in a ball now. But if you do the attention and they will, but what I'm saying is that that's the easiest path. You can always do that. The masculine path is to not. You have to try to get past that. It's not the natural thing. You're pushing yourself to do something that you don't want to do. Like we talked about courage and all those things like you're pushing yourself to be a better version of yourself rather than curling up in the field position and crying. But we don't look at it that way because I agree with you. Yeah. Of course, you have to exert yourself. You have to push. You have to try. Yeah. Of course, that's that's on you. But we don't look at that as a negative thing in any other context. Right. If you look at it from a business perspective, if you look at athletes, for example, and you may have used this, or maybe I just saw it somewhere else. I did. I was like, oh, that was good. Yeah. Yeah. So I'll let you explain. Everything that is considered good. Actually, you have to try and fail at. Right. To be good at it. I mean, learning a language, playing the piano. Right. Everything would never look at it like a pianist and say, he's wearing a mask while he's playing the piano. He's faking piano because he doesn't know it yet. You know, and that's that's the way they talk about masculinity. Like if your first impulse is to show weakness to power or whatever. Yeah, exactly. If that's your first impulse, but you overcome that, yeah, that's not fake. Right. That is really an inner driving force yourself that has decided. Right. That it's going to be a better person. I'll give you a great example of this. So a couple of weeks ago, and I posted this video on Instagram because it was classic. We have one of those video cameras outside of the front of our house. Okay. So if there's motion, it picks it up. Oh, nice. And I'm downstairs. My office is in the basement downstairs. And I hear this commotion house upstairs. I'm like, what's going on? So I got the long story short. A neighbor's dog came over, jumped on one of our dogs, started fighting or whatever. And not that big a deal. Just dogs fight. It just happened. My wife sent me the video. It's hilarious. It's funny. You guys go check it out. But it's just a little nuanced thing. But if you look at, it's really interesting. My son was outside and he sees this dog come over and he was going to pet the dog. And then he saw the dog was being aggressive and then jumped on my dog and knee jerk reaction. My son got scared and he ran inside. But before he hit the door, you could see it. He stopped and he turned around and he got in that dog's face and he yelled, get out of here. And the dog stopped and ran off. And then he kind of ran back inside. And I think this illustrates perfectly what you're talking about. The natural response was, I'm scared. I've got to get out of harm's way. And then something in his mind clicked. No, no, no, I got to protect my stuff, which in this case was his dog. Yeah. And so he faced the theory, turned around and he went and did what he needed to do. No mask there. Yeah. Just a development of character. Yeah. Absolutely. Absolutely. It's a reminder to me when you're saying that, Brian, you have something you have to train out when you're boxing. Your natural response when someone punches you is to turn your head a pitch. Right. Yeah. Yeah. He's a turn your head away. And that's actually how you get punched a lot worse. And so you have to learn to not do that. Right. Yeah. I mean, are you faking, you know, you were a sponsor? Yeah. I mean, this comes back to what we're talking about as making a choice to be more masculine is a virtue. But something inside you is making you want to make that choice. And especially in our society, when we're talking about like all the messages that are coming down saying, you don't have to do a man, it's okay, be more vulnerable. You can cry. Men have never marched in fought and wars for the right to cry. Right. Yeah. They're never, I mean, that's not, they don't fight for it. Men has never wanted that. That's something that other people are pushing on them and saying like, Hey, you could cry a little bit. You know, men don't really actually want to do that. Right. Because they want to be the better version of themselves. Do you think because here's an argument I think people will say, and and I've heard before is that the suppression of emotions or the inability by, we'll use cultural standards or traditional roles to suppress being vulnerable? Do you think that leads to depression, suicide rates, those sorts of things and men? Because that is the argument that guys have been suppressed for so long that now we're killing ourselves. We're depressed. We're suicidal. I mean, I think we're suicidal because they live in a feminist world. But I mean, I mean, honestly, I think that we have a live in a test lowering world. What do you mean by test lowering? What do you mean? If your sports team loses, your Tesla drop. If your sports team wins, you just go up. And that's just a basic factor. But do you not think like all like the way that the world works as far as men and how we relate to our society has any effect on our chemistry? If all you do is work at a customer service job where you say, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Like, you don't think that lowers your test? That's just a theory. I mean, there's no way I haven't done a study. I lean more towards what you're saying because I think the suppression of emotions or the desire to be vulnerable and not being able to. I think the bigger issue is the lack of significance and meaning in a man's life. Absolutely. They talk about military suicides a lot. And if you really look at it, if you talk to a lot of guys, a lot of it isn't about war. No, it's that they don't have their purpose anymore. They don't have their purpose or it's about like relationships and family drama or like their wife cheated on them. Or like there's a lot of other stuff that goes on aside from war. Basically, it comes down to that phrase of correlation does not equal causation. Yeah, not always. I mean, it's not always the same thing. And so I think women are natural nurturers. A lot of that is women looking at men's problems and seeing the way that women see them. Whereas men would perceive that in a different way. Sure. Neither are wrong. Except I will say this is that the way that we've operated is more relevant because we are men. I do not know what it is to be a woman. And a woman doesn't know what it means to be a man. Exactly. And I think that that's a very controversial thing to say. The moment society, the femist idea is that we're all really the same and everything else is a lie. But that's clearly not the case. One thing I've said before that I received some pushback on is that a woman cannot fully raise a young boy to be a man. And I stand by that. I was raised by a woman. My dad was out of the picture. Yeah. And even my mom would be the first to admit that she understood and recognized that she could not fully raise me into a man on her own. So I was involved in scouting. I was involved in sports. Eventually, I joined the military at a very young age. And I was exposed to other men who helped me foster and develop masculinity within myself. A woman can't do that. And I have guys who will say, they can teach them to do this. And yes, there are elements of life that a woman can certainly teach to a boy. But not everything it means to be a boy and a man because they've never experienced it in their entire life. Right. Yeah. They can't share that kind of experience. Right. Or how to respond or how to harness the chemicals that are racing through your body. It's not the same. No, not at all. Not at all. I mean, how do you relate to a group of men as a man? Can a woman tell you how to do that? No, of course. No. No. Because they've only been in groups of men with their women. Right. You know, which is interesting because a lot of guys, and I've said this before, specifically with regards to scouting, where scouting has changed a lot of their rules for transgender and women and girls allowed in scouting programs. Right. And people say, well, girls can learn that stuff too. No doubt. And maybe they should. Yeah. Right. Like it's, it's fine. I don't have a problem with girls learning how to tie knots or go camping or stuff. That doesn't bother me. That's not the issue. Yeah. The issue is there needs to be an environment in which boys can learn from boys and men exclusively because when a woman enters the equation, the equation changes. Yeah. Right. We start posturing. We start trying to impress these natural tendencies. Looking for approval. Absolutely. Yeah. Trying to win over. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It changes the dynamic and there is a time and a place for it certainly. But there's also a time and a place for us to be men with men only men so that we can work out our issues together. You know, my boys, for example, they'll fight my two old boys. They'll get in a fight and my wife will run upstairs and be like, stop, let them work it out. Well, they're fighting. They're they're wrestling. I mean, yeah, the older one will win because he's bigger. Yeah. And the younger one will start to recognize his role. Phew. This is how we work at it's fine. Unless they're going to in any sort of risk of injuring themselves, they're fine. Right. Just let it let it be, let it work. And you know what, it always does. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Man, we've been all over the place. Yeah. We've talked about a lot, but you know what, guys, go check out the book more complete beast. Really, really good book. I think I read it in the night. I mean, yeah, it's really short. Really short read. But I was just excited to have this conversation because the things that you had said in the book articulated points that I've kind of always felt a little bit in the back of my mind, but the way that you shared them and articulated them, I was like, yeah, yeah. And I would turn the page and like, yeah, that's right too. And that's right too. And so I really appreciated the book that way because it gave me a new perspective and a new framework for the way that I've always kind of thought, but it puts more validity to it. So I really appreciate that. How do we connect with you, man? What do you got going on? I know you've got a conference coming up, obviously the book, where's the best place to go for guys to connect? I'm an Instagram guy, as you know, and my Instagram is at start the world. I like that medium because I'm an artist by background. I like to communicate visually. I think do you design your own stuff too? Yes. Because you're wearing that. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I didn't know that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. That's awesome. I didn't know that. So that's kind of in many ways to get an interesting art project. Yeah. I had no idea how do you communicate the things that we're talking about? Well, you can tell me when you look at your stuff, as far as the aesthetics of the way it looks, I'm like, well, I didn't know it was you. I just said, this guy's got somebody's good who's helping him out. Yeah. I didn't know it was you. That's my creative thing. I do. I do all that stuff. And so, yeah, Instagram. And then my website is jackdastanavan.com. Obviously, I'm speaking at the 21 convention in Orlando in October. I spoke last year and that went really, really well. It was a really cool conference. Did that, if I understand correctly, either that one or maybe the year before, it was kind of the catalyst for this book, right? I mean, didn't it? Yeah. No, that speech last year was actually the sketch for this book. Right. Right. And then I filled out some of it. It was a really, I think, probably my best speech that I've ever given. So, I mean, it's available online. Yeah, I think I've caught part of it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's really good. Yeah. You can you watch that online. I think that that's kind of the best introduction to if you want to wonder what the book's about. You know, if you go to 21 studios, don't even do that. Just go buy the book. Well, obviously, yeah. But yeah, you both. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. But I think it's a good introduction. And then hopefully, the next thing I have coming down that I'm working on right now, that I'm really excited about is I'm kind of going to do like a magazine that's like maybe published twice a year. So I can work in that, that photography in the elements of design and so forth and then do interviews and philosophical essays and things that are, I think, hard copies of things are important. A good friend of mine who's actually a rare book appraiser. Actually, he finally found a way to make money in life because he's a super nerd. He is a brilliant, appraiser now and he is flowing around the country constantly to evaluate like rare books and yeah, like books that are like the most expensive books. Right. Like he's picked up with what is the printing press? Like the Gutenberg, pretty press or yeah, he's picked up the Gutenberg Bible. Oh, really? Yeah, he's been in rooms with he's been in rooms with like the most valuable books in the world. Really? Yeah, yeah. And he every once in a while, hold some me a little picture like that one's worth 15 million. And that one's yeah, yeah, he's like, this is the book that they'll sell to rebuild the entire library. One of the things he's made very clear to me, I think, over time is like all that stuff is still there. Books last. And I've had things that I've written online that were really popular that are no longer available. Right. Because the website went down or something changed. And it goes away. But books, books stay around. I mean, there are copies of, you know, the way of man and in some of my other books in libraries. And that stuff stays around. I think it's really important to put out stuff in hard copy as time goes on. It stays around and you can kind of stand with that. I think it becomes more valuable to the less, the less that it's out there and the less that it's, I remember, you know, I had the transcript of the book that I had written on my computer and I was proud of it. But it really wasn't until I got the copy of it. Oh, yeah. You know, you get it, you're like, you're holding it in your hands and you feel it and you can look at it and you can smell it. Like, yeah, it's just, there's just something to be said somewhere. There's going to be a copy of that after. Yeah. Yeah. I think that that's really, I think, something a way that you can leave a legacy in the world when you're doing the kind of stuff that we're doing is to, to, you know, put it in a hard copy. And so that's why instead of doing everything for online, I'm going to move more towards hard copies. Like, you know, so I can put out like maybe a couple books a year that have all these things in them. So I think I'm really excited about that. I think that's a good way forward. That's cool, man. Keep us in the loop on that because we'll definitely help out there. Well, I got to ask you, I mean, I know we've been talking about today, but as we, as we cap this thing off, the question is, what does it mean to be a man? The classic classic. I've asked it like 200 times now. Yeah. Yeah. The answer's never get old because I hear them all. So it's awesome. Right. Right. Right. What does it mean to be a man? The meaning makes it interesting. I talk a lot about what it is to exhibit masculine qualities. What does it mean to be a man? I think that has to do a lot with the way you perceive yourself as a man in the context of larger group of men. It's an interesting question. I think it becomes, who are you and how do you fit into the bigger picture is actually what it means to be a man. The definition is the same across the board. To me, it's the strength, courage, mastery, and honor. What it means to be a man is to be a man to inhabit a male body, to go through life and the experiencing that in the context of in your relationship to other men, a life experience that women will never have. And I think that's that's something that I think is important for us. Right on. Love it, man. All right. Cool. Well, we'll call it a wrap. I think this afternoon we're going to meet up with another a mutual friend and go throw some axes. Sounds good, man. Right on. Thanks, man. I appreciate you. All right. Awesome. Gentlemen, there you go. My conversation with Jack Donovan. I hope that you enjoyed this podcast. Again, very fascinating. Him and I resonate and get along with and have so many similar viewpoints about what it means to be a man. And it's so refreshing because as I said earlier, very few people are willing to have the types of discussions that we are having and talk about it in the context in the way in which we discussed it. So I would definitely encourage you to pick up a copy of Jack's new book, a more complete beast. It's a very quick read, but it is jam-packed with so much information. And as I said in the conversation, it articulates the ideas and thoughts that I've had. And certainly some of you have had on masculinity very, very well. And I think you'll walk away with a better understanding of who you are as a man and how we're supposed to show up in this life. Again, it's called a more complete beast. But go ahead and connect with Jack on Instagram. He's pretty active over there. Connect with me on Instagram at Ryan Mickler on Twitter at order of man, Facebook, YouTube, of course, this podcast. Again, share the podcast, leave the rating review. Guys, we really appreciate you being on this path and this journey. I hope that you know that when I set out to give men the tools and the resources that we are, I never had the idea that I was going to actually get more from you and more from my guest than the value that I was trying to provide. And man, I just can't tell you how inspired I am each and every week to see you stepping up as fathers and husbands and community leaders and every facet of your life. It's absolutely incredible. And I have become a better man because of you. So with that said, I appreciate you being part of the order. This is an organization. It's a brotherhood. It's a fraternity of men all over the world working to reclaim and restore what it means to be a man. And again, couldn't do without you. So with that said, I'll sign out for the day and until tomorrow for my Ask Me Anything with Kip Sorenson, guys, go out there, take action, and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life. To be more of a man you were meant to be, we invite you to join the order at order of man.com."
