France and South Korea have also got evacuation plans. But you need to prepare for and assume... ...bronly warning Americans to avoid all non-essential travel to China. That this is going to be a real serious problem. France, Australia, Canada, the US, Singapore, Cambodia, Vietnam, the list goes on. Health officials are investigating more than 100 possible cases in the US. Germany, a man has contracted the virus. The epidemic is a demon and we cannot let this demon hide. Japan, we're a bus driver, contracted the virus. coronavirus has killed more than 100 people there and infected more than 4,500. We have to prepare for the worst, always. Because if you don't, and the worst happens... War room, pandemic. Here's your host, Stephen K. Bannon. Okay, welcome. It's Monday, 29 August in the year of our Lord 2022 year in the War Room. We got a lot going on today. I want to start with my favorite topic, Marlago. Mike Davis joins us and Mike, thank you so much for doing this for our Boris joins us a second. Mike, I say that with kind of an eye roll for the simple reason is that there's so many massive issues going on in this country right now. You and I talked earlier, the economy, the debt that's up, the balance of the Federal Reserve, the 30 trillion dollars of face amount of debt, these massively important midterm elections that are coming up, and yet we're admired in arguing about it. And I think you framed it the best. This is a dispute, this is a library dispute over like an overdue book, the equivalent overdue book between the secretary for the administrative state, the librarian for the administrative state, which is the National Archives and others. Want me through you because today they're all blowing up. Trump's got to be indicted. This is a major case. They got the spies or spies in jeopardy. Of course, they also said the special masters not needed because they've already inventoried everything. Get us up to speed on what you believe is the latest state of place, sir. So remember in 2020, the FBI would not even look at Hunter Biden's laptop with clear evidence of foreign corruption and other crimes because the FBI said it would be election interference. Here we are 90 days out from the midterm elections and they're doing this unprecedented, unnecessary and unlawful home raid. Like you said, Steve, for overdue library book is essentially what this has come down to. Fortunately, this magistrate, excuse me, there's a district court judge in the Southern District of Florida, Aileen Cannon, who has said that on Saturday, she put out a ruling that she's tentatively inclined to grant President Trump's request to appoint a special master in this matter. That is a very good sign that what that means to me is this district court judge does not have confidence that the Biden Justice Department, including the corrupt counter espionage unit within the national security division, along with the corrupt counter espionage unit within the FBI are going to be able to handle these records as honest brokers. So this judge is inclined to appoint a special master to get to the bottom of this. I think President Trump and his legal team should and will go on offense and they should update and amend their rule 41G motion to get back all of these records that the Biden administration raided from our logo and tee up the legal argument that we've been talking about for several weeks now, including the president has the constitutional power to declassify anything he wants. He has the statutory power to make any presidential record personal. And therefore, it's not even possible that he could have investigated or that he could have obstructed investigations into non crimes. The presidential records act expressly contemplates that presidents have classified materials in the office of the former president and Congress gives former presidents staff with security clearances for the former president and staff secure office base or skiffs and secret service protections. This is starting to blow up on the Biden justice department, the Biden administration. And let's see how desperate they get here because these crossfire hurricane records, these Russian collusion records that they are clearly, that was the reason they went in to do this home rate as was reported by Newsweek, by Bill Arkin at News Week a couple of weeks ago. Let's see how desperate the Biden regime gets here. So, you know, the New York Times thing was yesterday, Maggie Havenritt had a huge piece and they they go through your arguments and they were talking about, you know, Trump's legal teams needs to come together and he needs a couple of quarterbacks or whatever. But they in that whole piece, they tee up, allow your arguments and they kind of dismiss them out of hand. And they also do this on MSNBC and CNN all night long. Like, you know, he doesn't have, there's all sorts of procedures to go through to declassify that these are not presidential records that given the long time that he was actually going back and forth that, in fact, it talks about Evan Corcoran's letter, I think in May to the Justice Department. What do you say to these people? I mean, are they gaslighting the American people because they never really addressed the legality of it, but they just kind of dismiss the counter arguments to the arguments from the Trump people saying that, hey, there's a whole pattern of judicial decisions. There's all types of precedent on both form and substance of how this has been done in the past. But these, but on MSNBC, New York Times, they just dismisses out of hand into the fact that the New York Times actually advocated strongly the other day that the president be criminally indicted. That's just complete nonsense. These liberal apologists, for the Biden regime, should go read a 1988 Supreme Court case called the Department of the Navy versus Eagan. They should read a 2012 decision in the D.C. District Court by an Obama judge related to eight years of audiotapes and Bill Clinton's sock tour. They should read the OLC opinion related to the Mueller investigation about how it's legally impossible for a president to obstruct justice for these non-crimes. They should actually go read the law. I bet I will bet them anything that a Supreme Court will side with what I'm saying. And that is precisely why I think that the Merrick Garland, who said he deliberated four weeks before he ordered this home raid, that he didn't lock down the hall at the Justice Department and go to the Office of Legal Counsel or OLC and get an opinion on the legality of this home raid because he almost certainly would not have liked what they told him because there is a Supreme Court decision directly on point. And what I'm saying, and I've been saying since August 8th, whenever this home raid occurred, is the president has the constitutional power as commander-in-chief to declassify anything he wants, for any reason he wants. He doesn't need any bureaucrats permission. And a good example of this was March 2012 when Bill Clinton got caught on the hot mic with the Russian president divulging our most classified nuclear information saying that Obama would have more negotiating room after the November 2012 presidential election eight years later. That is the most classified material President Obama could have conveyed to our enemy. And it was nuclear doctor, nuclear information. And he wasn't charged with espionage. There wasn't a home raid because he's the president of the United States. He doesn't need to take off labels or get a bureaucrats permission. He just did it through his actions. And so Trump actually did the Russian collusion caused by a hurricane declassification the right way. He did it through a declassification memo on January 19th, 2021, before he left office. It's the bureaucrats of the Justice Department and the National Archives, right? They're feeding never made a public. Let's go to we have Boris Epstein now Boris can you get us updated? I understand what's been going on today. Steve, Steve, honor be with you a big day important day. And you know, a really a ton going on. So let's start at the beginning. First of all, you had the DOJ make this interesting filing really more of a notice to the judge. And they said, Oh, well, you know, we're already done with the filter team judge. There's no need for a master. We're already done. Everything's complete. What do you mean you're done? You know, the president and his team haven't heard anything from the filter team. They haven't heard from the DOJ regarding attorney client privilege documents regarding executive privilege documents, which the DOJ did not even mention in this supplemental filing that they did today. Let's keep in mind the order of battle here. The judge having made that amazing thunderous ruling on Saturday, which was really, you know, big news in this, in this process, the judge haven't made that ruling on Saturday and putting the DOJ in a pretty significant way on the back foot and saying I'm inclined to allow for the special master and want the DOJ to provide under seal a more substantial inventory. You know, after that happened Saturday, it's really the balls already in the DOJ's court and they were supposed to tomorrow to file a response. And what's interesting is that the, you know, the caption of this case is President Trump is the plaintiff. The DOJ is the defendant, right? So the DOJ is the defendant is supposed to file their answer tomorrow. They rushed and filed something today to tell the judge, oh, no, no, don't worry about it. We already finished and by the way, we sent the documents to the office of the director of national intelligence as if somehow that updates the need for a special masterman. It does the opposite. We don't have no idea what's in the document. President Trump has, you know, hasn't been able to be briefed on what was taken, what was left, what was the process? Remember, his attorneys were forced to wait outside and we're not, we're not allowed to observe, to observe the range. So tomorrow now the government is going to put forth their actual response, let alone this intermediate half step they took today. Tomorrow they're going to put forth their actual response. And then from there, the president and his counsel are going to put on, put in a reply to that. And then you've got the hearing on Thursday. So this is a robust week. It's a big week with a lot going on. The bottom line being that Judge Eileen Cannon in the Southern District of Florida has now put the onus on the DOJ to explain what happened through this process, meaning, you know, vis-a-vis the affidavit, but further the inventory, how the inventory was put together and what's really in the inventory in terms of what was taken during the raid. And the DOJ has to reply why there should not be a special master in this case, a special master being judicial oversight over all the property that was taken, how was taken. And most importantly, pursuant to what statutes it was taken, the only statute applying to President Trump being the Presidential Records Act, which he has been in full compliance with, and it's consistently been in full cooperation with the Department of Justice and all other applicable agencies. You know, just to ask Mike, a second ago, you've had all these articles, you know, had the New York Times article, and if you watch, if you monitor as we do MSNBC or CNN, they continue to go on, you know, people like Mike Davis continue to cite precedent regarding, you know, the case against the Navy, you know, whether it's the president's ability to declassify anything, or it's all this, you know, the structural issues regarding what is presidential material and how the president can deem what's president material or not. Why does it seem like the left just they in dismissing it at hand, they never really come back and actually address any things that Mike keeps talking about Mike keeps citing precedent Mike keeps talking about this, but you never see that you never see that you never see the pushback come back on those specific details. The reason is because the other side doesn't have an argument. They know that the Presidential Records Act, which President Trump has been in full compliance with does not have an enforcement and what they did, what we know from the limited amount of the affidavit we've seen is that they took the PRA, the Presidential Records Act, and they try to bolt onto it, they bolt onto it, and enforcement mechanism from these other statutes, which simply do not apply. And they've got another huge problem, which is the Fourth Amendment. This is this was an overbroad warrant, which is a general warrant, which as you know, very well, Steve, is completely unconstitutional under the Fourth Amendment. There's a reason that the Fourth Amendment is there. And it's because the British used to issue these, you know, the King would issue this general warrant and the Brits would go into the houses of the folks in the colonies and just take anything they wanted. Well, this is exactly what happened in this raid, exactly what happened in this break in of the President's home, a beautiful Mar-a-Lago Palm Beach, Florida, and the DOJ as they try to leak things here and there, right? First, they try to leak nuclear. What we now know from the classifications again in the limited in the limited affidavit that the nuclear is accused nowhere in there, then they try to leak, oh, there's these super important documents and they're super classified. Not there either. Now they're trying to move the goalposts and say, well, that's actually classifications don't even matter. It's any defense related, Doc. All of that, Steve, has no application here whatsoever because the Presidential Records Act is the statute that applies to the President and the President, President Trump has been in full compliance with that act and actually has gone above and beyond to interact and be cordial to NARA and then the DOJ and telling them on June 3rd, hey, let us know what else you need. And by the way, if you look at that redacted affidavit, you won't see any mention of June 3rd, at least in the unredacted parts that we, the merely public, are allowed to see. Why? Because that is bad for the DOJ. Boris, hang on for a second. We dropped, Mike Davis is going to try to get back to him back up. Short commercial break, the firestorm around Mar-Lago next in the war room. You know what's never good? When your nation's supposed authority on economic policy completely misses the flashing red lights of impending inflation.

The epidemic is a demon and we can't let this demon hide. War room, pandemic. Here's your host, Stephen K. Bannon. Okay, welcome back. I want to share this. I got Mike Davis and I got Boris Epstein. Of all the ridiculous things they've gone after President Trump for, and they've gone after him would just observe things. There's a Linsky phone call. There's so many stupid things, the Nullification Project. But here are the New York Times. US-feared Trump files put spies at risk, put spies at risk. You got to remember, this is CIA that lost 22 or 25 agents, our top agents in mainland China, Chinese Communist Party, lost all of them, right? Because of moles or whatever inside the CIA, right? Lost the entire ability, human, which is a known story. But here, I just want to quote this, and Yella highlighted by the New York Times, when I thanked the New York Times, our beloved paper record. 140 unique documents bearing classification markings, including 67 of 184, 67 marked confidential. 92 documents marked a secret. And 25 is top secret. This copy of the New York Times is confidential. The overclassification is a joke. Navarre and I, these pompous asses, and that's what they are, they would sit there with all this stuff. It was meaningless. And we'd sit there and go, tell me, why is this classified? And they're heads blow up. Because this is how the administrative state separates themselves. This is how the priest's caste separates itself from the populace, from the citizens. Because they have the secret information. They have the information that the regular citizen is not, you're not qualified to see, right? You're telling me what a 184 67 remarked, wait for it, confidential, confidential clearance. The daily paper is confidential. And in fact, most of the stuff you've seen is Mark's confidential. Have you seen anything at all? It's something like came out of a news article, right? From aviation, weekend space technology. 20, this, this is an offensive joke of everything they've tried to do in the past, and you know, from the perfect phone card, all this nonsense. And it's all been nonsense. This to me is the most ludicrous and they've lied consistently at every step of the way. And like Boris said, the nuclear, all of it. Mike Davis, you've heard the drum beat over the weekend. He's going to be indicted, you know, and he had these serious Weisman and these people come on this very serious, limited brow, just like Merrick Garland had the knitted brow. You know, he was like, Jesus, that Yosemite, right? He was, he would knitted brow and just so, so thoughtful for three weeks, right? He's like, Hamlet, for three weeks had to think this through before he did it. The urgency. What, when you look at this from a lawyer's perspective, and you, and you, you see what they're talking about on a scale from one to 10, 10 being a complete joke. How ludicrous is this, sir? A 10. And I'll tell you why. If these records were so dangerous and President Trump's hands in Mar-a-Lago, why did they wait 18 months to go get them? Why did Merrick Garland leak out that he deliberated four weeks before he decided whether to do the home raid to go get these documents? Why did they wait three days after they got the home raid from their biased judge, judge, magistrate judge, Bruce Reinhardt? Why did they wait three days after that? That warrant was issued before they executed. This is bogus, what they're arguing. They argued that Trump had nuclear documents, and then oops, there are Q-level classifications on the rate of inventory, and there were Q-level classifications on the, on the Appa David's. So what do we have here? We have paper records at Mar-a-Lago with a former president, the Presidential Rep. Records Act, contemplates that former presidents have classified records. That's why he gets a security client. That's why his staff gets security clearances. That's why he has secure facilities or skips. That's why he has Secret Service Protection to guard these papers with listening devices and cameras. There's no allegation or evidence whatsoever that these records got into the wrong hands, unlike Hillary Clinton's illegal home server that was hacked by foreign governments when she was the Secretary of State. She violated the espionage act by having that home server. She obstructed justice by destroying the home server and the devices. She violated, she destroyed government property, which did that. There was no home raid. They didn't even question her. This is a political witch hunt against President Trump because he has declassified personal copies of the crossfire hurricane Russian collusion documents, and that scares the hell out of Biden, Obama, Hillary, Susan Rice, clapper, the FBI, the intel. Bors, is there anything in Mike Davis's argument that is not actually ironclad, forged steel logic about this situation, sir? Absolutely not. Mike's got to write. Mike's been doing a great job taking war remount over to Fox News and everywhere else. Mike and I have been in close touch on it. He's been sharing some vital points, vital perspectives. He's absolutely on target here. If you look at the history of this issue, the DOJ's, say we assume for a second that this wasn't just a completely naked political hit job of a breaking, which is absolutely it. But say we're living in this alternate universe where, oh, well, this is a real case. They're thinking of breaking. This would be the most novel esoteric case that they could think of bringing, and they're trying to do that against the most powerful political figure in America and the world. So just how corrupt this is cannot be overstated. And also how weak the DOJ's position is cannot be overstated. I think you're going to see that bear out in the DOJ's filings tomorrow. There's a reason that they thought they felt the need to preview it today. So I think you'll see it bear out tomorrow and you'll see it in the president and his counsel's response on Wednesday and then in the hearing on Thursday. Okay. So I'm getting to the point. You ran surrogates for me or for the team in 16. You've been a couple of guys. No, no, no's had a managed surrogate. You were obviously a senior consultant on advisor on the 2020. Here's what I'll get. Mike Davis, and we've had him on the Charlotte about many different issues, the tech oligarchs, the Supreme Court, you know, he's a he's a regular here in the audience lozing. He goes over on Fox and it's a great show. There's a two great hosts and Mike gives the war room and his analysis has been given the war room since the afternoon of May 8th. That thing was the day of the rape and it's bracingly it's bracingly refreshing on Fox because you haven't seen that. Here's what I'll get given that Mike laid out the case. You agree with that and it's forged and steel. This is pretty straightforward and Finn came on the other day and said the exact same thing. So we've got three guys who really know what they've talked about. Why is it that there doesn't seem to be a just a vast mass of surrogates out there, particularly elected officials in the Republican Party? Why is it crickets? And to the fact that I'm not saying it's accurate, but you can see how the New York Times and the Axioses can say, well, you know, there's a lot of people now very concerned about this. When they're talking about stuff that's nonsense and when they make these articles, it's nonsense. Where do you are? Are we anticipating a bigger groundswell of surrogate support here, sorry, particularly among senior elected officials? Well, here's what I'll tell you. I'll take one Mike Davis over 15, you know, sort of middle of the road, trying to have a both ways elected officials. Here's another thing I'll tell you, I, you know, have to point to the fact that the president posted on posted a video on truth yesterday, you did have Lindsey Graham of all people go on Fox and say that there could be riots in the streets of the DOJ continues to press for this. You actually, you've had some, you know, but I don't think we need to, but that's my opponent. That's this you just got to my point. I don't think we even need to mention that. And you know why? The case is so ludicrous. Maybe we are to dismiss it. We are dismiss it. We are to dismiss it as something that's not even a relevant to an indictment. This whole thing of indictment, they're trying to gaslightish right now and all the weekend and they died. I thought it was a war. I knew nothing here. There's nothing here. This is the weaker argument than even the first impeachment. This is the weakest they've of all the weakness they've had, and it's all been blown up and all been turned to absolutely a joke on all of it. This is, and they're just searching and searching. And Mike's right. We're now today's, I think 69 in a wake up, right to an election. This is direct election interference understanding that Biden essentially is getting turf. His presidency in November. One days to go. They did it with 91 days to go on August 8th for an election in November 8th. And there's there's there's been accepted practice, you know, that that 90 days before an election is supposed to have some, you know, sacrosanct nature to it. Obviously, the DOJ doesn't care about anything, anything like that. In terms of the elected officials, you know what they're doing? We could call it out, right? Oh, well, maybe we're just going to be something and maybe it doesn't benefit us long term that they're playing their usual games. Here's the flip side of it though. I will tell you that I'm very proud of the fact that for the last three weeks now to the day, right, today being being the three week anniversary of the raid in the break of Mar-a-Lago, we have undoubtedly won the PR war, the media war, the American people undoubtedly see that this break in this raid on Mar-a-Lago was unjustified, unwarranted, and un-American. And I think that having strong legal voices out there like Mike Davis, Tom Fitt, and others has been vital to that because, you know, they're breaking it down from a very specific point of perspective rather than, you know, rather than as an elected official doing so politically. Now, do I think that every elected Republican should be out there denouncing this? No doubt about it. Have we had some strength of folks like Jim Jordan and a few others? Yes. Has there been enough? Absolutely not. Okay. Hang on one second. We're going to lose Mike. Mike, can you give, because I want people to stay up with you 24-7. What is your social media and how they get to Article 3, sir? Thank you. It's Article 3, Project.org, Article Number 3, Project.org, at Article 3, Project, at Article Number 3, Project.getter, Twitter, truth, and my personal is MRD, DMI, MRD, DMI. Mike Davis, thank you very much. Appreciate you coming on. I know you get a busy schedule. Boris, I know you're busy too, but just I want you to help do the break. You've got another question on the other side. We're also going to get Michael Jan in here. Just saying it out. Exactly. A bunch of stuff happening in Iraq today. We're going to Michael Jan for an update, and then I've got a brilliant investigative report from the Christian Post. I'm going to do all this after a short commercial break. War room, pandemic with Stephen K. Banner. The epidemic is a demon, and we can't let this demon hide. War room, pandemic. Here's your host, Stephen K. Banner. Okay. I want to bring a Boris and I understand you're pressed for time, but they're doing the scyop now that they always do around around 80 or 90 days, 70 days to go, which is to put out all these polls that the Republicans are losing momentum. President Trump's losing momentum. We're not going to take the House. We're not going to take the Senate. When he actually look at the analysis that's attached to these polls, you look at the undercard. You see that that's not true. What can you tell people about where your sense is, where things are heading towards November 8th and the momentum around MAGA and President Trump? My sense, Steve, is that MAGA is more on fire than ever before. If you look at the turnout at all of the primaries we've had, look at the turnout at the President's rallies. You're going to see that again on Saturday on September 3rd. There's never been political fire, political enthusiasts like we've had now, especially specifically after the unconstitutional rate and breaking of the President's home in Mar-a-Lago. So these the suppression polls, oh, yeah, Republicans, they don't really care anymore. They're just now wrong. Republicans are more energized than ever. MAGA is more energized than ever. Biden in the year anniversary of the debacle, disgusting, despicable debacle in Afghanistan, is the least popular president in American history. So in any suggestion, otherwise, is a straight, bold-faced line. If you look at the cross-steps, they will tell you that Hispanic Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans, Jewish Americans, young people, older people, men, women are all coming over and drove to MAGA. And that's the truth. That's the reality. In any poll that says, oh, yeah, you're now Republicans are complacent or whatever that may be, it's just meant to do that, to cause complacency. But the beauty of now versus 20 years ago is that MAGA has more. MAGA has President Trump's truth account. MAGA has access to information that is truthful. And the MAGA voter, as they always have been, the MAGA voters are smart. We're not going to be fooled by this mainstream media nonsense. But we know that the time is ours, and we're going to take our 100 seats. We're going to be in charge for 100 years, and then march on to a major win in 2024. And for President Trump to walk into the overall office, as we hope and expect on Jan 20, 2025. Yeah, we're going to break down. We're going to use some cross tabs tomorrow to show you this poll. That's vital. These are suppression polls and scyops. Don't worry about it. The momentum, I got to say, I've never seen people more in fire about this country. All over the country. In New York, in California, and Arizona, and everywhere, all over the country. And I think you're getting a lot of independence to Boris, now more than ever, people need to follow in social media. How do they get there? No doubt about a Boris CP that comes to the website. Set up right now on Boris CP dot com, hot on the website, hot on getter at Boris CP on Twitter at Boris CP hot on true social at Boris and the hottest on the grab Boris under screbs time. Stay strong. God bless. And I will see you tomorrow. You know, later at the six o'clock show and battle ground, we're actually going to go to Michigan, talk to Christine Karamo. If you saw a gateway pointed day, they had a speech you did over the weekend on fire on absolute fire. They call, I think the avenging angel. We're going to have Christine Karamo run for Secretary of State. Also, we're going to go to Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, talk to Tony Shoop and Sam Faddis had a huge Patriot rally there. They're going to do these rallies every couple of days of these Patriot groups come together about voter integrity, get out the vote, but also voter integrity. So the two battlegrounds of Pennsylvania and in Michigan on fire. So Dave Bratt is going to join us and talk about there's been some articles recently about this whole thing concept of Christian nationalism. And they're saying that, you know, David French and others are coming out and saying the the mega, you know, evangelicals, the mega traditional Catholics are too hardcore. They're too hard edge. They got to start using kindness and got to start using more humility. We're going to have Brandon show water on joining us in a moment from the Christian post on a major investigative piece he's got do we have Brandon show Walter? Let's go ahead and get the let's talk to you. Let's talk about your amazing investigative piece in the Christian post. Very disturbing. I want you to walk through what your theory of the case is how you came up this about surgeries being done in young people in the situation of gender affirming surgery. You've actually done an investigation. People have denied it's actually happening. You say the opposite. You've done a deep dive investigation. Walk us through what you found. Well, yes, Steve. And this all was inspired because I was just so infuriated watching the legacy press, the mass media run interference for the gender industry, particularly these children's hospitals that have been exposed recently. Libs of TikTok, I believe it was last Thursday or Friday released the audio footage of staffers at National Children's Hospital saying on tape that they had done what they called gender affirming his direct enemies on 16 year olds. And so then you see NPR in the Washington post, this corporate media apparatus, basically the communications wing of the gender industry again, denying that this is just right wing information and they take the angle that oh, these are now, you know, these horrible people who are making threats against hospital staff, that kind of thing. And that this isn't happening. They're just flat out denying that these surgeries, these brutal sterilizing and disfiguring surgeries are not happening to youth under the age of 18. And I've been in this for a while, Steve. And so I just knew that the literature has otherwise. And so taking a page from Libs of TikTok, which just holds the mirror up and exposes their horrible antics for what they are, I figured, well, I'm just going to make a coherent list here of all of the journals, the peer reviewed medical journals, JAMA Pediatrics, the Journal of Sexual Medicine, the Journal of Clinical Medicine, the Lancet had an article a few years ago about this, obstetrics and gynecology, where the gender clinicians themselves say that they have done these brutal disfiguring surgeries on people under the age of 18. So I'm just recoding what they've already said and put them all together. And I just figured, okay, legacy media, you may be able to gaslight people, but you're not going to gaslight me. And I'm going to put you on notice that when this mass psychosis spell breaks off of our society, but what we're doing to children, I'm not going to let you off the hook. You're not going to be able to feign ignorance. I tried to tell you, and here's the receipts. Brandon, let me ask you a question. Is these surgeries, can they be reversed once children 15 or 16 years old or 12 years old, however old they are, if they make these decisions and they had these surgeries, are these surgeries reversible, sir? Absolutely not. Once you cut a body part off, you're done. And neither are these drugs reversible. That's the famous line that they toss out about puberty blockers. They say, oh, they're completely reversal, reversible. No, they are not. If you freeze your endocrine system, and especially if you then follow on with synthetic, oxis, ex hormones, you're going to be rendered completely sterile, very likely, you'll be sterilized. You can't reverse that. And it's aligned the NHS in England, not so long ago, updated its website where it used to say that these blockers were reversible. And then they changed it. And they said, there's the long term effects remain unknown. None of this is reversible. None of it. I want to go back to the railhead of the story, because we had Joe Allen on. He's our editor for all things transhuman. He's been on special project, but we kind of pulled him off because of this situation with the Boston Children's Hospital. And also then you had MIT review and you had the situation at Yale. I just want to go back. This came up on Boston Children's Hospital. They denied it. And then they came out and said, Oh my gosh, all these terrible MAGA people, all these terrible Trump followers, all these terrible Christians are calling up and threatening us. That is what really drove you in the mainstream media, gotten back at this, that people were lying, they never really said this, and that they were being for the first time in their history, they were being attacked and they they feared for their lives or anything like that. That's essentially in the mainstream media form, form like a phalanx around this. This is right. Yes. Dr Allen, you said, Okay, I hear you. I see you. It's been said, but you deny it. I'm going to go back and get the preview. I'm going to go back and look at the literature, what has been printed already and not denied. And by connecting dots, and that's why if we can get his story up on the screen, your story is pretty definitive. Now I do you quote the articles, you provide the links. I mean, what I love about it when I when I first saw it and reached out to you, you deliver the receipts. This is categorical. Is it not how you went through this, sir? Absolutely. And with respect to Boston Children's Hospital, from 2017 to 2020, they performed 65 mastectomies, breast amputations on minor girls. And for that, you can go to page three on the Journal of Clinical Medicines article, and that's linked there in the article. It's a data table. It says it right there in black letters, and plain as day. So they can deny it, but we've got the goods. They're absolutely doing these surgeries on minors. No matter what they say, or they'll speak out of both sides of their mouth, or maybe they'll minimize, well, this was just this one very distressed child that we just had to do it. No, forcing to tell the truth, because you've got the document. It's right there. Has since the piece has posted, have you gotten a blowback? Well, we're I'm getting a lot of gratitude from people. And Steve, you should know, I hear from a lot of people on the left who are adamantly opposed to this nonsense. I mean, lesbians, radical feminists, Democrat lifelong Democrats who say that they'll never vote Democrat again, because they watch their daughters go get Planned Parenthood test on strong, and then their voice becomes froggy, and they wind up progressively sterilized. This is just tearing apart families right and left. And look, I'll talk to anybody. But as far as blowback, I haven't received so much yet. But a lot of the people, because it's the Christian post, sadly, it has no sway amongst our elite, they just think we're a bunch of crazy people. But the truth is the truth, no matter who's, and I have the receipts. No, because because you have the receipts, what the reason this thing is so so professionally done. Hang on for one second. I think we worked at the technical problem we have with Michael Young Michaels over in overseas runnays in Europe. Also, we have Brandon show water, a quite frankly, a blockbuster investigative piece in the Christian post. We're going to take a short break. We'll be back in a moment. Enough. Gator has arrived. It's time to say what you want the way you want. Download now. Okay, the platform we've got Gator, we're on it 24 seven Michael Jons on a 24 seven. Steve Cortez, Ben Harnewell, Navarro, Boris, everybody, the whole posse is up there, putting up stuff. It's all free. If you want to get a deeper understanding of the show and everything with all the dots, we're trying to connect geopolitically, economically capital markets, cultural issues, all of it. Just go together right now, sign up and I appreciate if you follow me. We'll make it worth your while that we're going to want to bring in Brandon Schulwalter, lead investigative reporter for the Christian post amazing article up. Brandon, and we're going to work with you afterwards. We'd love to have you back in the morning show because there's so much more I want to go through this article. It's so well done. But you used a phrase Brandon called mass psychosis. Can you explain that? We only got a couple of minutes and I want to put it in the context of isn't just the Christian post, you're just haters and these people are already traumatized enough and you've just singled out these people that confuse about their gender for more hate, sir. Absolutely not. I've known people who have struggled with that issue. They're gender confused, gender dysphoria, they've bodied dysphoria. My heart goes out to them. We owe those people whether they're male or female compassion. When I said mass psychosis, when I refer to mass psychosis, that's what I mean by that is I say gender ideology has a stranglehold on our institutions. And so there are people who live in these bubbles where it's just this is all that they have been inculcated with and it's it is like we can't speak the truth normally. The word Orwellian is overused in our society, but I think it perfectly fits with this trans dogma that we're now swimming in. And I call that mass psychosis. We need to snap out of it. And I think that as more and more D transitioners are starting to tell their stories and as they get their stories out and hopefully this is happening around the world, but hopefully it'll start here now. Legal action, lawsuits against these clinics that have disfigured and harmed these people irreparably. We're going to see the spell start to break because the harm will be un-enorable. Brandon, what is your social media until we get you back on here? How do people follow you and how they follow the Christian Post? You can follow my byline at the Christian Post and my social media is on Twitter at BrandonMShow. Sir, thank you very much for coming on or I appreciate it. Thank you, Steve. Blockbuster story. Okay, I want to go back. We get to technicality with Michael Yahn worked out. Michael is one of the people that knows the region where this is happening better than just about anyone. Michael, let's play some of the footage again. I think we got some of a big first. You can go ahead and play it and then I'll bring in Michael for a second. The footage is horrific. Keep the footage on. Just open around my perfect. This, I think, the presidential palace. This reminds me of 2004. It reminds me of what's happening in Sri Lanka. I want to bring in Michael Michael is Baghdad descending into chaos and is this driven by economics or is this just a continuation of the religious strife that we got caught in the middle of? I think it's a continuation, Steve. I mean, this is the Baghdad that you're seeing there. It's the Baghdad that many of us are in. Many watch this experience many, many times. I see it's almost one o'clock in the morning there and there's almost no moon. It's only about 5% illumination. Normally on this night, this late at night, but really dark, moon will start to go home. But I'm getting reports, still my live reports coming in from Baghdad now. They're getting more and more mortar fired into the green zone and looking at the screen. Those things come in here. And in fact, the embassy has evacuated through the German embassy. The green zone, for those who don't know what the green zone is, green means safe. The safe zone where the embassies are, it's been brief. Wallace can phone up. Some of them appear to have been shot down with large weapons. Others may have been blown up for the closest. But bottom line is the Madi army, which the army's worked. Motana al-Sawter. I'll explain who he is in a moment. But they have breached into the green zone. They're actually attacking also appear to be attacking Iranian PM militia. And so there's a lot of interesting things going on here. But Motana al-Sawter, for those who don't know, basically his father was a big leader for many years. Huge cult leader, you might say. And a very big, crucial leader. He was fascinated in the late 90s. And then his son took over. Many people say his son is not the farthest guy in the world. That's what's out of al-Sawter. He has a large militia at least from south of people. He gave us many hard times in Iraq. We could have killed him many, many times. I mean, many times we do exactly where he was. I mean, I was on missions at times where we knew where exactly where he was, what vehicle he was in, tracking him with aircraft and going right by it. Nobody did a thing. So you'll see reports that United States was looking for him dead or alive for years. We knew where he was. Let him come and go to Iran back and forth. And so anyway, he invented Motana al-Sawter eventually left from being just cult leader to joining the actual government. He just resigned from the government. And now his militias are going wild. Keep in mind, this is not going to be all against Sunni. He has fight each other just as much. So in other, there's a lot of factions within the Shia community. And they're fighting each other now. It's clear that the fighting is picking up. I'm getting reports again, like for instance, I see 50 cows firing in the green zone now. And so I think the way things are looking right now, I think this is more than a spasm. That's my guess. As you know, let's talk about China for a minute. China is deeply involved in Iraq. Since we left, they get approximately 40% of their crew trying to get to approximately 40% of their crew from Iraq. So there's more going on here than just Shia, Sunni and government dramas. The normal players are at the table. And the Iraqis, they love a good gunfight. I've been in many people watching. Your show has a lot of veterans. And as many people watching this, I've been in a lot of gunfights there. And they know how this goes. Iraqis, we got to bounce for the six o'clock show. We're going to Michigan, Pennsylvania. Real quickly, how do people follow you tonight for your head back on tomorrow on social media to follow this? Yes, sir. I'm on Gator at Michael, Yawn, 1776. And I'm also that's my Gator page. And I'm also on local dot com, locals dot com, where I publish every single day. Thank you, Steve. I know it sounds haunting, but for the audience, there's chaos in the green zone and Baghdad. I mean, that takes us back what 18 years ago. Some things never change. Okay, we're going to take a short break. Michael, thank you very much. Honor to have you on here. Look forward to having you back. Six o'clock, we're going to go to the six o'clock show. We're going to Michigan. We're going to go to Pennsylvania. We're going to talk about what's happening in those battleground states on election integrity with people at the tip of the spear fighting for the Secretary of State and also fighting to make sure that mail-in ballots are ended in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania all next in the world.
