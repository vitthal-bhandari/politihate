    "text": " Fun question of the day today, what is your favorite TLC show? We all have one, A&E as well. We always want to take a peek behind the curtain and see how other people are living. Maybe yours is my 600 pound life. I want to talk about that because I'm realizing that they are engaged in a type of voyeurism that could be causing real world consequences. Plus, later on in the show, I'm going to tell you about a conversation. You're not going to leave it I had with Hailey Rosa. She was the model that was featured in the Skimsad. We had a conversation and I'm going to share with you details with you. It's very interesting. All that and more today coming up on Candace Allen's. I had such an interesting memory the other day. I was thinking about the show intervention. I used to be completely addicted to it. My mother used to watch it all the time. So I was very young when I would watch this show. You guys all know it. They would intervene. First, they would sort of make you watch and document a drug addict's life. And they're very extreme behavior. And then their family members would sit in a circle and suddenly surprise them with an intervention and essentially give them an ultimatum to go to rehab. And you would hope fix their lives. Well, I was thinking about the most absurd episode that I had ever seen. And I promise you this is what happened. I may not have the drug that he was addicted to correctly. But the memory of this episode first and I'm ashamed to say this made me laugh because it was so crazy. And then I realized now with my adult brain how horrific what I actually watched was. And then I wanted to cry. I promise you I went through these very extreme quick emotions thinking about this episode of intervention. So it was documenting a man, a father who had an extreme addiction. I want to say it was meth. I couldn't be wrong there. And essentially he was about as addicted as anybody could possibly be. Of course it gets to that moment at the end of the episode where they all are in a circle and they're reading letters. And he had a young son whose face I actually remember. I mean he must have been eight years old. And the young son got up and spoke and cried. And obviously these were always the most heartfelt moments of the show when a small child would talk about how the addiction had impacted their life. We'll talk about what they missed about their father. This is what he did through tears. He was hysterical. And it pulled at your heartstrings and you want to always cry with him. And that is how I felt in that moment. And then because the expectation was that after seeing his son cry he would agree to go to rehab. It was quite jarring when suddenly he said absolutely not. F you guys. And he ran. He quite literally ran away and said he was not going to rehab. He would not agree to go to rehab. He starts sprinting onto the streets. Cameras are running behind him. His family members are running behind him. His son is running behind him. At a certain moment I believe it was a family member who turned to him. And this is the moment I'm talking about and said look your son right in the eye and tell him that you're choosing drugs over him. And I kid you not. I kid you not. He looked straight in his son's eye and he said I'm choosing drugs over you. And then he ran off and he sprinted. And it was shocking because you just had never seen anything like it ever before. You never see that somebody that's so capable, so deep in their addiction, so deep in their selfishness that they would abandon their role as a fire. At least lie to your son. Say you're going to go and say you know maybe you're not going to. But TLC documented this right. And then you fast forward and they gave you because he said he wasn't going to rehab. They gave you a little excerpt at the end of the episode, a little update and they said you know days later or whatever it was weeks later. He did eventually agree that he would go to rehab because you were left on the episode with your face just like oh my gosh my mouth is on the ground. I can't believe this actually happened. Then they gave you a little update and they said he did agree to rehab. And then it was another plot to us. It said while he was in rehab they discovered that he had cancer and the guy was dead within like six weeks. And then once again your jaw hit the ground because you went I cannot believe it. This is crazy. I was thinking about this today because of course in producing a show five days a week we have to make certain decisions of whether or not how we're going to air content. What is the right moral thing if we're going to show content. And I thought about those TLC executives who watched this kid be traumatized on television. Right? Imagine the person chasing on a street you watch this moment. You watch this kid be told by his father. You already got the moment of him reading a letter. You've got all the mushy stuff. But you decide to keep recording when this horrific moment happens of a dad saying I choose drugs over you. You don't stop recording. You not only just record it. You then know that the update is that the guy dies. The father dies after realizing he has cancer. And when you're editing this you don't think to remove that content. You don't say this is a child and for the rest of his life this moment will be known to the world. I'm not going to be able to forget this moment because he wouldn't forget this moment even if it wasn't aired. But nothing stopped the producers. Nothing stopped the editors. Nothing stopped the executives. An entire bunch of people from saying this is a bridge too far. That's why I went ha ha thinking about that was so wild and then I went oh my gosh. It was horrible. Who made that decision? This really is how and again that was A&E. This really is how certain networks function. It's sort of this extreme sport of voyeurism. They find things that to them represent freak shows. Really they make this as an executive. So this is an absolute freak show. Can we get this freak show to agree to go on camera and people like us we watch it because we can't look away because you can't imagine that people are actually living like this. You can't imagine that this happens in the real world. It's shocking. Shocking in the worst possible ways. I'm thinking about that today because jazz Jennings. I don't know if you recall jazz Jennings. Jazz Jennings was essentially a human experiment that took place on TLC. Jazz Jennings was a little boy who according to his mother decided at five years old that he wanted to be a little girl. Now of course again I was very young when this show started up. It's now eight seasons in and people could not look away. They're actually going to try to turn this little boy into a little girl. I want to go on this journey. I want to watch this. This is about as real as it possibly gets. And so people began watching. I'm talking about this today because as I said it's eight seasons in. It turns out that jazz Jennings who has edited his facial appearances and has grown out his hair to look like a girl is still not happy despite having four sex change procedures and countless hormone treatments. Here is a clip of jazz speaking about his unhappiness. Take a listen. I feel kind of all over the place and like my mind is very cluttered and not clear. And I really want to have that clarity. I really want to understand myself and be able to read my own soul and what I want. And it's just very challenging. And I think I'm kind of breaking down a little bit and spiraling into negativity. I just want to feel like myself. Like that's it. I don't care. All I want is to be happy and feel like me and I don't feel like we ever. I don't feel like me ever. This is despite again as I mentioned having four sex change procedures and having the entire world applaud and egg jazz and his mother on. Who is jazz's mother? What kind of a story is that? Those of you that have kids and have young children. What kind of a story is that? My five year old came up to me and explained that actually he wants to be a girl. That was all it took. What is that? What does that signal to you? Jeanette Jennings let horrible things happen for profit. On TLC was willing to go through this human experiment with her son because viewers were interested. Now, you don't believe me? Do you still hold a favorable opinion? Maybe you think Jeanette just loves jazz. Do you believe that garbage? Well, let's go back to an earlier season when jazz was beginning this journey and take a listen to Jeanette as she describes forcing jazz to reopen a fake wound that he's had inserted into his body as a sex change procedure. Take a listen. But with her, I'm worried about like her mental well-being and her dilation. I mean, if she leaves my house, we have a dilation problem. That is a concern. We don't have that watchful eye. They tend to go back to old patterns. I have woken jazz out of a dead sleep and taken the dilator and put the lubrication on it and said, here, you take this and you put it in your vagina, if not, I will. But jazz is bad, even when I'm home, once a day. I would be so mad if she goes way to college and that thing seals up. I will bring her neck. Can you imagine? I can't imagine. Do you hear the producer there? No, I can't imagine. The producer is sitting across from my mother that is describing how she is forcing her son to insert a device into a wound that was made where his penis used to be. This is on TV. This is allowed on TV. This is allowed to be on TV for eight seasons and people are not outraged by this. Why? Because we have a culture of voyeurism. We like to look at this. This is Ripley's Believe It or Not. That's what TLC is engaged in. It's what TLC has always been engaged in. Want to know some other shows that are on TLC? You can watch 1,000 pound best friends if you want to follow four best friends that happened to be thousands, almost 1,000 pounds, I guess, by the title as they're on a journey, laughter, friendship, and clinical obesity. What's not to like about that? We all remember John and Kate plus eight, of course, who could look away having that many kids, six kids all at once, one pregnancy. Oh my gosh, we have to see where this ends. Well, we know now it ends in divorce and very unstable households, but we can't look away. How about my 600 pound life? Who hasn't watched an episode of that? I'm guilty, by the way. I'm not here to be accused of the story. I am guilty too because you just think to yourself, how could a person allow themselves to become 600 pounds? I want to know. I want to watch. We watch these people as they harm themselves as they eat. In the back of our heads, we say, it's okay because the producers are going to help them get gastric bypass surgery or whatever. Here's another show, My Big Fat Fabulous Life because they really do love clinical obesity, the number one killer in America over at TLC. The reward is fame, the reward is notoriety. How about my strange addiction? Another show on TLC, this is an image of a man that is making out with his car because his strange addiction is he loves his car so much. He's in a relationship with his car. What we are really seeing is an example of many, many shows in which the producers have discovered that mental illness is prominent in America, that mental illness and addiction are prominent themes in America. They want to be the first ones to capture it. They want to be the first ones to put a camera in it because they know that it's difficult to look away from a circus act. It is. As I said, I am guilty, so I am asking the question as we are constantly examining these topics when we are looking at children that are being encouraged to harm themselves and we point to a very sick culture that has led us to this unique moment in time. I am asking us to examine how we contribute to it because I know that I have contributed to this. I know that I have watched these shows. What is the result of that? What is the consequence of that? Look around you. We are glamorizing all the wrong things. Jazz Jennings is in my view an abuse victim and I hope that he gets the help that he needs to actually find his true self. And that's all I have to say about that. Even with Roe v. Wade overturned, the number one killer of infants continues to be abortion. In this country alone, abortion takes the lives of nearly one million babies per year. Preborn network clinics is determined to put a stop to abortion by introducing expected mothers to their unborn children via ultrasound. Upon hearing that heartbeat, expected mothers are 80% more likely to choose life. Hi, I'm Aisha and I just wanted to share my journey with how the clinic has helped me come along this way. I just moved to LA to pursue a career that myself going through an unplanned pregnancy. I was debating whether or not I was even pregnant, so I did an online search and I found the clinic. And for sure, I was doing this. I made the appointment. I showed up to my appointment. I spoke to one of the counselors and took a test. While I was waiting, they talked to me about different pregnancy choices and different options and information that helped me be more educated. The test is positive. To confirm, I got an ultrasound of the pregnancy test and it was for sure positive and I got to hear and see my baby for the first time. Hearing the heartbeat made me cry. And it was certain that I was going to keep my baby forever. And from time to time, I still go to the clinic to get additional services like baby clothes and diapers and other things. And I've had so much support from everyone, the staff, the volunteers. I now see my daughter and I cannot imagine my life without my happy, lovely, joyful, smart baby and I'm so grateful. The majority of women who enter preborn clinics are being pressured to abort. By offering them the opportunity to choose life as well as necessary support in doing so, the preborn network has saved over 200,000 babies from abortion. How can you help? A donation of just $28 will provide one ultrasound. $140 will provide five ultrasounds. Let's save some lives today. Help me secure my goal of rescuing 10,000 babies this year. Donate securely dial pound 250 and say the key word baby. That's pound 250 baby. Or you can go to preborn.com slash Candace. That's preborn.com slash Candace. Okay. Now it's time for some topics to do. You know, we talk often on this show about the dangers of social media and how people are doing more and more extreme things for attention. And that I believe that somehow that attention is going to fill a spiritual void, which it never does, of course, because people giving you likes and encouraging you to do things is not actually developing a true sense of self or a true sense of community. Hence, jazz Jennings, the notoriety, the fame, the quote unquote success that you might say that jazz Jennings has from having eight seasons of a show clearly has not actually bought jazz Jennings piece. But I want to then jump into this story because I think it really underscores that point. A transgendered flight attendant, Kaylee Scott gained fame after appearing in a United Airlines commercial. Well, Kaylee Scott has just been found dead on Monday in his Colorado home. He was only 25 years old. This is one of the biggest lies about the transgender that somehow if you go through and you get recognition and you go through all these steps, it's going to make you a more whole person. Again, this person had already received notoriety and attention. He appeared his transition story. I transitioned to a girl in a 2020 trans day of visibility video, which was produced by United Airlines and then declared on Instagram all of these years later that he was planning on ending his life. Here's the last thing that Kaylee Scott wrote on his Instagram. As I take my final breaths and exit this living earth, I would like to apologize to everyone I let down. I am so sorry I could not be better. To those that I love, I am sorry I could not be stronger. To those that gave me their everything, I am sorry my effort was not reciprocated. Please understand that my leaving is not a reflection of you, but the result of my own inability to turn myself for the better. To Ashley, Cynthia, Regina, and Sophia, I am so sorry. Please remember for the good memories we have started and never for my downfall. I will see you all again on the other side. Brianna, I'm coming. This is absolutely heartbreaking to me. It is absolutely heartbreaking to read that, to know that this person was struggling so much internally and to have a society that refuses to have real discussions about why this is, that refuses to address the fact that it is after transition that suicide rates for trans people goes up not before, but after. This is not an individual, at least according to the fact that they were used in an ad and obviously gained a following because they were being used in an ad. It's not an individual that didn't have frontend have a network. In fact, everything that we're virtually seeing on the web is pro-trans. And yet this person did not feel whole. Why is that? Imagine that individual that goes so far that they change their body and they receive all these accolades and they come out and they say, I'm this and I'm that. They now feel this pressure to continue this pursuit. Even if they're quietly having discussions with themselves and saying, this actually doesn't feel right. Even though everyone applauded me and told me to do this, this still does not make me feel whole. I think I'm actually just struggling in general. Rather than being able to say that out loud, they feel pressure because they mean so much to so many people who have also been invested in this cultural lie. Imagine what their option becomes after that. They feel tremendously suicidal. And again, I'm not speaking for any one individual. I did speak to people who have detransitioned and this is the sentiment that they expressed with me. And it is so important that people that may be feeling like they're struggling with identity issues here, this side, we have to stop the collusion that is taking place with big tech to censor this perspective. We have people that are detransitioning that are not being heard. We have people that are talking about these issues realistically that are being censored, just being flat out censored across platforms because it's considered phobic. I'm not transphobic. What I am, if I have any phobia, it is against lies. There is something satanic about telling a child or a young adult that they can change their lives if they mutilate their bodies. It's patently wrong and I will continue to speak out about it. Moving on you guys, and this feels appropriate obviously. We've been in the middle of a firestorm all week unexpectedly for a rather flippant, I will admit, remark that I made weeks ago because we constantly talk about DEI initiatives and why they're dangerous and why they're patronizing and why everyone needing to feel seen needs to recognize that you actually need to cultivate a better interior life. You should not want the world to edit and to reflect you and your pains and the things that you have gone through. You need to triumph the things that you have been through. I always say you do not want to be known as a victim, you want to be known as a victor because every single person is a victim. Well the thing that we got wrong obviously in talking about the SKIMS campaign is we thought this was another DEI initiative because it just says SKIMS made for everybody available in size extra, extra small and 4x. When I saw this, I said what is this? Like is this the purpose of just you trying to say we are now going to make models that are disabled on crutches, burn victims and because everybody needs to feel included which is actually an impossible thing. It is impossible for everybody to include it. We are all different in some aspect and as I said we all have traumas. And so anyways it actually turned out which we talked about on the show a couple of days ago that these SKIMS do actually possess a technology that is made for disabled individuals to be able to get into them easier which is wonderful because that's actually technological advancement and that is progress and so we just got it wrong. We didn't have the details and when we had the details we then shared them so I can't say enough that I thought okay it's very important to say that we got that wrong. But I took it a step further. I spoke with Haley Rosa. Haley Rosa is one of the models that was featured in the SKIMS campaign who is wheelchair bound and she had done some videos about me and she had spoken to Forbes and she had said I'd be willing to educate Candace and after having a discussion I wanted to bring it to the forefront with her permission that I would say exactly what we spoke about. So first and foremost the most important thing for me to say to her was that irrespective of whether or not I wanted to make a point about diversity, equity, inclusion. If I was an actual model that was in this campaign and I heard Candace say like what is this I would probably be offended and so I apologize to her because I was like this actually was not about you. I realized what had happened was that people who listened to the show regularly the reason why nobody blinked when I said that is because you hear me talking about diversity, equity, inclusion and why it's patronizing and why it's wrong. If you followed my entire career you know this is what I believe. I do not believe that you should assert yourself as a victim and let people hand you participation trophies. I think that is a meritocracy. But if you do not follow the show at all, it all you see is this five second clip about a SKIMSAD and we don't go deep into diversity, equity, inclusion things. It's like Candace must hate everybody who's in a wheelchair which is obviously pointed to the ridiculous and so I said to her no I, this is a regular beat on my show. I always talk about the harms of diversity, equity, inclusion and this particular ad clearly I was wrong because it quite literally was designed for people that were disabled and so the most appropriate models would have been people that were disabled. What she offered back to me was that she didn't understand my perspective. She said I also do other ads that are not necessarily for disabled. I just model for other things and do you think that's wrong? I explained to her I do find it to be patronizing. I do think that the average person when they see an ad and they've got one fat person, one black person, one person that's an amputee, one person that's a, I don't know, has cancer maybe has no hair. I think they process that as somebody in the back checking boxes. It doesn't seem to me that they are hiring you for any other reason than to say see we're so inclusive and we're so diverse not because they actually think you're talented and I gave her the example of Lizzo. I said it's pointedly ridiculous. It would be pointedly ridiculous for her to be modeling bathing suits, swimsuits and she said, well I think Lizzo is really pretty in the face. I offered back to her. You qualify that by saying in the face for a reason there is such a thing as objective beauty as something that is aspirational, something that I am not. I remember meeting Scarlett Johansson one time and I was blown away by how beautiful this woman was. She is genetically blessed and she said, well I don't think it's wrong to include other people and I said I think it's patronizing. We all know that Lizzo should not be modeling bikinis. We know that there is something wrong when Lizzo is twerking in a thong on a basketball courts but we don't want to say it because we want to be inclusive and not surprisingly Haley didn't want to say it. This is the point. I can agree with Haley and I can apologize for misunderstanding the ad that was an honest mistake. We obviously have covered tons of topics all week, we could just show five days per week and sometimes we do genuinely just miss something and I can completely own that. But what I won't do is transform my opinion about diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives and how they are incredibly patronizing and it's really a pat on the head that the people that are behind them don't actually mean them. I think regarding that we're at a bit of an impasse. That's not to say that I don't wish her well on her path as a model or any other person that wants to pursue a path of being a model by the way whether you're able-bodied or disabled. I don't exactly think it's an enviable job. I don't actually agree if you follow the show of them being half naked on the internet ever for any reason even if they're promoting clothes or whatnot. But I do think that we did have a productive conversation so I did want to share that with you guys. Lastly and this is one element again that I think is largely to the fact that Haley Rosa and a lot of these people are not familiar with my work, my anti-victim hood work is how I would probably describe it. One thing that put me, or I should say rather made me a little uneasy was that throughout our conversation multiple times she had asked if I would give a donation to her foundation. And just to me when people are saying to you like what you're saying is ableist and then right after it one way that they suggest that you can rectify your ableism is by giving them money while I'm in a whole documentary on Black Lives Matter. It's going around and saying people you're all racist in one way that you can wrench yourself of this guilt from your racism is by donating to a foundation. Now I don't mean to suggest that what she wanted out of this was money but I am saying that she had explicitly asked for money multiple times and did insist upon me mentioning her foundation in talking about our conversation which I'm happy to talk about her foundation I'm happy to name her foundation. It is called for everyone. I personally will not be donating because I do not believe in what amounts to me as like victim hood corporate shakedowns. I gave her a genuine apology for not knowing the information that I knew. I've updated that on the show. I've rectified that situation. I even have Christina Applegate tweeting at me and I've told her again we genuinely were not aware that these underwear were designed specifically for people that were disabled and so that should be enough. We should not have to give money in the form of indulgences to allow ourselves into heaven. And that is all I'm going to say on that issue. Thank you Hailey Rosa for the conversation that we have. I do think that it was incredibly productive. According to a recent poll almost two thirds of Americans do not have a will.

Moving on to a final story that has been in the news. It is kind of shocking and I'm sure a lot of listeners have not heard of this person. I actually hadn't either but I did follow his trial because it was a media zoo. A rapper named Takashi69. I will tell you why his name you may have seen perhaps in the news is because he was a rapper who was in the blood gang and he was facing decades in prison back in 2019 on racketeering and other charges but he ended up taking a plea deal that lowered his time in exchange for him essentially writing out all of his gang members to the feds. What ended up happening was that those gang members are now serving multiple decades in prison but he was essentially released after only serving about two years. His real name is Daniel Hernandez by the way. Again, he goes by 69 and he even throughout these corporate seedings named Cardi B as being in the blood gang. I mean, it was, like I said, a media circus for a reason. Well, recently he was in Palm Beach County which has got to be one of the most pretentious counties that have been to. It's beautiful. It's beautiful down there in Florida. It really is. He was in LA fitness and he got jumped. I presume these people are in a gang as well but they essentially jumped him for being a rat and you can take a listen or a look at this video from that beating. That's crazy. That's crazy. So he is in the hospital recovering from this beat down. He was apparently sitting in the sauna when these men came in and they just beat him to a pulp and the internet is divided because I don't know only in rap culture. Do you think people would be divided on this? Some people are like, yay, finally they got him. And how dare this man rat out his mates. No snitching and he should have instead be rotting away in prison. And other people are saying, this is an act of cowardice. Why wasn't it one on one? Why is it multiple people that beat him? But I would say the overwhelming sentiment is he got what he deserved and I've regularly spoken about how toxic rap culture has become. And again, I am someone that used to listen to rap. I don't do it anymore. I'm not saying that I would not and I'm not saying that there aren't certain songs that don't engage in this. There's no snitching culture. The idea that this could happen in Palm Beach County, Florida. It's really a commentary on the state of things. I don't see how things can possibly get better in these communities when these people are so brazen in this jumping that they're willing to record themselves jumping him, put it on the internet like they did and say that we got him. What does that tell you about the state of things in America? The next time that people tell you that it's racism that is keeping minorities behind in this country, think about a circumstance like this. Think about the fact that right now within this subset of culture, people are celebrating the fact that he got to beat down. I'm not defending Takashi 6.9. I'm just telling you guys know what happens in America today. And really, that is all that I'm going to say about all of that. All right, guys, that is all the time that we have.
