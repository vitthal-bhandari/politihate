All right. Listen, it's Monday. Of course, we got a loaded show. Joe and I have been hard at work putting together the best video audio content for you. So here we go. The Trump tapes as they call them on by social media platforms have been released. And of course, Joe, you know, it's worse than Watergate, Joe, for the 10,000 time. This is it. They got them now, Joe. They got them now. It's off. It's off. They got them now. So I'm going to get to those in a second, but I want to get to this first. The unconstitutional rule changes, the rejection rates that have been historically low for signatures, the unconstitutional rule changes regards to the 2020 election, 2020 presidential election, the rejection rates, the roll off where people voted for Biden at historic rates, but didn't vote down ballot. The videos at a state farm arena and the allegations of vote switching have just not been addressed in many cases. But of course, the media folks who don't want any objections to this election result, who they've already declared an unquestioned winner for get any allegations of fraud are furious that people like Senator Ron Johnson from Wisconsin is daring to question the election. Despite what I just told you, there's been no addressing of the unconstitutional election changes, Pennsylvania specifically, rejection rates, roll off the video at state farm, the allegations of votes switching. There's been almost no serious rebuttal other than it's a conspiracy theory. Here's Chuck Todd and Ron Johnson this weekend. Before I get to the Trump tapes and Chuck Todd absolutely losing his mind that Ron Johnson dares to ask questions, check this out. There's a three and a half hour hearing, we barely scratched the surface, but organized the allegations. Let's put out take off the table, the ones that have been explained, but also acknowledge the problem areas that have not been explained so that we can restore confidence in our election system. This is an unsustainable state of affairs right now. And that's what we're saying is, as long as I'm just gonna be objecting to this and we're gonna be taking a vote, let's propose a solution in terms of transparency, investigation with commission. All right, Senator, I wanna quote Senator Ben Sasse for you, because what you're alleging is essentially you and your colleagues have created this controversy. So right now we are locked into a destructive vicious circle in some ways as you kind of outlined, except which is you made an allegation that there was widespread fraud. You have failed to offer specific evidence of that widespread fraud, but you're demanding an edge investigation on the grounds that there are allegations of widespread fraud. So essentially, you're the arsonist here. President Trump is the arsonist here. You've started this fire and now you're saying, look at this, oh my God, all these people believe what we told them because you didn't have the guts to tell the truth that this election was fair. So Trump Chuck Todd, who, Joe, do you see his face by the folks? If you're not watching the show on Rumble, please, rumble.com slash one geo, just look at Chuck Todd's face. He reminds you of every sniveling beaver face, little moron you ever grew up with in your entire life whenever you can write you see his face. He's outraged, outraged that Republican Senator from Wisconsin. So you have context to this video is asking the questions I just asked about this election and is going to object to the electoral college counting of votes in states where suspicious activity occurred. Joe, he's furious. He's furious. Chuck Todd beaver face. You see his face the push on him. He's devastated. Now, you know what's weird? This subjecting to the counting of the electoral votes coming up in a couple of days on January 6th. I don't remember Chuck Todd NBC or anyone in the liberal media having a meltdown with the beaver face like Chuck Todd. I don't remember any of that. When this happened in 2005, when George W Bush won reelection and a bunch of Democrats went to the House floor in conjunction with Senator Barbara Boxer, Democrat from California. When a bunch of Democrats went to the House floor to object to the vote count in Ohio, I don't remember Chuck Todd doing the beaver face anytime when that happened. Oh, you don't believe me? You think it's unprecedented that Republican senators are going to object to the counting of the electoral votes in states where this suspicious activity had just laid out occurred. You think it's just checking Armacostas, the audience on buzzman, the very definition of unprecedented means without precedent. Correct? I'm. Yeah. Thank you very much. I'm making sure doing right up lower spline. There's right on target. So if this is unprecedented, what Republican senators and congressmen are doing saying, hey, we want answers to these questions about this election before we agree to certify anything or agree to not object to anything on January 6th. That would mean if it was unprecedented, there was no precedent for it. So let's roll the videotape here showing you how beaver face was losing his mind over nothing here. Let's roll the videotape of numerous congressmen and women up on Capitol Hill, all Democrats, by the way, objecting to the 2005 reelection of George W. Bush in the house for the, by the way, here's the precedent for the unprecedented activity. Check this out. The chair now hands to the tellers, the certificate of the electors for president and vice president of the state of Florida. Mr. President, the objection is in writing signed by a number of members of the House of Representatives, but not by a member of the Senate. Mr. President, I stand for the purpose of objecting to the counting of the vote from the state of Florida as read. Mr. President, I rise on behalf of the congressional black caucus to object to the 25 electoral votes from Florida. President, thank you for your inquiry. It isn't writing. It is signed by myself on behalf of my diverse constituents and the millions of Americans who have been disenfranchised by Florida's inaccurate vote count. The is the objection signed by Senator. Mr. President, I am objecting to the idea that votes in Florida were not counted. The clerk will report the objection. We a member of the House of Representatives and the United States Senator object to the counting of the electoral votes of the state of Ohio on the ground that they were not under all of the known circumstances regularly given signed. Stephanie Tubbs Jones, State of Ohio, Barbara Boxer, State of California. The objection today is raised because there are irregularities across this country with regard to voting. And we as a Congress have an obligation to step up to the plate and correct them. Mr. Speaker and members, I dedicate my objection to Ohio's electoral votes to Mr. Michael Moore, the producer of the documentary 9 11th. Now, maybe say in Dan, you left out some context to that montage of Democrat zeros objecting to the election. It started out in the beginning. If you go back and watch and listen again, if you're watching, you can see its C-SPAN footage you'll see in the chyron in the corner. That that actually begins in 2001. Dan, you said that was an objection to the 2005 re-election of Bush. I did that on purpose because as producer Joe actually accurately stated, the Democrats and Beaver face Chuck Todd are claiming an objection to the electoral voters unprecedented meeting without precedent for the Democrats listening. I know that's tough for you. Not only is that video at the end of 2005, Maxine Waters and others objecting to George W. Bush's re-election. It's an objection in 2001 by Democrats to the election of George W. Bush the exact same way. So really, really weird that's something that's credit air quotes unprecedented actually not only as precedent, but as precedent twice. I left it out on purpose. Not a joke, not covering me tape the show. So if we messed up, I can go and fix it. The end is 2005. The beginning of that tape is the precedent prior to the unprecedented precedent of the precedent of the Democrats in 2001 setting a precedent by objecting on the House floor to the electoral college vote. I just wonder where Beaver face was for that one. Oh my gosh. I've never had a ready for quite this. Oh my God. Craping himself like he took a dolchalax left and I chucked up like he needs to be an adult to pay. Someone can be a wiper. Is that a dead? Are you laughing at me? You never laugh at me. That must be really I have never heard. Are you actually laughing at me right now? I have never heard you laugh at any commentary. I can't take it. I'm trying to get a. You know Chuck Todd. Here's the problem with Chuck Todd. Brian Stelter is so dumb at CNN that in our gold medal of dopey media people Olympics, no Chuck Todd frequently surpasses the ceiling I set for him in stupidity. You just can't beat Stelter. He's that bad. But Beaver face made a shot this week. Oh my. I can't take it. This has never been done before except for 2001 and 2005. By the way, if you want to watch that full video shockingly enough, there's more. There's an article up on gino report.com or drudgel alternative from the post millennial, which has that video embedded in it. That's where Joe got that from. That goes on Joe had to cut it for time. The video is actually two minutes and 19 seconds. There are more Democrats who did it, right Joe? You had to cut that for a time. Because we don't want to take the whole show up and I got the Trump tapes to get to it. All right. A load. Let's move on. So easy. Just so easy for. I said that it folks, despite the precedent from 2005 and 2001, let's go on worse than Watergate. It is worse than Watergate again for the, I don't know, 2462nd time. I'm just making that number up because the Democrats in the media at it again, they've got them now. They've got Trump again. This is another one of those collusion impeachment things. We have definitely got them now. Trump. Trump is 100% worse than Watergate. Call Bernstein of Watergate fame actually went on CNN again and claim this that this was worse than Watergate. He said this for probably the, I don't know, 50th, 60th time, if not more on CNN. What am I talking about? President Trump had a call with the Georgia Secretary of State and absolute failure right now, Brad Raffensberger, who is a Republican, sadly, I don't know what this guy's up to. The call happened, I don't know about a week ago or so, and it's clear in the call that President Trump wants to get to the truth about what happened in Georgia because of a lot of suspicious activity that happened in Georgia that has not been answered yet. There are questions that have not been answered. You don't believe me? I'm going to go to the videotape and show you how these questions haven't been answered yet because facts actually matter and you won't get them from the media. Well someone leaked the tape and ladies and gentlemen to be fair and give you honest coverage. You don't leak the tape. And I say that because I think although the hacks in the media like Beaverface are trying to portray these tapes of President Trump talking to officials in Georgia as an attempt to overturn an election, an attempted voter fraud by President Trump, that's not what happened if you actually listened to the tape. And I say that with regards to who leaked it because I'm not actually sure who leaked this. Because if you listen to the whole tape, the conversation reflects my humble opinion much more poorly on Raffensberger and Georgia state officials than it does on Trump. So I'm not clear who leaked this. It is clear however, Raffensberger at this point appears to be a bit of a snake. Let's go to the video audio first. So here, let's get the bad stuff out of the way. This is the clip Beaverface and others, Washington Post and the times have been focusing on where they allege President Trump's trying to fake an election. He said he wants to find ballots. Of course, I'm going to just give you the bet. This is the worst and Watergate part. This is from NPR and others who've been highlighting this and leaving out the context of the rest of the tape. So check this part out again. This is President Trump talking to a guy named Ryan who was the lawyer for the Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensberger and the Georgia Secretary of State himself. Check this out. Look, all I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more that we have. But it's a big problem in Georgia. And it's not a problem that's going away. And we got it. This is Ryan. We're looking at every one of those things that you mentioned. And if you find him, you've got to say it, Ryan. Look, and there we are. Ryan, I'm going to tell you what we are seeing. Go ahead. What we're seeing is not at all what you're describing. These are investigators from our office. These are investigators from GBI. And they're looking and they're good. And that's not what they're seeing. And we'll keep looking. We'll keep looking at all these things. Well, you better check out the ballots because they are shredding ballots. Where's the water again? They got them now. Oh my God. What do you think? I bet it's the first time we've ever seen this day. They got them now. Oh my gosh. Folks, the tape is nearly an hour long. Now, again, to give both a Washington Post and others have published the entire tape, but that's the part, again, they focus on just like they did with the Ukraine phone call, where they don't actually mention any of the subsequent stuff in there. And the call, they mentioned one line of the Ukraine call about Biden when Trump was talking to Zelensky, the Ukrainian elected, newly elected leader. This is all they're pumping right now. This one clip saying, my gosh, President Trump saying, find vote. What is he suggesting election fraud? Ladies and gentlemen, if you actually listened to the tape, it's clear where President Trump was saying, he's talking about finding illegal votes. Did you even listen to the tape? Of course, you didn't. You're media people. That's not what you do. But what's noticeable here is if you watch CNN, MS, DNC, or other outlets, they'll play you that clip. Oh my gosh, President Trump talking about finding votes, illegal vote, you idiots. They leave out the other portions of the tape that are pretty damning for Georgia State Secretary of State. Raton's burger. I mean, Raffensburger, forgive me. Here's another part of the tape where they leave this out. Remember that state farboreena video we showed you on the show? The one that's been the on TV you've seen in commercials, where votes are pulled out from under the table. Remember that one, Joe pulled out in ballot boxes from under the table and are counted when election observers went home because election officials told them that vote counting had stopped. Remember that? Yeah, we've seen that video quite a bit. So President Trump wants answers on that state farboreena debacle, where vote counters, there's no dispute over the facts here, although Raffensburger and his people have tried to fudge this a little bit. Votes were counted early in late into the night, early into the morning on election night. Votes were counted. It appears in the video, there appears to be some double counting, although there's some dispute over that. They were taken out from under a table. There's no dispute about that. While election observers were told counting had stopped. Sounds suspicious. No, listen to President Trump ask some obvious questions about this because nobody has answers. And the Washington Post and others, it's interesting. They don't highlight this as much as they highlight the other part, because it's clear if you listen to this, President Trump's talking about things like this, anomalous counting and questions that haven't been answered. Here, check this out. He used President Trump. This is the part you need to pay attention to. No, no, no, no. Ruby Freeman, about early in the morning, Ryan, when the woman took the whole gang took the stuff out of the from under the table, right? Do you know that the do you know who those ballots, you know who they were made out to? Do you know who they were voting for? No, not specifically. Did you ever check? We did what I described the oral. No, no, no. Did you ever check the ballots that were scammed by Ruby Freeman known a known political operative, uh, ballot here? Did you ever check who those votes were for? We've looked into that situation that you described. No, they were 100% for Biden. 100%. There wasn't a Trump vote in the whole group. But why don't you want to find this, Ryan? What's wrong with you? I heard the I heard your lawyer is very difficult, actually, but I'm sure you're a good lawyer. You have a nice last name. But but I'm just curious why wouldn't why do you keep fighting this thing? It's just doesn't make sense. We're way over the 17,0779, right? We're way over that number. And just if you took just Ruby Freeman, we're over that number by five or six times when you multiply it out times three. And every single ballot went to Biden. And and you didn't know that. But now you know, kind of a serious charge. No. Maybe the kind of thing if you were a Georgia state official. You have this ballot counter counting ballots that came out from under a table after hours while election observers want home. There's obvious these are allegations to be clear, but allegations of potential fraud there. Maybe kind of thing you'd want to look into. The lawyer for the state of Georgia secretary of state's office doesn't seem to be that interested in that. Now do you understand, again, President Trump, who doesn't always articulate things like a lawyer because he's not a lawyer and he's not a politician. What he's talking about finding. He's not talking about fabricating ballots, you media morons. He's talking about finding potential illegal activity, which these guys in Georgia don't seem to be remotely interested in finding. Oh, it gets worse. Here's the part of the video. You know, I'm going to place this say, let me take a quick commercial, but I'm going to play this part of the video audio of the conversation that leaked again. I don't know who leaked this because I think this is more damaging to Georgia than it is to Trump, unless you're, you know, beaver face in the media. I'm going to play the part in the video next where President Trump says repeatedly, he just wants the truth to come out. The truth. Weird. President Trump's trying to get incentivized people to commit voter fraud while simultaneously claiming he just wants the truth to come out. It'll be good for everyone. Those are his actual words. We'll play in a second. But again, if you listen to the media, you probably believe the peepee tape too. All right, our second sponsor today, our friends at stamps.com.

This is where a legend voter fraudster Donald Trump wants the truth to come out because he thinks it'll be good for everyone. Weird stance for a guy who wants voter fraud. Really crazy, right? You didn't hear much about this in the media. Did you check this out? So look, can you get together tomorrow? And Brad, we just want the truth. It's simple. And everyone's going to look very good if the truth comes down. It's okay. It take a little while, but let the truth come out. And the truth is I won by 400,000 votes, at least. That's the real truth. But we don't need 400,000 votes. We need less than 2,000 votes. And are you guys able to meet tomorrow, Ryan? I'll get with Chris, the lawyer he's representing us in the case and see when he can get together with Kirk. All right. This Ryan will be in touch with that. The other attorney on this call, Mr Meadows. Thank you, President Trump for your time. Okay. Thank you, Brad. Thank you, Ryan. Thank you. Thank you, everybody. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you very much. Bye. I have a weird call for a voter fraudster, right? I mean, I'm just throwing that out there for the same people listening. That means not people in the media or liberals. Kind of a weird call. So the media is portrayed this as worse than Watergate. The president harassing Georgia state officials to fake an election result, right? That's a media portrayal. It ends rather cordially. And it ends with a legend voter fraudster, Donald Trump. Just crazy, Joe, how this happened. Let voter fraudster Donald Trump and all the White House cabal trying to manufacture fake election results. It's just weird how when they say that they end the call being very clear that they just want the truth to come out and that that would be really good for everyone, the truth. That's just the strange voter fraud kind of call. I know every time I want to commit vast voter fraud, you know, the first thing I do is call a state official and ask him for the truth to come out, record the call, which I'm sure was recorded on both ends, and an end in such a nice cordial fashion thanking everyone for joining. That's how I do it, right? I mean, I mean, sorry. Again, folks, I how many times are we going to fall for this worse than Watergate? We got them now. Here it is. President Trump to Trump tapes on tape demanding voter fraud. Yeah, we always do that when we ask for the truth and then start asking basic questions like, hey, what about those allegations of voter fraud and state farm arena? Do you guys get to the bottom of that? No, no, we didn't. Oh, okay. Okay. Oh, nice. Now, again, in case you think I'm making this up and you want to beatify Georgia Secretary of State, Brad Raffensberger to you think, Oh, what a great guy. He's answered all the questions. I don't know this guy. Never met him in my life, but he is a public official subject to scrutiny. Is he not that video and state farm arena is devastating? You're saying Trump's lying. Brad Raffensberger's answered all the all these questions about state he has. Check out this interesting piece in the epic times in the show notes. I strongly encourage you to read. Bongino dot com slash newsletter. The newsletter is the show notes. Same thing. Subscribe free. We'll email him to you every morning. Here's a fascinating piece by Jack Phillips at the epic times. Trump, Georgia Secretary of State is unable to answer ballots under the table questions. Raffensberger says it's not true. So let's give the allegations President Trump and his team and the video we've actually seen at state farm arena, which shows the suspicious activity. Let's get to the allegations and see what Raffensberger's response is because they're claiming on it's all cleared up. It's all cleared up. It's all cleared up. It's all good. Okay. Let's go to the epic times piece. Screen shot number one here. Check this out. Meanwhile, the footage from state farms showed suitcase like boxes of ballots being wheeled from under a table on the night of November 3rd after the poll challengers left. After those boxes were pulled out, it appeared to show vote counting taking place. Wow. That's kind of odd. According to Shafer in a statement in early December, Fulton County workers, this is someone who witnesses continued counting ballots in secret to 1 a.m. Trump's lawyers asserted that the video shows clear evidence of election for now. Raffensberger and his whole crew are like, that's all BS. We've answered all of that stuff. Election poll workers leaving counting after hours with no one around you have. Let's check out their response in the epic times piece because this is awfully weird if they got to the got to the bottom of it to use the worst expression in human history. Check this out. Epic times is their counter to be fair to both sides. Officials with the Georgia Secretary of State Office have said the video footage does not show anything unusual. Oh, all right. Let's read on Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling said in a statement that the footage quote shows normal ballot processing. Well, that's that's strange. While Fulton County quote cut corners, wait, wait, I'll keep, please give this up. This is weird. So he just said, Joe, quote, this is normal ballot processing. And then he says it shows that the Fulton County officials in the video quote cut corners and quote showed managerial sloppiness in handling the election and recounts. Those things both can't be true. Like that. Yeah. Strange. So odd. Quote, we have launched an investigation into why the monitors from the political parties left before scanning ended. I thought this was normal. While it was their right to leave early, we want to make certain they were not misled into thinking scanning had stopped for the night. We did it not. They said they were misled you knuckleheads. Walter Jones, a spokesman for Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensberger told the epic times in December. Um, so to use the Barack Obama expression, to be clear, he's just saying that all the time, to be crystal clear. Raffensberger's office in Georgia has still not cleared up. Why election monitors? They were supposed to look, remember, Danielle, I'm watching you, Faka, remember that? I'm on election observers who were supposed to watch the election to make sure there was no fraud were led to believe counting stopped when it didn't were according to the Ronaf of David's felt that they were told to leave because there was no more processing when there was. And these Georgia state officials say, this is nothing unusual and then go on to say, yes, but we cut corners and showed sloppiness. So it's not unusual to cut corners and show sloppiness. And by the way, they still can't answer why these election observers felt that they were pressured to leave. They still don't have an answer for that. But when President Trump dares to ask that in the call and Republicans dare to object on the, on the floor to the electoral college results in Georgia, like Democrats did in 2005 and 2001, apparently without precedent with, and without president weird. But apparently when President Trump asked those questions on the call, this is worse than Watergate, folks. Keep in mind, it's not worse than Watergate that there's a video of suspected voter for an on tape at State Farm Arena, which nobody has answers for. That's not worse than Watergate. Asking questions about it is worse than Watergate. Double barreled for you, if you know what I mean. We will ask questions and you can go. Wazoo time. Here's another video. This is a real gem. Hat tip, friend of mine who sent this over. This is not a Georgia state hearing over election malfeasance that happened to just a little bit ago. And this is a state representative from Georgia who by the way is a very, I watched the whole video. The hearing's interesting. This guy's not some bomb thrower. He acknowledges that what came out from under the table were ballot boxes, not suitcases. Fair enough. I don't care if they were suitcase or buy. That's irrelevant. The fact they were under the table. But he acknowledges that that maybe suitcases sounded a little weird that the ballot boxes were pretty standard, but they were hit under a table and did come out after hours on election observers left. None of that is actually in dispute. So he plays it fair to both sides. And I want to play this video where he's confronting an official. You're not going to get there's no answer to this. So you're just going to get the Georgia state rep. And he's like, wait, you guys said you cleared all this up about counting after hours, votes in the state farm arena without people around. But you haven't really cleared it up. Check this out. What was most disappointing to me was this part of the statement. In a statement to pull it a fact or to fact check that or the secretary of states office, quote, we have launched an investigation to why monitors from political parties left before scanning ended. The secretary of states office said in this statement, while it was there right to leave early, we want to make sure they were not misled into thinking scanning had stopped for the night when it had not. Nothing we have learned from the independent monitor or our investigation has suggested any improper violence were scanned. The monitor, who agreed to be interviewed on the condition of not being named due to death threats faced by election workers, told us he was in the room from about 8 15 p.m. And when he left and returned at 11 52, it doesn't take a whole lot of math to realize that's a lot longer than one hour. And then this is the best part. The deputy secretary of state told fact check that the monitor was not required to be there at all times, but she instructed him to return after hearing the news outlets that the county was going to cease counting for the night. This means that the deputy secretary of state knew the entire time that there was not an observer in the room when ballot scanning was happening. And they sent two memos to us saying that there was. The story doesn't add up. Somebody isn't telling the truth. If I compare it, there is a conspiracy theory that's phenomenal. How it's a conspiracy theory, yet the conspiracy involves actual facts. Like the Georgia Secretary of State's office was obviously aware there was no ballot observers, election observers there, while ballot counting continued. And the implication was that they had to leave because ballot counting wouldn't continue when it did continue. And then ballots are taken from under the table to be counted when ballot observers aren't there. Really weird, right? That's why I'm telling you folks, I'm not sure who leaked this tape. If you know what I mean, because when you actually listen to the tape, it's pretty damning for Georgia Secretary of State, Raffensberger, and their office, not for Trump. But of course, it's the cool beaver face crowd and all wants to pile on because they're morons. Oh my God, why is the Watergate? You think it'd be interesting to get to the bottom of that? Why the Georgia Secretary of State, this state rep has documents from the guy's deputy, the Secretary of State's deputy in charge of the election, ultimately in the end, the Secretary of State, where they knew ballot observers and election observers were not there. And it was suggested they should leave because ballot counting would stop when in fact ballot counting didn't stop. And then ballots are taken from under a table to be processed after the election observers leave. And they knew about this. You think that may be something the media'd be interested in? Of course not, because it could be worse than Watergate, like actually worse than Watergate, unlike media worse than Watergate, which means it's not worse than Watergate. And it's not Watergate at all. So disappointed. I got more on Georgia, by the way, this star, this story will be in the show notes today as well. Just one more to kind of show you where this is going. Here's Georgia star news, a friend of mine writes articles over there. Tiffany, I don't know Tiffany Morgan, another friend of mine writes over there, but Georgia star news. Still no chain of custody documents produced in Georgia for 76% of absentee ballots cast in drop boxes two months ago in the presidential election. That's kind of weird, do it, isn't it? Oh, you think we think we'd have those? Joe kind of a good idea, chain of custody. Yeah, unbelievable. You know, when I was working criminal cases, in my prior line of work, if you handled evidence, you had assigned a chain of custody law. T, why would you do that? Maybe because you can't frame anyone then without signing your name to something. Hey, I want to frame Joe for a bank robbery. So let me get my hands on that gun used in the robbery. I'm police officer, Joey Beggadonuts. Okay, sir, here go have it. Why don't you take it home for the night? What do I do? I know Joe, I go say to Joe, Hey, Joe, check out this new gun I got Joe puts his hands on the grip. You bring it back, you put it in the evidence envelope, you go to court, then I say, I got Joe's fingerprints on the gun. Joe's like, I didn't, what are you talking about? I touched that gun last night. I didn't use that gun to rob a bank. He asked me to touch it. No, no, his name is not this has been in evidence custody the whole time. He didn't. Nobody said it's been in an evidence locker. You had me touch it last night. That's why we have an evidence custody log. That's why we have chain of custody logs for things like absentee ballots to make sure there's no fraud in between. Just an idea. Can we maybe get a rise on those two? Nah, of course. We have to focus on 20 seconds of the Trump conversation taken entirely out of context and make it out to be worse than Watergate because we're wasting our time. Folks, shockingly, this gets worse. I've got information in Pennsylvania. Let me get to my last sponsor coming up from the Sean Parnell campaign for Congress. I think was robbed too. Remember that story last week? Joe, remember this one that more ballots were cast in Pennsylvania than people that voted? Yeah. Yeah. Why? Remember that doozy? Oh, I guess Sean's got actual data out of a specific county. Allegheny. How magically more ballots were cast than people who voted. I don't know how that happened. Space aliens. I don't really know. All right. Now that sponsor's there.

Thanks, personal defense network. I got this last night from the Sean Parnell campaign in Pennsylvania. He ran against Connor Lamb in an election. Again, I'm very suspicious about it. We had told you last week about this story at a Pennsylvania like Dan, I thought we were talking about Georgia. No, no, there's more. It's not just Georgia. But again, we're not supposed to object to this election on the House floor because it's unprecedented despite the fact that there's precedent in 2001 and 2005 from Democrats. Here is Allegheny County, Allegheny, Pennsylvania, Allegheny with a GH. Don't confuse it with Maryland's Allegheny County. I ran there. If you spell that wrong, they will not like it. There is no H in Maryland's Allegheny County. But this is Pennsylvania Allegheny County. Here's a release from the Sean Parnell campaign. This is weird. Again, Joe, Allegheny County, total ballots cast 726,720 in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania. Okay. I'll keep that up for a second there. I have, you know what? So I'm just doing some math here. 726,720. Voters that voted in Allegheny County. 605,754. Hold on. Let me do this here. I'll come back to me here for a moment. If you don't mind this, Paul, I'm going to do some quick calculations here, Joe, because I think I got these numbers wrong. So 726,720 people, ballots, excuse me, ballots were cast in Allegheny County. Yeah, it's 605,754 people voted. That's a difference of 120,966 ballots that were cast despite people who didn't vote. Mm. You know what's even, can you put that back up? Would you mind? What's even weirder about this? In Sean Parnell's campaign as released, they actually cite Pennsylvania law at the bottom, which is like really crazy using the law. It's Pennsylvania. They've clearly thrown election law out the window. But here's actual election law. It is 3150 of their Pennsylvania election law, a computation of returns and certification, where they note that if there is a discrepancy in a palpable era, it shall be investigated by the return board. This is actual Pennsylvania law, Joe, really weird how it says this. And no votes shall be recorded from such district until such investigation shall be had. Yeah. So not only did Pennsylvania unconstitutionally change its election law without legislative input in violation of the US Constitution. Yeah, they did that. The Supreme Court was like, we don't have standing. I don't have standing. Sure. Not only did Pennsylvania just randomly use bureaucrats to unconstitutionally change its rules for elections. What's even stranger is we have a clear dispute in the numbers here. Is it explainable? Could be. Do we yet have an explanation? No, that's satisfactory. No. We have 726,000 ballots cast yet only 605,000 people in Allegheny County voted. Clearly a dispute. Pennsylvania law says those votes shall not be recorded until investigation occurs. And clearly nobody cares, especially be for face in the media. Okay. This has never happened ever. Objecting, objecting to an electoral ballot count that doesn't seem to make sense. Never happened despite the fact that happened in 2001 and 2005. You think we may want to look into that in Allegheny County? You think we may want to check that one out? How there are 726,000 ballots and only 605,000 people voted. Is there an explanation? Give it to us. I'll put it out there. Now, officials in Pennsylvania are saying, well, this is just the discrepancy late in the game. We're going to clear this up. All the county data isn't okay. Well, when that comes out, we'd love to hear it. But I thought when there was a discrepancy according to Pennsylvania law, there's supposed to be a not record and there's not supposed to be a recording of the vote until an investigation. And is that actually happening right now? Or are we just taking Pennsylvania law and ramming it up the wazoo again? I'm just, I'm just checking. Well, not everybody sitting back and taking this. Yeah, good solid citizens like a friend Ted Cruz, Republican Senator from Texas. Who, by the way, I have to give him credit. I don't think it's a secret. Joe, wouldn't you say Ted Cruz probably has presidential ambitions again? I mean, he won the Iowa caucus. He ran a more than credible campaign in 2016. Yeah, fair statement. Ted, I like Ted Cruz a lot. Brilliant guy. So it's kind of weird to Ted Cruz who has his own presidential ambitions. I haven't spoken to him. He hadn't told me that. I'm just stating, I think the obvious that Senator Ted Cruz, knowing that if this doesn't turn out Donald Trump's way, Donald Trump could run again, seeing what happens here after this January 6th count. That against his own presidential ambitions, Ted Cruz is deciding to take a principal stand. Do you think it'd be celebrated by the media? Now, here's Ted Cruz on Maria Bartiromo show stating what I told you before that, no, no, no, Pennsylvania, Georgia, all these questions. I want someone to look into this before the swearing in on January 20th. It gets a fair hearing on Maria Bartiromo show, but the media is beating him up again, because of course they want to focus on the worst and Watergate fake finding from the Donald Trump call. Here's Ted Cruz. Look, we're at an extraordinary time in our country's history. We went into this election with the country deeply divided, deeply polarized, and we've seen in the last two months unprecedented allegations of voter fraud. And that's produced a deep, deep distrust of our democratic process across the country. I think when Congress have an obligation to do something about that, we have an obligation to protect the integrity of the democratic system. And so this past week, I spent writing out a position and assembling a group that ultimately of 11 senators that we put out yesterday that we will together object to certification in order to force the appointment of an emergency electoral commission to perform an emergency audit of the election results to assess these claims of frauds. I think we can do that. We can do it promptly. We can do it in 10 days before the inauguration. But I think we have an obligation to the voters and we have an obligation to the Constitution to ensure that this election was lawful. Oh my gosh, what a controversy. How horrible is that? Senator Ted Cruz again, in stark contrast to the media picture. Oh my gosh, he's what a mercenary fool this guy is. This is clearly for his own political ambitions. It is. He wants to run for president again. And if this doesn't work out, Donald Trump's going to probably run for president again. How does this help Ted Cruz? If you can explain that to me, I'd love to hear. No, no, he's trying to get Trump voters for what? I'll run against Donald Trump while supporting Donald Trump. What kind of an idiot are you? Well, your beaver face, it's obvious. All he's asking for is a commission to look into these charges we don't have answers for. What happened in state farmer in Georgia? What happened with the 5,000 dead voters in Georgia who allegedly voted? Now, Raffensburgers office in Georgia saying they didn't vote. We only had two instances. Fine. The president's campaign team is like, can we see that data? Raffensburgers office says, no, we're not turning it over because of privacy concerns. Maybe could we get a look at that? To see if dead people voted. It's hard for dead people to vote. They're dead. Very difficult. No neuronal activity. No kidney function. excretion sweat. None of that stuff. Respiration. No lung. It's really hard to vote when you're dead. Maybe we could get a look at that data. No, no, Raffensburgers office. Oh, it is privacy concerns. Can we do an investigation and check that out? Just just checking. Can we see what happened in state farm? Can we get an answer on Pennsylvania? There's time. Nothing's over yet. It's time to concede that. Hah, hilarious. I could see nothing. And neither should the president. As we say, I've enjoyed. How does the lecture week look for a concession? Any good for you? No, no, no, definitely a no for Paul. That's three for three. And look, the next week either. All right. I got a little time. I want to get to two final stories because it just speaks to the insane times we're in. This is an actual piece of video from the House floor. So Nancy Pelosi, I'll put up the story in a minute at Breitbart. It's in the show notes again, bungeano.com slash newsletter. If you'd like to check it out. Nancy Pelosi, sadly, was just one her House floor voice vote for speaker of the House again. So we have to deal with her for another two years. But a speaker that she gets to change the rules. I'll get to the rule changes in a minute, but we've have an evergreen topic on the show we bring up how the left likes to weaponize language randomly change the meanings of words on any given day. So if you say the wrong one, they can attack you as a bigot, racist. Now, for those of you familiar with the words, very complicated word, Joe, not many people have heard before, you know the word amen. I'm sure nobody's heard that one. You know, I'm being sarcastic. I mean, used almost every day by religious folks around the world. Amen is a Hebrew word. And I, I, Ben Shapiro has this on his Twitter feed. So I had to tip to him. It's a Hebrew word that means it may be so, you know, amen and affirmation. It has nothing to do with the term man or men as in the equipment downstairs. That's not what it means. It doesn't mean a hyphen man. It means amen, like may it be so like in Hebrew. Listen to this gem from the House floor. According to Nancy Pelosi's new rules, they don't want any gendered terms there. So this is not a joke. This is actual footage. Check this out. We asked it in the name of the monotheistic God, Brahma and God known by many names, by many different faiths. Amen. And a woman. What? Like that old song. You're in the store that when a man loves a woman. This guy. Well, man loves a woman. Boom. Who sings that? Percy Sledge. Who said, do you know? Yeah. Percy Sledge. What are my favorite songs? Always good like that. Guys, he was an actual me. Can you do me a favor? Remember that picture you showed me in a news article of you in the band in the 60s? Yeah. Do you remember, do you know the one I'm talking about? Yeah. Yeah. Can you find that? Yeah. We got to put that up on the show. Hold on. I'll send it to you. I'm going to take a note tomorrow. Joe, please. This has to go. I want to show you because I say Joe was like a real musician, dude. Not a joke. This guy knows everything about it. I don't know. I'm a man. What is that? Serious. Amen. And a woman. It's not a. What are you even talking about? So now. Just to be clear. When the word or no, no, not when the word when the M E N designation shows up in a word, we have to make sure to provide an alternate woman to despite the fact that it has nothing to do with gender at all. So I did not plan this, Joe. I actually have another about statement. I want to get Joe. Let's think of some words. So if you say the word like don't be a mensch, you have to say don't be a mensch or a woman either. Or if you're going to say, listen, your behavior is mendacious. You have to say your behavior is mendacious or it could be one man. Dacious. Any of us. I'm trying to think of a few others here. I'm doing this on the spot because I'm just thinking of how ridiculously stupid the left thinks we all are and how there's going to be a mass cultural revolution here that's happening right now because of the left stupidity. Commandment. No, no, no, co woman men men. You suck. Yeah. Okay. I want this. What call woman men men. Oh, what even worse? This could get ugly. Let's say you see someone and you want to say gosh, that person's immense. You can't say that. There a woman meant. Don't you dare. You're just calling a woman immense. That's all I'm not. I'm just saying to a woman. You can't say men woman, but this is where we're you let. Oh my gosh. This is the dumbest segment ever. Yes. Yes. The verdict is in. You are correct. On a scale of stupid. This is zero. It doesn't even crack a one. Why are we covering this? Because it's actually happening. We are now fabricating new words like a men and a one men. You think I'm making this to be the eclipse of joke? It's everywhere. That's real. Because of this Breitbart article, which you can read, Nancy Pelosi has changed the rules on the house floor. She's now banding gender terms like mother, daughter, father, and son. Alana, mestrangelo. Right. One final star is going to get out a little early, but I'm not going to do that because I got out early Friday. And thank you to all of folks Friday show one crazy and Joe, I think you could probably attest to this. I got to be honest with you folks. I was struggling on Friday bad. Joe knows I told you I'd never do a show of I was an up for it. I was but like halfway through, I almost died, which I can't believe I'm not be hyperbino must die. I felt really bad. Let's leave it at that. Everybody's got problems. Don't don't cry for me, Argentina. I'll be okay. But Friday was probably the worst I felt in a long time. I feel good today as you can tell by my energy level. I was stunned. I said to Joe and Paul, I have to show my the shows of disaster and abomination to humankind. You must have loved it. The show did crazy numbers for a Friday after New Year's Eve, New Year's Day. The show went crazy. I'm not even kidding. I so thank you. I thought it was the worst show I've ever done in human history. Joe didn't think it was that bad, but I was the end of the show. I had to wrap it up. I mean, I like halfway through, you could see my face. My temperature was going up everything. So today, I'm not going to get I'm going to cover this last story. I just want to show you again about the professional BS's on the left, how they love to lie to you. This guy, Judd Legum is East hilarious. I mean, hilarious, tragically hilarious. This is a guy who dedicates his social media account to trying to eat. This is how he portrays himself to be a truth teller, holding the social media companies accountable. What he basically does is he spends all day attacking Facebook and Twitter for not fake fact checking conservatives. In other words, he targets conservatism, pretends to be a truth teller. So here's a tweet from him. This guy, Judd Legum, clown tweet. He wants to know why Senator David Perdue running in the Georgia run off ladies and gentlemen, please vote in that election day is tomorrow. Please, nothing will be accomplished by not voting that won't make it worse. I get it. The Republicans are not great. I don't even think these two candidates for that terrific. I'm just being straight with you. The other two are a disaster. Disaster. Please go on vote. So here's like a big truth teller. He tweets out, Senator Perdue should explain why he is making a white power sign in this photo posted by a Trump campaign operative on October 15th. And there is a photo of David Perdue with three fingers up. My gosh, Joe, that's serious. Oh, man, Senator candidate David Perdue sounds like a nice guy. I mean, they're not I don't want to bash them. They're not awful candidates. They just, you know, you got to inspire for we got to do a better job. But go please go out and vote like the alternative is awful here really genuinely awful. The Republican candidates making a white power sign. Oh my gosh, that's serious. Sorry for I'm just this doesn't sound like a great way to get votes, Joe, to make a white power sign in a state with a large black population. Bad choice. Except for the fact that they're very bad choice that except for the fact that's not actually what happened, of course, because alleged true teller, John Legum is lying to you or she's too stupid to figure it out. Here's a tweet by a reporter, it's the same Greg Bluestein on his Twitter account, where they actually go to the guy in the picture with David Perdue. Who happens to be black? That's really weird. How he the black guy in a prediction with David Perdue is making a white power symbol really crazy. So a blue steam Greg Bluestein on his Twitter says, well, here's what the GOP activists who actually took the picture of David Perdue that's going viral said quote, I took this picture. I'm African American. The boys in the picture are Native American. They are celebrating reaching 3000 voter contacts, nothing about white supremacy. So it is to be clear. Sorry, I didn't say that precisely. The guy who took the pictures black, the other two in the picture are putting three fingers up to celebrate 3000 voter contacts of the Native American community and they're Native American. And yet, Judd Legum wants you to believe that the three is a white power sign with Native Americans and a black guy taking the photo. And Judd Legum's like, a woman, a woman, this is great. Hey, woman brother. Idiots, idiots. I'm really sorry if you're a liberal waking up every morning, knowing that these are your beatified saints of your movement. Judge Dipwad Legum. Obviously lying to you and you're like, makes perfect sense to me. Of course it does. You're an idiot. So being a liberal, you have to be a moron. I'm really sorry. All right, folks, please get out and vote in Georgia. It's super important. Gosh, if we lose seats, it'll be devastating regardless of what happens on January 6th. It doesn't matter. I mean, it matters, but it doesn't matter for that. It doesn't matter if we lose on January 6th. Us losing the Senate razor band. If something comes out of January 6th and we don't lose losing their Senate seats, it'll still be bad. All right. Thanks again for tuning in. Please check out BonginoReport.com BonginoReport.com.
