    "text": " History isn't the point of the woman king. The Viola Davis funded movie about a tribe of female Amazon warriors. Message is, the movie is on message. Men are evil, women should rule. Hollywood is preaching that message over and over again. You can see it in the HBO show, House of the Dragon. You can see it in the Black Panther, the movie that really inspired the woman king, which is an old to black grandma magic. China wants American men emasculated. It's using Hollywood to achieve that goal. Welcome, welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host, Happy Friday. We made it through another week. Oh, it is awesome. I think I'm going to King's Island this weekend, me and my nephew and brother. So I'm looking forward to a great weekend with family and riding roller coasters. But before I do that, I'm going to take you guys on a roller coaster ride, a fun roller coaster ride today on this Friday edition of Fearless. Delano Squires, Shamika Michelle will be here. We'll talk about the movie I saw last night and that Shamika and Delano saw as well, the Meemaw King. I'm sorry, the woman king. I call it Meemaw because Viola Davis is damn near 60 years old and she's the star and she's beating up men and all this. But before I get to that, and I got a fire that I'm going to start as it relates to black grandma magic and the woman king, give me a few minutes just to talk a little bit about the Thursday night football game. I want to get this take in before I start this fire and Shamika and Delano and I talk about the woman king. I want to talk about Amazon's debut of Thursday night football that featured Al Michaels and Kirk Herb Street and the Kansas City Chiefs and the Los Angeles Chargers. And there's basically one main point that I wanted to make and it's important that I make this point because it highlights why you and all your friends and everybody you know should be watching this show and why you can't rely on corporate mainstream media. No district. I thought Al Michaels and Kirk Herb Street did a great job. I enjoyed the Amazon broadcast. It was terrific. I'm basically talking about the rest of the media, the people that you count on to analyze sports for you and to tell you what's really going on. There's a reason why you should be watching this show because I can make you smarter than all of your friends because I will talk about the things. It's not that I'm brilliant, but I'll just talk about the things. Everybody else in the media isn't authorized to talk about. They're handlers won't allow them to talk about and something very, very interesting happened last night during that Chargers Chiefs game. Something very important happened. Because I've said this for years. The NFL, the NBA, all these live sports, all they are are TV shows. They're no different than whatever your favorite TV show is right now. If it's House of the Dragons, if it's reruns of the Cosby Show or Martin Lawrence, that's all the NFL list. And you know what they do on TV shows? They write people and characters in and out of the script. And we saw that last night. No one else is going to tell you this. Eric B. Enemy, the alleged offensive coordinator of the Kansas City Chiefs. He's been written out of the script. If you watched that game last night and I watched every drop of it except for the first four minutes, maybe it was talked about in the first four minutes and I missed it. Because again, I was that the woman king had to come home, get settled and then watch the Amazon and I missed the first four minutes of the game. And so maybe it was discussed. But I don't think it was. And if it was, it wasn't discussed the way it used to be. Eric B. Enemy, the alleged offensive coordinator, he's been written out of the script. But the whole Andy Reed and the Chiefs trying to promote Eric B. Enemy as the next, the next great coaching legend, the heir to Tony Dungy's throne, the heir to Vince Lombardi's throne. Last night, they weren't talking about Eric B. Enemy. They weren't showing. They weren't flashing to the sidelines showing Eric B. Enemy pretending to call plays. Everything last night was about Andy Reed, Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reed calling plays and running that team. Everything. Eric B. Enemy has been de-emphasized because they're done with it. They couldn't pawn him off on another organization like they've tried the last three years. And so they've written him out of the script. All of that is controlled by the NFL teams. Andy Reed, who are Bill Belichick, they get to tell. They get to green light. Whoever on their staff, they want the television networks to talk about and focus in on. And so for the last two or three years, the Chiefs were having a concerted effort to try to promote Eric Reed, Eric B. Enemy, up off their staff and get someone to take him on as a head coach. It's a very clever way of firing people. CNN, again, this is how TV works. We just saw it with CNN, not with a promotion, but with a demotion. Don Lemon, CNN wants him up off their air. They just took him off his primetime TV show and demoted him to a morning show, New Day. He and two other women, two other women are going to be hosting a morning show on CNN. They want Don Lemon to quit at CNN. They're saddled with his contract and so they don't want to fire him and have to pay him off and eat all that money. And so they've put him in hospice on their morning show until he quits. He's been demoted and de-emphasized and written out of their primetime script until he quits. That's the end game here. Either his contract will run out and they'll just be, oh, we couldn't renew a contract with him or Don Lemon out of pride will take 65% of the money left on his contract to walk away because that's what CNN wants. They're writing Don Lemon out of the script at CNN. No different than the Kansas City Chiefs and the NFL are writing Eric B. enemy out of the script and that's why he was not discussed last night. He's been de-emphasized. They couldn't pawn him off. This hold all the media that has spent all these years, oh, Eric B. He deserves a head coaching job. He's the greatest head. He's getting screwed over because he's black and if the NFL wasn't racist, they've been selling that nonsense forever. Meanwhile, the Houston Texans hired Lovey Smith off the scrap heap, hired Dave Cully, a 40-year NFL assistant. The NFL has no problem hiring black head coaches. I don't care what you hear on TV, how racist they are and all. That race isn't the issue. We've talked about it on this show. I've talked about it in writing. Culture is the issue. You plug all of these men into this emasculated victimhood culture that has been pushed on black people. You don't produce leaders that way. And that's why black men are struggling to get NFL head coaching jobs because they've been forced into a culture that does not prepare them for leadership. That's Eric B. Enemy's problem. And that I wanted to get that off my chest because it's connected to the conversation we're going to have about the woman king. Black people are living in a matriarchal culture here in America. A matriarchal culture does not produce high quality black male leadership period in the story. We can deal with that fact and correct it. Or we can continue to be cowards and wine and cry and call everybody racist and say, oh, it's the white man's fault for X, Y, and Z. It's our fault for maintaining and buying into a matriarchal culture. You eventually. This is what, again, they won't tell you this. If you stay on your knees and continue to be a beta male and a coward, eventually you're going to get written out of the script. That's what happened to Eric B. Enemy. Life knocked on his door and said, Eric, we did the best we could. We tried to sell you for three years. We got all the media running around saying you're the greatest coach in the world. You get in these interview rooms and people figure it out. You're not built for leadership. They won't give you the job. Eric, you know what? They literally tried to get rid of him this offseason. Remember, go read the stories. There was this whole deal. They're going to bring him back and he ended up signing him to another one-year deal. Now they're done. They would give him all the welfare that they could give him. No one would buy the fake product. Rid him out of the script. Now, let me take care of a little business before I like this fire about the woman king. Bank on yourself. Do you really control your retirement money? If you've got a 401k or an IRA or some retirement plan, the government actually controls it. They decide how much you can borrow and when you must pay it back, you will also owe taxes and penalties for taking money out too soon, even though it's your money. Thanks to our skyrocketing national debt, who knows how much you'll have to pay in taxes during a retirement that could last 30 years? Thankfully, Bank on yourself is a better way to grow and protect your hard-earned money. This retirement plan alternative has never had a losing year in over 160 years. No volatility. Your plan doesn't go backwards when the market tumbles and the market is tumbling. I'm watching it every day this week, last week, the week before. Joe Biden is killing us. That's why you need to be out here banking on yourself. Your principal and growth are locked in. You have control of your money without government penalties or restrictions on how much income you can take or when you can take it. Perhaps the best reason of all, you'll get the peace of mind because you'll know the minimum guaranteed value of your plan on the day you plan to tap in. You plan to tap into it and at every point along the way, you can get a free report with all the details of how adding bank on yourself to your financial plan can help you take back control of your money. Just go to bankonyourself.com.com. That's bankonyourself.com.com. Be a good fearless soldier. Bank on yourself. Take control of your money and destiny. Don't, look, I'm sitting out here like everybody else. Watching the stock market tumble and looking at people 401k, looking at our retirement, go to bankonyourself. That's what fearless soldiers do. Alright, let us know your feedback at fearless at theblaze.com. My fire starter, Anshanika Michelle. Next. Hollywood has abandoned new ideas in favor of prequels that repackage and reinforce China approved things. It's a technique employed by ministers and coaches. Effective leaders find new and compelling ways to say the same thing day after day. The Christian minister uses the Bibles, 66 books and 31,000 verses to convey a simple message. We need Jesus. Right now, Hollywood is hyper focused on a simple message selling a different savior, woman. The Viola Dave is fronting it. The woman king purports to be a based on true events drama about a group of amazing female warriors in Africa. The truth is, the woman king is the first prequel to the Black Panther superhero fantasy. Panther sold its woman as savior message subtly. The blockbuster let unsuspecting moviegoers leave theaters believing T'Challa was the hero. The reality is T'Challa did exactly what his mother's sister and a group of amazing female warriors told him to do. T'Challa was a robot, a system quarterback program by a female coaching staff. The prequel, the woman king, is far less subtle. 57 year old Viola Davis is Dohome Africa's Black Panther. After watching the movie Thursday, I wanted to hashtag Black Grandma Magic. Why not call it the Meemaw King? That's the point. The matriarch is the ruler of the patriarch. General Nadeska, the fictional leader Davis played, is an 1823 version of 52 year old Queen Latifas, the equalizer. General Nadeska is wiser, braver, and more charismatic than Dohome's king, Gazels, played by 30 year old actor John Boyega. Casting Davis opposite Boyega is not an accident. It's a message that young black men should submit to and serve their mothers. It's a wildly popular message. The same message was in the Black Panther, a movie that grows more than $1.3 billion worldwide. That's why I consider the woman king a prequel. Hollywood is hoping to ride the emasculated black man narrative to box office glory. It worked in the Black Panther. The Meemaw King is doubling down on the narrative. King Gazels' top servant is a gay man who makes RuPaul look masculine. General Nadeska and her troops outsmart and trounced their male rivals. Factual history tells a much different story than the fantasy spun in the woman king. General Nadeska convinces King Gazels to abandon the slave trade and the female warriors thwart the white colonizers. It's all fantasy. The French routed the Amazon warriors and the British forced a homie to give up the slave trade in the 1850s. History isn't the point of the woman king. Message is. The movie is on message. Men are evil. Men raped and tortured Nadeska when she was young. The father of teenage Woyanawi gave her away to the king when she rejected an older abusive husband. The climactic point of the movie is that women should rule. After an all-female post-war circle twerk, King Gazels named Nadeska a king to rule alongside him. Hollywood is preaching that message over and over and over again. A month ago, HBO launched its Game of Thrones prequel, House of the Dragon. The dragon pretends to be the backstory of the Targaryen family. It's really the backstory of Arya Stark, the female child who would grow up to slay the wicked knight king in Game of Thrones. Arya wanted to be a boy and go off to war. The patriarchy wouldn't allow it. Renaria Targaryen, the star of the House of the Dragon, wants to be a boy and go off and fight in wars. The patriarchy won't allow it. The point is girls would be boys if not for sexism and sexism is ruining the world. The truth is the world needs better men, not women pretending to be men. All art emanating from Hollywood has a secular anti-male theme. It rejects a Christian worldview. The woman king is a farce. It's satanic propaganda promoting the worship of women. It's not remotely subtle in its messaging. In the post-movie credits, during an extra scene, the Amazon warrior Aminza shouts out Brianna Taylor in a ritual celebrating warriors killed in 1823. Can't you see Brianna Taylor, the woman killed in a shootout with Louisville police, is an extension of the African warriors who captured and sold her ancestors into slavery? Yeah, the people who sold black people into slavery are the real heroes. Anyone who disagrees is misogynist and a racist. That's my fire. That's my review of the woman king. Before I bring Shamika into the conversation, I want to talk about my friends at Preborn. This is not a commercial. This is not another endorsement. This is life or death. Here at the blaze, we're building a village of blaze babies with a goal of rescuing 50,000 babies from abortion. Let me tell you a little bit about Preborn and how they have rescued over 188,000 babies' lives. When a woman, under pressure to abort her baby, meets that baby and hears the precious heartbeat, it's an absolute game changer. Because 80% of the time, she will choose life. Preborn clinics are located in the highest abortion areas in the country, standing strong for mothers in crisis and introducing them to the beautiful life growing inside of them. Would you join us and me in rescuing Preborn babies? It's one of the most important things we can do, helping to preserve these precious lives. One, a single ultrasound is just $28, or you can sponsor five ultrasounds for $140 and save five babies' lives. All gifts are tax deductible to donate securely, call pound 250 and say the word baby. That's pound 250 keyword baby, or you can go to preborn.com as you saw me do this week. Preborn.com slash fearless, give us the credit for it with the fearless army, preborn.com slash fearless, fearless, and we can start saving babies' lives. Guys, you saw me do it earlier this week. I'll do it again next week. If I have to, I need to inspire you to help me and us save babies. All right, let's roll out to North Carolina. I had Shamika and Delano go watch the woman king. We all set through this torture. Yesterday, it premiered on Thursday. I'm sure tonight will be a big night. All of Hollywood, all the messaging. I come home, watch the NFL football on Amazon last night. I'm seeing commercials. They got some Washington commanders, football coach Jennifer King. She's in a commercial promoting her football coaching and the movie. And she's the woman king. This movie is everywhere. And this movie is a joke and a disgrace to me. But Shamika, I don't want to put my thoughts into your head. You saw the woman king yesterday as well. What did you think? Jason from the very first, I started laughing because I knew I was in for some foolishness. Now, there were a couple of things that I liked about the movie, but there are so many things that I didn't like. Starting with the way they romanticized Africa, they romanticized these women who would have been a part of the military. And it just wasn't real from them dressing exactly a light to breaking out and dance together like they were Oftown 3, 5, 7, just in sight. It was just too much for me. It just didn't appear real. And so that was something that I didn't like. I've seen people say they like the cinematography. I didn't. I was thinking, where are the flies? It just was too perfect. And so I didn't like the fact that they're pushing this movie as based on a true story. I think I would be more kindhearted if they said inspired by a true story. You know, something so that people would know that it has been, it's false. It's fiction. And they've added a lot of sprinkle and sugar to something that's just not true. I argue that the Black Panther was actually more accurate and realistic than this movie. And obviously the Black Panther's a work of fiction. You said something though interesting that I hadn't heard you say in our discussion earlier today. There were things you liked about the movie. In the interest of fairness, please expound. So as a mom, I went to the movie with my oldest daughter. I like the whole fantasy fiction part of the mother-daughter relationship fighting for each other and, you know, making sure they came back. That was a part when the Meemaw King, as you said, was getting whipped and my daughter was like, where's her daughter? You know, it just like she expected the daughter to come in and rescue the mother. And so that part, the whole fantasy fiction part of that was just fun. So I like that aspect of it. And I also like that they confirmed what we say on this show a lot, which I think will go unnoticed. That when you choose as a woman to step into a masculine role, you have to deny your very nature. Now, there was one part where the little young warrior was asking like, why can't we be involved with Meem and the one the older warrior was saying, you know, when you fall in love, it makes you weak. And even just the feelings that she had for the youth, I think when we taught you Colin Kaepernick, he looked like Eddivar to me, you know, I was waiting for him to just break out and say, when it feels like the world is on your shoulders. But the way she had affection for him, and it was like she wanted to be with him and how she had to deny those feelings to just walk away and know that she could never be with him. I was like, see, you know, that's what we talk about. You have to deny your very nature as a woman when you step into these masculine roles. You know, you mentioned the Colin Kaepernick character. I'm the half-frickin' de homean. I think his mother was black and his father was white. And that was just one of the things that was just like, oh, here we go. Why are we forcing this into it? And then he's all swole up like he just got out of prison or just left 24-hour fitness. And somehow he's the only, the half-frickin' de homean is the only honorable man in the movie. That's what pissed me off. And again, just I think everybody knows I'm clear on this. No problem with interracial dating, interracial babies, any of that, but for the grace of God or, you know, there go I. Don't have a problem with it. But damn it, that's not who I am. And they keep trying to portray as if like black parents, two black parents can't produce kids and are young people or young adult male adults that are honorable and courageous or whatever. And so it just, it just irritates me. They all in Africa with all these black people. And the only honorable one they can find is a half-frickin' de homean that grew up outside of Africa. It was a fencer to me. The Kaepernick character offended me. Yeah, and I think maybe they called Tyler Perry because that's what he does in all of his movies. So I think they reached out like, hey, Tyler, how do we make this okay? And he said, well, you gotta have a light bright, almost white to come in and save the day. When you look at a lot of his movies, that's exactly what he portrays all the time. And so it was just so much, Jason, you, I think you mentioned maybe in your opening how they had this trans gender or whatever. RuPaul. Yeah, they have RuPaul. They had a drag queen in 1823. And it was so apparent. It wasn't even like it was somebody who you were thinking, could they be? Maybe, you know, like how Kevin Campbell recently came out and said, you know, he was gay. So many people acted shocked, but then there were those of us that said, this isn't news, Kevin, we knew this. But with this person, it was so obvious that he was the king's right-hand man, but he didn't, he wasn't masculine. It was crazy. And the king to me looked like a young Tito when, you know, when Cedric the entertainer used to pick on Luther Vandross and said his curl just didn't curl quite right. I was trying to figure out what is going on with this man's hair because it just didn't curl quite right. It was just so much that was wrong with this movie. It was almost like a comedy because they went to the extremes. And those people that have common sense will see right through it. It was funny to me. I'll say this about the cinematography. I don't know if anybody broke a sweat. They did a lot of fighting, a lot of running around Africa, and no one broke a sweat. The cardio over in Africa in 1820s are the air conditioning was top rate. But the other, you know, you had the RuPaul deal, you had the Colin Kaepernick deal. The other thing I just couldn't get my mind wrapped around is just like Viola Davis. And maybe they're casting her as if she's 45 or 40 in the movie. But I'm sorry. That's a 57-year-old woman. And at no point was I not thinking, this is a 57-year-old woman that's running around Africa beating up men, big old swollen up men. And I'm just not buying this. I mean, that scene, that's what the comedy was to me. I'm like, this old woman running through Africa, and then there was a couple, it looked like they didn't focus long. But I don't know if you called it. It looked like Lizo was part of this army as well. I saw some woman with some big old calves, wasn't very tall. And I'm like, Lizo's out here. She's part of the, what do they call them, the OJOG or whatever. I'm like, they really wild with it. And what these women can do, I guess in the 1820s, I know some 57-year-old women. I'm 55. They not out. And maybe that just speaks to how out of shape we are. But I just don't know. It looked like it was a fantasy movie more than it was reality. That's exactly what it was, fantasy. And that's why I said, if they had said inspired by, I would be okay. Because what they didn't show, and from what I've learned about these women, is that they would go into villages, villages that were unexpecting them, and they would go through and kill like the elderly, grab the adults and the children and sell them into slavery. And so they portray them as if they're this saviors trying to ward off slavery and the colonizers, instead of putting in there, that they were actually a part of the slave trade. And they would sneak up on these unsuspecting villagers and pillage the village and actually were seen as evil people. So the fact that they just romanticized this and made women want to feel like, I'll give up marriage and having children so that I can be strong and powerful and rich. It was ridiculous. And I'm glad I can tell my children it's alive, but we're going to see a lot of people running around just like they did with Black Panther, you know, going in with their daishekis and their head wraps and thinking this is just a real thing. And it's crazy. I thought it was bad, Jason, but it was funny. And I would probably watch it again just for a good laugh. You just took me to a place I hadn't gone to, but really what this was, and really like in reality, these Amazon warriors are the same people that are looting and rioting in their own cities, burning down their own cities, terrorizing their own community. They're black lives matter rioters. That's what they were. They were going around Africa, looting and rioting and enslaving people. And we've now turned them into heroes. And so we're doing it in a way that we're going to be able to do it. We're going to be able to do it in real time, but 100 years from now, they will say the people that burned down New York or Louisville or Kenosha or any of the Minneapolis. And that's going to be about the Amazon warriors of Minneapolis that were trying to save black people after the tragic death of George Floyd. They'll make them the heroes. And and and and and and and and. And I don't know if you you caught this, but Delano called me last night after he after he watched it. I was like, Hey, did you catch the shout out to Brianna Taylor in the credits? So, no. Now, as soon as it went off, I was out of there. I had I had to leave right away. And so I called my daughter said, you missed just a little bit, but it wasn't much. And so I asked her like what happened at the end. And she said that they gathered all the swords of those that had died and they were praying over them or pouring something over over the over the source and saying that they would always be with them their spirit would always be with them. And they started calling out the names and I asked, you know, what names did they call out. And she said, girl, I don't know how to pronounce all of those names. And I said, what did you hear Brianna? And she said, no, because she was just trying to figure out the concept of what they were doing. She missed that part totally. So I will. On a serious note, I want to end on this discussion point because I think this is where the movie took me is obviously it's a celebration of the matriarchy female leadership. I thought the end where, you know, Viola Davis, 57 year old Meemaw gets named king to sit alongside and rule alongside the 30 year old king was a message of black men. Celebrate, venerate, elevate, worship your mother, worship the matriarchy and share rulership and power with them and let them guide you because the king, the man had a bunch of bad ideas. And here was Meemaw Viola Davis. Let's end slavery and let's let's sell this a Shea buttercream lotion. It's going to be a hit all over the world. I don't know what that palm oil was, but I'm thinking it's got some kind of Shea butter and I like Shea butter. But that was the message and it makes me think about just the improper relationship between black men and their mothers. That's what struck me about this movie. I wanted your thoughts. Jason, you're absolutely right. And if you notice the Viola, the general or whatever, she had this kind of angst her and the wife. One of the wives didn't get along. It's like they were jealous of each other. The wife thought that Viola got paid, you know, too much attention to why did he favor her. And so they had this caddiness and this jealousy just like we have a lot of husbands now because they let their moms kind of be in charge or rule. And then they have this jealousy with the wife and they don't get along. It was like they promoted that even in the movie and acted as if it was okay. And one of the things that kind of surprises me about Meem, Jason, is that so many men have been kind of feminized by their mothers that they get angry when you even look to them and say you're capable. You're able to lead. We think you're the ones that should be in charge. They're so indebted to their mothers. They don't even want to take the lead. They don't even want to be in charge and they get offended when you say anything about a woman not being in charge because this is what they're used to. This is what they've been taught is the right way. And it's amazing to me that because of how society has been for like the last 50 or 60 years, men voluntarily now let women lead them. It's like there is no struggle. There's no fight. You hear even men now saying women are the backbone. Where? We're the only group of people that have said women are the backbone of the community. We're the only group of people that act as if men are not valuable. Men shouldn't be in charge. It's all the woman, the woman, the woman. No other group of people does this, but we do it. And we will readily say women are the backbone. That's foolish. But not only is it foolish for us as women to think that it's crazy now that you're in charge of the women. It's crazy now that you have so many men buying into it. Like when you see this whole men for Stacey Abrams, what has she offered you all? Why isn't that you're willing to bow down and worship this woman who doesn't even have a solid plan to build you up as black men in the community? Where is this coming from? Except that their mothers taught them, I can't say well, but taught them effectively that put your nuts on the chopping block. We don't need you to be masculine. We don't need you to be in charge. We don't need you running things that now so many men are just easily bowing to it. Just like when you saw in the woman king when she defied the king and went out and did what she wanted to do, even after he told her no, you will not go after these other warriors that were captured. She did it anyway and then came back and was honored in her disobedience. So this is this is what happens in real life. So it was so much played out in this so much that can be broken down that you have to go into it with the eyes of knowing this is propaganda. And this is exactly what they're pushing on our community. The thing that I left there said and my theater was mostly empty. There may be six, ten of us in the theater, but I think a lot of people are going to go see this this weekend. And the whole thing is going to go right over their head and they're going to see great movie, inspirational. This is what we need to be. It's going to confirm in their mind. Turnover leadership to Stacey Abrams, Kisha Lance Bottome, the whole scene at the end, the way I see a lot of people interpreting when she went and set on the throne next to him and he's sitting there. The thing I was like in most people of mine, they're like, that's Barack and Michelle. Oh my God, that's that's the I have Barack and Michelle. That's what you got there. And I'm trying to avoid the cynicism and skepticism, but I'm just like, I don't can can our culture this culture is so matriarchal. Can it be fixed? Is there, you know, because because again, I just keep asking like, okay, if you're the backbone and your leadership is so great. And you're the let's go to the scoreboard. Let let let and particularly for black men go to the scoreboard. We are getting destroyed in every category, falling further and further behind financially, educational wise, leadership positions and corporate positions. The black heterosexual man is falling farther and farther behind. What are your rewards for hopping on board with the matriarchy? I guess it's piece at home with your woman because if you don't, she's going to put you in the spare a bedroom or out on the couch. I guess. And so there's some instant gratification, I guess, for hopping on board. When I look at the rest of the scoreboard, we're getting wiped out. Yes, and it may be some instant gratification, but I talked to a lot of men that are miserable and they aren't happy, you know, with life, but they also don't understand part of your unhappiness is because you have bow to the matriarchy. You have bowed and kind of given away what's innately in you. I think me and just as I feel like women are natural nurturers, I feel like men are born leaders. They're born protectors. They're supposed to, you know, rise up and make sure things get done. But we've kind of taken that away from them that they don't even realize why they're so unhappy, why they're losing in life, why they're miserable. And I think a lot of that is because they've denied the very nature in them to lead and be the leaders and be the providers of the family. And so many of them are miserable, but they don't realize that it's because you're not being natural. You're not being the person that God created you to be. So I wonder, yes, can we get back to it when they won't even accept what the problem is? It's almost like when we were talking earlier this week about how we can see that the culture is declining, but nobody wants to talk about the fact that kids are acting up, you know, talk about the crime in the black community and how it's black people always fighting other black people or fighting Asians or, you know, doing this. We don't want to talk about the hard things. And so until men actually grasp the fact of who they were created to be, I don't know if it's going to be a change because they're going to continue to let women lead and we're just going to continue going down a dark road. I think there are those of us that see the issues. But, you know, a lot of times we're looked at as crazy, you know, and it's not even, it's not a bad thing. Like so many times you'll say, well, maybe I'm just a misogynist or maybe I'm sexist. I don't even see that from you. One of the things that I loved when I first came to work for you was you saying that you were a benevolent dictator. I think that's a good thing personally, you know, and you've given me a platform to speak. You're always kind, but you have things that you want done and you want them a certain way. That's what a man should do. That's a leader. And so I appreciate that. And I wish more men would kind of grab hold to that. We're not telling men to go out here and be, you know, rule, evil rulers and beat women and be controlling. And, you know, that's not what we're saying. We're just saying take your rightful place and be who God created you to be and the same for women. Thank you, Shamika. Great job.

Perfect way to end a Friday show with the smartest man on the show Delano Squires and talking about the movie that Shamika and I just finished talking about but last night or yesterday or at some point, maybe the day before I I reached out to Delano. I said, Hey man, can you go watch the woman king on Thursday? Cause we want to talk about it. I want to get you. I want to get your take on it. So we're going to invite Delano into the conversation and we'll start here Delano. I'm calling the movie the Meemaw King and go to black grandma black grandma magic was on full display last night. I really believe the message to this movie was to all men but to black men in general submit bow down worship your black mother serve her empower her elevate her submit to her will. And I just don't think that's the right message for black men or men in general. I agree Jason that the gender dynamics in this film are impossible to miss and for me, I read it as you know, this is the 2024 campaign slogan for Kamala Harris, right? This is where the Democratic Party wants to go as it relates to our country and particularly as it relates to our country. I'm not sure the black community. It's this the woman King is the brainchild of white Hollywood liberals and the activists BLM black Mark Marxist types because all women women exert full, you know, power and control. The men are literally emasculated castrated. The male figure the king has no real rule or authority. He even elevates his general after she disobeys his order. And all of it is just it paints the picture of men in particular in this case, you know, in this context, black men as evil and rapacious and sinful and oppressive and women as strong and aggressive and protective and righteous. And it follows with the Hollywood theme and it's to the point now where in Hollywood, whether in the big screen on the small screen, if you're a woman who dies in childbirth, that is a function of the patriarchy and it shows how oppressed you are. But if you die in battle, then you are valorized and glorified as a brave warrior queen. And Jay said this whole thing to me was a scyop from from Go. And I actually took down a couple of notes. It was a magic Johnson theater. So, you know, that type of thing, having your phone out is not to be unexpected. So I took down a couple of notes. Here's a couple of lines that I picked up, right? At one point, and I didn't say who said what, but this was in the movie. At one point, someone, the women who were taking captive said, we're not going to hold you accountable for the sins of your husband. At one point, one character said, I do not want, I think this is the protagonist. I do not want the husband. I want to be a warrior. They said, you are the strongest warriors in Africa, right? They said, I think Viola Davis' character said, someone asked her, you have never loved, and she said, I am a gano, you can't have both. So, a lot of it was to say, oh, and one last one, beyond this, beyond this wall, this is a place of women. This was after they said that the only men allowed to live back there were eunuchs, right? So guys literally castrated the Billy Porter character who was sashaying around in his nightgown, who was a unit, they could have just had him with a high voice, but they chose to make him transgender. So this was a complete propaganda job from the word go. I call it Wokkanda. And again, it's a prequel of the Black Panther. Allegedly, this is based on a true story. It's a historical movie that's supposed to glamorize these Amazon, you know, and it can't be historical because if they told the true, you know, these Amazon warriors got wiped out by the French and the Dehome tribe or kingdom or whatever was fueled by capturing and selling black slaves and using black slaves. That's what I love. They all act like, oh, we just captured and sold the slaves to white people as if slaves weren't used in Africa as well. They sold some of them, but they also used some of them. And so it's not a historical movie. It's a fantasy movie. And I almost wish if they were going, not almost, I wish that they were going to make this movie. Just call it what it is. It's a fantasy. It's the wet dream of the left and just call it that rather than, but I don't think they believe the message won't be as strong if we portray it as a fantasy. As opposed to convincing me, yeah, this is the way things were. I mean, women were meant to rule and they were these great warriors. They were beaten up these big strong black, because that was the other thing about it. I went into the movie expecting to see most of the conflict between black Africans and the white colonizers, but really, this was a war between black men and black women, which is a war between black women. Which is on message and authentic because that is what's going on. But I just founded hysterical that they chose a 57 year old actress. 57 year old Viola Day. She's out conquering the world and this 30 year old king that the actor that played the king is 30 years old. And to me it was just a clear mother, son, matriarchy relationship being portrayed. And you and I talked and message is far more important in this movie than anything else. Yeah, correct. This movie is more red tales than saving private Ryan, right? So this is not going to be confused for some once in a lifetime epic about the Dehome kingdom. So in terms of the cinematography, I mean, it's average at best. But to your point, it's about the message. And that message, as you said, in terms of black women largely fighting black men is on brand. And honestly, I think back even to the movie Harriet, talking about Harriet Tubman. The main antagonist was not white slavers. It was, I think the guy's name in the movie was like Bigger Fellow or Bigger Long or something like that. Who was a black slave catcher that she had to fight off and I think eventually kill. So these movies are made for a particular purpose. They take a little grain of history. The homie was a real tribe, right? The Abigee were real imperial guards women. And then they put in a whole lot of, you know, their own sort of social and cultural values. And then they mix it up. And they know, and I'm going to say something that's probably going to offend some people, but they know that the largely black audiences who go to these movie premieres in full dashiiki, right? And all the garb, they did it for black panther. They know that we, many of us, not all of us, are low information viewers. So in this movie, people paper over, they, like I read part of the review on the route written by the type of guy who would have been invited to live behind the doors of the palace. And it's one of these things where he's like, oh, wow, these women are so powerful, whatever, whatever. Nothing about the historical inaccuracies, the lies. This is not the great debaters where it's the college that the black students debater was actually USC, I believe, in real life. And they made it Harvard for dramatic effect. This is saying that the homie were against slavery when they actually were forced slavery. And it was the British that tried to get them to stop the slave trade. But they know that we're such low information viewers that if you sprinkle a little black girl magic on here, right? Strong black female lead, we won't even think about all the other stuff. And they did the same thing with the black panther. The black panther had Trump's America First Foreign Policy. He said, if you invite these people into the country, they're going to bring their problems. So even though it had all the colors and the garb and the ancestor worship and all the other stuff, most of the black folk that I know who went to see that movie didn't even catch that part of it. And even to the end of the movie, not a single black American or African from another tribe or black person from the Caribbean or black expat who lives in England or France came into Wakanda. To Charlin, his sister went into Oakland, but they weren't inviting anybody back. So Hollywood knows if they give us a little bit, you know, a few crumbs and you put the right characters around it, we'll support it, we'll promote it. Even though the messaging in the actual movie is the type of messaging that we say that we don't stand for. Delano, I think one of the, in talking to you this morning, one of the great things you pointed out to me that I missed and it's because literally when I saw the movie come into a conclusion, I first screwed it up to the edge of my seat. And I was like, okay, this is almost over, my pain is almost done. And then as I was like, okay, it's clear, there's maybe another 50 seconds, 60 seconds left. I stood up, walked down the steps, started exiting the theater, and then I turned around just so I could see the full thing. And so the last thing I see are General Naneska, Nawi, the young girl, and then I think it's the tall warrior amendsah, I think it's hurting it. I see those three standing and looking over all that they've conquered, and then the next thing you know the woman king pops up and I'm like, it's over, I can leave, I can skip. And so I left immediately, didn't look back, didn't want to see the credits, I didn't want to know who was fully responsible for this mess. But I think I left too soon because you pointed out to me and please, because I can only take your word for it or I didn't see it for myself, but there's a scene where basically after some of the credits roll, they shout out Breonna Taylor. Yeah, that's right, Jason. I stayed because I'm a glutton for punishment and I was already there, so I say, you know, let me stay through the credits. And because I know the credits are oftentimes, you may tease a sequel or some part of the plot may be revealed. And as you said, the tallest of the warriors, she was there, you know, there was a bunch of swords on the ground amendsah, excuse me. She was there, there was swords on the ground, she was calling out some of the names of her fallen compatriots, right? So it was a scene similar to some of the ones that were earlier in the movie because they were clearly praying to the ancestors. And she called out the one lady, I can't remember, I'm not good with names, but she was like the drill sergeant warrior who got killed in battle. And there was another name and another name, and then at the end there was a dramatic pause, and then she said, Breonna, and then it cut. And I said, yup, I was right, this is all propaganda. I mean, this is meant to demoralize, intimidate, and emasculate. This is peak DEI movie making from Hollywood. And it just goes to show that for these people, it's not about really the story or having any fidelity to the story. It's always about the underlying message that they want to push. And that's why I said this movie was BLM's dream, right? Those three characters you talked about that were on the cliff watching, that's Patrice Colours, Alicia Garza, and Opal Temetty. The only difference is they would have been on the boats with the white people leaving because they prefer to live around white people than they do with Blackfoot, right? But that's what this is, Jason. This is the BLM emification of the Dahomi story. And the people who will cheer the loudest are the ones who are on Twitter all the time saying, we need to teach real authentic history. But they don't mind propaganda when it suits them and it makes them feel like they have some sort of accomplishment because they can link it back to their history. So this was all propaganda from the world goal. Alright, so I'm going to put my tin foil hat on and sound like a conspiracy theorist, but this is what I honestly believe. None of this stuff is an accident, Delano. And I'm talking about Black Lives Matters, starting in 2014 or whatever year it started. This isn't an accident. This isn't three women that just came up with a hashtag and it just took off organically. Someone decided and that's why this stuff is all connected and that's why there's shout outs and references in movies and just like, again, I didn't even go there, but yes, the three Black BLM leaders or whatever, that's what's being depicted. And that's why they do the shout out to Breonna Taylor, the woman killed in Louisville. And it just, this morning when we talked, the first thing you say was like, oh my God, this was a scyop. And I'm arguing, all of this stuff we're seeing is a scyop that there's an organized agenda being executed to emasculate men. American men and we're just happened to be first up in the emasulation. And that's why it's so in our face. And I mean, from the moment, and I don't, I can't remember how early it was, but when they had the Black transgender servant to the king on camera, that's when I was just like, oh, here we go. I mean, this is 1823 and they already got transgenders in the mood, right? In Africa. And I'm just like, oh, it was. So none of this stuff is an accident. There is a, and how do we wake people up to the fact that like the stuff that's being done and being, because there are a lot of Black men that will be celebrating this movie. And think that somehow this is a pro Black movie. The only solution, the only argument I can try to make back to them is like, hey, this movie is out of line with a Biblical worldview. This is not the natural order. And yeah, it's a great little story that over in the home of Africa for a brief moment, they had these women that were warriors, but they got their butts kicked. And that's the reality. And so anybody sitting around waiting on the Black woman to save us has a very long wait, an eternal wait. If men, if we don't rise up and take our leadership responsibilities seriously, we're going to get slaughtered. Yeah. I mean, I completely agree. As I said before, this is one of the reasons I didn't, this was one of the things I didn't like about the Black Panther movie is that you finally have, you know, a Black King who's ruling over a very prosperous kingdom. And he's being defended by women. And just that picture of Black women always being on the front lines defending Black men, either with their bodies or with their ideas in ways that are, to me, like that's unhealthy, it's unproductive. To your point, it goes against the creation order and the natural order. And really what you see here, and I made references to the Democratic Party. And I said it sort of timing and cheek, but I'm actually being serious now. Jason, we are about close to 60 years removed, almost 60 years removed from the Moynihan Report. That report talked about the coming storm in Black America. If some of the dynamics within the Black family are not addressed, Moynihan was talking on a policy level, also on a cultural level. And he pointed out that in a society, any society in which the norm is male leadership, patriarchy, that when you have matriarchy, things are not going to work as well. And we spent a generation looking at the results of that. We saw the rates of autowellat birth, skyrocket in the Black community. It was about 25% in the 1960s. By the 80s, it had crossed over 50%. It's been holding steady at 70% plus for Black Americans in general for well over a decade. And in some communities, particularly among women who have less than a college degree, it's closer to 90% of children born out of well. And what the Democratic Party has chosen to do is double down on the very things that Moynihan said are going to cause problems. They have pushed all of their chips to the middle of the table, and they are betting on Black women as leaders and saviors. And that's why every time that they have a microphone, they are believed Black women, let Black women lead. Black women save democracy. And it's not, again, it's not that I have anything, you know, any antagonism or anything towards the end of the day. And so, when I saw that, I was like, I was like, I'm not a Black woman. It's just when things are out of order, you get dysfunction. That's the way it always works. It doesn't matter skin color, ethnicity, religion. And what we have is a large degree of dysfunction culturally. And so when Hollywood comes along and they make these types of movies, like, as someone who is not even, I'm not a particularly abstract thinker. lean food into masters directors. And so when I was wondering in me I was very subscribed what the \\'alams speech is doing. I was very worried about theivalent social media forces for me they inferred things, but to your point, when I saw that character the the comic, I channeled my son and wife I said, oh I kind of finnute to be a mess man. Because I know where this is going. When you put it in that early, Jason outside of the initial fight scene, the next three guys you meet are a Dad, who won't protect his daughter. an abusive potential husband and a unique and emasculated a castrated unique. Those are the next three guys up in line in that movie and there's no way that you can tell me that this is this is by accident. Now if this was written by a West African writer and they were true to the script and true to the storyline taking some dramatic license that would be completely different. But I think the people who are behind this project have no interest in historical fidelity. It's all message all the time. I want to take you to conversation I have with Shamika and just kind of get your thoughts on. What should, because I think some people will listen to our conversation and be like, well man, they're anti-Black woman and obviously that's not the case. Obviously your wife would contradict that message but what what should the relationship between an adult Black man and his mother what should it look like what should it be because right now our culture is so matriarchal that in general the Black woman is the leader. She's seen as the backbone she's the leader. We worship her. We venerate her. We're reluctant to challenge her. Any challenges seen as disrespect and and I just the I've said this for years and I said this even as a child I don't know if you've ever seen roots but even as a child and I watch that in real time in the 70s. One of the top scenes is in episode one of roots Kunta Kinte goes off to manhood training in Africa and when he comes back at 16 after going through manhood training his mother has to treat him differently and has to treat him with a respect and reverence almost the same as his father and and I as a kid I started saying man that's the way things are supposed to be. I would say this in the 70s and I say it even more now that the relationship between the Black man and his mother is completely inappropriate. The roles are completely reversed. She is always the leader until the tomb and I just don't believe in that. Yeah I mean there's some complicated family dynamics and again the necessary caveat we're not talking about all black men and all black mothers right but when you have a community in which the vast majority of children are born to women who have no husband then you're starting off on a particular type of playing field right. You got a particular type of soil with certain seed and all the things that sort of go into nurturing that. So oftentimes you know you'll hear people talk to like a little boy and say oh you're the man of the house. Kid is 10 years old. He's the man of the house because he doesn't have a father in his house and what that does is that offsets the dynamic between a boy and his mother and on one spectrum of that is the sort of overbearing mother who pours into the son has a hard time letting him go as he grows older. She loves him genuinely she cares for him but for instance let's say he meets a woman and wants to marry her she has a hard time letting go because he's been playing the role of her companion not just her son for the better part of his life. That's the best case scenario your worst case scenario in these type of context is the mother who's overbearingness and as sometimes conscious decision to say well he doesn't have a dad I'm gonna be his dad because becomes takes on certain masculine characteristics and a certain aggressiveness in the way that she talks to and disciplines her son that as he gets older almost feels like a stone grinding him down right he becomes smaller and small even though he's growing in stature he's getting smaller in terms of his spirit and his strength and these are the types of and again this is more extreme case the types of mothers would call their sons bees and say yells at them and curse at them and say you're not gonna be anything you'd be just like your dad and a boy who looks to his mother for comfort and nurturing putting in instead gets antagonism and aggressiveness can develop a certain dynamic with women in which he's a sexually attracted to women right as he goes out he gets older but he hates them because he has unresolved issues with his mother and in the same way we recognize women who have daddy issues there's a lot of guys not just in the black community but we're talking about black folk right now a lot of guys have mommy issues and you can see it by the way that they interact with women because what what'll happen all that time he spent as a teenager not being able to to to grow into his manhood he looks to assert that more aggressively with new women so he he is insistent that they submit to him because he couldn't get his mom to stop treating him like a little boy right so to me the the proper role is that as a as a boy ages right and this is best case scenario if his dad is in his life as a boy ages his mom starts to see him increasingly as a man as a as a he's a boy he's a young man he's growing into manhood she respects him as such when he gets his his own wife and his own family she respects that his wife is now the number one woman in his life because he made a vow to her see only type of relationship between two human beings in which one makes a vow to the other right before for God and family and she says this is my son's wife this is my daughter-in-law this is my daughter and I will respect him and in his family and and I will play the role that that I am set to play which is as an elder statesman as a mother who can impart wisdom because the Bible says a child she honors mother's father and his days will be long in the land and I believe in that but honoring is not overbearing us honoring you you we are not I am not to honor my mother by by disrespecting my wife and making my wife feel as if my mom is really my number one girlfriend that's not honored so so it's it's about getting the order right the ordered affections correct and pointing in the right direction and then trying to ensure that that balance stays where it's supposed to be and I'm not so much speaking to you Delano as I am speaking to the audience here or the statement I'm about to make just because I think this conversation can be uncomfortable for a lot of men and women because take my mug I really believe walks on water closest thing to Mary that we've seen since the old times but and my mother watches the show and so I want to say this with affection and with proper respect but me and my mother struggled for a number of years because of my outlook and approach to life and she lives in the world that we live in right now which is very matriarchal and many of her friends and sisters or whatever they get to be bosses and kids grown kids and I've just never allowed that and tolerated that the mistake that I was making and this is why it's important I'm trying to share this with young people one of the mistakes I was making is that my mother could not see that my worldview was rooted in a biblical worldview because I unintentionally hid that and so she's looking at a son who's doing right by her and taking care of her taking care of my grandmother and all of that but I'm hiding the fact because and it's not an intentional but it's just I was lost in the world I was hiding the fact that my approach is really rooted in my biblical worldview couldn't see it so she couldn't respect it now as she's seen me over the past five six seven years like say this is all biblical and what what I'm the life I'm trying to lead lead is biblical now it's easier for her to respect what I'm doing and get on board with what I'm doing because she can see what is rooted in and so I've said that to say to young men you know I'm just not calling you to just be tyrannical leaders and you know if you don't properly project your leadership model and let people know that it's rooted this is what God wants me to do that'll get your mother on board because most of your mothers are spiritual come from a Christian background it's it's again I say this and again I'm not as much talking to you as I am just the audience and even talking to myself but I look at the mistakes I made in my personal life with with women that were worthy of marriage and why I wasn't able to pull it off and it's because they couldn't see or because I wasn't highlighting and leaning into my biblical worldview and Christian beliefs and things like that and so I made a lot of mistakes in my personal life but and I ended up had to get real old to figure out like the the kind of leadership that I wanted to execute over a woman over my mother over my sister over any woman that I love it can't be done without God it just cannot be done it will fail without God and so I don't want to put it in secular terms but to some degree I do it's it's like men if you really want to control and that's a negative word I don't mean it negatively but if you want a woman to submit to your leadership you better make sure she understands your following God that's the only chance she'll hop on board and so I said my mother I know you're watching and your friends are probably watching and I was trying to handle that as delicately because now I'm gonna be less delicate and just you know just keep it real but I something I've had to tell my mother I was like hey look you can run things the way that some of your friends run things and you gonna get the exact treatment and results and level of support they get from their kids or you can let me run things and you can sit up in this house drive this car sit on you know go on these vacations and do everything you want to do my way or your way but that explanation although factual isn't as effective as saying look here here's what scripture says this is what I'm trying to do yeah that's a much more effective message anyway any reaction to any of that and and I just I just want to put that up because obviously our platform you and Dave Shannon and Verda and TJ Mo you guys are you know following you got family and I just want to give people the opportunity here from men that are living biblical lives or trying to their approach to all these issues so that you know perhaps edify and help other people yeah I mean my my final thoughts are fairly straightforward it's like it's the same message we have generally speaking you know to the nation to anyone we listen to right or that we're talking to which is a message of repentance we need to turn from the things that we have been doing and turn to God because it really is going to take divine intervention to to get the relationship generally speaking between black men and black women back on track because it has been derailed for so long and has have gone so far left that it won't be done by human hands right so it's gonna be a lot of praying it's gonna be a lot of trying to reason with people and get them to see what's going on because right now we in some respects are killing ourselves right I mean well when I think of some of the civil rights organizations Jason you know the NAACP should rename themselves the National Association for the abortion of color people because that that that is that is where the civil rights establishment and I got that from a gentleman I think his name is Ryan Baumgarne on something like that so Ryan that's that's your attribution after this is mine but but but really this is where we are going as a people everything that brings death and destruction Gen Genesis issues about humanity about sex and sexuality about life about marriage all the creation issues have been weaponized on the left and have been inverted and then packaged back to us so aborting your children's liberation the cross-sex hormones and castration is liberation same-sex marriage is liberation and any black person that stands for the natural and moral and creation order as seen as a as a bigot and a hater and at a certain point we just gonna have to deal with it because there's no other way as I said we're literally killing ourselves and even though the woman king and I did think that that one of those scenes I thought was about to be an abortion scene but it wasn't so I'm glad that they didn't go that far but but in in many ways not just rhetorically but literally this is what we're doing to ourselves so yeah I believe we need to pray turn back to God and realize that the designer is the definer and and if in the God says that we should order our lives in a particular way we should trust that that that is the best way to do it because going against that is all only gonna bring us more heartache and pain Kallano have a great weekend I'm sorry that I force you to go see the grandma king but I appreciate you doing that have a great I think you're speaking for Virgil tonight do a great job all right that's it and that's all for us I think I hear tomorrow that means we'll see you next week it's my obligation on hate discrimination isn't up your hands for freedom raise up your hands for freedom I just want I wanna be I just want I wanna be I just want I wanna be I just want I want free I want freedom you"
