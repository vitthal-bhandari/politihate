So Buck I think that we have reached a real sort of I would say significant turning point in the nation as a whole and what I would say is you have and I'm among them every single week I want to thank everybody in Fayetteville met a ton of our listeners who were there for the Texas Arkansas game incredible experience I'm gonna be by the way in Gainesville Florida this weekend for the Alabama game against Florida in a couple of weeks Buck is gonna be with me for his first ever college football game we're going down to Tuscaloosa for the Ole Miss Alabama game which looks like it's gonna be incredible but then also in addition to be in a Texas Arkansas I flew back my 10 year old is about to turn 11 on Wednesday and what he wanted to do was go to an NFL game the local team the Tennessee Titans here with his 10 year old 11 year old buddy so I took a big group of kids to that football game and I've been to a bunch of college football games I've now been to an NFL stadium the crowd began as the flyover was occurring and as they honored September 11th victims this was obviously on September 12th the crowd spontaneously began to chant USA USA I tweeted out that video you can go check it out what I am seeing all over this country with college football fans and with NFL fans is they're showing up selling out their stadiums not wearing masks living a hundred percent their normal life tailgating with friends hugging high-fiving celebrating sometimes your teams play poorly reacting in the same way that you would before and I can't get over the incredible dichotomy between the way the blue check losers in the Joe Biden administration and their anti science advisers behave demanding that we have a vaccine mandate and the way what I would say real Americans across the landscape are actually behaving and buck I'm curious because you went to the US Open for the tennis final and they made a big deal about how they're gonna require vaccine passports to enter and everything else virtually nowhere in football are they requiring them but what was your experience going through to get into that arena to watch that event so I love going to the US Open it's one of the only sporting events that I make a a real I've made a real effort in the past to go to I've been going so I was a kid I mean I used to go to NBA games to and the occasional Giants and Jets game but that's that feels like a eons ago now but I'm going to the final between Medvedev a Russian and Novak Djokovic a Serb who is arguably if he wins one more of the major the US Open Wimbledon French Open Australian Open the greatest tennis player of all time at least by by major wins which is usually how people judge it and I show up there and just spoiler alert in case you didn't see it which I'm sure anybody who cares about tennis did Djokovic got got spanked I mean it was bad he had a tough time three set loss on on center court but as we're going in play they're yelling you must have your vaccine passport visible and your ID in your hand you must they're yelling this and I've been there there's this big walkway with thousands and thousands of people just funnel toward yep the main grounds and then Arthur Ash Stadium they that after they were yelling you at this you know at the top of their lungs they people yelling this is you're getting closer and then they had someone go just just waving people yeah yeah yeah yep yep I am not kidding I could have held up a a soiled napkin I can't wait in my hands a piece of junk mail saying you know I've just won a million dollars or something and wave that and the secure by the way I'm not I'm not making security guard I'm with the security guards on this I'm with them in that they're not gonna do that this is absurd it's gonna slow them down so I appreciate I want to high-five the people who weren't even really checking but it is an extended finger in the center of the hand so to speak to all the people that are going oh we need the vaccine passports everywhere it only if you're gonna do things like this it is truly cosmetic theater it obviously means nothing and we play we were outside the main matches outside this stuff doesn't doesn't spread outside not in any meaningful way we can't be held responsible for people that are afraid of lightning strikes all the time I'm sorry we just can't live our lives that way well and I think it becomes increasingly difficult to argue in favor of any kind of restriction when Americans are turning on their television sets and even if you are among the the the covid fear porn purveyors or one of the people who still terrified that you're gonna die of covid when you're watching a full stadium and they finally have done away with the absurdity of coaches on the sidelines having to wear masks or anybody having to wear those ridiculous shields there is now no indication whatsoever that covid ever existed as it pertains to college football and the NFL when you actually are in the stadium you're watching the games and buck the great masses of football fans out there this is spreading virally now the amount of chance of f Joe Biden that are occurring all over the country including in the 911 celebratory Mets Yankees baseball series we put together a medley don't worry they're bleeped of fans in crowds starting viral f Joe Biden chance listen to this does this sound buck like the most popular president according to electoral math the most most most of all more votes than more votes than Barack Obama yes of anyone million and one million people I mean I think what you have is finally people there there's a little bit of a turning point that is occurring here tipping point that's happening where you have people are getting to the point of fatigue with the stupidity where it's becoming more obvious and here's how it's a that because Clay you know you get to spend more time in red state America I get to spend more time in blue state America right so in blue state America has been this cultural and social signifier of your intelligence to to double mask indoors outdoors to to stand away from people when you're in line and all these these crazy things and you know to sit in the circle in the park that they've made for you and I mean they actually draw a circle on the ground pictures yeah they've done all this that was a signifier now I am seeing people who granted there's you know 700,000 Republicans or 800,000 Republicans in New York City but I am seeing people that are just like I'm not gonna do this anymore I was on the subway going out to the game subway back and forth the US Open masks are quiet on the subway of course I didn't wear a mask because I'm such a rebel but I didn't wear a mask and I'd say about four or five other guys in the subway car interesting was always guys not I did not see any unmasked female in the subway only guys now maybe that's because you know if somebody gets aggressive with you you know you're in the subway a guy might feel a little more comfortable handling the a buddy you know back off thing but people are starting to say this my coffee shop on my corner masks even for the vaccinated it says required half the people and the staff not wearing masks I think there is real fatigue with Fauci's and that's settling in clay in blue say right it's been in Nashville it's been in Tennessee and Texas and Florida but I think even the libs some of them some of them not a majority but like a good chunk of them are tired of this bull crap yeah and look but I think it's it's it's gratifying right my team got their ass kicked on Sunday the Titans got destroyed by the Arizona Cardinals but man I'll tell you being in a stadium that was full again and being able to look around and not see a single person wearing a mask anywhere in my entire section not seeing a single person lining up to get your ticket scanned to come into the stadium and seeing that also taking place Buck all over the country right whether you're a Giants fan in New York or whether you're a 49er fan in San Francisco places that you would anticipate fans would be more apprehensive and nervous and there might be more of a mask related requirement now maybe Lord Fauci is gonna weigh in here because he couldn't have been happy with all the NFL teams joining all the college football team why was he picking on the I want to ask you this you know why would he pick on the college football teams clay but I would also say though you know if you were at a if you were at the Philharmonic or a soy milk tasting contest I'm just saying you would see a lot more masks than you will in an NFL game I agree and I think that's the answer of why Fauci's picking on football because football fans I think in general are the heartbeat of America their middle of the road people who are saying but also not fearful I mean if you're gonna go watch guys beat up on each other playing football hyper masculine sport men and women you're probably not the kind of person who is is fearful of of what might happen to you on a day-to-day basis you can break an arm you can break your back you can go paralyzed playing for them and football comes with a bar more danger than dangerous the players than covid and and yet the people that are there watching they understand that this is everyone there wants to be on the field wants to be there and yes wants to be involved in this sport and look I I'm hoping clay because at least right now they keep there are doing things that are always in contradiction with each other you know the vaccines work so well oh my god unless everyone around me is vaccine you know is vaccinated vaccine I'm gonna I'm gonna get so sick and die even from 30 years old I'm starting to see people are understanding that this can't continue as it is the only thing that would change that trajectory in my opinion isn't even really a case thing it's a if we see the hospitalizations and the deaths are to go up considerably again which would just be an indicator of not just vaccines waning in efficacy but effectively failing after a time period and that's the big question mark that we have to see how it plays out in the winter time but I clay I have more I have other sports thing no way that I would like to talk to you about it's one that I've I've been fired up about for a while it has to do with transgender stuff and mixed martial arts I want to tell everybody big surprise there was a biological male who beat a biological female in a fight over the weekend but this is now happening at the professional level we'll discuss this when we come back you know going online without Express VPN is like leaving your laptop open in a coffee shop will you go and stand in line for a refill I

freedom calls we're here to answer call us at 1 888 freedom welcome back to the clay Travis and box action show if you want to weigh in on covid vaccine mandates the insurrection 911 comparisons football over the weekend anything that has gotten your attention today on the show 800 282 to 882 and I have a sports story that called my attention actually no way what happens mr. Travis and not just bunch of bunch of foreign dudes playing tennis at the US open over the weekend it was actually quite amazing to watch medvedev just tear apart the greatest it just goes to show you even you're the greatest of all time you can have a bad night even the best of all time I mean you know it's just the way it is sometimes but the it used to be that they're in the earlier days of the transgender rights debate and the and the movement around it that you could say okay well we could all agree that there should be some things you know you shouldn't have men biological males playing on women sports and we should just be able to say men by the way because men and women are actual categorizations that exist in reality despite what the left thinks and they said no no no and so now you do have people who will be competing in things whether it's you know they'll be I remember there was the transgender handball player I believe who's like you know a foot and a half taller than most of the other girls on the the Olympic the Olympic weightlifter we just kind of way left or right Laurel Hubbard we've talked about but even beyond that we said okay well we could all agree that there should be some things I mean combative sports boxing jiu-jitsu mixed martial arts you're not going to subject a woman to fighting a man a biological male that's just wrong that's just unethical it would be like having somebody in a boxing match who's just all you know juiced up on steroids fighting somebody who's not that's not right that's not fair right and not talking about two men in that in that example but a lot of my glocklin is the second openly transgender woman to compete in MMA in the United States one her because we all have to say her that's the requirement now debut friday night via submission at uh in Miami florida this is an individual McLachlan former u.s. army special forces retired in 2010 i mean clay i just think this is gross man i know there are people that want to push for this kind of uh you know they think this is a new liberation movement or a new civil rights movement or whatever you look at the two bodies one's a man one's a woman and a man fighting a woman should be viewed by everybody as as wrong and beyond just wrong from a sports competition perspective yeah and i think this is one of the places where you run up against the reality of transgender rights i think there's a huge percentage of people out there i would put myself in this category if you decide that you want to change your gender and you are an adult and you think it will make you happier and you can afford to do it whatever i mean i just don't i don't get that worked up about it right i understand some people are upset about that idea but me i think i'm like whatever i think that's probably the majority i just i really don't care but when you start telling me that you are going to have men who are biological men competing against women and that by the way it's going to be happening in some of our high schools there's a lawsuit out there i'd encourage you guys to read out of canada kit where the canada kit state high school champion now uh in many different sports is a man who identifies as a woman and if you think out there you got a daughter you've got a granddaughters you got somebody who has worked her entire life trying to be good at something and then they end up losing to a biological man it's just not right it fundamentally distorts the entire basis of athletics and so buck you're right it's even worse in combat sports or weight lifting places where being physically large is a tremendous advantage and i i think i can't believe that we even have this going on it's pure madness got to stay healthy these days folks do everything you can to make your immune system fire on all cylinders right you know that's critical over 20 years ago naturopathic doctor dennis black of texas invented texas super food for that very

different topics to talk about coming in this monday search out my name clay travishing search at his name but sexton whether it's itunes whether it's google play stitcher spotify you find the podcast anywhere and we love all of our affiliates as we continue to roll those up across the country as well you guys are the lifeblood of the show speaking of the lifeblood of the show there's a lot of life bloods of shows out there that have to do with taxes a lot of family dad mom carrying the household making sure that you are taking care of your family and some of the details are coming out the house of representatives has finalized some of their detailed tax codes and i got to hit you with this buck because you're a new yorker the headline at cnbc right now top earning new yorkers could face a 61.2 percent combined tax rate under joe biden's house of representatives theory tax plan californians would face a 59 percent rate uh and these obviously are adding up the state and local you'll your federal income tax city state federal combined up to 61.2 percent buck when you uh and i didn't even but in new york city combined top marginal state and city tax rates 40 at 14.8 percent so new york city taxpayers who were the highest earning could face a 61.2 percent tax rate and i got to be honest with you i i don't know if you are a top earning new yorker now why would you stay in the city if you're a top earning californian why would you stay in the city or state uh out in california i think a lot of people are just throwing up their hands and saying i'm moving the tax rates have just become two owners well the data shows that i mean you actually can see who's gaining people who's losing people as states right now and there is not some blue stronghold i mean we think of new york california massachusetts illinois none of these states have people clamoring to come into them who are already in america there are substantial what's interesting is there a substantial immigrant inflows into some and including by the way illegal immigrants in places like new york people often forget california as a state has the most legal immigrants in the country but new york city as a city unsurprisingly has the greatest concentration of legal aliens in one place and clay this is exactly what people have been saying would happen but democrats seem to not really care but i think that the problem that they're going to face now is that new york just to speak as a new yorker used to be a place where if you wanted a certain kind of job at a certain level if you wanted a different up if you know if you want an opportunities in media if you want opportunities in finance we want to work at one of the biggest advertising companies in the world you had to actually be in new york for the yeah they had offices elsewhere but usually i just start out here right you want to be a goldman sax banker bro you got to start out in new york city same thing if you wanted to be in a hollywood you actually were in l.a. and you know you're passing your screenplay around people all that kind of stuff that whole world has changed yeah and we've seen it change more rapidly because of covid than at any other time in memory where now you have yeah that some people are remote working some people are not there's a lot of companies that are still figuring out what the mix is going to be but we ran a 12 month can you work remote test for a lot of people who are particularly high earners and the answer was yes and in that environment now remember some companies may say you have to come back to the office people say well okay maybe i'll go work for that slightly lesser known or that startup or that mid-tier mid-range company that does this i have the same skill set and i'm seeing this happen with people that i know friends of mine who are saying i'm heading to florida i'm heading to texas friend of mine just yesterday tweeted out that she was looking for houses in texas lifelong new yorker like me clay at some point the value proposition swings too far in the other direction and when you have no salt deduction either you started to the numbers on this you look at what it cost to have a house you look at what it cost in taxes you just say why what am i what am i getting for being here in some blue enclave where the crime is rising the streets are dirty the taxes are too high and i'm like i've been my whole life a new york super fan super defender even i lived here when things were really crappy i grew up here and things really crappy the 90s i saw the miracle of juliani ism and the city becoming so safe that it was like felt like disney land you're walking around here real estate prices skyrocketing restaurants or amaze all that stuff but now it's going the other direction clay and it's not just it's new york it's san francisco it's los angeles it's chicago it's happening all over the place you can't find a house in nashville i mean you just can't like my neighborhood the minute that the houses go on the market they are selling for far in excess of what they're even listed for and most of the people that are moving here bok are coming from california they're coming from new york and they're coming from the chicago area they are fleeing high tax areas to come here we have no state income tax in tennessee no state income tax in florida no state income tax in texas and you start to do the math on how much you can save we talk about california and new york uh new jersey 57.2 top tax rate hawaii 57.4 top tax rates this is under the democrats proposed plans now ironically the guy who may be saving some of these blue enclaves is a west virginia democratic senator joe manchen who has just said hey these tax increases these budgets the three and a half trillion bernie bill it's out of control here's what joe manchen said play cut 20 he will not have my vote on 3.5 and shuk knows that and we've talked about this we've already put out 5.4 trillion and we've tried to help americans in every way we possibly can and a lot of the help that we put out there is still there and it's going to run clear until next year 2022 what's the urgency what's the urgency that we have it's not the same urgency we have with american rescue plan we got that out the door quick now it was about two billion dollars two trillion and on top of that you know all the things we've got with the carer's package everything leading up to that so we have done an awful lot and there's still an awful lot of people that need help but you have 11 million jobs that aren't filled right now 8 million people are still unemployed something's not matching up don't you think we ought to hit the pause and find out yes pre-reasonable yeah it's clay it's amazing to be the reasonable voice in the room when you're the guy who says we've already spent six trillion let's maybe do one and a half trillion in addition to the six trillion 3.5 trillion more i mean look at how many global economies even have a gdp of three trillion dollars i mean you start to look at these numbers to put it all up perspective and i worry clay i mean i i give uh i give credit for this to neval ravicon who's a silicon valley guy who just a really interesting thinker but we should have him on the show at some point another guy you should add i'm sold already really interesting guy i think he's the founder of angel list but he's a contrarian but but a a precise thinker and he tweeted something about how yeah the thing about inflation is that before it gets really painful and ugly stock market goes up employment often starts to really go up assets go up in value that you own but then the foundation beneath all this starts to crumble and then then then you have you know people realizing oh my dollars are worthless my dollars are worthless and things get a whole lot less fun on the economic front yeah and that's what the thing that frustrates me the most as a guy who built and sold a small business and still is hiring a lot of people there is a fantastical disassociation in the democratic party modern monetary theory is what it's called between economic reality and business practices that have worked for hundreds of years in capitalistic economies and it's like we're pretending buck those truths and those verities and those realities don't exist anymore and it's leading us to absolute chaos i really am afraid i got to tell you though if you're one of the people out there who's having a bite of your paycheck coming out because of inflation if you are worried

buck and we put out the the fauci signal if you will and clays even got a poll out now on twitter for those who are on twitter by the way if you are follow me at buck sexton please follow clay at clay travis uh on the twitter and uh on instagram buck sexton as well it clays on instagram too uh so you can follow us both there but fauci we've asked officially will he come on the show and we will be we will be respectful but firm but respectful if he comes on the show i doubt he will do it clay i think it's fair to say the fauci likes the friendly outlets he doesn't like he's gonna come on here and clay will be all oh but i don't like masks and forced vaccination and all your natural immunity talk he's not gonna like any of that uh i've already put the poll question up we've already during the commercial break basically got in 2000 votes 92 percent say that dr fauci will decline our request despite the fact that he's doing every media outlet in the country i mean really he's been everywhere we've got the biggest radio show in the country and honestly we would have a respectful conversation we disagree on a lot but 92 percent of you are of the opinion i wouldn't even ask him i wouldn't even ask him so why did you lie under oath about gain of function research or whatever i would be more polite about him lying under oath about gain of function research i would try to say why did you have a a lapse of judgment in your discussion under oath with congress you know polite style clay i'm not even that worried about gain of function i would just like for him to talk with us about natural immunity yeah i will i mean just answer those questions they they dodge that scientific reality because it does not fit with the the narrative of the cdc is going to save everybody which unfortunately is not true we do want to get some calls a lot even patient a lot even calling in here we got dug in utah father two in their 30s good to have you on dog what's up hey i love you guys thank you we love you doing the carry on russia's legacy i love the format of this show so thank you for what you guys are doing so i got a question and then i need to just bust at the end of that uh clay's chops just a tad but i wanted to ask you so my wife and i were in our early 60s i'm 60 long she just turned 63 um so yes she did you know rob the cradle a little bit but our kids are millennials and to my just ah angst it's like how in the heck do you believe what you believe and it's like and they go oh where are you getting all your data from where you're getting your information from the clay and buck show it's like i can't win it's like i mean sounds like the answer is yes which is excellent but yeah yes it is and before you yes it was rushed so it's like are you kidding me and i'm like i love my kids we have a great relationship but we can't sit around the dinner table on a sunday and have these conversations so the sites that they go to and that they listen to they're vaccinated my wife and i are not vaccinated and that's becoming a real sticking point with us and it's just how do i talk to i mean you guys are not my age but you've got kids play one day maybe you'll have kid i mean buck you'll have kids but how do you talk to your kids about it's such a millennial i think i think clay aged out at genie i'm not millennials by like eight months or something technically i'm a great bearded millennial so i can speak from the perspective of not all of us are msnbc watching lunatics dug so that's a good not that your kids are lunatics but you know what i'm saying not not everyone has been drinking the kool-aid of fauciism from even the 30s perspective i think dug what what i try to do with my kids and my kids are young you know 13 we got two birthdays this week so i got to keep track of exactly how old they are but but eighth grader fifth grader first grader what i try to do is talk to them based on facts because it's not as emotional so i can't pretend to know how your kids are going to respond dug but i think looking at actual cdc data and laying it out for your kids without the emotion see what the problem i see in a country today the biggest problem is that everything is anecdotal it's like oh this person who's 24 years old had a severe covid issue and so that means all 24 year olds are at issue or look at what happened to this eight year old they tell you that kids aren't in danger but look at what happened to this eight year old and it spreads virally but it's not representative it's an outlier sample size right thank you so much man for calling and we appreciate it god bless you and thanks for listening and please stay with us here every day clay in order really reminds me of actually shark attacks people are people get really look i'm not gonna lie how many of us have been in the ocean and you feel something tug at your foot you might be your buddy who is you know having to go at you or something but you know you feel something a little weird you go huh you think you're in a scene from jaws your chance of being attacked by a shark is it's not zero so i can't tell you someone listening to this at some point might get a little bite from a from a bull shark or something it's not zero but it's basically zero insofar as you should be worried about it when you're swimming unless you're like chumming the water and you see great whites want to go pat went on the head same thing with a lot of this covid stuff it's like shark attacks jonathan and tennessee what do you got for us jonathan? well hey this is going to be kind of like christy gnomes interview hey it's a conservative on conservative fire but look play this is not because i'm from Memphis but why are you praising the titans or talking about the titans not saying you're praising them when they have gone full on woke they've gone full on woke i have denounced the nfl the nba now i won't say the mlb all the way but how do you get i mean for real how can you talk about the titans when they have their own national anthem well they didn't play the black national anthem which we'll talk about in the third hour i think we got a clip from bill mar i believe that if you like something you don't allow them to take it from you without fighting right i understand some people are like i'm just going to turn off the television first of all i run a sports media company so i'm going to talk about sports as part of my career but even more so i think if you allow the woke idiots to win without opposition then you are giving away a big part of our country so i'm not going to give up my interest and like for sports because i think some of the leaders of those sports are making ridiculous decisions i understand some people disagree but that's my perspective i want to fight and i want to win and bring sports back to everybody jonathan hey appreciate it man thank you for calling in back with more in just a few you're listening to
