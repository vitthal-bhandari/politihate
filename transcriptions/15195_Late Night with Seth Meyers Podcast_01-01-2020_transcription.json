It stars Jesse L. Martin as Professor Alec Mercer, the world's leading expert on human behavior. Now using his brilliant insight into the criminal mind and a dry sense of humor, Mercer helps crack cases that have left the cops cold. People, this show is everything you love about procedurals, but with a psychological twist, I'm telling you, don't miss the irrational, starring Jesse L. Martin Mondays on NBC. From 30 Rockefeller Plaza in New York City, please enjoy this podcast edition of Late Night with Seth Meyers. A day show you'll hear Seth interview with Stand Up Comic Michelle Wolf, whose new special joke show is now streaming on Netflix. But first, Seth celebrates the kind of story we need right now. I'm going to tell you a story about a bodybuilder in Rochester, New York named Willie Murphy. A burglar broke into Willie's house recently, and Willie beat him up. All right, fine. That's what you would expect a bodybuilder to do. But what if I told you, Willie Murphy is 82 years old? And what if I told you, Willie Murphy is a woman? And what if I told you, this brings us to a segment called the kind of story we need right now? This is Willie Murphy. She was about to go to bed one night when a man started pounding on her front door, demanding to be let in. So she called 911. But while she was waiting for the police to arrive, he broke down her door and barged in. What the man didn't realize, though, is that Willie Murphy works out. You're probably thinking, oh, that's cute. She does water aerobics. No, son. Willie Murphy lifts weights every day at the YMCA, and she can deadlift 225 pounds. 225 pounds. That's me holding a microwave. According to USA Today, Willie can do one-handed pull-ups, one-handed push-ups, fingertip push-ups, and the push-ups where you put your fingers in a diamond formation and press your nose all the way to the floor. You know what they call those kind of push-ups? The burglar's nightmare. So how was she feeling? Is this burglar was prowling around her house? It's kind of semi-dark, and I'm alone, and I'm old. But guess what? I'm tough. And you want to know what happens? He picked the wrong house to break into. This is the kind of story we need right now. 100%. Most news stories make me want to jump off a bridge. This story makes me want to jump onto a bridge, or whatever bullsh- they do at CrossFit. So Willie... Willie is hiding in her house, and when the burglar comes near her, she grabs the closest things she can find to protect herself, a candlestick? No. A rolling pin? No. A table. I took that table, and I went to work on him, and guess what? The table broke. She picked up a table and, quote, went to work on him, and the table broke. Most people her age are breaking hips. She's breaking tables. So Willie proppers this man with the table. What next? I'm running in the kitchen. There's a bottle of baby shampoo on the table. I grabbed the shampoo, and guess what? He's still on the ground, and his face, all over the whole thing. She blind him with shampoo. Americans spend $11 billion a year on guns, and it turns out all we needed was some Johnson & Johnson. You know what stops a bad guy with a gun? Apparently, an old lady with a table and some shampoo. So after the shampoo did Willie stop and show the guy some mercy. She did not. And I got the broom, and he's falling the broom, and I'm hitting him. I'm hitting him with the broom, hitting him. She kicked a man's ass with a shampoo and a broom. I don't know if she's single, but I bet I know one guy who's interested. So finally, after all that, the police arrived and put the burglar in a cop car. I'm just kidding. He was hurt so badly they had to put him in an ambulance. Because I had really did a number on that man on serious. I think he was happy when he went in the ambulance. Oh no, I'm sure. I'm sure he was until the paramedics, until he told the paramedics what happened, and they laughed so hard they had to give themselves oxygen. Despite the fact that this burglar was caught red-handed, Willie is not pressing charges, and of course not. She's too busy pressing 225. Plus she wants that man roaming the street so she can find him and kick his ass again. This is the kind of story we need right now. Superhero stories women are usually insignificant side characters, but in this story, Willie Murphy is the superhero. She saved the day, and she did it with a kind, a very kind Christian attitude. I said to myself, if it's my time to go to hell, I'm taking him with me. Very, very personal. This is then the kind of story we need right now. It's time again for How Well Do You Know The Voice. This country superstar is the newest coach on The Voice. Superhero McIntyre. She is a member of Country Music's Hall of Fame. Superhero McIntyre. Finally, where can you watch The Voice? Superhero McIntyre. Oh, I'm sorry the correct answer is NBC. Tell her what she's won, Johnny. You've won the new season of The Voice with John Legend. When Stefani, Niall Horan, and Reba McIntyre Monday on NBC. I've always wanted that. Our next guest is an Emmy-nominated writer and comedian you know from her show The Break with Michelle Wolf and her work on The Daily Show. And here at late night, her latest stand-up special, Joke Show, is currently streaming on Netflix. Please welcome back to the show one of our favorites, Michelle Wolf, everybody. Welcome back. Thank you for having me back. Congratulations on your special. It's fantastic. You used to right here. And I know you tour more than anybody you're on the road all the time, even when your New York you're doing sets. Do you have time to keep up with politics or you pay attention to the election? I've paid enough attention that I can tell this joke or I can take a closer look at this joke. That was really good. Why don't I get a graphic? You work here for two years. Yeah, I try to be a good feminist. I step off the party line quite a bit. Like I know we're supposed to be mad at Joe Biden because he touched a bunch of women over a couple decades. That never made me mad. That made me like him more. Not the most feminist point of view, but I do have two pretty good reasons. One, if you look at every woman who Joe Biden gave a neck massage to, it does look like it felt good. He looks like he just has those hands that know where the knots are. Like every woman walked away from that being like, no, he did get it though. That's annoying. But also you look at every woman who Joe Biden touched. Every woman who Joe Biden kissed the top of her little head. You'll see this guy doesn't have a type. He's doing it to everybody. He's not discriminating. It's old, young, white, black. This guy is swiping right on the whole country. And that's what I feel like we need right now. Creepy old man will love every single one of us. There you go. I stand behind Joe Biden because when you're behind him, he can't touch you. You talk about immigration in your special as well. And maybe a similar take on this and maybe how we're framing it wrong. Yeah, I mean, like I have a friend. She's really worried about immigrants coming in and taking our jobs. And I'm like, well, you're a stay at home mom. Um, well, you know, all sort in your court. Right, right. On that one. I'm much more worried about Americans taking immigrant jobs. Like I got a massage from a Midwestern white lady. And it essentially felt like a cat was walking on my back. And not like an angry or a hungry cat. Just a happy cat. Trying to find a place to sleep. And then a couple of weeks later, I got a massage from a Korean man. And he pressed into my back with the pressure that he had left his whole family behind. That's a great massage. You need a massage from someone who's been through something. You can't get a massage from a woman named Mary Death, or the worst thing that ever happened to her. The one time she got bangs. But you don't want a massage from someone who wants to give you a massage. You want a massage from someone who has to give you a massage. Two very different people. Someone who wants to touch your naked back for an hour, that's a serial killer. Someone who has to give you a massage, someone's like, this piece comes in here and says her neck is sore from sleeping wrong. I work 70 hours a day. I live three states away and I bite to work and this piece and the whole time you're thinking, this is a great massage. The massage table is on the border. You still send in jokes every now and then. And more often than not, I text you, Michelle, why would you think I could tell this joke on TV? I thought it'd be nice to prove that. I picked three that you've sent. And I just want you to picture if it was me saying this in a monologue. Yeah, I wrote these four Seths. They're in Seth's voice. No, they're not. And I think they would have gone over very well. Are you sure you don't want to do this one? I'm positive. You sure? I'm positive on all of them. I don't want to do any of them. One of the words? No, go ahead. Okay, so I'm Seth. There's probably like a graphic here. Yeah. According to new reports, Prince Harry and Duchess Meghan Markle, who are expecting their first child this month, are considering raising their newborn as a vegan? Does that mean the d***? No, because that for grabs said the queen? It's the best girl to win. Good. If you love that one, just wait for this killer. Australian news outlets are reporting that a fire at a genetics laboratory has destroyed thousands of dollars worth of cryogenically frozen bull semen. What a digister. The only thing to do is to make a comeback. The last is severe, but it won't be spermament. Seaman. Seaman. The last one is the one I most didn't want to say. Are you having any doubts about it? No, I think a digister. I mean, that joke has got a bunch of people pregnant, so. I would have gone just after. Just after? No one will ever know why my show was cute. Like bring them home. And just so you know, no matter how the audience responds, as soon as it's over, I'm going to say Michelle Wolf, everybody, so we don't have to worry about it. No, but I think we should wait for them to laugh for a really long time. I'm going to cut it off right away, because I'm confident. Guys, guys, take a deep breath now. You're going to need it. Fill those lungs up with air. And let's prove this man wrong. Officials in Florida yesterday. Officials in Florida yesterday pulled over a woman who was hiding a footlong alligator, her yoga pants. It's the classic. Is that an alligator in your pocket, or you just have a really fluffy vagina? Michelle Wolf, everybody! Her special jokes show is screaming on Netflix. Late night with Seth Meyers airs weeknights on NBC at 1235-1135 Central. Original music on the Late Night podcast is by the HE Band.

How many times have you dreamed of being a king or a queen? I mean, I can't answer for the Riches, but in my heart, they're all kings and queens. But Riches, what if we told you that there's a darker side to royalty? And more often than not, life as a prince or princess is anything but a fairy tale. Ereisha and I are so excited to tell you about our brand new podcast called Even the Royals, where we'll be pulling back the curtain on royal families past and present from all over the world. We do love to pull back curtains. Over on Even the Royals, we'll cover everything from stories you thought you knew, like Marie Antoinette, who was actually a victim of a vulgar propaganda campaign, which started a wild chain of events that led to her eventual beheading. Or Catherine Dibidichi, who was assumed to be responsible for one of the most devastating massacres in French history. But in reality, she was a mother holding on to her dying dynasty.
