    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears and boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Brian McClure. I'm the host and the founder of the Order of Man podcast and movement. Welcome to your Friday field notes. I'm going to share some thoughts that I've been thinking about throughout the week. If you're new to the podcast, I interview incredible men. Learn from them. Try to extract all the wisdom they have to share with us in a short but punchy, powerful conversation and deliver that to you here on this podcast. Now, the Friday field notes is a little different. Unfortunately, you just get to hear from me, but we do have the interviews. We have the Ask Me Anything. We have the Friday field notes. We just did a bonus episode yesterday with Tim Tebow. If you haven't listened to that, I want to go back and listen. Very powerful conversation. But yeah, we're trying to do a lot to get the word out about masculinity and helping you improve as a man. Guys, I got a lot to talk with you about today. We're going to go through four mindsets of masculine leadership. This is from my book, The Masculinity Manifesto, which you can pick up a copy wherever you get books. Also, if you're interested, we have signed copies available. We also have an exclusive edition available with a leather cover, custom leather bookmark, signed copy, custom hand, wood turned pen, and also a signed note card from me. You can get that at store.orderofman.com. Now, one other announcement I want to make, you see me wearing this jacket right here. My camo is clashing today. I've got this Origin brand new 100% made and sourced on America Camo on today. I wanted to show this off. Excited to finally get this in. Of course, it clashes with my Order of Man Camo, but it is what it is. This is where it's at right here. But I want to mention, Origin is doing something very, very cool. I just got these boots yesterday. These are called their Victory Boot. Again, what's cool about Origin is everything is 100% made and sourced in America. So this is their Victory Boot. They're releasing this today. And there's only 500 of these available. And I've got a pair of them. They were nice enough, kind enough to give me a pair of these. So the Victory Boot, they also have their Victory denim, which is sitting, actually that's sitting in my bedroom. So if you're interested in those, go check them out because what they're doing is they're giving away a brand new Audeit bike. This is made in America. It's a motorcycle, not just a bicycle. It's a motorcycle. They're giving it away. If you want to learn more about how they're doing that based on the boots and based on the denim, then go to OriginUSA.com, OriginUSA.com, and check out their boots, check out their jeans. These are the Victory Boots, the Victory denim. And you're going to be entered in for their sweepstakes on that brand new Audeit motorcycle, which is rad. So you definitely want to check that out. OriginUSA.com. All right, guys. Enough with the promotional. For now, let's get to the meat of the conversation. Again, want to talk with you about the mindsets of masculine leadership. Because if you're listening to this, odds are very, very good, very, very likely that you are either a leader in some capacity or you would like to be a leader in some capacity. And in order to be an effective leader, we need to have the right mindset to be able to do these things. This isn't a one and done type thing. We have to continue to work on these mindsets, develop the skill sets, and then lead people effectively. Now, I don't care if it's in fatherhood as a husband, as a team leader, as an employer, as a coach, or a trainer, or a mentor. It doesn't matter how you're showing up. The cool thing about what I'm going to share with you, the mindsets, is that they're universally true, meaning their principles. So we're going to break down each one. Again, this comes from my book, The Masculinity Manifesto. Number one is you have to overcome the ease of modernity. You have to overcome the ease of modernity. And you also have to encourage and teach and foster within others how they can overcome the ease of modernity. Because if everything was easy, which it is relatively easy right now, and I know that's not to discount the hardships people are dealing with. If everything's easy, there's no leadership required. It's when things get challenging that leaders are required and that those leaders will step up. So you need to get your people, your kids, your spouse, your colleagues, your clients, your coworkers, to embrace discomfort, to embrace challenge, to embrace hardship, and not just to add all of this stuff to their plate, but to make them more capable of dealing with adversity as it arises. So what I would suggest to you is that we put our people in meaningful, okay, this is not just to beat them up, but meaningful situations where they can learn how to overcome hardship. If it's in a family dynamic, it's uncomfortable conversations. It's doing physical exercise and activities. It's going through physical hardship. It's teaching kids maybe even to speak in public, which is a real challenge for people to be able to express their thoughts and their ideas in a controlled environment so they can learn how to do that effectively. The more that you can make it a challenging situation, not hard for the sake of being hard, but with meaning behind it and purpose behind it, the better leader you're going to be and the better your people are going to do. The reality is life is easy right now. And nobody's struggling. Well, that's not true. People are struggling, but nobody's struggling to the degree that they will at some point in their life. And your measure as a leader is your ability to help them overcome the challenges as they present themselves. And if they're not challenging right now, trust me, they will be at some point. So your job as a leader is to help people overcome the ease of modernity and not take the path of least resistance. But the path of most resistance in training type environments so that when real world kicks you in the teeth or your people in the teeth, they'll be prepared to deal with it. Number two is don't be a superhero. Guys, as a leader, it's very tempting to come in and rescue people from their problems. In fact, many people believe that's what leadership is. That if somebody's struggling, I'm going to jump in the water and I'm going to save them. Now, there might be situations where you actually need to do that. I'm talking metaphorically, of course, or maybe even literally. There might be situations where you need to do that, but those are few and far between. Those are situations where someone is in real danger or the consequence of what's happening. The situation is dire and potentially catastrophic. You may need to jump in and save somebody. But the overwhelming majority of the time, that's not what it is. And what I see a lot of leaders do is they swoop in and they're Superman, Cape, and they rescue everybody from their problems. They try to spare them from hardship. They try to spare them from the consequences of the choices and decisions they've made. And while that might seem like the right thing to do, inevitably, it's a failing tactic. It's a failing strategy because you're not empowering people. You're not letting them see that there's choice and decisions and consequences that follow. You're not letting people experience the weight of their decisions. Now, again, if it's catastrophic or even life-threatening, sure, maybe that calls for you coming in to rescue somebody. But that's not what we're talking about here. Let them feel the burden. Let them feel the weight. Let them struggle. This is why I say with kids is give them enough room to not hang themselves with, but choke themselves with. They have to feel a sting a little bit. They have to feel the weight. And if they don't, then you're robbing them of a couple of different opportunities. You're robbing them of the lesson that could be learned because there is a lesson in failure. You're robbing them from that, from them. And you're robbing them from them, the opportunity to build up mental, emotional, physical strength to overcome new and even more challenging hardship that will present itself in the future. Also, what makes you think those people want to be rescued? I've said before, you cannot help people who are not willing, or I should say you can't save people who aren't willing to participate in the rescue. You can't save people who aren't willing to participate in the rescue. Then I need to know that if I'm going to work with somebody, whether it's my kids or my wife or my colleagues or my clients or my coworkers or whoever team members, teammates, whoever it may be, that they are willing to get into the fight. Because if not, then I have to direct my energy, my time, my attention and resources to somebody, something else who is interested in improving their life. Don't be a superhero. All too often what I see is that these guys who want to be superheroes, they want to come in and rescue everybody from their problems. They're not actually really worried about their people. They're worried about how they'll look. They come in and they're fancy tights and they're cape and they look so amazing. They look so incredible and they want the praise and the notoriety and the accolades that come from rescuing somebody. It's all narcissistic. It has nothing to do with actually serving somebody else. If you really wanted to serve somebody else, you'd let them struggle. You'd let them suffer. You wouldn't let them kill themselves, but you'd let them struggle enough that they can learn what they need to learn in order to succeed the next time they're faced with that challenge or that hardship. Number three guys, lead before the title. I have seen so many men wait for specifically at work situations where they'll say, well, you know, that's not my responsibility. Well, you know, they're not paying me enough. And when I get the title, when I'm this, when I'm that, then I'll be a leader. No, guys, you're a leader now. Or at least you can be if you decide to be. And I understand the sentiment. They don't pay me enough for this. This is not my responsibility. Okay. Well, then don't complain about it when you get passed over for a promotion. Don't be upset when you've been at a company for 10, 15, 20 years. And the guy that's been there for two years keeps passing you up and is running laps around you. Why? Yeah, maybe there's some, some nepotism going on there. That's it. That's something that could potentially happen. But more often than not, I think what it is, is that's an individual who's willing to go above and beyond leadership comes before the title. Start doing these things now and the titles will come. The titles are just externalities. Those are manifestations of your leadership ability. Not always. I know there's extenuating circumstances. I know that that we've all had leaders who probably don't deserve to be there for one reason or the other. Okay. But that's the exception. That's not the rule. People are there because they've qualified themselves to be there. So what better way to do that than to lead, to serve, to sacrifice, to commit, to take on responsibility, to assist and help other people along the path? These are all leadership characteristics. The more you do that now, the more the titles will come. The more the promotions will come. The more the income increases will come, the raises will come. That stuff will happen. But if you lead now, that's what the result is. If you wait to lead, you're always going to be waiting. Always. All right. Number four guys, very, very important here. Render yourself obsolete. That is the goal of leader. I can't tell you how often I hear from guys who are like, oh, you know, I'm training my competition. Oh, I'm going to train my replacement. Right. Right. That's the point. If you're worried about training your replacement, you're so focused on the present at the expense of what could potentially be for you. Maybe the reason you're not getting ahead is because you're so comfortable with where you are and you're talking about not wanting guys to replace you that there's just, they can't, there's no room. And I'm talking about in a corporate environment, there's no room for you to go because your boss is your higher ups. They need you in that position. Because there's nobody else who can do what you can do. It was not a problem. What if the only thing that is holding you back from growth and expansion is making sure that somebody can come in and replace and fill in for you? I also think about this in the context of my children specifically. Like if my children need me to the degree they need me now, forever, I've done it wrong. I've done it incorrectly. Now they can always call me. I'll be there for emotional support. I'll be there to cheer them on and to help them. But if I'm having to pay their bills, if I'm having to put a roof over their head, if I'm having to put food in their bellies, if I'm having to emotionally babysit them forever, I have failed. They have not failed. I have failed. My job is to put myself out of work. It's to render myself obsolete. And the more I think about this, I'm not saying that you're going to be gone and out of the picture entirely. But your relationship should evolve specifically with the kids. You're always going to be their father, sure. But more importantly than that, it's how the relationship evolves over time. So if you have a one year old, you're probably still wiping poo off of your baby's butt. You probably shouldn't be doing that when they're eight years old. When at eight, you're trying to teach them to work hard and eat everything that's on their plate. And at 16, that's probably something you shouldn't be worrying about. At 16, you're going to be making sure they know how to drive responsibly. You're going to need to make sure they know how to find good friends. You're going to help them navigate potential relationship issues and things that they have going on. Okay. And at 24, you're going to be worrying about how to help them with their, with their career decisions and starting their own families. You see how this evolves? And yet we have 40 year olds who never evolved out of this 16 year old little boy. Why? Because mommy and daddy did not render themselves obsolete. In fact, they found value in being needed for everything. So what I would suggest is that you don't find value in being needed. You find value in seeing that your, your, your people are thriving without you. Now that's hard. There's a little bit of a sting that comes with that. My oldest is 14 years old. He's a lot more independent than he has been over the past several years. And I'm not as cool as I once was. And he doesn't need me as much as he always has. And I feel that, I feel that, but also I'm proud because I see him developing and growing and doing good things. And that's more important than my feeling about the situation. Guys, there's a lot of rules. There's a lot of mindsets. There's a lot of things that we can go through, but to suffice it to say that these, these are the four that I isolated and picked out in the book, the masculinity manifesto. And of course I break each one down even further. So if you're interested in picking up a copy of this, make sure you do wherever books are sold or you can go to store.orderman.com to pick up the signed copy or the exclusive version that's available. But again, the four mindsets of masculinity are number one, overcoming the ease of modernity, helping people to do that and for yourself. Number two, not being a superhero, not rescuing everybody from their problems, but helping equip them with a knowledge and the skill sets and the tools they need to deal with their own problems. Number three, leading before the title, not waiting for somebody to come bestow leadership upon you or, or nights you, you know, Sir, Mickler or sir, whoever lead now. The titles will come. And number four, render yourself obsolete. Relationship should evolve and you should be the one helping those things evolve. Guys, I hope that helps. This is how we lead as men. This is what the world needs more of. Trust me. I don't, you don't even need to trust me. You know, you know, we just had elections and you know, some things. You're excited about others like, how, how could we elect these people? That's because we don't know what leadership looks like and we're not acting like leaders. If more of us did just these four simple things, not always easy, sometimes challenging, but very simple. The world, politics, your business, your family, every environment would be better because of it. I hope that helps guys. Shoot me a message. Let me know if there's other mindsets that you think are important that we ought to address in future episodes. We can certainly do that. Hit me up on Instagram at Ryan Mickler. Very active over there. Also check out the masculinity manifesto store.orderman.com. If you want to sign copy and or an exclusive edition and then go to origin USA.com to check out the victory boots today. These are going to sell out today. So make sure you get on it today. Victory boots, victory jeans and the audit bike that is available from, I believe the man's name is Tony Odette, former US Marine is making these incredible, incredible motorcycles. So check that out because you're going to be entered in that sweepstakes as well. All right, guys. We'll be back next week. Until then, go out there, take action and become a man you are meant to be.
