A show about difference, about conversations, about conversations, about difference, and how sometimes those conversations can get a little awkward. It's a show also about addressing and correcting the mistakes we make in conversation. And with that in mind, I would like to respond to some feedback I got about last week's show, which included a conversation with Michelle Goldberg about the experience that we as women have with a president who is an admitted sexual-sailant, occupying the Oval Office and being present in our lives day after day after day. Michelle and I really focused on how it is hard, if not impossible, for well-meaning people. And I want to emphasize people, not just men, but well-meaning people who don't already understand, to come to understand that sense of threat and menace and insult that is the Donald Trump presidency. I got a lot of really great feedback reminding me that, of course, women are not the only people who know what it's like to have a abuser or harasser present in their lives on a day-to-day basis. Of course, men are survivors of sexual abuse and assault and harassment as well. And I imagine a lot of them are experiencing that same daily insult that Michelle and I talked about. I also heard from people who wanted to point out and I apologize for not thinking of it in the moment. There are whole swaths of people who have a historical reference for what it's like to have the occupant in the Oval Office not respect their dignity, their freedoms, their rights, and indeed their physical safety. Whole swaths of people who know exactly what that's like. In fact, that experience is something, or one of the things I talk about with my first guest, Greg Howard, who is a writer for the New York Times magazine. We also talk about a piece of his that went viral, why went viral, and why he wrote it. And after that, we talked to Rick Wilson. One of my favorite, and perhaps your favorite, never Trump's sort of Republicans, we check in with Rick about this transgender ban thing and have a rather spirited discussion of whether or not one should consider that a distraction. Both of those conversations coming right up on with friends like these. Welcome to the show, Greg. Thanks for having me. I don't know if you listened to last week's show. I did. Okay. Well, you know, it was, I think, you know, I'm going to say I'm pretty happy with how it turned out. And I thought both guests talked about some important things. And the second segment, you know, was me and Michelle Goldberg kind of talking about the experience of having someone who's an admitted sexual assailant in office and how that is this daily insult that I personally have to just not think about all the time or else it'll incapacitate me. And we were talking about how much trouble, like how men, even sympathetic men can't possibly understand what it's like to have this daily insult of a sexual assailant in office. And basically ever since we said goodbye, and that interview got kind of booked and went up in the podcast feed. I've been like, you know what, Anna, you're a fucking idiot. There's lots of men out there that can understand what it's like to have someone who is violently opposed to their existence in office. So sorry about that. Just officially, I'm sorry. I, you know, I spaced. And it's not an excuse. Well, it's not it's not I don't know. I agree with you, but it's also not the same flavor of, you know, of fear and it's not the same flavor of resentment, I guess. I think they're very similar and there's definitely, you know, a crossover. But I'm a little torn in this too. All right, because it's not as easy as it's not a one to one match up. It's not a exact overlap of experience or or feeling. So I think there's a there's a level of like resentment for women specifically. And and hatred for women that is that is different than hatred for people of color, but and men of color, I think, you know, which I think is something I kind of touch on in my and my story with, you know, with white women walking as well. So I guess we can get into more, but for the most part, for the the idea that, you know, the person heading the government and people around, I'm having an intense hatred for you and and don't consider you even a full person, you know, or worthy of the same rights and opportunity and happiness as as himself or as, you know, people who look like him is that definitely matches up well to me. It's just, I don't know, I don't think anyone quite has like, like women to be honest, including women of color, too. I mean, women of color, of course, and also trans people and gay people. I mean, basically, there's a lot of us that are invalidated by this president, right? Right. Right. And it's a slightly different experience for everyone, you know, the kind of, the kind of invalidation, perhaps, or the kind of fear is slightly different for everyone. Because that's also the kind of what Michelle and I were talking about, is basically what it feels like to have to have your existence, you know, governed, literally governed by someone who you fear, you know, like who has a history of doing violence to people like you. And it's just it, it waits on you. It doesn't, I mean, there, you know, there's a weight on my shoulders every single day waking up knowing that, you know, like, I don't know, like, I live in New York, I live in Brooklyn, I've, you know, I think I'll die here. I think it's the greatest place in the world and stuff. And before the election, you know, it was kind of even as, you know, as racism with ramping it up across the country and you had, you know, Nazis coming out the woodwork, you know, and white supremacists coming out the woodwork and going on, you know, mainstream channels and having, you know, and speaking, get rallies and stuff and you had the Klan, you know, putting their hoods back on and everything like that. Like, it was always just this idea that it wasn't going to touch me here as, okay, from DC, you know, who grew up in a diverse middle class, I guess, well, area in Maryland. And then, you know, I moved to New York, which is like this great, you know, inclusive diversity. You never really thought that it would touch me. And then when, you know, when there was a white supremacist who, you know, who took a bus up from Baltimore and stabbed the, the, a random black person to death, you know, and you, and you start seeing things like swastikas and stuff like that were being drawn of buildings or being, you know, tagged on buildings and, and subways and stuff like that. It kind of made you realize that there's no real safe space. And, and I, like that, that loss of personal safety, you know, and the fact that I didn't really have concern for my own well-being, like losing that, that's kind of, it's kind of changed. I think who I am pretty fundamentally, and, and it's affected my mood and, you know, and just how I see the world and how I see other people. And, you know, the guy got elected like, what, like eight months ago, you know, like, you just moved in, but like six months ago or something like that, you know, and it's, it's already changed. So I am fundamentally, because I don't have the same sense of security. And I wake up every day and I, with, without that sense of security. And I, and I think that's, that's probably how it feels like to sort of be a woman, you know, like all the time. And trans people this morning who woke up, you know, to a greeting that they're not fully, you know, worthy of being treated like people. And, you know, I see that, that tweetstorm that Trump did this morning that like, I'm going to talk to our next guest, Rick Wilson about it a little more thoroughly. So I don't want to get too sidetracked, but it's like declaring open season on trans people. It's like, putting a target on them. That's exactly what it is, you know, and, and, and as if they didn't feel targeted before, right? I mean, they, they, they're in one of the most precarious positions in our society, you know, in terms of their daily living, especially trans people of color, you know, historically and just statistically as victims of violence and hate crimes. So it's, so let's, let's actually, so let's start. I think we've, we've pinpointed something that's a shared experience of sorts, right? Which is that there's an unprecedented number of people living under this president who feel on a day to day basis, like their safety has been threatened in some way, some more, some more specifically than others, right? And because the tinnas are literally also living in fear right now, right? And they have, they have people, they have armed and unified people coming after them with instructions to do so, whereas armed and uniform people are coming after black people, but not without so much specific, specific instruction. Anyway, right. And women also are feeling this again, perhaps without specific instruction, although we could talk about some of the, you know, misogyny that happens in the White House too. But your piece in the times that talked about a place where these experiences definitely diverge, right? Sort of literally, do you want to just share, share what you wrote about? And then let's talk about the, what, the controversy and conversation that happened. Yeah, well, I, you know, I, we put together, so our race related newsletter that goes out every week, New York Times tries to tackle different issues within race from different angles. And so what I thought would be a really enjoyable project. When it popped up in our pitch greeting was on the question of, you know, was that racist? And, and, you know, we all had, and it's a lot of people of color in the group. And we all, you know, had different experiences where, you know, we don't know, we didn't know if there were, but the races or not, you know, my colleague, John, he went to a Mexican restaurant on Mother's Day, and he wasn't given, he wasn't given tortilla chips and salsa. And then his, his server, I believe, she told him that they were, they didn't have any tortilla chips and salsa, and whether they ran out. And then, you know, then everyone else got coming out. Yeah. And everyone else. And then, you know, it was, I, you know, I kind of chuckled at that because it's a question that like, is that racist? I don't know. That's, that's weird. You know, and, and, but, you know, for me, it was, I guess it was a little bit more serious. And that, you know, it's something that happens to me, you know, every day, um, multiple times a day. And it's, it's when I, you know, when you're walking in New York and they're crowded sidewalks and, you know, crowded underpasses and stuff like that, you know, everyone's kind of pressed together. I think that there's, um, general etiquette about, you know, how you go along moving through crowds and stuff. And, and, you know, they're unspoken. I think everyone kind of gives way for everyone else, you know, and that's, you know, and, and I, you know, I call acknowledging you and, you know, that might be stepping to the side or even, like, you know, shifting your body weight onto your one foot or the other or, or, you know, or turning your shoulder slightly so that, you know, two people can, who are moving get through the same space. What I've noticed for years is that when I'm, you know, when I'm in a tight space and walking towards someone, white women generally remain broad-shouldered and walk through me, you know, expecting that I will always give way to them. No, no people of color do this. White men don't do it. And it's not all white women, but, you know, whenever it does happen, it's white women, you know, but, you know, sometimes I have to actually physically step off the sidewalk because, you know, because women refuse this to, I guess, to give way with me. And, you know, and they invade my personal space. And, you know, it's something that jars me every single time because, you know, you realize that there are some, like, you know, some rules have been, unspoken rules have been broken, right, about walking among other people and walking alongside walk-in. Like, I think the chief among them is that you make it easier for other people when you guys are in closed spaces, right. And what I observed over my seven years, living here is that, you know, whenever those rules are broken and whatever my personal space is invaded to the point where I have to completely reroute or, you know, step off the sidewalk, which, you know, makes me the most furious for all that, that entails or something like that. It's always a white woman. And I was, you know, the, I wrote an article about why. Why is it always a white woman? Like, is that racist? Am I being crazy, you know, and also why do I feel obligated to be the one to always, you know, always give way, always step off the sidewalk because when I talk to so many people, not black men, but, you know, black and brown women, statistically, they say, no, we're just going to keep walking and, you know, if they don't want to get out our way, then we're going to bump, you know, and I feel really, really allergic to any kind of physical contact with white women, I don't know. Well, that seems, yeah, that that historically has been not, does that not end well for black men, let's say, right? Right. Yeah. So, yeah, and I got, I'm sorry, go ahead. Well, I was going to say, like, I talked to a friend of mine who's a black man who said, had a kind of parallel story about how he is always aware when he is walking, and it night, usually, and there's a white woman on the sidewalk, he will cross the sidewalk to not follow that person and to avoid her because he knows the implicit threat that he might face. And he's tired of like, and he basically, it's not that he's acknowledged, he's not he's saying, yes, I am threatening, he just doesn't want to deal with that potential dynamic. Yeah, one, I, this, yeah, this is actually really interesting. What, what I do, I won't cross the sidewalk, but I will speed up and pass the woman, like, I'll give her wide berth and pass the white woman, right? So that, like, she can see me so that she knows that I'm not like lurking behind her, or anything like that, like, that she understands that it's safe, like, I'll be, I'll be loud, I might, like, whistle, like, if I'm listening to music or something like that, it's, I mean, it's, it's the thing, you know, and it's because you don't, I guess you don't want to deal with that. But also, I think beyond that, it's, there is a, I think you're learned that, oh, you know, a white woman is justified in fearing you, and it's something that I think is drilled into black men's heads and from an early age. Right. And I, it's, so there's a part of me that wants to just dig into your experience on this, right? Because like, explore these two, what seem like on the surface, diametrically opposed experiences, right? Like the experience of a white woman needing to avoid her and make her feel safe. And then the experience of the white woman barging in through your space. And I want to dig in and like, try and figure out, like, if we can reconcile those impulses and like, what's going on there. And then there's a part of me that wants to just talk about how, like, you got ganged up on by the right-wing media for this. So I've got nothing but time. So true story, Third Love is a sponsor of the show. And this week, I actually did a little unintentional advertising for them because my third love, Ross Strap, was showing on national TV. And it was a Third Love, Ross Strap. And if you actually are a Third Love customer, you might have noticed that because it has this like extra thick sort of padding to it for those of us that need extra thick padding on the shoulders. And I actually love that bra, which is why I wore it, even though it wasn't quite the right bra for the shirt. What I really need is a racer back bra. Unfortunately, I actually looked for a racer back bra on Third Love, and they were sold out of the size and color that I wanted. But I have them going to contact me when they get it, because I actually am a Third Love customer. And I was before the show. They offer a great shopping experience. And even better than that, they have some of the best fitting bras I've ever used. And you buy them online because they have used thousands of real women's measurements and super smoothing memory foam to create bras that fit better and feel great. They even have half sizes.

What I want to point out is that that, I think the proper thoughtful response to your piece, even if one doesn't agree with it or doesn't have the same experience is, well, let's figure this out. I haven't noticed this before. I want to know more about it. I want to know about your experience. I want to know about the experience of other people of color. That seems like what a person who didn't necessarily agree with your piece or have your same experience. That seems like the way a person who was thinking would respond. But that's not the response the right way media had. It's definitely not. I actually think the response is basically came in a few different camps. I've got hundreds of emails and EMs and weird LinkedIn requests, friend requests and stuff like that from people I have no connection to over the last few days. It's actually been intimidating. But for the most part, people of color are saying, thank you. I thought it was just me or laughing at the observations that I made. And then you have white people. And then there are the white people. Yes, that's always the other half of the story. I think there's a minority of white women who reached out to me, who reacted. That exact way. Either just believing me, take my word for it and say, wow, I didn't know that I did this. I have to look out more for whether I'm doing this. Maybe not quite, I believe you. But I think it's worth looking into. Just to be clear, I believe you. I just can't quite get my head around it. You know what I mean? I am just like, what's going on here? That's what I, my impulse is to try and figure out what's happening. And also to look at my behavior and see if that's happening with me. I mean, I'm totally 100% the belief that this is your experience. Wonderful to hear. It should be like, believe the women, believe black people, believe people look right. But the vast majority of people, and they usually are coming from the right because they have names like Conservative Kick 55 or Chad or something like that. Maga, deplorable USA. Right, right, exactly. Or Brian from Omaha was one guy and they were calling me a race. Right. Or when they're not calling me a monkey or a nigger, right? Or saying, I have no home training or that this is why fatherlessness and black communities are crying because we don't have manners or they're saying, you know, which I thought was cute is you're right about white women not getting out of your way. They do it to me too. And I'm a white man, you know. And the vast majority of things that like I think right conservative organs like Fox and Breitbart and stuff have lashed on to more than anything else is that they're saying that I'm attacking white with, you know, and they're not even, they're not even engaging with what my observation or critique is. They're just saying that I it's not my place. I don't have the right to attack white women. And it's been it's been really educational for me for a couple reasons. And first, like I don't think I've had an article really blow up like this definitely among the like among the right. And that's because I write about black people, you know, and they have, you know, a lot of, you know, conservative white people have no real reason to write to read about black people. They know interest, right? Or they have reason. I would actually argue, Greg, they have reason to read. They just have no interest. Yeah. Yeah, or interest. Sorry. Yeah. You know, but I don't know. I'm friends with, I know you. I'm friends with a lot of women who write, you know, close friends with some and I was expecting to be docked. I was expecting, you know, someone to post my address to the threat and to kill me, you know, or something like that. And I was just people calling me names for the most part and calling me stupid. No one's threatened to kill me or rape me or show up to my house. You know, there, I think there's a glossary of insults reserved specifically for women that I didn't have to deal with, you know, and there's a glossary of threats, you know, to my personal physical safety that I didn't have to deal with because I was, because I'm a man. And it was so, so fascinating because, you know, I know women who get fast worse than I ever had. I was like, well, this is bad. I mean, you know, I'm still getting response coming in of people calling me names for the most part. And I haven't yet had my physical safety, it's threatened. And I think it's because I'm a man. But, you know, but the other, well, in another side of that is that the idea that I am attacking white women has really taken hold and every article that, or, you know, that's been written about mine or every segment on, you know, Fox and French or Tucker Carlson or something like that, it's about how I am attacking white women. And I find that really interesting too, because, you know, like through that vocabulary is interesting, right? Like that's that's what's the sort of rich vein. Yeah, it's to you. No matter how or or it doesn't matter, you know, how true or legitimate what I'm saying it, it's just, you know, it's just you're you're attacking white women. And I think in our history, there's so many policies that reinforce, you know, our our racial caste system that are justified by saying like we have to protect white women, specifically from black men, you know, like from, you know, segregation, miscegenation laws, you know, housing discrimination. I mean, you can even see now with like, Justine Diamond, you know, who was killed by the Somalian police officer in Minnesota. And you put, you know, you put her story and her tragic, disgusting death compared to give me a racist or Mike Brown, you know, or Philando Castile, or Trayvon Martin, Eric Garner, like on and on. And it's, you know, the only the things that's getting the right up in arms about Justine Diamond is that she's a white woman, she was killed by a black man, you know, you know, and that's what that's what's terrifying. I mean, you can, you know, I mean, even look at Trump with the center, part five, you know, and how he calls for their heads and still won't apologize, you know, they were exonerated by DNA evidence, you know, right. And he still won't apologize because the truth of what he was saying is that we know we must protect, you know, our, our cement fragile white women from, you know, these Boris Eastley black men, right? That's what we're talking about here. And let's face it. I mean, one, one, the huge problem here is that some white women believe this, right? Yeah, like that's the, the onus. I mean, what we white women have to own that that we bought into the same mythology, right? And also they use the similar argument about bathroom bills. Let's not forget that. It's the same kind of protecting straight white women. I think exactly. Yeah. And they're most, you know, white women helped elect Trump. And I think in part because they believe that same narrative. And that's what really, you know, that's what really gets to me, right? Because like when you're talking about, you know, how your friend crosses a street or something like that, you know, or that, you know, I speed up and pass a women's own visible to her, you know, when it's especially when it's dark out, like, make myself loud or and everything like that. It kind of all funnels into the same thing and all this, this acknowledgement that, you know, white women, you know, are afraid of black men, you know, and, and, and it really governs so much of my life and ways that I don't really think of that. You know, and, and, and once you get into like stuff like public spaces and, and, and, you know, and personal space, it, it takes on like a, a weird grotesque form that results in me stepping off the sidewalk completely rather than, you know, rather than coming into contact with the woman, like what, with a white woman? Like why is the sidewalk, or yours and mine, if we can both sort of, you know, shimmy to one side and go on our way without ever thinking about it, you know, you know, why do you feel that it's my prerogative to step off the sidewalk or step to one side or that it's, no one's going to need to get out of the way. Um, yeah, you know, it, it gets really worth worry. Yeah, well, because ultimately, you know, a government is about protecting people's bodies, right? Like, that is why we have civilization. And in public spaces are where those bodies interact and that's why some of the most vicious fights in history and in American history specifically are over the use of public space and over the use of like what whose bodies matter, whose bodies are worth protecting, you know, and I mean, I guess part of me feels like I want to say I think it was very brave of you to write this piece. Um, and I want to thank you for writing it. And I do thank you for writing it. I mean, you know, we say this shows about uncomfortable conversations. Like this is a, this is a hell of a fucking uncomfortable conversation to have, right? Um, although I think we're, you and I are having it okay, but sort of the general idea of women, white women needing to own some responsibility for their actions and how they treat black men in public spaces. Like that's hard, you know, um, it's, it's, I'll tell you, I mean, I, my back goes up a little bit because I'm so used to thinking of needing to protect my body, right? I don't think it's from black men specifically, but I'll confess, you know, like implicit bias is a thing, right? Um, yeah, and I may be doing what you're talking about. Uh, I mean, what, I mean, what bothers me and like, I mean, the, I think the crux of, of this whole thing, right? I mean, the crux of like racism, right? Is that like I'm like, uh, I'm, first of all, I'm small. I don't know how to fight. I think I'm like a pretty, you're not threatening physically kind of. I mean, let's face it. Right? Like, yeah. I mean, I, I grew up in, I grew up basically, you're nerd in a diverse area. Yeah. You know, um, I mean, I play soccer my whole life and it was, I was a teenager, I think before I had, you know, like non white kids with my team. Um, you know, I went to an all white college. I have many, many great white friends, you know, outside of that, um, I'm smart. You know, I, I have multiple degrees. I'm like, I'm like, you work at one of the most prestigious jobs in the country for a writer. Yeah. And it doesn't, it, it doesn't fucking matter. Like it doesn't matter. None of the circumstances of my life matter. It doesn't matter how much money I have, right? It doesn't matter. Um, how well-intentioned I am and how much tax if I pay or anything like that. Like, if, uh, like, if a cop pulled me over or stops me, um, I'm in, I'm in, I could be in great danger, right? Like if I'm, um, if I bump a rude white lady on the sidewalk, um, who believes this, my personal space is more hers than mine. I could be in danger, right? Like, and, and it could be justified by the fact that I'm a black man. It's like, no, you can't say he's a black man, but he's, he's got a cool job. You know, he's a black man, but, um, you know, his best friends, a white dude, you can't, like, you can't, none of that, none of that matters. And, um, like, you know, all that matters, that I'm a black man. And so, you know, things can happen to me. And it'll be justified by the fact that I am a danger and, and, you know, and possibly a danger to white women specifically, you know, and, and, and for me, like the flip side of that is, uh, that I know that all black women have to deal with this. And, um, and I had to, when I had a NAFRO and, and dreadlocks, um, a few years ago, you know, I had dreadlocks for like six or seven years, um, is like white people, but white women specifically, like, would invade my personal face and push my hair often without even asking. Um, that is just the weirdest thing to me. I have to say, like, I, yeah, I know it happens all the time and I'm just, I, it happened every single day and it's, I mean, because I don't know, I, I, because you're worth less like you're in, I mean, that's the message it sends. And that's why, like, I mean, so that's why I feel like this is such a great follow up to the last week show about Trump's presidency being a daily insult is that we all have to watch out about what our daily insults are to other people, you know, right. And like white women got to own it, right? Like, right. We, we can have that same power, not the same power as the president of the United States, right? Of course, like it's different, but we have it within our power to make other people feel small and feel not worth, not worth, um, the same rights we have and not worth the space that we get. And we got to, we got to watch it, you know, that will make a difference. I think, I want to say just one thing, which I do think that people who are listening, it will make a difference if you personally try to try to, you know, monitor this behavior and be aware of it, it will make a difference in the life of another person, right? If you just resist the urge to touch some red locks. Right. I mean, to me, a few things, everything like there, there's such, I don't know, it's on Twitter and stuff like that. You can see especially with with black women, there's so many people, so many black women who think, you know, don't touch my fucking hair. Don't touch my head. Don't touch me. And you know, I think about this all the time on it because like, you know, I, invading someone's personal space is like one of the most, you know, tender, caring, like, trusting things you can do, right? Like, like reaching down and touching someone's hair or playing with someone's hair, like picking a lamp off their clothes, you know, or kissing them or something like, you know, you know, walking, you know, arm in arm or hand at hand, like, it's an, it's an agreement and you're allowing someone, right? Like, it's like allowing someone into your home. When someone just like, when someone would reach out and touch my hair or, you know, walk towards me on the sidewalk and, and force me to one side, you know, you know, and invade my personal space that way, like, it's, it's actual, it's an invasion. Like, I mean, it feels like a home invasion or something like that, you know, like, like, the space that was mine and that is so important to me that I believe that I have alone, I realize it's no longer mine. And, and that's what you, I think that's what so many Black people know to be true and what so many minorities know to be true is that like, you know, your, your body, necessarily, isn't, like, isn't necessarily yours, depending on where you are and who you're around, you know, and, if you're in a public space, your body might not necessarily be yours, you know, if you're, have an interaction with the government or law enforcement, you know, your, your personal space, your body, your personal health, that's not, you know, that's not really yours, you know, how you come up, come out of that is not really up to you. And, and so you already had that and that was always there. And then with, with Trump, when you see so many white people who would, who would maybe want to do my harm or maybe think that I'm such human or something like that, but didn't have the balls to, you know, in Obama was the president or Bush was the president or anytime in their life now when you see them, just the, just the rash of, of race of the defense across the country. You see, you know, Jeff, power guard sessions, as the attorney general, you know, you realize that whatever, whatever, you know, confidence and personal safety and your personal safety that you might have had, that's Trump as well. And it's, it's a very unique feeling. And it's something that it's a new type of fear that I've never felt ever before. And the fact that anyone could physically harm me at any time or that there's no real safe space or many more of that, like, you know, that's open season. And I want to just, I want to just interrupt because I think you're making a great point, but I want to bring it back to some this, there's a, there is a Venn diagram here, right? Like, where other, other kinds of people are feeling similar things. And again, I'll just stress, you know, stress everyone's experience is slightly different. But Muslims, you know, Latinos, LGBTQ people, women, we are all having this kind of unprecedented experience of feeling our physical safety in danger in a way that we haven't been as consciously aware of before. Now I will say all of all of those groups of people have had the same, have had awareness about their physical safety in other ways, right? Like, let's not discount the historic oppression and violence. But this particular president at this particular historical moment to have the person who's sitting in the Oval Office in various ways, give signals to his followers that these people's lives and physical beings are not worthy of respect and in fact are not the same kind, they don't exist on the same plane with the same level of humanity as they do. That's, that's different, at least for the, for the modern era, you know. Yeah, and this is, I mean, this fascinates me too, right? Like everyone, everyone, the jury's out on Donald Trump, it's been out on Donald Trump for decades, right? He's, he's scum of the earth, right? Like everyone knows that. There's no, there's nothing you could say about Donald Trump. There's nothing bad you could say about Donald Trump is probably not true, like at all, right? But like the saving grace of there was one, was that he just doesn't give a damn about anything but doesn't, you know, that isn't directly in front of his face, right? And so I got kind of excited when he was like transgender bathrooms or, you know, or trans people using whatever bathroom they want. I don't give a damn, you know, like, he's not like, he's not interacting with, like with trans people, you know, and I was like, this is awesome. And you know how, like, he doesn't, you know, he doesn't care about gay marriage because he just, because he's not gay, you know, he doesn't care about that. You don't care about gay people. And you, you, you kind of saw some, some weird, um, there was, there was hope in that in some ways, you know, you know, um, but one, two things that he does hate, two groups of people that he does care about and he does hate, are women and people of color, right? Like, I mean, his whole life, you know, like the, um, Nixon, um, Justice Department, sued, um, him and his father for having discrimination. I think what in the, in the sebodays? Yep. You know, um, there is a long, like, you know, everyone knows exactly how Donald Trump feels about women from his wives and daughters to, to everyone, you know, um, and, and I think that's, that's different because, um, you know, that if nothing else happens, he's going to try to harm women and he's going to try to actively harm, um, people of color. And, and that to me is the scariest thing is if you say, yeah, of course he doesn't actually care about anything. Um, but he does care about, he does care about women and he does care about people of color, you know, and it's not, it's not good. He's, he's not going to lose fight of that and how he fast up, um, you know, his, his cabinet and his government. Um, I think has proved that. And I just, I feel probably should add that, um, and his personal beliefs while I agree, I agree, like are important and he does have those obsessions. Um, when he, he can target his followers on other, you know, vulnerable groups and it doesn't matter what the fuck he thinks. Right. Like he may not care about trans people, but I can tell you from my Twitter feed this morning. Right. Exactly. And that's the flip side is that you can't, you can't, because he doesn't matter. He can say, I don't care about trans people at all. Right. Like, like, let them, you know, do what they want. And then it doesn't, because he doesn't care, he can ban them from the military today and declare open T-stone because what's the difference to him? Right.

My conversation with Ruth Wilson, Republican strategist and never Trump stalwart is coming right up. But I wanted to pop in to remind you that if that conversation with Greg brought up anything for you, you should take care of yourself. And if it is something having to do with sexual assault or harassment, you should call the National Sexual Assault Hotline, which is run by RAIN, the Race Abuse Incest and National Network. Their number is 800-656-HOPE, that is 4673-800-656-HOPE or 4673. And if you have sort of a more generalized issue of anxiety or struggling with something having to do with mental health, you can text the Crisis Text Hotline, which is 741-741. And you can text them anything, anytime. They will help you find resources and make sure you're okay before they let you go. And with that, my conversation with Rick Wilson. Hi, Rick. Hello. Well, it's I'm glad to have you back. Checking in on our favorite, never Trump correspondent from Red America. How are you today? Let's just start with that. Well, look, I think today is a the national stress test that Donald Trump has put this country through and has continued to put this country through and has continued. I think today's announcement of this LGBT transgender ban at the Pentagon is absolutely the work of Steve Bannon and Steve Miller and Anthony Scare-Muchy trying to get people off the fact that Trump has had a pretty disastrous week on the Russia front and that health care is about to give the Democrats a sword to fight the election of 2018. It's a hell of a week. I'm glad that in two days I'm going to be standing on the front end of a fishing boat in the Gulf of Mexico, fishing and diving. And I hope you have a wonderful time while the country burns. Yeah, one last brief moment of relaxation before the fires and the screening. So, I'm glad you brought up this incredibly crazy thing that happened this morning. We were taping on Wednesday for listeners because I actually wanted to talk to you about trans stuff. That was part of my plan because I like you. I think you know, you know, you have had lots of conversations off the air. I see some parallel, if not overlapping values. Of course, I appreciate your humor and incisive insights into Trump. So, always great having you in the air. But I have to say, because it was pointed out to me by one of my friends who happens to be a trans person, you know, you have pointed to the trans bathroom issue as a reason why Democrats lost, right? Well, let me reframe that for you. The trans bathroom issue, Democrats tend to walk away from clusters of issues people care about more and they end up going for these things that make them feel great but don't move numbers and elections. And you only have a limited number of days, cycles, and then with it, a campaign to communicate a message. And just in raw, hard fact and polling, no one cares about trans bathrooms as a driving issue. If I pull it and ask a panel of 20 questions, what's your most important issue? Every single time, every single time, jobs, economy, national security, education, health care are going to be the top five in some varying order. The issues that make you feel great aren't necessarily the issues that win votes. And the issues that may be, they may even be the right issues. They may even be a principal moral stand, but they don't necessarily help you win votes. And we live in a country that is fundamentally still driven by the things that make people vote. They're still driven by things that are very immediate to them. And this is no way disrespecting trans people, but that is an issue that is not a front and center everyday challenge to a suburban family in Charlotte, North Carolina, or an unemployed industrial worker in Green Bay, Wisconsin, or whatever. And like I said, I'm doing this with my cold political guy hat on. You've got to go after things that make a meaningful difference to the large majority of people that you were trying to address in a campaign, because you always have limited time and resources and bandwidth to get to communicate a message. Okay, like I understand that argument. I do. But it also feels like, you know, you have to talk about your principles at some point. And if one of your principles is equality and safety of people who are vulnerable, you know, populations, and their well-being and how they're treated by their government and by their employers and their communities. I mean, that seems like an important point, you know? And I'm not arguing that it's unimportant and I'm not arguing that the issue doesn't exist by any means. Right. And also, let's be clear also, it is the conservatives who made this an issue. Like they started it. Well, yeah, I don't, I haven't really ever studied like the provenance of this thing, but I do think that I do think that that is probably not completely incorrect. Yeah. You know, look, and I think people that are activated by this are often surprised by the fact that even in the broad conservative community, there is not in the broad conservative community, there's not a sense of malice about a lot of this. Sometimes it is just a cultural disconnect between Red and Blue America. But if I've got my political guy hat on, and I'm talking about what wins an election, if I was a Democrat running in North Carolina, I'd rather be talking about it, you know, the job situation. Well, rather be talking about, well, of course, those are better, those are better issues spaces for Democrats to win in. But while people are in danger, like you can't do that. I mean, like it's sort of, I'd rather not talk about the House on fire, but the House is on fire, you know, in bathrooms matter, public spaces matter. And then and also, I mean, and let's face it, like this is sort of, I mean, maybe you just just are going to have to disagree about this, which is that I fully accept that this that that that Trump's incredible. And I do mean that kind of almost literally, right? Like I almost can't believe it. The actual meaning of incredible the actual meaning of incredible rant this morning was clearly written by someone else, by the way, because it wasn't a rant. If it was a rant, it would have been written by him. It felt very steeped down into me. Right. Yes. And that thank you at the end, right? Like that was that was not Trump. I I get the political analysis that that is cover for something. In part, because it's just, it's just, you cannot policy does not work that way. And there is someone in the White House who realizes that policy doesn't work that way, right? Like, and also remember, they did this decision while Jim Mattis was on the one vacation he takes a year. Yeah, I didn't even know that. That's that. Yes. So even more so, I see this is almost transparently a purely political ploy to. You know, you know, my my my long defense department stuff, right? You know, with it from this morning, who is who who we knew each other when I was a brand new guy at the Pentagon, and he was a young dumbass first lieutenant and somebody's got three stars now. So we're all growing up. But I, you know, him this morning, and his response was was he goes off the record at this guy, because, you know, in 1948 on the same day, Truman, you know, integrated the military service, he was we were we were going to make this work. It wasn't going to be easy or fun for everybody, but we were going to make it work because we always make it work. The military leads on these issues. They do. They can show the rest of the country how to do it. If they want to. Yeah. And look, if you go back, if you go back right now and look in 1948, I assure you, you can find a lot of of of southern and and and frankly, and frankly, upper Midwestern legislators who were basically saying these new growth cannot possibly serve in our armed forces. It will cause great disruption and we can never ever, ever accommodate it. It will never work. Right. And they'll probably they would probably have numbers to back it up on some level, right? They'd probably be able to say some kind of like made up. But here's the thing and I don't again, I don't mean this is a slide to trans people, but honest to God, the numbers we're talking about here are the minimus. Okay. We are not talking about about hundreds of thousands or tens of thousands or probably even thousands of cases either. We're probably talking about a couple of hundred cases a year from what I understand. And and look, the defense department, the big organization, 2.45 million people, civilian and military, it's a big organization. These numbers are a drop in the bucket of the overall pool of possible recruits. But listen, you can there is steam coming out of my ears, Rick, like literally, like, yeah, look, no, I'm saying that. I know it, but like, it doesn't matter. Like, if it's only if it's only a small fraction of the society being persecuted. Okay. Okay. Okay. The argument by the White House, this is super disruptive. Oh, right. Okay. Okay. Okay. I didn't know where you're going. It's bullshit. That is bullshit. Yes. Okay. Good. I thought you're going in a different direction. Libertarian position on it. I have a general sense that I don't want the government making a set of moral decisions through whatever, whatever the moral posture du jour of the administration is and saying, you know, we're going to accomplish x or y goal because it makes our base feel good when it's something as consequential as our national defense. Listen, if there's a trans person of either direction who wants to go who speaks Farsi or speaks Dari or Pashto, fuck yeah, put them in. Get them going. Get to work. If they want to serve the country, I don't think we should turn down confident people. You know, if there are things that we do as a country that that the national policy that's meant to basically be, you know, to basically exclude people who otherwise have a set of desires and talents to serve the country, then, you know, we're probably doing something wrong. And look, I do not believe that being gay or being trans is some sort of moral choice that people make. It's not some sort of policy choice that they make. I do believe it's inherent in some, you know, meaningful way. And then they're not American citizens at that point, just because they're in that category. Just as just because somebody is an evangelical Christian, they're not part of a category that should be denied, you know, a position because their beliefs, their behavior or their lifestyle. It just doesn't sit with me right. So again, but I think, you know, we're falling into the trap here of playing Bannon's game, of everybody having a hissy fit about this on left and right. You know, I see a lot of conservative writers today. And I'm so I'm such a bitch right now, including one who I know is in the closet, ranting and raving about a great decision. This is by the White House to finally teach those gays a lesson and finally teach those LGBT people a lesson that we're not going to play their political correctness games. You know, but I think we're falling into a trap here. They want to have this cultural civil war. They want to divide the country on a lot of diggies. Well, you know, but here's the thing, like what what I would say is that, you know, it does take two sides to have a civil war, right? And what would be great is what would be great is if conservatives who feel like you do, which I do think is I think there are a fair amount of them. I do. I mean, Donald Trump, again, Donald Trump is probably one of them, right? Like, who feel like it being gay or trans or queer is something that is intrinsic in some way. And those people are Americans if they want to serve, they should be able to serve and they should have their rights respected at any other American citizen. Like, I actually, I almost thought, like, Richard Shelby of all people was going to give like the wisdom on this because when they surprised him on CNN, like he was as surprised as anyone, like he was reacting to the news in real time. Like the thing he said was, I think everyone should be treated fairly, right? And I was like, that would be awesome. That should be the official GOP, you know, like, word on this. I think this also illustrates the real moment that we're that my party is in. Okay. There's a broad generally, what set aside the cliches about Republican evangelicals and whatnot. But there's a broad swath of my party who basically do not give a shit who you have sex with. They want to be they want individual liberty and personal freedom and and and a constitutional government that protects those liberties and freedoms. And you know what, you know, it's involved in that in in the view of a lot of people like me of the government saying the fuck out. Right, right. Of your day to day interactions with who you want to be with. I don't believe that that government gets a vote to ban or or allow marriage. I think that's it. Those are civil institutions that are beyond government should be beyond government's breach. They should recognize things that society and churches engage in like that. But it shouldn't be their position to ban it or or force it either direction. Right. So, but I do think that in the world of Trumpism, their desire is to cause these kind of social issue civil wars. Their desire is to is to fracture society, fracture cohesion, fracture trust. You know, we've had this conversation before. I think that in the in the big picture, there have been basically four big civil wars that have happened in our country quietly. And Republicans, one on the gun control question, they they fought to a draw on abortion. They lost on a merit on gay marriage and they lost on marijuana. Society has pretty much decided that LGBTQ people are here. We're going to figure out how we how we you know how we integrate everybody as a society. They figured out we pretty much like we in this country. You know, they figured out that abortion is is is is icky, but it's going to exist in some some some some some format and they like guns. These things are all you know, social things that have been driven for the bottom up. So all these legislative and policy things you try to tweak them on, especially something as ad hoc and as shitty and shameless is what the White House does, like on an issue like this, that defies the defense department. Yeah, completely. And and and like wreaks havoc if they want to actually do this, right? I mean, like, by the way, by the way, so as a guy who worked in the Pentagon and knows the knows the ways of how the DoD would operate in a situation like this, the fact that the Department of Defense that OSDPA the public affairs office, that their reaction to every media query today has been speak to the White House. Is that a fuck you? Oh, it's a ginormous fuck you. Things where you speak to the White House, where you want the White House to take full credit or the White House to take full blame. Guess which one it is? Yeah. Full disclosure, parachute sheets sent me a couple of things to try to make sure that I like them before they advertised on the show. And if you are a loyal listener to the show and you don't skip the ads, you might know that experiment worked out really well. Not only did I fall in love with the sheets, but my husband did too. And in fact, we ordered more of them beyond the sample that we got. And we actually just also got their towels. The sheets are beautiful and comfortable. We ordered the linen ones, which you can really tell how soft they get with each wash. It's kind of amazing. They're already kind of like in favorite t-shirt softness category. They also are just really well designed. The pillowcases are not your usual pillowcase that just has the one open end on the edge. They're kind of more like envelopes. They fit the pillows when a really tailored way. They look fantastic. If you're the kind of person that loves that neat hotel kind of style and you want to have that in your bedroom, you're going to love these pillowcases. And the towels are also amazing. We got the bath sheets, which usually means like kind of a beach towel size, right? That's what a bath sheet is usually. Our bath sheets, the parachute towel bath sheets that they sent us, are like literal sheets. They would probably fully cover a twin size bed. I'm not kidding. They are enormous and they are soft and they are a beautiful color and they feel amazing. And as with the sheets, they get softer with each wash, although they started off pretty darn soft. I am told that they use an innovative aero cotton technology. The fibers are spun so that the air passes through the cotton, creating exceptionally absorbent quick drying towels. I can attest they are really absorbent and quick drying. I have really fine hair that is weirdly porous and it just sucks up water more than you would think and it takes forever to dry unless I get, unless I can really like kind of use a towel to to top up the edges of it. And these towels, usually I have to use like a microfiber towel and with the parachute towels, I don't. My hair, I swear, dries like in half the time. So parachute sheets, comfortable, soft, awesome, looking, great colors too. Parachute towels, also very soft, absurdly luxurious in their size and just feel amazing to use. Again, if you like the hotel look in the bedroom, you probably like the spa look and feel in your bathroom and that's what these parachute towels are like. So that is my testimony. You should order some for yourself to try them out. If you go to parachute.com slash friends, you will get free shipping and returns and you will get a 60 night trial. If you don't love the things that you get, you can send them back. No question asked. Again, it's parachute home.com slash friends for free shipping and returns and a 60 night trial. I am not lying to you. I would never lie to you. This is an advertiser. I truly love and feel really lucky that I get to attest to having discovered them. You know, usual caveats apply. Property is theft. Capitalism is oppressive. But these sheets and towels are awesome. Parachute home.com slash friends. You're going to like them. I should also point out that parachute does good in the world too. They partner with United Nations Foundation and when you buy your sheets, you can donate as I did for malaria prevention bed nets. And also, if you return your sheets or towels, which I do not think you will, but if you do, they give the returns to habitat for humanity. So you can feel pretty good about indulging yourself. Parachute home.com slash friends. So part of my frustration is I think I can be outraged by more than one thing at once. You know, like, I think that I have outrage to spare. So I can be angry about Trump not refusing Trump's trying to live above the rule of law in terms of the Russian investigation. I can be angry about the way that he's corrupting democratic norms. I can be angry about his self and using the White House for self-enrichment. And I can be angry that he put a target on the backs of people I love today. You know, like, what he did, you know, who in that is, I cannot say, I cannot simply say, I'm going to refuse to be distracted by this because there are people I love in this world who feel less safe today than they did last night. I understand that. And I understand I acknowledge that. Okay. I completely understand that. And I think that I think that in many ways, this is going to require a journey through the courts. I hope so. We are right now a country that that we're being governed almost entirely by executive fiat. And what we have seen with the Trump administration time and again while they govern by executive fiat is that they're not very good at it. Is executive orders that they craft are subject to challenge? I think this will and should be subject to challenge because I think it goes into a space where as a conservative, the Constitution should be blind to all of the defining characteristics of who you are except for one big one. Are you an American citizen? If you are American citizen, you deserve to have your rights protected under the Constitution as they are enumerated and defined and acknowledged in this country. So I think this is going to have to take a journey to the courts. I think it's in part that's what Bannon and Trump want so that we have an ongoing, endless thing. And they're going to point and scream and the other side is going to scream it to genocide. And they want that crush. I want to get to the rule of law and have the courts decide this matter. I want a constitutional government that obeys the rule of law. Now Trump is very bad at obeying the rule of law. But again, because we're being governed by executive fiat, I think that this has a big chance of being overturned. I think so too. But I guess what my hope for you, Rick, as your friend, try to listen a little more about this. And I know you personally are you think of yourself as not transphobic and not bigoted. And I know you personally believe yourself to be a libertarian. I am not questioning that. But I do just want you to think a little about when you talk about this being a distraction. Again, it's a small, it may be a small number of the population. But in America, only thing should matter is that who you are. I mean, nothing about in America, it should not matter who you love and what your body looks like. And I just can't get over. Trump makes a lot of people, not just trans people, like feel personally less safe. And that's the biggest violation of civil rights that there is. Well, I mean, no, I think the government randomly being able to kill somebody is the biggest. Well, personally less safe, personally less safe. That's what it means. Personally, less safe. To not be able to know that you are going to be safe in your person, that the government or someone who feels validated by the government, by the president himself, can hurt you. Yeah, I have to say this in a way that I'm not trying to walk around with your assertion here. But under the Constitution, you're enumerated rights. You know, if the government acts in a way that violates those enumerated rights, it should be unable to do so. It should be sanctioned for doing so, and it should be reversed. But right now, you've got a president and a team of people around him who not to find a point on it are evil. And so that's why my argument is this has to go through a judicial process, a legal process, because folks aren't going to feel safe until they understand, just as African Americans have had this very long, slow, agonizing, painful arc, you know, in this country of the slow improvement in terms of the way the government has looked upon them. You know, and I'm, you know, I'm not putting too fine a point on it to say that this is going to be a longer process than I think a lot of LGBTQ people want. Of course. It has to be something where there have to be legal precedent and legal standing and legal status that is acknowledged by, you know, the courts and it can't, if you do things by executive fiat, then you are always vulnerable to the next guy reversing those things by executive fiat. Right. If you do things by executive fiat, you're always have the potential that you're driven by politics of the day. And that doesn't lead to long term security for folks who are in minority groups. And again, I don't, the scale of the number, I wasn't making a point about the number to diminish face folks. I'm making a point about the number to say that this problem isn't as sweeping as folks on the right would make it. Right. It isn't as, as, you know, oh my God, there's a million, you know, a million people trying to join the defense department tomorrow and we've got to accommodate all these, you know, trans needs on this side or that side of the equation. It just, it, even if there's one person who's in a minority status, they're still an American citizen. They still have to be treated in a way that it's consonant with the Constitution, neither more or, neither more or less rights than anybody else in the country. But, you know, and I agree with you that Donald Trump and C. Bannon are deliberately trying to make this into a terrifying civil war. No matter how you feel about LGBTQ issues, they're trying to make this into a dividing point in the country where they once again have the Trump base and then the rest of America, not just Democrats and liberals and gay activists and LGBTQ activists, but also like decent Americans who don't have a lot of hate in their heart. You know, they're trying to make people pick a side on these things. And, and yeah, I fully acknowledge it's a terrifying political behavior, but the only way to do it to fight back against it honestly, is the rule of law. You can't, you can't fight back against, you know, chaos with just more chaos. I agree, but I'm going to tell you right now, it would mean a lot to a lot of people in the world if you personally acknowledge that you have LGBTQ people's back on this. Like, and if you personally acknowledge that you have their back on this, and if you think a little bit before you dismiss trans bathrooms issues, if you think a little bit before you talk about this being a distraction, because it's not a distraction for people who feel threatened today. And I know you're making it, I know you're making, and I'm actually just asking like as a friend, like a friend, so my my trans friend asked me like, she was like, she was like, you know, your friend Rick Wilson, it must be nice to be able to be friends with him and not feel, you know, belittled by him when he makes dismissive statements about the trans bathroom issue. You know, like what you say matters in the world. I remember, yeah, well, I don't know about that, but, but my position on it, is, you know, you have to separate the moral dimension of it. Sure. And the political mechanics of it. And so the phrase dismissing it is not dismissing the issue as an issue, you know, qua an issue. It is the understanding from based on 30 years of experience in this ridiculous business, that people vote on things that absolutely directly move them day to day emotionally, and that absolutely directly move them, you know, in their pocketbooks and their feeling of personal security. And, and I, again, it's not dismissive when I say that for the vast majority of Americans, this is not a top of mind issue. That doesn't mean it's not important people. It's just for the vast majority of Americans. It's just not there. It's just a political reality in the landscape. And frankly, a lot of people think that themselves is being pretty tolerant, pretty, pretty okay with with with LGBTQ people. And they think that if their personal behavior is okay, then that's as far as they need to take it. Now, that's an advocacy question for the LGBTQ community on how you move people that are in that broad middle to be more activist and to be more engaged, but that's a fundamental political question. And let me on the subject of having people's backs, I have, and believe me, I'm the last guy to do the my black friend thing. I have a lot of LGBT friends a lot. I have several family members, okay, I this is not something that is alien or bizarre to me. And, you know, but I'll also say this, if I see someone abusing a person for any reason, no matter who they are, I'm generally going to be the guy that waves in and gets out of the car, you know, and, and, and tries to put a stop to it. And, and that would include the abuse of trans people. If I saw that happening, or if I saw that in a way, look, I'm a southern guy. And I was raised in a environment where, where, you know, the need to do the right thing when people, when people who are vulnerable or, or, or in a less fortunate position than you are in trouble or hurt or being hurt, you step in, you do something, you stand up. Now, so, you know, obviously, they're all hypothetical, but believe me, I'm a good guy to have it your back. And I would be in that case. I would, I'm going to suggest that you keep an eye on the kind of abuses that are happening online today against trans people and maybe stop your car and get out and say something then. And on that, we have to actually, I, I, we and I could probably talk about this more, but we probably could. I am just, I feel like I erred what I needed to air to you. I, I, I listened to you, and I, I think, and I think, I, I get a lot of ways. We're in a, we're in a broad sense of agreement on this in a lot of ways. I hope so. I think, I think in my, you know, I have, I think I have a fairly consistent conservative ethos. And that ethos does not include abusing people in minority groups. And, and, and that includes standing up against people who do that. I do think this was, listen, it is a distraction, but it's also a cool distraction. It's meant to, it's meant to divide this country. It's meant to cause, you know, this sort of civil war that they dreamed of every day since they started this process. So, so do your part and refuse to participate. That's what I would say. Yeah, you, you, you trust me. I want me to say you're bigger than me. The, the, the, the squealing of the machine at the Defense Department of Defense is loud and long. And I, I have, I have, I do have some faith. I have more faith in our military than Donald Trump does. That's for sure. And we're going to have to end it. Great conversation. Thank you. I'm sure we're going to be checking in with you again. Hopefully, remaining in front of the pod. Hopefully that, you know, we're still here when you get back from vacation. Yeah. Right. God bless. And that's it for the show. If you want to follow up with either of the folks we had on, they are both on Twitter. Greg Howard is at Greg Howard 88. That's G-R-E-G-H-O-W-A-R-D-A-8. And Rick Wilson is the Rick Wilson. We as a show are also on Twitter at crooked underscore friends. And if you have thoughts that are over 140 characters, you can email us at with friends like pod at chmail.com. We are collecting stories and suggestions and questions for a sex ed show if you want to send something along those lines. But we're also interested in hearing from trans people these days. I mean, always. But specifically for a show we're doing next week about this trans ban order directive, whatever it turns out to be. Trans voices are often missing from the debate about trans issues. And I would like to help remedy that myself. I encourage you to as well. Please seek out actual trans people to get their opinions and insights and the richness of their experience when it comes to this debate. A couple of my favorite people to follow on Twitter are Parker Malloy. She's been on the show. I also love Janet Mock and Sarah McBride, who is a spokesperson for the Human Rights Campaign. But just start looking. Start looking for those voices. Thank God they are being elevated right now. You can find the stories of trans people who are veterans and who are actively serving the military. And those are some of the best testimonies I have ever seen for any kind of civil rights issue in part because some of them are cursing because they're, you know, as one of them said, mother fucking Marines that that is actually my favorite quote of the week. I am I've never identified as trans and her mother fucking Marine. Let that guy keep serving, right? But that's it. We got through another week guys. Thank you. Thank you for making it for the show. And thank you for making it through another week. I hope you are well in Trump adjusted terms. Until next week. Bye."
