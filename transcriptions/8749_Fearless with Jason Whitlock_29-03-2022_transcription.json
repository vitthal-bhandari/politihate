    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Fierlers with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock. Thanks for joining me on this day after Monday. Happy Tuesday to you and yours. We have an awesome, awesome show planned for you today. We've baked in, I think, a little disagreement because we're going to circle back on the Will Smith, Chris Rock topic, and we've reached out to a couple of guys that are actual defenders of Will Smith, or at least they were Sunday night when the events were going down. Steve Dase from The Blaze will join us at some point during the day show. Steve kind of surprisingly shockingly defending Will Smith, Will Smith's actions and behaviors, but we'll start with Brian Sharp, aka Hotep Jesus. I think Brian, Hotep Jesus is probably the most qualified person to speak on any of this as the founder and host of the grifties. He's been in Chris Rock's position several times hosting a major award show and taking on that responsibility of being humorous and engaging and entertaining to a massive audience and a massive crowd of celebrities while hosting the grifties. He knows the shoes. He's walked in the shoes that Chris Rock was walking in. He's filled those shoes during the grifties the past two years. I can't wait to hear what Hotep Jesus has to say about this. We'll also talk a little NFL football. They're changing their rules and becoming more woke, operating and running their business like a college campus. They're installing quotas on demanding that each NFL team, all 32 NFL teams, must have a black assistant offensive coach, which I would bet every dime I have, all 32 teams already have that. But the hook is now that women will count as well. They must have a black or a woman or some sort of minority on their offensive coaching staff. The quota system has come to the NFL. It's crazy. We'll talk to TJ Mo about that. But we'll start with my second fire on this Will Smith situation and then we'll bring in Hotep Jesus again, probably the most qualified person. I mean the grifties other than the Academy Awards, I don't know what's bigger than the grifties, what has more pressure than hosting the grifty award. So let me start this fire then we'll bring in Brian Sharp. In the court of public opinion, Will Smith will benefit from the indifference of black elites when it comes to black on black violence. Barack Obama will not issue a statement suggesting that Chris Rock could be his brother. Reverend Al Sharpton won't call for a boycott of the Academy if Smith isn't harshly punished. lawyer Benjamin Crump will not threaten a lawsuit. Black Lives Matter and the NAACP will not take positions on Smith's assault on Chris Rock. No one will analogize Smith's slap as a painful reminder of the public abuse black slaves were subjected to by their weight white masters. Instead black elites aka liberal Negro Wranglers will seek to rationalize justify celebrate and weaponize Smith's emotional and criminal behavior as Sunday's Academy Awards. Late Monday night Twitter influencer Jamelle Hill floated the first trial balloon in manipulating the narrative related to Smith's unjustified assault. Writing for the Atlantic Smith argued that our hill argued that the reaction to Smith's crime was a tale of two Americas one white and one black. She said she couldn't help but notice the disproportionate outrage that many people in white America and many in the Hollywood elite are showing towards Smith. She pointed to an angry since deleted tweet by director Judd Apatow that criticized Smith's out of control rage and violence and comedian Howard Stern comparing Smith to Donald Trump. Hill's job is to calm white liberals by assuring them that black people do not see Smith's outburst as problematic. To the contrary Hill insinuated that black people were inspired by Smith's accent. She quoted actress Tiffany Haddish saying quote when I saw a black man stand up for his wife that meant so much to me. The underlying message of Hill's column in the Atlantic is that black people do not have a set of values and principles to determine our point of view. Everything is based on race. Hill went on CNN plus last night to discuss her views on Will Smith. Take a look. You have to actually understand this on an even deeper level than that for black women. We just watched confirmation hearings with Judge Contangi Brown Jackson right. We just saw everything that she went through. Saw how she was really lambasted in the public eye and we saw all the things that she had to deal with and she was often lauded for keeping cool and collected. Sometimes when things happen people don't feel that way and I think for black women in particular because I saw what Tiffany Haddish said as well was she said that she felt very encouraged if you will by the fact that Will Smith in this very public setting was standing up for his black wife. Right. And that's a protection that black women often aren't afforded. Black women felt encouraged by the assault according to Jamel Hill and Tiffany Haddish. We know that had a white male slap Chris Rock in defense of his wife's honor. Haddish, Obama, Sharpton, Crump, BLM, the NAACP and Hill would all be disproportionately outraged. There would be calls for the white actor to be stripped of his award permanently banned from the Oscars and jailed for several weeks or month. None of that will happen to Smith because black elites will and have convinced the establishment that the bad behavior of black people should not be taken seriously. Black lives do not matter. White perpetrators matter. Chris Rock is Michael Moultrie Jr. a four year old black boy shot in the head in Chicago. Rock is Serene Broughton, a seven year old black girl killed by a bullet in the chest in Chicago. Black elites have not and never will beg you to say the name Michael Moultrie or Serene Broughton. They're unimportant. They were not killed by white people. Chris Rock despite his fame and wealth is unimportant too. He was slapped by the wrong colored perpetrator. Rock knows it. That's why he won't be pressing charges against Smith. He won't be asking the Academy to strip Smith of his best actor award. Black men settling their petty differences with violence is acceptably hit behavior in America. It's acceptable because the black voices granted the largest microphones tell the world to ignore our violent mistreatment of each other. 30 minutes after Smith assaulted Rock, the white and black liberal elites assembled inside the Dolby Theatre, showered Smith with the applause as he blamed Richard Williams, the father of tennis legends Venus and Serene Williams and God for inspiring his attack on Rock. Smith cried. He proclaimed that love will make you do crazy things. He said he was a crazy father just like Richard Williams. He said he was overwhelmed by what God had called him to do. His acceptance speech was absolutely deranged. He sounded like Jim Jones addressing his followers in Guyana. The audience of elites drank Smith's Kool-Aid. No one should be rationalizing Smith's behavior. We should be pleading for Smith to get mental and emotional help. Stripping Smith of his Oscar might shake him from some of the delusion created by living the past 35 years as a pampered and entitled celebrity. Punishment serves the perpetrator as much as the victim. Smith's 160 word apology was weak. He assaulted Rock on an international television broadcast. He wrote an apology on Instagram. He continued to pretend that Rock's harmless G.I. Jane joke was a bridge too far. Now six days before the Oscars, Jada Pinkett Smith released a TikTok video claiming she loved her shaved head and that she died of care what people thought of her hairstyle. Take a listen. So if I'm doing a cover, everybody, no, we went here here straight and flowy. And it's like, all right, cool, but that's not really like what my hair likes to do. So I had to learn to get the courage to just go, nah, I'm not doing that. Which is why I feel the freedom today. I don't give two craps when people feel about this ball ahead of mine because guess what? I love it. She loves it. Will Smith needs to explain why he initially laughed at Rock's joke. Beyond an apology, he should state how he plans to atone for embarrassing Rock, the Williams family, the Academy, and overshadowing the other nominees and winners. Smith needs to be held accountable. His actions damage public discourse. Comedians play an important role in free societies. They protect and expand free speech. Comedians and ministers are authorized to speak uncomfortable truths. We expect them to say things publicly that others won't have the courage to do. Dave Chappelle creates the room for the public eponder whether we've gone too far in protecting the sensitivities of the LGBTQIA plus community. Joe Rogan's podcast lets us debate the appropriateness of masks and vaccine mandates. Jamel Hill and Tiffany Haddish support Smith slapping rock because they want to live in a world where no one questions the motives, behavior, and logic of black men, black women. Rock is collateral damage in a war to silence men. Will Smith is a Trojan horse in that war? That's my fire. I'm going to be very interested here if Brian Sharp, aka Hoteb Jesus can put this fire out. Hoteb Jesus tweeted on the night of the Oscars, if you condemn Will Smith for this, you're what's wrong with the world. Brian Hoteb Jesus, welcome back to the show. Do you stand by that tweet? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely 100% I do. And I want to highlight something you said. You brought up freedom of speech. Well, you know what freedom of speech in the Constitution sits right next to the Second Amendment. And what does the Second Amendment represent? Violence. You see without violence, you don't have freedom of speech. Now, let me ask you this. Uh, Jason, and then I'm going to answer it right away because I know you won't be able to get it. Um, and not because you're not smart or anything like that. It's just, it's just a very unique take. But why do white boys like hip hop? They like hip hop because it's freeing. You see, white people were the first male to be neutered and castrated on this continent we called North America. They did it with the Victorian ever and he did it with Puritanism. White people were and allowed to do various different things. Uh, and that's why that's why you saw some things such as Jim Crow. Jim Crow was created because white people were hanging with black people and they were like, you are hanging with the black folks and you're acting like them. So on, so forth, you're dancing like them. You're carrying on like buffoons, blah, blah, blah. They didn't want white people being that free. So white boys gravitated towards hip hop because hip hop allowed them to be free, allowed them to, to curse and allowed them to be violent. When you think of masculinity, you should think of violence. Women are attracted to men who have the capacity to be violent, not violent men, but have the capacity. That's why you see women, they always go and they date some dudes straight out of jail because they like men who have the capacity for violence. If you don't have the capacity of violence, there are many women that will be turned off by you, but they have to know that you have the capacity for violence. The white male has been neutered. So you're absolutely right when you said, well, if there was a white man that did it, then it would be different and you are 100% correct. They would have condemned them, Benjamin Crump. Everybody would have came down on us with smacking Chris Rock. Why? Because the white man was the first male to be neutered on this continent. He's the first one to be castrated. He's the first one to have his masculinity stripped from him. And we saw that on January 6 when the white man went down into the capital to go get him some freedom and he was condemned for that. They are afraid of white male violence because the white male is the majority of his country. If the white male has the capacity for violence, he has the capacity to overthrow a corrupt government. Now, the black man who has the capacity for violence and he consistently exudes that capacity of violence is the last male to be neutered just like we were in slavery. And that's what they want to do. They want to castrate the black male and reduce his violence so that he doesn't inspire the white man to have violence to overthrow this corrupt regime that we call the Biden administration and I digress. You've set a mouthful. Unlike you, I think they probably provided you my column ahead of time. So I'm trying to digest what you just broke down to me in real time. And so I want to go. I do want to run through it because one, I think you've misinterpreted or misconstrued several things. The second amendment, you related it to violence. I think the second amendment is about the people retaining a defense of themselves from a corrupt government. And I think the founding fathers knew that government has a tendency to turn oppressive and corrupt. And so they wanted to leave us with the ability to defend ourselves because they know the government can be oppressive. Defend us with violence. Obviously. Well, look, if guns wanted to arm yourself, whatever, yeah, we know the defense often requires a physical violent defense. But again, Will Smith as it relates to this, he wasn't defending anything other than perhaps his own masculinity. He certainly wasn't defending his wife. She wasn't harmed, assaulted in any way by Chris Rock's very harmless joke. This dude may have been defending his ego. And we can't have a society based off of people defending their egos and like, oh, you disrespect to me. Therefore, I got to pull out a guy to kick. That's a chaotic society. That's why people are running up out of inner city neighborhoods. And we define as Black, but we define success as moving out of our own neighborhoods because too much of the mentality is, Bill, I was disrespected. I got to shoot you. You stepped up my Jordan's. So that's one. White people. Hold on. You describe masculinity as violent. I disagree with that. I don't think I think that, look, sometimes you do have to defend yourself, but I don't think that you can reduce masculinity to just the ability to be violent. To me, I consider it very masculine to provide for family. What's the other P though, Jason? What's the other P? There's two P's. Protect and provide. Protect. Yeah, protect. Protect. Yeah, I consider requires violence. No, no, no, no. It does not always require violence because again, some people like take my mother. Okay. We were in the hood in the show, enough ghetto. And me and my brother, me and my brother, a way stand with my father and my step family. And someone broken to our apartment back in the hood where my mother was living. In order to protect us, my mother took a second job and moved us to a working class neighborhood. She moved us up out of there to protect us. So taking a second job and sacrificing her own finances and taking on more of this. That was her way of protecting us. Again, you can protect your kids a lot of time by gutting it out and staying in a marriage and deferring your happiness for the betterment of your kids. There's all kinds of ways to protect people short of violence. Last resort, violence is okay. But there's more ways to be, you know, I look at both of my parents and, you know, I'll apply some masculine, what my mother did, very masculine, taking on that second job and blah, blah, my father never missed a day of work. I know plenty of guys who's, who's in order to protect their families, make sure they had everything they need, very masculine mindset to work, being reliable, showing up, all of that. There's a lot of ways to be masculine short of being violent. For some reason, I can't read my own notes here. So you said something about why people and fruit. Go ahead. Go ahead. No, so so what your mother, I wouldn't call that protectionism. I would call that prevention. Sort of like you have Western medicine as opposed to Ayurvedic medicine, which is preventative medicine, right? So she was preventing from another altercation from happening. Protection would be, okay, someone has already entered the house and I've grabbed my weapon or we're resorting to some sort of physical violence. But the thing is, I agree with 90% of what you said. I don't disagree. You know, my thing isn't about Will Smith. My thing is about the state of America as it is today. America as it is today is trying to redefine what masculinity is. They're trying to neuter men. They're trying to feminize men and we saw that with Leah Thomas, etc, etc. But they're trying to blur that lines of what masculinity really is. So when I saw Chris Rock get on stage and smack somebody for saying something he deemed defensive, I said, okay, masculinity back. This is something I thought was a precedent that had to be set going forward to let people know men still do have the capacity to be violent, especially in places such as the Oscars. I loved it. Brian Brian Brian and I get what I get what you're saying. No one, there's not one person in America who is honest, doubts a black man's ability to turn violent towards another black man. No one doubts that matter of fact they expect it. So I don't think we needed any more proof on the world stage. Yeah, but because I don't find anything that Will Smith did here as masculine, he opened hand slapped another man over disrespect. I find that emotional, childish, illogical. I'm not shocked that Jamel Hill and women are sitting around clapping and we sit here and wonder, I mean these are just facts. We sit here and wonder why inner city communities, filled with single mamas, are so violent. Go look at Jamel Hill, Tiffany had their applauding black men being violent with each other. That's their definition of masculinity. That's their definition of protection. This is luminacy. This is the ill logic. And so there's no question in terms of proper masculinity, we're being led astray and being taught that masculinity expresses itself in some violent reaction and masculinity actually expresses itself through a man's discipline and ability to be a reliable provider and protector for his family. That's true masculinity. Will Smith has exhibited, wasn't exhibiting any of that on Sunday. He was out there emotional like a little woman. I'm surprised he didn't try to pull Chris Rock's hair out. Pull his bra off or whatever. That's what it looks like. Anyway, go ahead. I think it's an unfair comparison because you're comparing the behavior of the lower class with the behavior of the upper class. We, for example, Terry Crews allowed a white man to grab his balls and he did nothing about it. And I know the majority of us are saying he should have went upside that man's head. I don't know if you agree with that sentiment or not, but I believe you should have went upside that man's head. Secondly, this isn't the first time Will Smith has been violent at an event. There was a previous time where a white man tried to kiss him and he smacked him. So Will Smith already has the capacity for violence. We know. Okay. Okay. So let's unpack these things one and even though these are connected, but just give me a chance to respond. Okay. If somebody sexually assault you, grab your balls. Yes. You have every right to hit that person, back them off, whatever. Somebody, some man tries to kiss you. You have every right man or woman to get that person up off you any way that you can. Somebody says something about G.I. Jane and your wife's hair. That does not authorize legalized violence. I'm just sorry. It just does it. It's not comparable. Nobody. If somebody went up and grabbed Jayda's crotch, yes. Cold cocky. Absolutely. But a harmless joke and there's not this whole little alopecia excuses. She's running out. There are people that believe this has nothing to do with alopecia. This has to do with all the chemicals to get thrown in black women's hair to make them look more white and all the weaves and everything else they're putting in their hair. It had a lot of people believe that that it has nothing to do with alopecia. That that is some excuse that has been concocted. But when you these women and you throwing these chemicals in your hair every weekend and getting new weaves and tying horse hair to yours. There's some complications that come from that. And so I just she's on TikTok publicly talking about she loves her hair, don't care what nobody else thinks. And so Chris Rott, hey I love you but can't wait to see you in G.I. Jane. Will Smith laughs? laughs at the joke. We can't see what Jayda did to Setty Marr. If she at some point said what you laugh at that and then that clicked in this simps head and mind oh my god Jayda's mad. I better do something. Let me show everybody how manly I am. I know she has emasculated me in every way possible for years including talking about this little boy that she was banging on the side. His problem is with Jayda and being the simp that he is and because there's a lot of simps and all these gangs and inner city instead of addressing it with his woman he goes out and tries to recapture his masculinity by doing something violent to a black man and we got Tiffany Haddis, Jamil Hill and everybody. You go boy. You go. I'm encouraged by that. You stood up for a black woman. This is why we have so much violence in our communities. I don't disagree with you. You are absolutely 100%. I just need you to understand why I appreciated the moment because from the black person who sits in Hollywood we don't see this type of behavior. We see them taking all types of reviews. We see them having writers put them in dresses so when I saw somebody at that level smack somebody somebody who he had personal beef with for years when I saw him smack somebody I said okay cool we still got some masculinity that's living at that level. That's why I appreciated it. When I watch movies I don't want to watch some Puritan, Victorian, ever I want to see some violence. I want to see some drug dealing. I want to see some guns get shot. That's the type of flicks I enjoy. So for my personality I want to see some violence and when I saw him get up on that stage at a place that's supposed to be you know you got to walk like this and you got to talk like that. You got to dress like this and make sure you squeeze your ass cheeks nice and tight and don't do this and don't do that and I saw him step outside that boundary and I said yes yes some resemblance of humanity and masculinity. I loved it. I'm going to tell you why this shocks me Brian is because you're a whole tip. Whole tips in my view think differently. They're independent thinkers. They think outside the box and and and this sounds like you've been programmed that that that you they've taught you it's no different than man do I love the taste of a McDonald's double cheeseburger. When I think of good meals fast food joints come from my I've been programmed. There's better food out here for me. Far and taste better healthier for you. Easier to digest. Doesn't cause all these problems and but I've been programmed to think of bad stuff and so I just listen to you rattle off and trust me like the wires my favorite show love the sopranos the shield would make me I get scar faces one of my favorite movies. All of it got got it but but trust me there's better stuff out here and and and that's why it will Smith smacking Chris Rock is whatever the worst fast food joint you can think of the most deadly fast food joint you can pick up. I don't want to call it on the ends of I want to hear it but it's probably some taco place. Whatever is the that's what Will Smith smacking Chris Rock is if he really wanted to be masculine if he really wanted to do something that would have excited me it's like here's Will Smith the most powerful man in Hollywood just one of the best actors or just killed the King Richard role. This man has the leverage to say whatever he wants about these Hollywood movies. This man could have given a speech about hey man why did it take me Serena and Venus Williams to force y'all to make a movie about a strong black man dedicated to his family to raise some great kids. Everybody that has watched this movie has been mesmerized at my performance the narrative arc of the story it is to me it was clearly the best movie of 2021. Now Will Smith could have put pressure on Hollywood to make more movies about strong black fathers and be an inspiration and touch the minds of these kids but instead the only it's like we won't make believe movies about Wakanda and the black women that ran Chachala and made the black. We want that garbage instead of something real like King Richard one of the greatest movies I've ever seen Will Smith dominated that role and this man had a chance to get up on a soapbox and wag his fingers and say we need more movies like this that we blah blah blah blah. Instead of all these boycotts about who gets awards let's make more movies about strong black men doing the right thing. That to me would have been masculine powerful impact the culture him slapping Chris Rock man I can walk I can go I can just go home and go to my old neighborhood and see that that's a dime a dozen and it won't be slaps they'll pull out guns shoot each other it might shoot me so now you're right the Williams movie you're right this did overshadow the Williams movie not though the Williams movie we need that programming and when you said I'm programmed to like that type of content yes I am programmed to like that content I was raised in the 90s I am programmed to like that type of content you are not wrong when you said that and I admit that every single day I am programmed to like that debauched decadent type of content in him something I'm trying to shake however I know it speaks to the inner masculinity me that has the capacity for violence and that is why it speaks to me that's why I'm so easily conditioned to those type of movies but the Williams movie was masterful and I love the moment in the movie where he's sitting at the meeting and he expresses his moment of flatulence I was like yes that's exactly it he farts in the middle of a meeting with all these you know distinguished white men I love that but yes you're absolutely right this moment did overshadow the Williams movie and we I prefer I would prefer that type of programming over the nonsense absolutely I just remembered I just could read my notes again the last thing you said why do white kids or white boys like rap music and you said it's because of the freedom I believe is that what they're my right you said is the freedom and there have actually been studies done and what has made rap music the most popular form of music white black whatever is even though it's toxic it is the expression of masculinity that everyone is attracted to because they they feel the entire society trying to suppress masculinity and so again I've seen studies where it's like you know why the Trump phenomenon happened because America is so gimps masculinity that Trump's willingness to express masculinity in its rawest form is attractive to men and women and same scenario with rap music even though it's toxic even though it's not the right form of masculinity at least somebody is expressing masculinity and so it's like a person dying of thirst in the desert they'll drink right to cause their thirst and that's what rap music some people argue Trump is pissed that we're drinking because we're dying of thirst yeah that that's why I love Trump I saw somebody who was walking into an arena where you're supposed to have your ass cheeks tight and his was he was very expressive he was unpolished and I said yes this is exactly what we need in the White House we don't need the same old cookie cutter Puritan nonsense and that's why I love Trump because he was not that because he wasn't so tight asked it was it was exactly what America needed and that is the masculinity I'm gonna let you go I'm gonna bring Steve Dase in here he's another guy that agree with you we'll see if I can argue him down into some common sense thank you so much Brian I got to have you back but again I do think you're the perfect guest that's why we wanted you hosting the grifties you know you can relate to what Chris whole Chris Rock was going through I hope you never get heckled like that or anyone assault you for giving out a grifties that's why I thought you'd be more sympathetic towards Chris Rock you know I mean I like I better agree with you I don't think he should have been slapped but I do agree with you though Jason I just enjoyed the moment I didn't in the end enjoyed it I think that's the first time we've heard that word on this show with the hard ER I'm gonna have to feel about that all

days who had a fascinating fascinating take on will smith and chris rock a take that kind of called me by surprise as much as hoteb jesus take did and so i'm glad that steve has agreed to join us but we'll start here with his tweet sunday night most biblical moment at the oscars in recent memory will smith pimp slaps a punk for dissing his wife then accepts an award for patreoni dad who went to the mattresses to protect and provide for his family more cowbell please steve i disagree with you but i can't wait to hear your explanation of how you're defending will smith's criminal behavior i just don't sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never harm me i just think his response to a harmless joke just completely out of bounds i think that we can um agree or disagree on whether the occasion of the remark was worthy of the response and i have in ensuing points on twitter for the last 36 hours said this repeatedly i've said it on my own show what really set me off right away actually um was the idea that there is never a time for such a response and you know i've been sitting here for the last 23 months jay watching mom after mom challenge covid stands regulations challenge the school board with no men around mom's walking into the right aid in the casko without a mask on their own only to have creeper dude on video come up to them and try to corner them for not wearing a mask and no man comes up to defend them or their honor on any level mama bear after mama bear walk into a school board meeting where their kids are taught automatically they're racist and doctrines of demons and dads don't speak up and are nowhere to be found and so i i would i've been searching for a little nia mia like male overreaction uh and haven't seen really like any male reaction like at all um so i'd number one much rather live in a culture where men uh have to be conditioned to not overreact than to not react at all um what i i so i was just appalled at the idea that there is never never a time never a place never a situation at all where someone could insult you and your wife to your face and there is never a time whatsoever where you know um the law of the jungle uh just has to be enforced i just don't agree with that on any level i i go back to the story that cbs news had earlier this year um where it predominantly inner city school so not exclusively black dads but mostly black dads came into the school and started patrolling the hallways because of uh violence and bullying that was going on in the schools and all the sudden there's a market decline in the violence and bullying that was going on in the hallways is it because the dads are smarter than the moms no is it because the dads have a clever turn of a more clever turn of phrase than moms pithy sayings no it's because the implication is they're hey young buck why don't you try me on for size you if you just decided to maybe try to bully your 130 pound teacher's assistant here this morning have you thought about me um that's the implication and i i go back to the words of the great prophet iced tea social media has taught a generation of people that they can get away with saying stuff that would have had your t-3 arranged in every other previous generation so when when i saw that action and what it was in response to and the fact and then the look his wife shot him people suddenly only responding when he got the look man i would have loved a lot of wives have been given their husbands the look Jason the last 20th you're gonna do something they're masking our kids still you're gonna do something about it you're gonna do something about that now our kids are gonna mask while playing hoops they're gonna mask while playing soccer you're gonna you're gonna get up you're gonna do something a lot of good things a lot of men do righteous things respond into that look i think america could use more men respond into that look if you ask me but then with then the seal that what sealed it was with that was the follow-up of his acceptance speech and you know um i can't think of a room in america that that we could assemble that would have more cultural influence and and more terrible demonic cultural influence than that one that more needed to consider the things that he clearly was wrestling with within his own heart and soul and being in that in that acceptance speech now i don't know if that's sincere i don't know if he just felt embarrassed i don't know what i do know though is i don't want to root against it being sincere i can't think of a room in america that needs what what he was talking about and and and the themes that he was addressing in that acceptance speech to be more sincere than that particular room and and i also think that the same academy that honored child sodomizer roman polanski that applauded year after year giving awards to harvey wine steamed despite his open secret that they admitted to later now this is where they want to draw the line they're now threatening to take his academy award away the fact that the academy that would not know morality if it slapped him upside the soul this is now where they want to dig in their heels and take a stand kind of confirms for me that maybe i'm on the right track here so i get and and this is like a different approach by me is like whenever a major news story happens like a major one i don't like to react over twitter i don't like to react instantaneously i want to be able to marinate and gather my thoughts and so i'm to when i first learned of this because i at that moment i wasn't watching the academy awards but when i first learned of it i had the same reaction as you oh man finally drew a line in the sand wow finally but then as i thought deeper on it totally digested it told that's when i'm like nah this ain't it when i started factoring in how much his wife has publicly abused him and how this was more about his protecting his own ego and reputation than defending her that's how i end up landing at a different place his joke about her hair completely harmless inbound she did a tiktok video six days ago where she talked about how much she loved her hair and how she was comfortable with her hair she didn't care what people thought there are people that believe she doesn't suffer from alopecia she suffers from years of chemical abuse to her hair while she straightening it out and trying to get the perfect hairstyle and weave and all this other stuff that that's actually what happened to her hair i don't know i do know that chris rock's joke wasn't out of bounds regina hall earlier in the show actually cracked a joke about their marriage and that was far more personal and offensive than some little gi jane joke and so in in giving time to reflect and factoring everything i'm like this is will smith trying to protect his own ego and then listen there's no reason for a white guy in aiawa for it to hit him the same as a black dude from india and appleis who's you know spent time in the hood lived in the hood dad's bar of business in the inner city just black men overreacting and giving into their emotions and reacting violently just going to strike me totally different you particularly being a christian the whole racial implications probably didn't even get on your radar it said a man stood up yes and we need we do need more of men standing up but for me i'm looking at like here's another black dude who can't control his emotions and someone has said something and he thinks the response is to get violent on an international television broadcast and then in his acceptance speech doesn't apologize to chris rock and blows an incredible opportunity i don't know if you saw the movie king richard it was that was one of the best when we saw last year yeah thank you to me it was the best movie of 2021 it richard Williams even and i don't care if it wasn't a totally accurate portrayal of richard williams i was just honored and thrilled to see a masculine devoted husband to his family that type of movie there wasn't an ounce that i could find a wokeness in the movie it was just celebrating a black father and just a father in general and and will smith had an opportunity if he really wanted to do something important he could have stood up in that acceptance speech to say why aren't we making movies like this more often why is every movie other than this one directed at black people with a big black cast it's always about our engagement with police and how we're oppressed and how we're victims and how blah blah blah he had a chance to stand up and say we need it i did because uh will smith did the pursuit of happiness which is a very critically acclaimed successful movie that was in this same vein as king richard he could have talked all about that and put some real pressure y'all want to talk about diversity how about some diversity and then movie narratives particularly as it relates to black people why can't we do more movies like this that put me and black people in their best light i'm winning the best actor award he overshadowed all of that and overshadowed whoever won the best documentary that chris rock was giving no one remembers sanny o jackson was given a lifetime achievement award no one remembers no one is talking about the king richard movie and the message behind it and the role he played it was a very narcissistic selfish act and it was he was prompted again these are issues that i'm not sure if you're totally in tune with you have no reason to be but it's just like uncle jimmy and i talked about it yesterday uncle jimmy worked for years in law enforcement and we've talked long before this about man uh when uncle jimmy was working in law enforcement he worked in the sheriff's department he worked in a jail he talked about how many black men were in jail because they did something stupid to win the affection the approval of some woman who was put a battery in their back to do something stupid jay to pinkett smith put a battery and her husband's back caused him to do something very stupid uh and for him to lose emotional control embarrassed chris rock uh embarrassed the william's family and all this and so for all those reasons i just found what he did uh completely irresponsible and and and i do get how in the moment over twitter it's like a man stood up and drew a line in the sand because we do need that energy and we do need men willing to stand up and take bold stances but that's why i don't tweet oh i reflect and i i try to save my best content for either my column or my show uh because i just think people's instantaneous reactions a lot of times locks them into a position that prevents them from going deeper into the narrative and the story and the point of view and so it you know i get where you're coming from but i just i just completely disagree so couple things i'll say about that number one i don't know what it's like um uh to be black i do know what it's like to be married and i i i can tell you it's very hard to be married it's even harder to stay married um your two sinners and um and and and now we've doubled our sinfulness in the home um and and that's just if you if you even if you're a believer and you recognize you're a sinner imagine if you're not and or one of you's not and you don't so then you have no self-awareness really to your own contribution to the struggles and temptations that go along with a marriage whatsoever i've been open about this to my own audience uh about two years ago my marriage almost ended um we had serious issues that we had not addressed on both sides um and you kind of just put that stuff off because you're in the middle of raising kids and you want to keep that family together you don't want to be a statistic you don't want to put them through that disruption uh and what that does and and that's why a lot of times couples who do that end up in the pastor's office uh a few months or a few years after the kids leave all leave the house and they say hey we're getting a divorce we've grown apart because they they put those things off well covid comes along and now all of a sudden we're gonna have to address these things there's there aren't any distractions there's no word to take the kids the kids don't have any going on it's just us now here in this house with everything else shut down and all these issues now come to the surface and um i mean my wife had the number of an attorney we were really close and then you go through a coping mechanism what what what what what what what does it take to keep a marriage together what are you willing to tolerate to take to keep a marriage together when one side is contemplating that they're kind of already have one foot out the door and so they're even behaving along those lines that this is this is some personal empathy from me understanding having walked through those shoes and while i'm not nearly a public figure to the extent that will smith is obviously i still m1 and and in in some regards this is even a tougher road for me because the kind of public figure i am comes to a certain level of moral expectation that hymas does not you know and so um i i i've walked at least a few centimeters in those shoes and so i understand the difficulty of what does it mean to keep a marriage together when you're very flawed people when one particularly if one person's flaws they're not willing to confront them but you're still you know there's an entire book of the bible about that by the way the book of hosea um you know this the my i mean my wife this is why she does therapy now she just finished her therapist degree at liberty and she works at one of the larger christian therapy clinics here in town and the stories that she can tell about marriages and what goes on and this is people that are coming for christian counseling so they they know that this is coming with a particular religious angle and yet the baggage that goes along with that we're in a systemically fallen culture so what i saw and so just as you empathize with the the cultural angle that you have personal experience with i was empathizing with the cultural angle that i have personal experience with which is the when a man is determined even to tolerate things that maybe he wouldn't think he would tolerate or to do things he didn't think he would do but he's determined to keep a marriage and a family together and as he said in his acceptance speech love will make you do crazy things and think maybe he was addressing both you and eyes angles on this when he said that actually but i i i i to me the more i learned about this because you're right i i my initial take was twitter take was that but then the more i learned the back story of this see i i go out of my way to not know anything about celebrities lives nothing i don't want to know i don't care i hate the idol worship but the more that this kept getting thrown back at me i actually looked at it from my own personal experience and then the second-hand experience i have from my wife and the stories that she hears all day long um and and i could also see the a guy reacting that way because this is the last straw especially when you're telling me i didn't even know that there was a another joke about their marriage in the show because i didn't watch any of the show except that clip so i i mean i i could see where that tension was just kind of building up the entire all the day long and this now becomes kind of a breaking point to some degree i i think both things can be simultaneously true and i also think there is no more destructive force in the history of humanity there is no more destructive manifestation of our original sin than the fragile male ego it has caused more wars it has destroyed more communities and cultures it is it is it is it is devalued and destroyed more families than any other manifestation of our sin than nothing has come close to the fragile male ego and i think that's not unique to one particular you know aspect of of of american culture i think there's a lot of men regardless of the pigment of their skin or the language they have spoken that have maybe done things they regret in order to earn the favor approval of the women in their lives but i think sometimes that can be a positive i think i think i think a lot of men have been have have have thought that i don't even have to get the approval uh an affirmation of the women in my life anymore so i can just be completely passive while uh they rape my daughter's mind in school uh or maybe allow her to be raped in the bathroom at school by a dude who feels pretty or choke my children out i don't have to do any of those things and and and and i just bristle at the notion that there's never a time to react any such way that there's never any insult or disrespect that could be said about the women in your care and and that you love that would that would that would merit such a response and and that was what i wanted to push back on from the very beginning but and then i've heard the argument well because of what has been allowed to go on in their marriage he has no moral standing to make this case i think that's the language of the devil actually i think the devil is the one who says hey because you fell down over here no never you you can't get up anywhere you can't ever take a stand anywhere if the if the standard is when we have reached a certain level of comprehensive moral achievement we can now take a stand when there is no red light district in our minds when there is nothing in our search history we're not proud of when there is nothing currently going on in our lives that if god called us home we couldn't look jesus in the eye and admit because we'd be ashamed to that's now that is now when we can stand up if that's the enemy talking those are all accusations because then no one would be qualified to stand up man you know you've talked very eloquently in the past about just being honest about your own past and how in the minds of secular america that doesn't give you the standing to stand up for those things when in reality from the christian worldview it precisely does and and i don't like the idea that if you're i mean if you're falling in one area of your life that means you can't take a stand anywhere else um the christian the devil's the one who says to stay down the biblical worldview is i appreciate you taking this righteous stand here but now it's time to start applying this and be more self-aware in other areas to challenge people to be comprehensively better not to essentially say you're so far gone just continue to circle the drain and wallow in your own sinfulness so there were just numerous meta arguments if i had had if if i had not heard any of these meta arguments brother and had only had this particular conversation with you one-on-one i might have had an instantly different reaction but there were all these other meta arguments that i think are far more destructive than this went this was about a joke and it went too far that speak far more to our current cultural condition which is largely driven by lackadaisical complacent and wimpy men that that's what drew my attention to this story from the very minute after it occurred and so here's what i would say and that's an eloquent very thoughtful uh i'll be marinating on your response for the next day or two i would say this though what i think some of us are arguing is like he's directing where he's standing up it's at the wrong target chris rock is not his problem he has been emaculated and ridiculed and he has violated the beliefs that he grew up with he he's been in interviews talking about he was raised in the church he in his acceptance speech he referenced god and god called him and so if he really want and i do want will smith to stand up and what so will smith according to the interviews that he and his wife have done his wife talked him into the open marriage and she comes from a more secular background than he does and so what i want will smith to do is stand up at home and say you know jade this open marriage thing it don't work for me it undermines my confidence my ego it's not what i think it's healthy it's not what i believe in for a family and i certainly don't believe in sharing all this publicly on your red table podcast and so i argued this yesterday john tompson the great george town basketball coach had a saying about people need to have three lives personal life private life and a public life and social media and all this stuff has made it all just one life and so everything's terrific now and people share everything and so he to me he needs to stand up at home and be a man and put some boundaries and parameters on his out of control wife uh and so chris rock's not really the problem and and then i think there are those again when he gets into the septic speech and starts talking about god that's what makes me really say not stand up at home bro on national tv slapping chris rock to make a point to everybody else you're what that's not going to satisfy your real issues and his real issues to me are he's like a lot of men he's trapped in this what he believes and what his values are in comparison to the life that he's living i've been trapped like that i've been you know part of the reason i left l.a. was to escape a very pagan woman and a pagan lifestyle that i was living that just didn't work with my values and principles that i believed in and the only way to break that spell was for me to leave l.a. and so you know luckily i wasn't married didn't have kids things like that it's a lot easier but will smith is has been captured by a woman with highly secular values and he's completely unhappy and miserable and so he beat up chris rock because he ain't man enough to break that curse to get that woman to submit or leave her and so he beat up chris rock instead and and and this is pervasive i was talking to hoteb jesus before you about like this is pervasive what goes on in the black communities and it's why black people we define success by evacuating our own communities and neighborhoods that are overrun by single women who are matriarchs the leaders they're setting the standards and that's why from jamele hill that tiffany hadish i wrote about and talked about them on today's show they're all kind of oh this is very encouraging will smith stood up for his wife his black wife and this is very encouraging this this mentality of black men being baited into uh or pressured into or led into being violent towards each other to win the approval of black women it's why our murder rate that's why our neighborhoods are so unsafe uh this is being taught that this is the proper way to handle very petty differences and and again when you don't when you're not the man of your house you start looking to be a man in appropriate places oscar stages uh but when you're the man of your house you can come outside the house and and like oh i can eat that doodoo i can eat that doodoo because i got so much peace at home that i can swallow that oh someone cracked a joke who cares i'm gonna go home and jade got my back and my kids got my back and i'm the king of that castle he looked very weak to me uh but i i really appreciate this conversation i thought well i'll return the favor i think what you just said was very potent and eloquent as well and it did give me um some perspectives i'd not considered and i will say it's a perspective that no one who has disagreed with me in my inbox or anywhere on social media has dared to offer the disagreements i've had were um there's never a time ever ever to put a dood down there words can never there's nothing let me make a point there ever say whatsoever that's ever worthy of those times so there's a point i wanted to make there steve go ahead go ahead let me make this point let me make this quick point because this is where i agree with you and this is like where i wish men would channel the will smith energy i promise you this if i promise you this if somebody at the nc double a swimming championships had slapped the hell out of somebody at the nc double a for allowing lee atomas to hop in that pool with women i would be defending them until the cows came home i promise you and so that was that's my issue i think i think both of us came at this with what is the primary lament we've been wrestling with professionally and personally for the last period of time i think in your case it's what's going on in your home base your native community and how those issues have been transmitted generation after generation and in my case it's what i've witnessed over the last 23 months with dads who say nothing while their daughters are have their positions just taken from them and are completely erased by whatever we all recognize as a bearded lady act as a man men who said nothing and did nothing while their children were choked out or being told that they had to take a second or third round of an experimental and dangerous jab in order to come back to school these are the so i think both of us are coming at this from the perspective of what's been the what's been the primary whirlwind we've been trying to confront within our own ecosystems and your perspective is one that i've not heard from anywhere else and no one that came back at me offered me your perspective everything that i heard was frankly just more wasification just more feminization just there's there's never a time my my husband can my husband knows that there's no he doesn't have to when if i'm attacked doesn't have to ever violently really so you're called a filthy a guy calls you a filthy whore and says i want to molest your daughters and you want your husband just to sit there and say hey buddy that's not nice i i that's the stuff that see to me that is how we get to you're dealing with what you have seen generationally wreck your community and i'm trying to confront what i see on a generational level is going to wreck every community and that is just complete and total lack of a masculine of masculine action and aggression and initiation and so i think that's really the issue here is both of us coming at this from the perspective of what we have been primarily trying to confront within our own ecosystems here as a as of late steve awesome every time i have you on it reminds me why i need to have you on more often very kind i i i i i this was awesome thank you so much you gotta get your fearless army swag at shopblazemedia.com all right we're gonna take it down a notch and talk a little football with tj moly nfl's got some new diversity inclusion and equity rules tj moly x all right welcome back time to hear from tj moe the show me kid from st louis we're going to talk a little nfl you guys remember tj former mazoo wide receiver a cup of coffee at the nfl with the rams and the patriots tj the nfl has instituted a new addition to the runny rule requiring all 32 nfl teams to have a black offensive assistant coach uh they say this is because you know all these organizations are hiring head coaches on the offensive side a lot of that has to do with the money that's dumped into quarterbacks if you're paying quarterbacks 40 50 million dollars a year it's important that your head coach be able to relate to the quarterback and help the quarterback and so the nfl's decided that every nfl team has to have a black offensive assistant coach which they all do uh you know wide receiver coaches running backs coaches tend to be black and so it's kind of a silly rule but they also say that if you hire a woman that would be considered meeting this rule and they're adding women to the interview process of the runny rule including as it relates to head coaches and so uh i i can you know there's a hypothetical situation where an nfl team could interview two white women uh to be the head coach and uh that will service the runny rule they don't have to uh interview any other minority coaches this rule is silly it's stupid it's it's bringing more of the college campus theory to life to the real world and to the nfl and to sports um you know last week steep kim and i had a conversation about fox sports and how they let troy aikman and joe buck just walk over to esp and and i said at the time i was like this is a sign that the nfl is going to go further left that if the nfl is comfortable with the esp and basically being the number one platform discussing its league and that's what aikman and buck going to esp and means that they are the number one platform talking about the nfl it's an indication nfl is going to go even more woke they haven't finished going left i look at this rule and say yep this is what i think is happening and thought is happening and and and maybe fox sports led aikman and buck walk because they think five years from now uh on this current path the nfl may be less valuable than it is today uh i actually think it's a possibility i think these types of rules putting just adopting all this college campus culture uh left wing quote a system upsetting the meritocracy again sports has always been about great competition this is undermining great competition and and just baking more politics and more bs into the nfl system um i i just i just don't see this as a successful path for the nfl and i know i'm saying a lot but i was also thinking this morning last night when i heard about this was like the nfl has never been more ripe for competition than right now and and they got this usfl league that foxes invested in it's a summer league you know one of the far-reaching thoughts i had is like i think the sec in the big 10 could break away from the nc double a and just do some sort of just make college football even more professional and it could be a threat to the nfl uh if they stuck to the old school values and rules but anyway i wanted your thoughts on this new nfl rule and where you think the nfl is headed well you mentioned that it it's a silly rule and it is a silly rule we went over this several months ago uh and i brought you a study that suggested it that not only does the rule not work but it may even be counterproductive because it ends up emasculating a lot of men putting them in a room just for show um the rule does not work so they moved on it's like you know people make fun of conservatives for always talking about the slippery slope uh we specifically with gun rights we talked about this we're not giving an inch because you always take a mile we went from interviewing a minority coach one time to interviewing a minority coach two times to now mandating the hiring of a minority coach and well and a woman who uh would not be a minority in the world but in the uh nfl so this is the slippery slope this is exactly what we talk about and it is not the rule itself is silly and it means nothing it's an empty rule because the likelihood of a woman filling this rule is almost zero and there are already black coaches i disagree but i hear you i yes i i think it had been unlikely but i do think uh in the next ten years there'll be a woman head coach in the nfl what i mean to say is that if someone goes that far they most certainly already have black coaches on staff so this will not the woman will not be filling this role if they're if they are that woke they've decided that they're we're only going to have a black and woman staff anyway and so you know it's like reading the article i sent it right back to you when he when he said it was actually runi who said well we hope to have female head coaches in the near future i'm like and in the meantime we're going to have you know a woman will be able to satisfy this rule when did black men and women become interchangeable i mean that that was my first thought what a what a weird thing to clump to get together and if everybody is so convinced that the nfl is racist are we just going to see white women everywhere that's obviously ridiculous but that's what a lot of these people would tell you and if the justification for more blackhead coaches in the nfl is because the makeup of the nfl is 70 black men what is the justification for adding more white women or women in general they don't make up any of the nfl how many women actually want to coach football in the nfl and when did wanting something become the only qualification for it being awarded to you when did the nfl's on field product become a charity we're going to be trotting out a bunch of make a wish which coaches if we have a woman on every team because they're just not qualified to be coaching in the nfl and so you again going back to you mentioned that it's a silly rule it is a silly rule but it is the principle that is a serious problem because the slippery slope where does this stop i don't see any transgender coaches i don't see any gay coaches and why are we stopping at coaches i haven't seen a an asian kicker seems unfair to steve kim i haven't seen a female quarterback that seems problematic you know if we're going to go down this line who gets to decide proper representation and if it's the woke mob what happens if they change their mind and what happens if one part of the woke mob the black lives matter leaders disagree with the feminists now what and if we're just divvying out quotas for every single group why do we even have interviews shouldn't we just get all the leaders of the movements of the historically oppressed groups in a room in divvy out positions based on victimhood status i mean this is the principle i'm i'm trying to point out the absurdity of how far this can go if you are deciding that identity is the only thing that really matters um there is no rational position you can take that support tiring based on identity that i think the logical extremes make it untenable and and the problem is is that people think because you can do the opposite and that's bad that this would be good what i mean is that we can all agree that not hiring someone based solely on race and gender it is a bad immoral thing you should not consider that as a disqualification but hiring someone based solely on race and gender is equally bad and immoral because it strips everyone of the power to control their own destiny with hard work preparation focus and all the other tools we have at our disposal to differentiate ourselves from the man standing next to us and so what it does that turns the american dream into a lottery when you're born you'll know if you can get the job or not and that is a reprehensible way to live you know so many thoughts flood through my head when i think about this and and what it says about our culture and society um it's it's hard for me to even keep up with just all the different negative consequences of shaping a world like this because you said like and i want to clarify a comment you made you said when did black men and women become interchangeable or did you mean when did black men and women become interchangeable yeah specifically white women yes and and it it people have said this about the civil rights movement for 30 40 years that the civil rights movement did far more for white women than it did for black people and that this entire again i've said black lives matters all of these civil rights they have virtually nothing to do with black people they have everything to do with the advancement of the lgbt crowd and women and feminists and now trans people that's what the real agenda is here and so they're taking football of all and again if they can do this to football where they're not talking about hiring qualified people it's just like oh well these people want it and it's no different than and this is why i say like what Jim Harbaugh did we talked about this a couple weeks ago with this female Georgetown basketball player she's now an assistant coach with their quarterbacks at the University of Michigan i'm just sorry just i get that maybe she wants to be a coach a football coach but is she really more qualified than a bunch of guys who played football all their life probably even if they just played it at a naia level uh what is she better prepared to help Michigan's quarterbacks prepare than some guy whose whole life has been devoted to playing and or learning the game i get that she wants to and i get that it makes a great statement but here's one of the in their minds here's one of the main things that that i think about what's gone on with american society and culture is when you detach yourself from religion you don't see yourself as part of an overall journey of leaving things better for the next generation and so what when i'm looking there's men in football all of them for rogigadale down no none of this has to do with leaving things in a better place they're doing whatever they can to preserve their jobs rogigadale wants to do whatever he can to make sure he continues to make 50 million a year rogigadale wants to make his underlings probably making five to 10 million a year he's trying to do he's trying to do everything he can to preserve his job uh in a jerry jones and the nfl ownerships that that won't stand up and put a stop to this they want to preserve their ownership of these teams and their ability because again they generate so much money none of this is about an overall good for society and so when i look at all the progress we've made in america in 250 some odd years of our existence a lot of it was dependent upon people making incredible self-sacrifices to move the country ahead and to keep it on course and that spirit no one does anything for america anymore it's always about the individual i sit here and think that we had a democrat president uh john frisjiro kennedy who asked historically ask not what uh you can what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country and we've completely divorced ourselves from that mentality and we've completely divorced ourselves from the other icon of that era martin luther king saying let's judge people by the content of our character uh we've pivoted 180 degrees from both of those mentalities i just and i'm just baffled and stunned and and and the people that have pivoted claim that martin luther king and john f kennedy are their inspirations it's mind blowing to me i think it goes back to self-worth and you mentioned i'm actually really glad you brought this up because i had uh i was going to say this as an aside at the end but but you brought us to it it is an identity crisis that we have never seen before why would you ever value the lives of future generations if you don't value yourself and how can you value yourself if all you are is made up of what you decide you are today so if you ask somebody today it's one of these identity obsessed you know um some of i mean we're we're getting the point where it's not just millennials but let's say one of these identity obsessed people who are you they might say i'm a trans woman pansexual political activist tiktok influencer i'm fighting for trans rights that's the definition of themselves and i was reading effigens one and two last night and how does god define us god in effigens tells us that we're blessed that we're chosen that we were adopted by jesus that were a de redeemed in christ forgiven because of what he's done mart with the seal given the holy spirit we're loved made in christ uh remade in christ when we deserved death we were saved by grace through faith and we are deeply loved children of god that's all set in two chapters in the bible and so that's what i think about myself so if i am valued that much by the creator of the universe so is everyone else because i'm a nobody so there is my reason to leave the world a better place for the next person but if you have such a low value for yourself and you are the only one creating value and you get on facebook and you get on twitter and you read your mentions all day and everybody disagrees with you and says you're garbage and you have such a low self-esteem why would you ever care about the next generation coming through if you have no value for yourself you can't value anyone else it's good stuff tj i gotta let you go i gotta keep it moving i hope you guys

she said i sure wish you would have took the opportunity to say something else what mama what what what did you want me to say i wish you would have took the opportunity to say that well it was a time at least a black man stood up for a black woman i said but mama was at the expense of taking down a black man she said yeah i know but it was just an opportunity just to say that the black man took up for the black woman we just need more black men to take up for black women i'm like mama but if you're looking for that just go to the prison system it's overcrowded men take it up for the black woman and then she said no gee me i'm being real serious and finally i said i understand mama and i said no i gotta go and i ended the conversation and i ended that conversation Jason and i realized that she's been telling me that all my life and we hear that all of our life and what i wanted to say to her and what i didn't say to her was i want to say damn mama you know i understand what you're

us feel about christ rock uh and so i'm going to we'll start with job performance i'm going to give him a 20 in job performance i think dave shapelle has unseated him as the most dangerous and funny comedian going and at one time i thought it was chris rock chris rock he used to do a lot of humor that i found enjoyable and risky he's gone a little bit woke and so i'm giving him a 20 in job performance i give him a 25 because this dude took the phrase the biblical phrase turned the other cheat he took it to a whole new level i mean honestly man he i mean honestly he he stood up and left this man slapping and he he exhibited a self-restraint that i i can't even imagine into the i'm seriously in today's society all we see is mammoth brawls this dude utilized restraint Jason if that's me and he slapped me and then he turned around and walked off you'd hurt you'd all you to hurt was glass breaking that's all but what the phrase say man i'd have him touching everything up in the Grammys man come on let's move to character um you know i i i with you kind of like he turned the other cheat that's a high character move um he got divorced from his wife you know he talked all about how he couldn't control his love of pornography and all that i don't know if you call it every wife was fine too but so i'm gonna give him an 18 in character i gave him a 25 i gave him a 25 because
