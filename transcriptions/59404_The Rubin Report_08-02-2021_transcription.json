    "text": " What's going on, humanoids? I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report Direct message for today, February 8th, 2021. And before we get into anything, and today is a wide-eyed, varied show on all sorts of topics that I think you're going to enjoy. I'm looking forward to chatting with you. But before we do that, we have to do a little bit of housekeeping here. I've got to clean something up that happened on Thursday. Now you know on Friday we did our panel show on spirituality and meaning amidst the chaos these days, which a lot of you guys enjoyed and we're going to keep doing those. But on Thursday, I was doing a regular direct message and I began the show by saying, what's shaken Nazis? And a lot of you did find that funny. A lot of you did find that funny. What's shaken Nazis? I don't know that that's a phrase that's been said before. It seemed like a funny way to start the show. But then a few of you did say to me, well, wait a minute, Dave, it can't be that all of your audience is Nazis. Sure, there's Nazis everywhere, right? Nazis are in the government. Nazis are in the Educational Institute. Nazis are across society. They're coming for everybody. But what are the chances that everybody who watches the Rubin Report is a Nazi. I mean, it can't be. So what do we do? Well, you know, these days you've got to follow the science, right? You've got to go to where the data is, where the numbers are. That's the only way to make sense of anything. So we looked, we looked at the analytics. We opened up the files. Okay, we went in, we had our math guy there, our accountant, the whole Rubin Report team, and we dug into the numbers to figure out who's watching this show. Okay, because I don't want to say what's shaken Nazis, the implication being you're all Nazis, if it's not the case. So we looked at the numbers and I want to update you on what we figured out. So it turns out that only 60% of you watching right now are Nazis. 60%. That's it. If I would have just guessed, I would have said around 85% Nazi, right? I do talk about free speech a lot, you know, free markets, capitalism, competition, law and order, individual rights. So I would have thought around 85% Nazi turns out 60% Nazi. So let's put that there. And it turns out that another 20% of you are capitalist pigs. So 60% Nazi, 20% capitalist pigs. So that's about 80% of you right there. Then we've got 10% anarchists. That didn't surprise me. These are the Mad Max Fury Road kind of people just want to disassemble the whole thing. I appreciate that. That gets us to 90%. Then 10% soy boy. I was surprised. I was, you know, I know that we've still got a couple, you know, progressive lefties that watched the show did not realize that it would be 10%. And then of course, 10% classical liberal, you know, I wrote a book defending classical liberalism. I believe that classical liberalism is the correct lens to view the world, at least at a political level to free the most people. So that doesn't surprise me. That's 10%. Now, if you add up all of those percentages, we had 60% Nazi, 20% capitalist pig, 10% anarchist, 10% soy, 10% classical liberal. You may note that that comes to 110%. And that's true because this is a big show. This is a big show here. And we've got a lot of people watching it. It's very exciting. And speaking of big show, don't forget guys, click that subscribe button, would you? Because a lot of you are getting unsubscribed every time I say it, click it. Then people go, wait a minute. I didn't realize I thought I was subscribed and I'm not actually subscribed. So click it. Make sure you're getting notified. And all that good stuff. And as I said, we've got a great show for you today. And I wouldn't just say that the way like Conan O'Brien or is he even on TV anymore? I'm not even sure. Or he's not. Maybe he is. Who knows? Or Colbert with, oh, we've got a great show for you tonight. Here are three actors you don't care about the lecture. What a racist Nazi pig you are. I'm not saying it that way. I'm saying we've got a really great show for you today. And before we get to it, people, do you know what I want to talk to you about? That's right. It's not Bill Barr. It's built bar. Emphasis on the T. It's February people. And if you're looking forward to Valentine's Day, but not sure how to stay away from the candy, I've got just the solution for you. Bill Barr is the secret. I'll hold two of them at one time to eating healthier food while also eating tastier food. Am I holding them up properly? No, here we go. Let's do it this way. Bill bars are low calorie, low sugar, high protein, high fiber, great for the keto diet. I can actually lose or maintain weight while indulging in a yummy treat. Healthy has never been this delicious. Bill bars taste like candy and they come in 18 amazing flavors, including caramel brownie and peanut butter. Bill bars are covered in 100% chocolate include both nut and nut-free flavors and are soft and easy to chew. And I know with restaurants opening up, it'll be tempting to indulge, but we also need to shed those additional quarantine pounds, which is why Bill bars are the perfect alternative for the health, conscious guy. Each bar contains 110 to 160 calories, 16 to 20 grams of protein, three to five net carbs. It's only February guys, don't give up on your New Year's resolution just yet. Bill bar is the answer. Go to Billbar.com and use promo code RUBIN to get 20% off your next order. Use promo code RUBIN to get 20% off at Billbar.com. And now back to me. All right. So I'm psyched to do this first story because if you want something, I thought we could lead the show today with just how stupid is everything and why it is that we should not be paying attention to the people that are making everything so stupid. This is the perfect story to illustrate that just that there was video that went viral over the last couple of days of Ibram X. Kendi. Now, this is one of the guys who's been the main drivers of sort of pushing all of this woke intersectionality stuff on us, this critical race theory stuff, this idea that America is evil and racist and that it's not that you just have to be not racist. You have to be actively anti-racist and you're not going to believe this guy's that usually turns out to you being racist. He's written many books on racism. Can we throw up some of the books right there? Let's get some of the titles of some of the books that he's written. The one he's really known for right now is how to be an anti-racist and in effect that means you should be a modern racist. He also wrote stamped racism, anti-racism in you. He wrote stamped from the beginning the history, the definitive history of racist ideas in America. He wrote a children's book called anti-racist baby and he also wrote a book called the Black Campus Movement. These are all interesting books that every correspondent on MSNBC has behind them in their fancy bookshelf. But the reason I mention him because obviously I talk a lot about these issues. One of the key parts of how leftism has become so crazy is the idea of intersectionality. The idea that you would take all of these supposed oppressed groups, so you would take black people and trans people and gay people and people with a limp and people with a lazy eye and fat people and you would take all of these people and you could sort of combine them into one stronger thing. You may remember the constructicons. They were decepticons in the Transformers. They were trucks that could combine into Devastator and then they were stronger as Devastator. Our Voltron might be a reference that would work for you, a similar idea as the constructicons. That's sort of what they think intersectionality is. We will take all of you sort of small groups of oppressed people. We will combine you into one huge thing. And what that would mean is that of course that your oppressions then would all be sort of stronger together. But of course it doesn't work and not only does it not work, it puts people in this hierarchy that we've talked about as my friend Faiz Alal Mutar calls the oppression Olympics where you have to figure out whose oppression is more than anyone else's oppression. So black people are oppressed this much, Muslims this much, this much and of course white Christian people, especially heterosexual white Christians, the most evil of all people. They're always on the bottom of this thing. Anyway, why do I mention all of this? Well this video went viral over the weekend. This is Ibram X. Kendi, the man who wants you to be anti-racist and woke and progressive and intersectional, talking about his son and trans issues. Let's take a look. You know obviously talking about race even talking about gender. You know I think it was last week my daughter came home and said she wanted to be a boy. You know which was horrifying for my wife to hear, myself to hear and so of course you know we're like okay what affording messages about girlhood. You know can we be teaching her to protect her from whatever she's hearing in our home or even outside of our home that would make her want to be a boy. And I suspect it's the same thing with you know kids of color in which they're regularly hearing these messages that maybe may want them to want to be white or even white children who are like I'm happy I'm white. Right you know what affirmative messages are we teaching them to break down those items. Alright so let's just be very clear here like without equivocation that guy is a total fraud. The entire concept of woke intersectionality is totally fraudulent and based basically in a bunch of people who don't believe the bile that they're constantly spewing they don't even believe it enough to put it in their own homes. He says that when his daughter came home saying she wanted to be a boy that it was horrifying. It was horrifying for him and his wife. Why would she quote want to be a boy. Now that's a very odd thing I thought these movements are together right black trans lives matter. Guess what I believe black trans lives matter I believe all lives matter I believe police lives matter I believe white people's lives matter I know controversial stuff but what this guy is saying is he was horrified that his own daughter might be trans. Now where is the mob? I am fairly certain that if someone on the right if Tucker Carlson let's say that this uh ebrum Kendi is a is a thought leader on the left he is right this is the stuff that is being peddled constantly all over the left. Okay this is mainstream acceptance uh so he's a thought leader on the left and he just said he would be horrified that or is horrified in a fact that his daughter came home wanting to be a boy which is a sort of offensive uh definition of what trans means that they just decided they would suddenly be a boy I thought that was offensive but okay let's put that aside now let's pretend Tucker Carlson you know Tucker Carlson he's got this little show on Fox it's actually the highest rated cable news show in all of television history imagine if Tucker Carlson went on air tonight and said that his daughter came home and wanted to be a boy and that he and his wife were horrified. Do you think there'd be calls for boycotts do you think they'd try to cancel Tucker and possibly this would be the one that would actually break him do you guys see the level of hypocrisy and nonsense I actually I agree in a certain sense with ebrum in that if your child came home and said they they wanted to be a different gender than they are or they felt that they were a different gender than they are then you've got some serious stuff to work out maybe you would find out that they were trans perhaps but if this is a young child I think his child's like five or six years old if I'm not mistaken um there's a lot of time that you have to play with there but even even saying that that you don't allow I'm sorry that his daughter is five or six years old um even if you don't allow uh you know children to immediately say oh I'm trans and then immediately start getting therapy they'll now call you a bigot right we all know this I did uh I did an interview with Abigail Schreier who wrote a book all about this about young girls transitioning very young anyway the point of this is that the people who are pushing this nonsense they don't believe it themselves the people who push intersectionally don't believe it and the people who push can't cancel culture it's not because they want to cancel people across the board who have bad ideas it's because they want to cancel other people you know damn well like you just know it in your bones if Tucker Carlson said this if Ben Shapiro said this if Dave Rubin said this there would be calls to get them booted off YouTube have Fox News canceled take out the daily wire sponsors whatever it might be but here's a good lefty who's obviously by their definition he's a transphobe he has a phobia is an irrational fear it seems to me that he has an irrational fear of trans people his daughter came home and said she wanted to be a boy and he said it was horrifying that seems like an irrational fear if we are supposed to believe that trans people are wonderful and great and everything else and again I believe they should live whatever life they want to live but by his own logic by the logic of the left by the rules that they demand you play by while you while they don't play by them themselves well then here we are so that person should not be I'm not calling for his cancellation people can still buy his books he's not going away that's okay but we should understand that he's a fraud and that the idea of intersectionality is completely fraudulent as well I think you got the point there did you get the point there I think you got the point let's talk about Express VPN for just a moment you never since the new year I've been talking about Express VPN on my show I'm doing it right now why haven't you got VPN yet guys maybe you thought hey this is America and we have free speech and privacy laws and so perhaps you believe that Trump and Congress wouldn't allow big tech to censor and spy on you so you didn't act well ladles and jelly spoons people love when I say that I'll tell you this with the new administration and cancel culture raging out of control there's never been a more important time to protect your digital rights that's why so many patriotic listeners are choosing to secure their online data by using Express VPN I use it myself do you believe that a VPN isn't for you because you can use the internet just fine without one well sadly that's just no longer true with the recent actions taken by big tech to control our digital lives are you confused about how it works Express VPN is an app for computers and smartphones that encrypts your network data and re-routes it through a secure server that means that you can use the internet more anonymously without having your activity tracked do you think that VPNs are complex and only for tech experts take it from me they're not with Express VPN you launch the app and literally tap one button and you protect yourself that's it it's time to trust Express VPN to protect your online data because they're rated number one and they stand for your values now is the time for you to take a stance take back your privacy to express VPN dot com slash Reuben that's e x p r e s s vpn dot com slash Reuben to get three months free Express VPN dot com slash Reuben right now and now back to me all right well I should say before we do this story that I could be canceled right this could be the one this if the stream goes down in the middle of this one it's very possible and it was nice knowing all of you and you should join me at Reuben report dot locals dot com because obviously I'm gonna be booted off all of this stuff at some point and that at least I own it and I can communicate directly with you guys but this is actually a completely insane story I know that I say a lot of things are bananas I know I've brought bananas back into the vernacular right but this one is truly truly bananas so Time magazine which used to be a pretty reputable place of journalism and it's actually not all terrible they released an article in the last couple days called the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election now let's just let me just repeat that title there because as you know YouTube has said we're not allowed to talk about election insecurity we're not allowed to talk about conspiracy things related to all of this and if we are to talk about any of those things our channel could we could get a strike which basically means you can't live stream and they could just they could just delete your channel and it is only by the grace of these good people that any of us are here but we've been told we can't talk about this stuff and then Time magazine which is a main stream I suppose a reputable source they wrote a piece again called the secret history of the shadow campaign that saved the 2020 election or well would be proud of that title himself so I want to read you some of the quotes from this this is actually remarkable what they're saying here and again I just want to say these conspiracy theories I'm about to read are from Time magazine and that Dave Rubin is but a humble servant who is just reading words from something else so please Susan Wojjeski and YouTube overlords don't delete me I'm just reading word for word what they said in Time magazine and you guys will make some decisions on your own this is what they say this is the inside story of the conspiracy to save the 2020 election based on access to the groups inner workings never before seen documents and interviews with dozens of those involved from across the political spectrum there was a conspiracy unfolding behind the scenes one that both curtailed the protests and coordinated the coordinated the resistance from CEOs both surprises were the result of an informal alliance between left-wing activists and business titans the pact was formalized in a terse little noticed joint statement of the u.s chamber of commerce the AFL CIO published on election day both sides would come to see it as a sort of implicit bargain inspired by the summer's massive sometimes destructive racial justice protests in which the forces of labor came together with the forces of capital to keep the peace and oppose Trump's assault on democracy come back to me for one second here I'm going to read a little bit more but are but are you are you getting this so far the forces of business came together with the forces of left left-wing activist groups to protect our democracy I don't want to editorialize too much again I I love you YouTube thank you for letting me be here your wonderful people all of you but I'm just reading what they say here and I just wanted to give you a little context let's continue though the scenario the shadow campaigners shadow campaigners were desperate to stop was not a trump victory it was an election so calamitous that no result could be discerned at all a failure of the central act of democratic self-governance that has been a hallmark of America since its founding I will editorialize for a moment yes yes they didn't wasn't that they wanted to stop trump they just wanted to make sure that the election would be okay you get it that was it these these are completely nonpartisan left-wing activists and business leaders they but they just want to make sure you get the truth okay let's continue their work touched every aspect of the election they got states to change voting systems what and laws and helped secure hundreds of millions in public and private funding they fended off voter suppression lawsuits recruited armies of poll workers and got millions of people to vote by mail for the first time they successfully pressured social media companies to take a harder line against disinformation and use data-driven strategies to fight viral smears they executed national public awareness campaigns that helped americans understand how the vote count would unfold over days or weeks preventing trump's conspiracy theories and false claims of victory from getting more traction after election every pressure point to ensure that trump could not overturn the result well you know i don't really have anything to say about all that that's time magazine telling you that a secret cabal of people got together with left-wing activists and big business groups in the aflcio and they did what's best for you and if you don't believe that they did what's best for you you're suffering from misinformation and you should probably check into your local reprogramming center or your local gulag generally you do the reprogramming center first and if it doesn't take you go to the gulag but if you want to go straight to the gulag i'm sure that can be arranged as well um again i have nothing to add to that um that's an article in tie magazine and it's a wonderful place of journalism and in essence they're saying that a secret cabal of people did everything they can to protect the election and get the result that they wanted but it wasn't because they certainly wanted a particular person to win it's just because they're really great people who are defending america and we should all accept that and i do because you know guys guys got to make a living you know so uh okay uh good talk everybody uh let me talk to you about uh gabby insurance everybody we're all looking

okay so i'm super psyched actually to do this this next little segment and i'm going to do a lot more of these whether you like it or not because well not because whether you like it or not i know you're going to like it and that's why i'm going to do more of them i've already committed to my people doing one of them every day this week because i think something interesting is brewing here so as you guys know i don't really watch sports anymore i i love sports particularly i love basketball i haven't watched the NBA in about a season and a half i just don't need to be watching a bunch of millionaires lecture me about things and see black lives matter on the court and i just don't care about it anymore i watch old basketball games on youtube i watch old comedies on youtube i don't really there's very little that's out on netflix right now i feel like i've seen everything i watched Seinfeld i watch like a lot of old stuff and i think in many ways that keeps me connected to the world that used to exist and a lot of the stuff right now it's like i just don't feel like giving these people my money or attention or anything else anyway although i did watch the super bowl yesterday and i pretty much muted it during all the depressing commercials because it was like they're basically just telling you how to live your life it's like are you selling me a car are you selling me a Dorito or you telling me how to live actually the Dorito commercial is fine but like you know and you get it it's like every commercial oh everything's horrible it's like okay do you make a product maybe i'll buy it anyway when i'm doing cardio i usually watch old basketball games but some of the other things that i've been doing i've been watching just sort of 60s and 70s and 80s sometimes talk shows sometimes with political leaders just to kind of remember what things used to be like and i happen to come across this clip it's about 18 minutes in total we're just going to show you about a minute and a half right now but then for the rest of the week i'm going to show you more clips from it this is uh Ronald Reagan who at the time had just ended being governor the republican governor my he was really a moderate republican governor of california this is 1975 he's on the tonight show with johnnie karson and this is a sort of sidebar but if you want to just see the difference between the late night shows of today versus the brilliant exquisite elegant professional that johnnie karson was well you'll see it in just a second and just notice the difference in tone and tenor and everything else but anyway ronald ragan is obviously a conservative he is obviously a republican he's obviously on the right as i said he was the republican governor of california this is 1975 before he had officially decided to run for president uh and then he obviously became president in 1980 after jimmy carter for four years and then he was president for eight years but there was so much in this video that he says that is true today and when you realize that things were true in 1975 that were true today and guess what there were truths in 1975 that were true in 1960 and everything else i just thought it was a great way of linking a little bit of the past to the president and the point is that things that are eternally true they're true no matter what year it is so this is ronald ragan on the johnnie karson tonight's show talking about the role of government back in 1975 well it's funny i think that one of the things is that people keep looking at government for the answer in government's the problem you a moment ago you you asked you know about people and feeling not only confused but right low and down in american first of all the american people if they were just take a little inventory and look around you triple our troubles and we're better off than any other people on earth and we've asked so much of government and we've gotten in the habit over the last 40 years of thinking the government has the answers there's very little that government can do as efficiently and as economically as the people can do themselves and if government would shut the doors and sneak away for about three weeks we'd never miss them okay i would like to announce that i will be running a go fund me and what we're going to be doing is we're going to crowdsource a whole bunch of money and then i would like to reanimate the corpse of ronald ragan that's the guy that we need as president of the united states those are the ideas we need and it's not just of course what he's talking about about the government has gotten too big and that there's nothing the government can do that people can't do better on them on their own it's that he has a mastery of the ideas the pleasant way that he speaks actually as as i said we're going to do uh three more clips of this this week and maybe i'll keep doing this i this this concept maybe will be a further segment as we go along with the show um but the pleasant demeanor uh the humor that he brings in much of it um the understanding of the proper issues and having like an actual philosophy that we understand as opposed to all virtually all of the politicians right now that you don't know what their guiding philosophy is like there are a couple that i do sense i know what their guiding philosophy is uh Ted Cruz i would say i have a basic sense of what his guiding philosophy is rann paul i would say i have a guiding sense of what his philosophy is um but the rest and and for the most of the lefties right now it's just oh power what else can government do again even even this morning uh ill hanomar the the wonderful congresswoman out of minnesota uh she tweeted about that we should have 15 minimum wage and it's like well what is the principle what is the economic principle the philosophic principle other than you just want to do something and force the government to force private people to do something and why not 20 dollars instead of 15 you beg it like why not why not it's because they don't have principles they just have the i oh we can just do things it doesn't matter what economic says or what philosophy says or anything else so i just thought that clip right there it's just one of several clips that we're going to show you guys and maybe yeah maybe we will do more of this sort of thing of listening to people of the past because maybe that can help us uh frame things in the future and uh boy if you would have ever told me 10 years ago that that would be the type of clip from ron ragan that i would be playing and saying yeah that that's the truth that's right i i guess i'd be shocked but here we are uh anyway guys uh join us on locals rubin report dot locals dot com where i can communicate with you guys directly without the interference of big tech and again i just want to say thank you to our friends at youtube who allow us to read articles from time magazine who these are obviously good people who are telling us the truth about securing the election and the cabal of people who did that so thank you to the cabal thank you to time magazine and thank you to youtube great people oh and just this morning we put up part one of my interview with ion hercioli you guys all i hope you all know ion hercioli the incredible human rights activist uh who i've
