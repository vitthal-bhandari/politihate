    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. I'm Lauren and this is Liam. Hello, hello. So we have a fun episode this time around. First off, we're going to be talking about the last of us part two game that's not even released yet that people are already mad about. And that's how you know it's going to be a success. So it's not released yet for several months. People are already causing controversies. Amazing. Then socialist rage on social media. We're going to be going through some ridiculous posts. And what's scary about those posts is that they're actually by politicians who have power. We're going to be debunking some socialist nonsense. Going to be a good time. But first, I want to tell you all about our awesome sponsor, Boox. So moms are working way harder than usual this year without a single day off. So here at the Boox company that's short for bouquets, we've decided to celebrate Mother's Day all month long. Put a smile on mom's face each month with our flower subscription and get 30% off plus free shipping every single time. Subscriptions are flexible so you can pause, switch up delivery dates or even recipients to cover all your bases, not into long-term commitment, not a problem. Try our gift trio for three months of farm fresh blooms. Order any time between now and May 31st to show moms some love with gratitude. Visit boox.com slash Lauren.

Maybe you can't give mom a hug right now, but you can still brighten her day with the Boox company. All right, so the last of us, you played that, right? Yeah, I did. I think that was a PlayStation exclusive. So I only ever watched the Let's Play, but it was a super popular game, very well received. Yeah, it was a good game. It was definitely at a very compelling storyline, you know. You play the role of basically a father who loses his daughter and then forms a new bond with someone who's forced to take care of basically. And it's yeah, it's a story based game and it was probably considered one of the best games to ever have released when it came out. So the second part of this was highly anticipated. Trailers have dropped for it at least a couple years ago. Yeah, I think there are ones that came out in 2017 and people have been so hyped about this. And what's interesting about the last of us, the first one is that by some metrics, it was woke. The little girl that you, your character Joel, that you play as you take care of, her name is Ellie. She's gay, but it was done in such a way where she was a well written character, three dimensional. It didn't feel like a trope or like a little girl. She's like a late teen. I think she was like 15 or 15. Yeah, I'm old. It wasn't like a sexual. Yeah, I'm old though. So anyone who's still a teenager is a little to me, but yeah, I feel you. So, but yeah, it wasn't central to the plot. Like it wasn't like it wasn't like at every turn. It was something about. Let's talk about diversity. Yeah, representation. So people, I don't think fans of the game had a problem with it. I didn't really see any controversy surrounding it. It was just like, OK, this character has to be it. Yeah. Apparently the same cannot be said about the last of us part two or last of us two. So the past week, there's been a lot of news surrounding this game. Leaks have come out that show that not only is there apparently an alleged trans character. It's not actually confirmed, but spoilers, by the way, for the last of us two. If you don't want to know what happens then mega spoilers because the whole plot was leaked. Yeah, the whole plot was leaked. A lot of you who are fans of the game have probably already heard it by now, but and again, spoilers. Apparently this allegedly trans character ends up killing Joel and maybe Ellie and you play as her. She's like the new main character and people are really, really upset about this. Yeah. So to reiterate and kind of clarify, Joel and Ellie are the two main characters from the last game, the ones that you really fell in love with throughout the playthrough. And you never play as Joel, who's basically in my mind the main protagonist from the first one. He's the guy that I think most people identified with. He never plays Joel in the second game. Yeah, you never play as him in the second game. And he ends up dying apparently as well. At the hands of this new character. Yes. At the hands of this new character who after she kills Joel, you play as her. Play as her to track down his kind of surrogate daughter. Yeah. Now, I think you can understand why this is upsetting to people. This feels like a slap in the face plot wise, like not even talking about any sort of trans stuff. But if you love these characters, the fact that you have to watch them dying and play as the person who kills them, why? Why? I mean, I've seen that the developers have said it's all it's supposed to be a theme about, you know, the pointlessness of revenge and how bad violence is. And that's a worthwhile story, I guess. But you can see why people aren't going to want to play this, right? And storylines can be uncomfortable, but still satisfying. This just sounds like a total kick in the pants. Yeah, I mean, to be fair, the leaks that we've heard have been like basic kind of bullet points. And I'm assuming that they would give us more exposition to make us somehow try to sympathize with the person that kills the people you. But it's like, I mean, in my mind, that would be a difficult move to pull off. I think so too. So yeah, and I think there's there are woke things kind of creeping their way in like the fact that Joel is a footnote almost in this version. Kind of being written out of the story. And you only play as empowered females, I guess, in this case. Yeah, and actually regarding the leaks. So there was a trailer that the supposedly trans character name is Abby. Maybe we'll throw up a photo of her here. It's actually not confirmed that she's trans. I thought it was when I was looking over the leaks, but people are hypothesizing that she is because she's very broad-shouldered and very muscular like this. And now that I mean, that rumor is about like, I get why people are saying that before the record, it's not been confirmed. And actually, I have this piece here that kind of supports the idea that maybe this character is trans. This is from bounding into comics. It says, following the immense backlash towards naughty dogs, which is the developer of the game, sparked after leak cutscenes from the last of us two gave players their first look at the game's questionable plot points and character designs. An alleged source connected to the studio has revealed that the designs of the female characters were intentionally made less feminine in order to avoid offending the trans community. The alleged source who spoke with Australian pop culture news site, Sausage Roll, under the condition of anonymity claimed that environment surrounding the game's development was very divisive and how even voicing your concerns on its story would upset certain individuals. It usually resulted in said person being called closed-minded or even phobic or some such nonsense. So I think these rumors combined with the way that character looks, people are assuming that it's a trans character. I don't know if that is the case, but it's funny because once the trans rumors started going on, even people who want like woke representation, they were kind of saying, how does this further trans acceptance, right? It seems like everyone's going to hate this character. Yeah, yeah, definitely. And I mean, it's kind of funny, I guess. It's like, to me, the way that Ellie was introduced into Last of Us One as someone who was lesbian is the ideal way to have representation because it's not like a in your face. It's just everybody accepted it and nobody cared. It's like, what else, what more could you want? Because it's just, it's not her central identity. It's just an asset or aspect of her character among many other things. Yeah, so my contrast, this might be and probably would be in today's age, one of the central parts of this character. And if she turns out to be a jerk, I mean, it wouldn't reflect well, I guess, to them. But at the same time, it's like, does every, I guess, trans and gay person and every other, like, is only white men bad in media allowed now? Yeah. Right? Yeah. And that's what, for Disney in, what's it, Beauty and the Beast, they had kind of like a pseudo gay villain. I thought that was actually interesting because it's gay and trans people can also be bad guys as anyone can. Yeah, because they're just like everybody else, right? Yeah. But overall, I guess, I get why this might seem like a questionable choice of the Korean readers, just to create such a polarizing character at all, but also say different. Yeah. I mean, yeah, I mean, to me, this whole conversation is ridiculous. And this is what happens when you try to go woke, right? I mean, frankly, once you start trying to go into the gender identity stuff, it's like, I don't think anybody knows what's going on in that, even in that community. It's just like, you're going to step on somebody's. Well, there's also the, the trope in, in some areas that, and I think TERFs play this up, trans exclusionary radical feminists, that trans women are predatory and violent and just want to beat up women. And so some people have said that this game is representing that trope by having this super muscular trans woman spending the entire game hunting down a lesbian couple of like cisgendered women. And it's kind of funny, but, you know, get woke up, broke is a saying for a reason. And actually, I think it was today, or yesterday, yesterday, definitely, when you're watching this, Sony released a trailer, I think one of the final trailers for the game. And it's interesting, this trans character, Abby, she does not appear in the trailer at all. We have a very short clip here for context, but Sony is apparently getting down the, the copyright hammer. So it's not going to be long, but check this out. I wish they would definitely. Ellie. But they ain't. I'm leaving tomorrow. I really hope you make it. So Abby, not in this at all. And there was an earlier intro scene dedicated entirely to her. She's completely missing now. Yeah. And I mean, to be fair, those of you who just got a little segment of the trailer, it, the whole trailer itself seemed like it had nothing important in it. It was, to me, it was one of the worst trailers I've seen for a blockbuster game in a long time. But yeah, I mean, it's possible that they're, they're taking some steps back. I don't think that's likely personally just because I know the amount of work that like the whole game is a story based game. You would need to, you would really need to tear the thing apart. It does. It's like, I don't think they have the time to do any rewrites or anything. I think the game is what it is. People have kind of theorized that because the game has been so long in development that may be Sony, who's, I guess the parent and all of this has, or try to implement some changes, but these leaks were pretty recent, like when they were taken. So this, this is what's going to happen. But it does maybe seem like even though there aren't changes being made to the game, they're perhaps trying to minimize the perception of it being the smoke game. Yeah, for sure. I mean, Sony, Sony are pretty good marketers as a rule. Yeah. So that's probably what they're trying to do. They're, they've probably seen, cause the trailer that came out two or three years ago was extremely woke. Right. It was about Ellie kissing. It was, it was, it was about interracial lesbian kiss. Yeah. Yeah. So that was everywhere for a while. So I think that they, they changed their tune a little bit and I've said that doesn't seem to make our core audience happy. At least until they sell the game, get the, and it's like, you know, the product is what it is. So they're just trying to catfish people, I think. I think so too, which is too, cause this is going to make people angrier, right? At least have the courage to stand behind. This is what our game is. Take it or leave it. Most people, I think a lot of people would leave it, but when you kind of, it seems like you bait people in a buying and you don't deliver, you're just going to end up with unhappy customers. Yeah. And this is one of the sad things is that there's so many games that I would like to, like I would have liked to partake in, like the Last of Us 2. I, I really did like the Last of Us 1. It would be fun. You know, Lauren and I could have played it together or something like that. But you know, at a certain point, I just got to say, I'm not interested in supporting these games. If they're going to be putting out some kind of propaganda, it was, we did the same thing my friends and I with the most recent battlefield game. We liked the previous Battlefield game where you're in World War One and we're all like, yes, like as soon as the national anthem starts coming on and we're like perfect. But, but with the next game came out and it was rewriting a lot of history. We said, all right, we can't buy it even though we enjoy the content. It's, and it's sad. The previous content, you may not have enjoyed the, the new game. Well, none of us played for the story mode. We played for, for the actual, you know, shoot, shoot, pew, pew. Well, you could, I mean, what I've heard people say is that they still maybe want to try it just out of curiosity, but they're either going to wait for final reviews to come out or they're going to wait until it goes on sale, which it, it looks like it definitely will pretty early. Yeah. That's the way to do it with these types of games, I'll be honest. Wait for reviews, wait for sales. This game is not a multiplayer. You're not going to miss anything. Just wait a little bit. Save some money. And actually I do want to go into before we get on, get on to the next segment. Anita Sarkeesian, she's kind of been roped into this whole thing. People have started blaming her for this game. There was a rumor going on that she was a consultant or something to not a dog. That's actually not true. We have this from hit C. But apparently Anita Sarkeesian is not associated with the game or its story in any capacity. But the reason why this rumor exists is that Neil Druckman, who's the, I think the VP of the studio mentioned feminist frequency during a last of his presentation. And during 2013, he cited feminist frequencies, tropes versus women as an inspiration for why he doesn't like what he sees in regard to the representation of females in video games. So I mean, it does seem like Anita Sarkeesian's general ideology is maybe affecting the developers, but it's not fair to say she specifically ruined this game. Yeah, not directly. Not directly. Yeah, I mean, definitely this kind of ideology is infecting major game companies across the board. Right. I mean, that's part of what Game of Game was about. It's tragic to me because it's not part of the core audience and we're seeing it everywhere. It's especially disappointing because I think anyone can criticize any type of media. That's just what creators open themselves up to. But when studios cater to people who are not their core audience, it's just a questionable business decision. If nothing else, I guess we'll have to see if this will be another example of get woke, go broke. It's kind of looking like those so far. I guess we'll have to see until in huge. Let's see what the numbers are. So next up, we're going to be talking about socialist Twitter. So socialist Twitter, it's a black hole. And I mean, a literal socialist here. I know there's this tendency some right wingers have to just call anyone on the left a socialist, which is not how that works. There are reasonable, well-informed people on the left who they believe in things like the government having a role in providing services or having some sort of wealth redistribution in the country to ensure a minimum standard of living. I disagree with that. But that's not insane or crazy, right? Things like public health care, expand and social safety net, maybe even subsidized housing. I wouldn't call that radical socialism. Maybe that's a sign of the over to window shifting. But on Twitter, it really does illustrate how far left some of these progressives are. We're talking actual insane policies like people who don't know how money works. They think personal property in general is evil. Landlords are the devil. Those types of people, which in my mind is just a whole step further than your average leftist. So we have some examples of ridiculous statements here made by actual politicians. And the amount of engagement, by the way, these posts have is so concerning. It makes me weep for the potential future of many countries. It's terrifying to be honest. This isn't a joke. These ideas are gaining a lot of traction. Very quickly, they're just growing amongst, I think, the youth in particular, which are going to be the major voting basis. I would be very concerned for almost every Western country right now. Exactly. That's how I feel. And we have this from Ilana Mar. She says, I guess in reference to a pandemic relief package, she says any relief package must make cash assistance universal and monthly. So UBI, halt foreclosures and evictions, freeze all deportations, what that has to do with the pandemic. I don't know why having more people in the country would help. They just like to intertwine all these things all the time. Cancel student debt. And what that has to do with this particular issue. She's not saying like, let's refinance that. Let's talk about some forgiveness, pan. Let's just, no cancel it. Pay for small business losses. Bela worker is not corporations. All right. She also put out another post saying, here's what we need to make universal as a start health care. Okay. This is becoming a very common talking point in the Democratic Party. School meals, vote by mail. And this is where she really displays how much further left than even someone like Joe Biden is housing. She wants universal housing. Okay. This is something that not even somewhere like Canada, which is a pretty left wing country has a guaranteed housing. It's not a thing. No, no, no, no. I mean, to me, everything in that list, the next, the last one is basic income. Yeah. Everything in that list is more or less, except for male, a vote by male, which should never be a thing ever. Yeah, I agree. Everything there can be universally more or less guaranteed through capitalism. That's the way I see it. The best way to ensure that those things are distributed most evenly is through capitalism. We've seen it tried other ways before. And historically, there's only one answer. There's only one answer to that. Right. And I think what these people don't understand is that saying something is a guaranteed right doesn't actually will it into existence or I don't know widespread existence, much less. Right. And this goes back to the positive versus negative rights, right? Right. And we see that in Europe, socialist love to talk about positive rights, which are rights that you need to be given. We're saying healthcare is the right, well, that necessitates someone be there to give you healthcare, saying housing is a right necessitates someone be there to build you a house. Conservatives in the US in general, they tend to favor more negative rights, i.e. freedom of speech, freedom of religion, where you have the freedom to do something. Yeah. The only way that that can be violated is if someone imposes themselves upon you. That's not something that you require another body to give you. Right. And the way I look at it is if you are stranded on a desert island, are your rights being denied? If you think no, then you may be geared toward more a negative rights. And if you think, yes, my right to food, health care, water is being denied, then you are wrong. That's how I was going to say that. How I would say that. I was going to say delusional, but I both work and we see the so Ilana Mar clearly believes in the positive rights issue and the same with basic income. And then you know, you talk about and I agree that the best way to ensure widespread housing and just in general lower poverty levels, higher standard living is through capitalism. We see that as capitalism has been embraced. People have been lifted out of poverty. It's amazing. But they want people who don't want to work to be covered. And that's why they talk about things like basic income we saw online. There was a viral photo of an Antifa protester or she looked like one saying abolished work. AOC in the Green New Deal wanted to have payments for people who refuse to work. Ridiculous. Ilana Mar, she also recently put out suspend and then she crossed that out cancel rent and mortgages, a settlement which Bernie Sanders himself also echoed saying, we need to cancel rent and cancel mortgages for the duration of this crisis. You know what I'm seeing a lot lately? Just a bitterness toward landlords. Absolutely. Which is so strange because that's something that like that's actual Marxist theory. Yeah. These people do not understand and I see them calling landlords leeches. It's like you are demanding a free place to live. Absolutely. Yeah. It doesn't make any sense to me. And especially when they want almost everybody to live in cities, they're always arguing, oh, you should live in an urban environment because your carbon footprint will be reduced. Yeah. It's like, okay, well, that will put an increased demand on the real estate. And that means you need people with a large amount of capital because it's so expensive to rent out places to this thing. And the only other alternative is to nationalize. But they want to do that. They want to nationalize housing. That's the national. Yeah, of course, which is literally communism. Yeah. And what's crazy is that I don't think they understand like when you make it so hard to do something like be a landlord or own property, no one's going to be developing new housing, right? And that leads to housing shortages. We see this in places like San Francisco where they've made it nearly impossible to build and develop that leads to housing shortages. Property. I know I once got in trouble on social media for referring to healthcare and higher education as commodities. And someone was like, they're not commodities. They're rights. It's like, well, you can call them whatever you want, but that doesn't mean that supply and demand doesn't apply to them. Right. Right. They're still commodities and just saying we're not going to have rent. Like ever, I don't think they've thought this. Yeah. True. And also just the threat of nationalizing private property like that of Americans living in America, I think is I mean, just threatening to steal people's property. Yeah. That's very concerning. It's not just going to be housing like houses are expensive. The reason why houses cost so much is because there's a lot of labor that goes into building them. Yeah. When you try to nationalize it, like the money has to come from someone. What's your chain? Yeah, there's a whole chain like construction, appliances, it all gets affected. I don't think these people have thought this through speaking of people not having thought this through. They have AOC can't have a segment on dumb socialist stuff without her. She says, this is in response to someone wondering why the stock market is doing so well. Allegedly, it's actually it's been up and down in the toilet. So I think this is a false depiction of what's happening. How's the stock market fine when everything else you know definitely isn't. She said, and this is funny, hint, it starts with a C and ends with apitalism, AKA. This is what happens when Wall Street captures Congress and writes themselves bailout check after bailout check as working people die. Okay, capitalism, government bailouts. Different things. Different things, right? And people were pointing that out. Like you've said this is capitalism's fault. Meanwhile, you talk about Wall Street capturing Congress. That's not capitalism. And actually, if this were a nationalized system like she wants, Congress would be continually bailing out these companies, regardless of whether they make money or not. That's what nationalized systems have. You have no choice but to bailout companies when they don't do well. So this doesn't make any sense. That's a good point. Yeah. I mean, because to me, I do agree that we should not be, especially we saw in the 2008 crisis bailing out these companies that got them into the whole problem in the first place. I agree. It's absolutely ridiculous. So on that point, we agree. But of course, conflating it to capitalism is ridiculous, especially. And I think this it's also important to know that the reason why these bailouts are even necessary is because of government mandated closures. So it's actually even it's different from 2008 because 2008 is not like anyone where it's actually even 2008. It was government mandated subprime mortgages. But like this, this wasn't Wall Street behaving badly. This was the government saying you cannot operate. And I've seen people like blame capitalism on the current, I think it's a full fledged recession going into depression right now. It's like, this is happening because of the government, right? Let's let's all be clear. Goodness. And we're going to finish off the segment with something from Jen Geuger, our good friend. He says, if we had a Democrat with balls when we take over, they'd cut off funding to red states and make them beg for their handout. Almost all of them are welfare queens who live off the blue states, Republicans run state, Republican run states are on average miserable failures who take money from the federal government. So apparently, Yeah, would you imagine that? Well, what's funny is that people were calling him sexist and a misogynist and racist because this even progresses because does someone taking money from the federal government make them a welfare queen? I'm pretty sure that's not the progressive message, right? I'm pretty sure the progressive message is that this wealth should be redistributed. So it's interesting. He sounds kind of kind of like an elitist trying to protect his own money there and not give it to other people. But and this is also just wrong. Some people have pointed out, namely Sean from actual justice warrior YouTube channel that I really recommend you check out, a lot of the money that goes to these blue states who receive more and federal funding than they give goes to things like defense. A lot of military bases exist on, you know, in the states, but also things like public universities, which if you're in favor of cutting funding to them, I mean, I support that. But yeah, it's not exactly an accurate or honest depiction of what's happening. Have you noticed that's like, I mean, Twitter is overwhelmingly left leaning. It's I try to stay away from Twitter as much as I can. Smart. Smart. Yeah. My job means that I need to be on Twitter. Yeah, I've noticed that. I've also noticed because I follow everybody in the right window, I get a lot of that as well. So there's it's it's it's a definite hole for echo chambers, right? You're going to get tons of echo chambers on Twitter. I think Twitter wants to encourage left wing authoritative echo chambers more than anything else. But definitely stay off Twitter is what I was saying. Yeah, I'm trying to the way I'm trying to calm myself down after reading all these things is that these people don't represent the majority. Like, you know, the average person out there is not saying, yeah, let's just cancel rent, cancel mortgages, universal basic income. These are niche views, but that doesn't mean that they're not gaining popularity, especially when we look at people like, you know, on Omar, AOC, Bernie Sanders, these are elected officials. So this is definitely something that needs to be addressed. We can't be complacent in thinking that they're just a bunch of crazies. I mean, they are, but they're crazies with power. And I think that's pretty much all we have to say for now. If you enjoyed this episode, please remember to like, share, subscribe, help us out a ton.
