Plus we've got the root beer T-shirts from the root beer cartoon. All that and more at theovonsstore.com. Oh baby. Oh dang look at the baby. It's so tiny. It's so tiny. God I remember that song. Remember that from church. Oh look at the baby. It's so tiny. It's so tiny. Dude I one time I went over to this. I don't know if it was Japanese or Chinese or or it was some knees. That's all I'm gonna say. It was some knees. It was Asian. It was you know what I'm saying? You could damn you could throw a pot of rice in this church and hit an Asian. They probably had unlimited Asians in there. You know it looked like a. It looked like a um. It looked like a kind of an Asiany Asiany Asian. Asian thing spot place Asian. It was Asian in there and uh. And I remember the first time I'd ever heard a batch of Asians like that sing a um church hymn. You know I think they were I don't know if they were first generation or not or I'm not sure what generation they were. They were some of them had the the beat you know the little some Asian people though if they get real old they get that catfish hair coming out of them. And you could get you know you put a damn worm in front of them one of them they'll damn you know they'll jump right out their damn kimono. They'll jump right out their damn church pajamas you know what I'm saying they don't you put a spinner bait or something you throw a chicken liver in front of a you know you got them catfish Asians baby they'll lurch. They'll lurch they got that you know they got that last bit of karate left in them and you know because it you know a lot of humans as they get older they you cross with an animal at a certain point a lot of humans cross with an animal and for a lot of Asian for a lot of Asian that's catfish you see that got you know but yeah I'd never been to a church before where I had seen um Asian za multiple Asian doing uh singing church hymns and it was pretty cool man it just shows you that that everybody can sing you know and that there's a that everybody no matter what ethnicity or culture that they all can sing uh songs of faith and have you know and be excited and stuff like that and be at church I remember I can't I can't remember the song now but it was like uh do you see the baby do you see the baby and they had a big screen in there and they have a picture of a uh you know the three wise men going to get uh Jesus Christ out of the sand castle so anyway what I'm trying to tell you is happy mother's day I want to say that out there to every type of mother every every mother there's a lot of you there's a lot of you listening right now when you're a mother you got something you know there's no one that's how I mean that's God's peephole baby that's how God looks out into the war through a mother that I mean you are the you are the liaison between you know you're the on ramp between the lord and earth you got that on ramp you got that thoroughfare you know you got that you know you got that yum tona lonia and that's how God but God that's how God serves him that's how he serves the world you know you're a woman's body a woman's vaiin ye however they say it out there in some of these other continents the vaiin ye that's how the you know that's how that that that that that that's how the lord start you know that's how he just puts people on earth that's God's last hand that's his last that's his that's how he reaches out into the world through a woman through a mother that's really fascinating if I told you there was a portal right say I come up to you you're sitting somewhere you having a sandwich or something you having a little cut a meat cut a uh cheese you know you're having to cut a meat cut a cheese two breads you know what it is a sandwich say you're having that you're sitting on a little riverbank or something I come up to you I say buddy um I'm going to tell you where there's a portal where you can go into another realm you'd be you'd be there in a heartbeat well that's what that's what a mother there mother that's the only way the only way to get from the brain of the of God of the of the powers that be a of mother nature and father time the only portal is through a dang woman a mother or this bitch as some people call her I don't you know I don't say that but anyway I just want to yeah I want to wish everybody a happy mother's day you know um you know sometimes I think that uh people are just ideas they're like like what if God had an idea right and I say God in the a theory in the you can whatever God you want it can be everybody you I have my you you can have your own God um but I think of people sometimes as like an idea of God like say you have an idea right an idea kind of comes in it comes into like it comes out of kind of nowhere right like if you have an idea in your head it comes out of nowhere and some some ideas there they do they they stick around they they turn into something you know some ideas they make a difference they some ideas really get turned into something and can adjust the world can um can change things can adjust a fan can adjust something small or as big as the whole world you know ideas they can you don't know how big an idea can be or how far an idea can go right if we have an idea so sometimes I think that humans they're just ideas of God really you know it's like we show up in existence we have a purpose sometimes sometimes we don't sometimes we evaporate and disappear early you know sometimes we stay around for a long time sometimes we change our environment uh and sometimes we we we can change the world you know so so I don't know if this is making sense but I feel like life it's like being a lot it's like we're almost like an idea of God like if we have an idea it comes into fruition we do things with it some of them are really helpful some of them kind of come and go but if God it God when God has an idea that's us that's a person we're his idea we're like ideas of God we come in the life we me and or some sometimes we have an effect on things sometimes we don't and uh and there we go so not sure if that makes sense but um that's something that's just been going on in my head I'm grateful to be here with you today um I'm grateful to be thinking about mothers I'm grateful to be thinking about mothers I got to see my own mother last weekend in Phoenix Arizona she came out there and and we had a nice time you know it's been a long journey with my own mother getting to know her and uh since we didn't have a connection when I was young get into have a connection as adults um you know I was a little bit nervous about my mother and I was a little bit you know I talk a lot about that I'm not going to go into that right now but it was also going to get to see her um we've got to do the largest show we'd ever done at the Arizona uh financial center dang bro dang duh dude warm up the Asians baby because I'll sing about that oh the baby is here oh look at him um that was magical I want to thank everybody for coming out to that it's a different type of energy man you're out there on the stage and you feel little god I feel so little out there in a club I feel normal size regular size 6 foot 182 one arm a little bit shorter than the other neither arm that long is neither long medium arms it's nothing you'd notice but if you know you know um what was I talking about uh oh in that big in that in that vast of a space I feel like I think I almost feel like a bird could come down and just pick me up off the stage you know it's almost like you feel like the mouse like you know somebody sees a mouse they shine a light on it and that's what it's like in there because it's big it's dark there's a light on you and I'm like man a big bird's gonna come and damn get me mm god I don't want that mm I don't want some big dirty bird picking me up but uh but that was incredible just thank you guys for just being a part of my life for wanting to come and see me wanting to uh wanting to let me see you um you know or just I'm just glad we all get to spend our time together and it's just been really it's been cool and I know a lot of people they want to get to interact more you know and we do what we can but I just want to thank everybody for coming out we did one show that was in a circle and that's damn confusing I mean it's like damn bro the whole time I'm feeling like I'm performing and asking people for directions you know and nobody knows what I mean it's just it was in the round at the celebrity theater and this place looked like uh it looked like a white castle but like the like the the white castle like where you know where white lived or whatever you know it looked like the last white castle but like the biggest greatest white castle it looked like a ceo where the ceo of white castle would live this place is in a just in a big parking lot and there's just a damn castle in it but it's just a low castle it's just like a short castle it's a low castle just damn short castling so if you got a you know this castle it's like a you know short castle you're like damn what is this but thank you I had never done a thing in the circle like that so it's damn I'm damn dizzy you know halfway through the jokes I got a hold on the stool or something it reminded me of the gravitron you know when you go to the fair as a child you know where I lived you'd go to the fair and uh and you get on the gravitron and we'd go over there a day early for 50 cents they let you get on the ride and you were experimental you didn't realize it you were a damn lab rat they were testing to make sure this shit worked and make sure there was no lice on the equipment or whatever because that goddamn boy you get on one wrong ride you itch for a month cuz I mean I swear to god I have one but he had two nipples he itch one of them bitches right off bro that's how bad he got all body lice he's down a one damn nipple cuz cuz the lice they they need a place to meet up at on the body you know they're just like they're just like a group of white people at a um music festival they every now and then they got to meet up somewhere and check on everybody where's ronda how's Ricky oh damn where's Donna oh well Tammy and them left they left they're gone so uh lice are like that they want a place to meet up and god forbid it because it's your wiener or uh or something like that or inner wiener that couter that in that i doe baby that that that in wiener yeah you know what oh they all got that in wiener don't try hey lady let me say that in wiener oh mama got that in wiener oh oh oh oh oh welcome to the world to the baby we're happy that you're here i can't remember that Asian church yeah but thank god they met up on his nipple dog and ate that bitch because you get them body lice but um anyway what i'm trying to tell you guys is oh yeah it was like the damn gravitron like the shape of the place and the gravitron you'd get over there a day early to the uh to the parish fair the county fair and you pay 50 cents and let you get on the ride and the gravitron you laid back against the wall and the whole thing would spin the damn thing was spinning and it used all the power in the community damn your mom's blender would damn shut down seven blocks away so this bitch could spin and it was you could hear your you know the dad your dad works at the factory that bitch shut down everybody's having power outages and right there in the middle of the fairgrounds the gravitron is spinning and then you can't even it you get pushed against the side it's so much inside you can't close your mouth or eyes you're just like yeah i'm having fun and then the guy right we're running it he'd be in the middle and he he was always this rock and roll dude and you'd be like do you want a rock and one person you could bear he does the centrifugal force was so strong you could barely get your arm up a little bit like and then he'd damn that guy would show you his damn win or every time that guy was a damn he was just a visual pedophile that guy he'd show you that sprout that body branch homey you know what i'm talking about that nut snake baby that wiener who damn this and you couldn't you couldn't close your eyes or anything everybody's mouth and eyes were just wide open because you were spinning on the gravitron and he just he you know he didn't do anything but he'd show you that bitch so i don't know what we're talking about happy mother's day that's what we're trying to say here and we're grateful to a lot of beautiful mothers out there we we love you moms and um and thank you for giving us this life whatever our life is now the tough part is when you're not enjoying your life you know to then still find that gratitude to your mother but you know there's no there's i don't know when it happened in time that we started to think that life while it is extremely unique right it's extremely unique it's it's so rare you know Neil deGrasse was on here and he was talking about the rarity that you exist the odds that you exist i mean you may not you may you may hate math but you are math you were a equa you are a carry the one to carry the one million and there the odds that we that you that are that any one of us exists they're astronomical or astronomical but somewhere along the lines we you know we started to think i guess that life was supposed to be a comfort a comfortable thing and i don't know when that happened i think that happened for me too you know and maybe some of that is just an american societal idea since we live in a and and have lived historically in one of the more comfortable countries you know where we've had a lot of um blessings and gifts you know we've had a lot of we've had a lot of cash and prizes we've had a lot of you know we have water we have roofs we have uh food you know we have our needs met that we started to just think that life was is supposed to be a comfortable journey but if you look out through time and it is not it's never really been that people have battled plagues lightning hmm what else AIDS flash flooding and dangerous animals baby all of that anyway i get in my head sometimes that it's this calm it's got it's supposed to be this comfortable thing as opposed to that it's supposed to be this journey it's supposed to be this experience it's uh that doesn't really have any guarantees you know and i wish i could look at life more that way because i think i wouldn't uh i might have i might i wouldn't be i'd probably find less disappointment and things if i looked at life more as like okay here i am on this journey as opposed to why isn't my life going a certain way it'd be more like life it was never promised to go a certain way it's just life you know it's just like an idea it comes along it could anything can happen to it so i'm a little all over the place uh but i'll sit and tell you my story shine on me and i will find a song i was singing just for you and i've been moving way too fast on a runaway train with a heavy load of my and these love and i didn't know um yeah good to be here thank you for being a part of my life thank you for uh blessing me with your time today and we are out here and we are alive and this is life this is what it is you know if i can accept life on what it is where it's at then uh i'm in a much i'm in a much better space usually you know if i have to if i show up with too many expectations then i'm gonna man i'm always gonna be uh disappointed you know i'm always going to be disappointed but if i can get myself if i can get myself to be like okay let's see what's gonna happen today let's see how it goes oh it's going good oh it's going bad it's not really going good or bad it's just going but when i start thinking too much it's going like this it's going like that i need it to go like it's like um um then i'm almost too attached to it you know whereas if i can sit back and just watch life kind of happen and not overreact to it just recognize it's always good that's the thing life hadn't been tricking anybody life's got two hands bro and it'll give you some bird seed with one and and it'll punch a damn it'll punch you in the fucking neck with the other that's life life will hand you a couple little uh butter scotch's bro with with one hand and then while you sucking on them hips hit you with the other hand that's life life is always done that it's that butter scotch freaking bad boy son it's uh james j brad odderscotch that thing it'll punch you while you freaking enjoying some sugar but if i so at a certain point i got to know that i got to know hey this is what life does but if i'm a so attached to it then i'm gonna do then i'm gonna be riding like that too if i put my saddle on every moment but if i can just kind of sit in the middle and know it's gonna be high it's gonna be low but i'm gonna ride a bra i'm a rider then i don't get caught on the waves and the crevasses i'm just chilling in the boat man yeah it's gonna be tough

child it's a good place to be a mom um there's a strong sense of community over there and uh i'm sure you will like it it's a great place to have an imagination and i'm thankful to that place uh for just giving me a tapestry to be on as uh as i passed through time here yeah i don't know we had a stray animal i mean i got bit by you know i mean damn i got bit by so many fucking dogs god them

you want to hear kid rock blasting in the background while you do it you got to go to michigan buddy and enjoy yourself homework no um but anyways i just got pulled in a little early uh to this you know program that i'm participating in and i just wanted to touch base i was listening to you you know on my drive-in this morning and recently you've just been talking a lot about like taking time for yourself like you know prioritizing like life moves real quickly and um you know that that's that's true and uh i recently made the decision to um you know take some time off for myself and and get some therapy and some medication to kind of battle the dark arts in my heart in my soul in my mind uh you know um we're out here man we're doing it and you know i'm a career person i'm a mom i'm a wife you know i got a lot of responsibility but you know at the end of the day i had to make the decision to uh help myself you know uh because what's the cost if you don't right so amen daniel thank you for the call and happy mother's day to you um and yeah i'm uh you know mothers are the real they're the real worst they they're the you know mother they get it all they get they're they're you know it's a lot of they're the toll booth they're the on ramp it's a lot of responsibility you're running around with a damn portal between the heavens and existence and the world yeah this i'm sure it is stressful dear god i can't even make it through a damn toll booth if i don't have the change right i fucking lose my shit so to be carrying a you know a portal to be in everything that just get you you're like that you're the greyhound station of the lord and you know how much things get left at a greyhound all kind of distant that and old jacket somebody left a damn uh uh oven mid over there and half a milk dude i saw a sister drinking a can of damn similac one time calling somebody a homo on the phone once at philadelphia over there by the bust by the greyhound so it's all kind of shit you know and when we're being a mom being all that there's a lot coming at you you're uh you're the you're the nucleus really of the family really in a lot of ways a lot passing through you and there's a lot that's been going on in history you know i think so many things happened over the past centuries wars and battles and love and loss and only now in the present society really are we really at a place where we've come up kind of for air where all of our needs are kind of met where we can look at our emotions see what's going on how we feel what's happening and it makes perfect sense to take time and clean your mirror so i'm proud of you yeah look at even nascar they put them dude they do nine laps and pull in bitches in the shop and those are the most greatest cars on earth so it makes sense that we take time and take care of ourselves it makes sense that we find ways to be happy and take care of ourselves so i'm proud of you i don't think there's anything uh yeah look this is your time it's mother this mother's week is your time so yeah you take care of yourself take all the time that you need um yeah it's important we have to take care what yeah if you don't have
