    "text": " Today, the Democrats have a redo on their spending bill as the US posts the weakest economic growth since the pandemic. Also, the left really, really, really wants to indoctrinate your children into being transgender. You're not going to believe the latest. We've got all that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Horrifying. Hi, welcome to the News & Why It Matters. I'm Sarah Gonzalez and it is Thursday, which means the boys are back in town. We've of course got your favorites and mine too. Oh, you're still? Mine too. You just say that to all the boys. Super dear Pat Gray, really? Yeah, be sent through the Tuesday guys. My favorite contributors. Oh, we don't contribute anything. No, that's what she said. That's interesting. That's interesting. That's interesting. Your hosts, not contributors. All of this just hurts. That's what I'd say about it. It hurts me. Well, we're off to a great start here at the News & Why It Matters. So, Joe Biden, you know, they've gone, the Democrats have gone back and forth for months now with their Build Back Better bill and the $3.5 trillion human infrastructure plan. And after all of that, back and forth, we saw Joe Manchin, we saw Kirsten Sinema kind of say, hey, guys, this is actually, I think they're the only two sane people left in the party. And that's not to say that they couldn't become insane later. But as of right now, maybe the only two sane people left in the party, just to stop and say, we probably should not be spending this much money on this much junk. So the Democrats have finally debuted, debuted an updated version of their Build Back Better spending plan. And they've scaled it back from the $3.5 trillion to a $1.75 trillion bill, which is, I mean, that's way better. Obviously, we can afford $1.75 trillion. Everyone has that just laying around on their wallets. Yeah, I mean, that's pocket change to the United States. So this one focuses on care for families. They say addressing the climate crisis, expanding access to health care, which I'm sure has something to do with letting women kill their babies on demand, lowering costs for the middle class and tax reforms. They say it's dropping, what was previously in the other one, paid family leave. It's keeping universal preschool as well as childcare subsidies. It expands affordable housing. And I should use air quotes for that, affordable housing and focuses on climate change policies expands the social safety net. So the 3.5 trillion was not going to fly. They're going to see what they can do with the 1.75 modified proposal, but they'll obviously need full participation from the Democrats in order to pass in the House and in the Senate. So what, you know, part of me is like, that's great. It's not the 3.5 trillion anymore. And then I'm like, we still don't have the money. So we're still screwed. That's kind of my summary here. Luckily, they did cut my favorite part of the human infrastructure plan, which was the Matrix. They were just going to put us in the will eventually just be running the entire society off the energy of humans and pods. That's the best part of human infrastructure. But that's right around the corner. Don't worry. Yeah, I was going to say I was kind of looking forward to the part of it. Yeah, it does seem better than this. It's an interesting change. I mean, it does show that they're going to supposedly cut the bill. What does that mean? There are a couple of the programs that they're removing, like the family leave thing. There's a couple pieces of it being removed that are actually good news in my mind. The cost is kind of, it doesn't really matter. I mean, you know, we don't have money. It's money we don't have. And like the way that they're cutting this from 3.5 trillion to 1.75 trillion is taking things that they had planned for 10 years of spending and acting as if they're only going to do it for one year. They did this with us, one of the child tax credits, for example. So they'll say, well, we're going to extend that for one year. Now, we all know what's going to happen at the end of the year in the middle of an election. Is it going to be extended? Of course, it's going to be extended. So all of this money is actually being spent. It's just going to be it's just accounting tricks to make it make that big number come down. You know, the Democrats wanted to please their progressive left by giving a big number. Instead, the number comes down. So Joe Manchin can go back to West Virginia and say, look, I got that bill cut in half. I am a sensible moderate Democrat. In reality, like the structure of this is what's really important, not the money. The money's really bad, but the structure is really much worse. And that structure, the vast majority of it is there. So so soon as not even there's no good news. So it's like there's bad. And then there's also worse. Yes, there's a congratulations. It's definitely not good news. I mean, it's better news than Bernie Sanders pipe dream, right? It's not quite that. But it is very bad. We don't have the money to do it, especially off of just spending $7 trillion on COVID. We really don't have the money. Well, whoa, whoa, whoa, hold on. Hold on a second. Pat, I want to get your thoughts, but I would just like to refute something that's too said because I just heard from Joe Biden. Thank you. I just heard from Joe Biden today that this is fully paid for. Let's listen. Someone has to say it. Let's listen to Joe Biden today explaining this is totally fiscally responsible because it's all paid for watch. Today, I'm pleased to announce it after after months of tough and thoughtful negotiations. I think we have an historic, I know we have a historic economic framework. I know. It's a framework that will create millions of jobs, grow the economy, invest in our nation and our people. Turn the climate crisis into an opportunity and put us on a path not only to compete, but to win the economic competition for the 21st century against China and every other major country in the world. Right. It's fiscally responsible. It's fully paid for. No, it's fully paid for. You heard it. You heard it right there. It actually costs zero dollars. The 1.75 that you see is just an illusion, Pat. Right. It's going to cost zero dollars. He keeps making the okay, likes of primacy sign. Did you ever notice that? He didn't do it there, but he's done it multiple times during this discussion. What? I don't know why CNN hasn't called him out on the white supremacy side, but multiple times. Anyway, it's going to cost zero. And so that's really great. I don't know what you guys are complaining about. We all knew Joe Manchin wasn't going to hold the line on this, right? I mean, he made a nice pretend effort. He stomped his foot and told him he wasn't going to go for three and a half trillion and wouldn't go for anything more than one and a half. And now he's compromising at 1.75 because he had dinner with him in Delaware the other day. So everything's fine at his house, at his home. So you knew the minute he goes to his home, he's going to come back agreeing with it. It's expensive to do that. I will say that. Yeah, it's an expensive dinner right there. 1.75 trillion is what it's costing us. Yes. So yeah. So I don't know, maybe Kirsten's cinema will hold out, but I doubt it. Yeah, they don't have an on record either. One of them actually agreeing to this yet, though, but it looks like it does is in it looks like he's. I always said, well, anytime we discuss all of this and it's mansion is the only holdout and it's like when Joe Manchin is the only thing between saving the Republic and the Republic crumbling into ashes, it like that does not make me feel very comforted. Joe Manchin will not save you. He never saves you. He always has a chance to be the deciding boat and never is. He just always somehow comes or there's always something that gets some to me. And it may look like he was really going to hold the line this time. He's written op-eds about it. It's not even just like comments and passing. He's written op-eds in major publications saying he wasn't going to do this and he's doing it anyway because he always does this. This is Joe Manchin is and West Virginia, you keep doing this to the rest of the country. Thank you. Over and over and over and over again, you keep putting this guy back in our faces and he keeps screwing us over and over and over and over again. And the way they say they're going to pay for this, not fiscally responsible, they say they're going to pay for it with this ridiculous corporate tax, which is going to make, as Biden said in this speech, 55 companies paid zero dollars in income tax a number that is based on a liberal think tanks study. And guess how many of the tax returns are these companies this liberal think tank had? I'm going to say zero. They don't have any of their tax returns. They're guessing based on public information. They don't even have it. And this is all stuff on, you know, like it's based on deductions for things like employee salaries and research and development. It's like, if you make a billion dollars, but you spend a billion dollars on research and development, like every other business in the world, you would have no profit. That's how that works. It even included in that are things like the green energy tax credits that they fought for. Right? Like you're saying they create a green energy tax credit, then a company takes advantage of it. And then they say more.pan taxes. What's wrong with these companies? You made the laws. Yeah. They're just scamming the American people as usual. So let me on that note, talking about taxes and the tax reform that the Democrats want. Joe Biden did mention, as you said in his speech, he did mention a little bit about taxes and calling for people, of course, this is what we hear all the time from the Democrats. It's time for people to pay their fair share. But don't worry, Joe Biden's a capitalist. So he says, watch. So I said before, these plans are fiscally responsible. They are fully paid for. They don't add a penny to the deficit. It makes it true. They don't raise taxes on anyone making less than $400,000 a year. In fact, they reduce the deficit. Here's how. I don't want to punish anyone's success. I'm a capitalist. I want everyone to be able, if they want to be a millionaire, to be able to seek their goal. Now I'm asking this. Pay your fair share. Pay your fair share. Oh, he paid your fair share. Oh, I can't. Right now, I didn't catch it. I didn't catch it. I didn't catch it. The first thing virtually nothing. Oh, my gosh. The creepy, like lean into the microphone thing is so weird. He thinks it's amazing. He does. He lets the whisper thing and lean in. It's so weird. Just so irritating. So do we think that there is that he has someone on his team who's like, please stop doing that, and he just does it anyway? I have to believe that's true. Yeah, you have to. He's like, I got it. I got it. Or maybe he just doesn't remember the conversation. That's very possible. Which one is he thinks that's effective. I mean, he thinks that's effective. That's his big exclamation point is his bold and underline. It's his way of really emphasizing something. Of course, what's so strange about this is this has been a liberal talking point for how many decades yet they never can identify what this fair share is. We have the most progressive tax system in the world, basically. You know, Europeans, they do tax more than us overall. But what they do in Europe is they also tax lower and middle class a lot. Right? Like when you're making $60,000 a year in Norway, you're paying 30 and 40 and 50 and 60% tax rates. That's how they can make it. That's why they have a much less progressive system here. What we've done here is we keep the bottom half of all taxpayers paying nothing. No, no, no income tax rates. That number is actually above 50% right now because of COVID. But it's been, as we remember with Mitt Romney saying 47% back in that election, it's about right when it comes to federal income tax. And then we tax, put all the pressure for all the stuff that we want on the wealthier people. And you can justify that morally if you want. I mean, I don't like it. I don't think it's a good system. I think everybody should have a little skin in the game. I think that's smart. But if you're going to do it, you then can't complain about people not paying their fair share. A European system has an argument there, right, where you can say, well, you should be paying more than the people at the lower rates. But that's how percentages work. They're really convenient like that. Like they're really doing a good job in making people who make more money, pay more money. It's just a really simple thing. Our system is incredibly progressive. They want Elon Musk and Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to pay everything. It seems to be their end plan. And that's not going to work. Yeah. Pat, I found it interesting. He said, noticed, he said, I want everyone to be able to, if they want to be able to be a millionaire or billionaire to be able to seek their goal, he didn't actually say I want you to be able to achieve that goal. He's like, I want you to keep working at that and keep giving the government money. But just don't think that you're ever actually going to get there because we're going to take all of your money before you do. I love the lip service. He's paying right now to capitalism. Yeah. And to carrying about the people that he's trying to suck the blood out of. And I'll bet right now he's getting a lot of pushback from the Mark Zuckerbergs of the world. They don't want to pay that kind of tax rate. They don't want to be hit with another 15% billionaire tax. I mean, how is that? How is any of that fair? And then they're going to start taxing them on their unrealized capital gains? That's insanity. That's not even liquid asset. And so if you're going to tax, for instance, just the other day, Elon Musk's net worth went up $32.6 billion in one day. But he didn't see that. That's not in his pocket. That's not in his bank account. That's just what his company is worth and what his stock is now worth. And so in order to pay a tax on that, he'd have to sell that stock. Right? Yeah. I mean, you know, look, it's ridiculous. Now they say they've removed that out of this bill. We'll see if that actually sticks or not. Part of he kind of wants it to be in there just because when Tesla stock goes down, I want our country to write Elon Musk a check for $1 billion. Just just because it would never happen. Well, it would have to be part of this because, and this is like how they manipulate these numbers, right? If you make a big profit one year and you make less another year, we have a lot of laws that let you smooth out those profits so that they're not over over the top. And that's one of the reasons why they keep saying this about the companies. All these things, we as a country pass laws to incentivize companies to do things like research and development. What we say is, hey, we won't take your tax money, but instead do research to grow your company, to grow jobs, to help grow the economy. We tell them we want them to do it. Then they do it and these guys come out on television and bitch about it. It's so infuriating. These are their laws. They pass them for specific reasons. You know, even like the green energy thing, that's not a thing that I want them to be spending money on, but they're giving them money to do that. And then they're acting as if they're ripping off America when they take advantage of the laws. These idiots passed. Yeah. Well, that was when they were still in Congress 100 years ago. They don't remember that. All right, we've got more to come first. We want to thank our sponsor Built Bar. So I mentioned this the other day, but I just I finally tried the blueberry muffin. Have you tried it? No, I haven't seen the blueberry muffin. Okay, I think I still have them in my dressing room. I'll get you some to try it. It's so good. They also just came out with a new puff flavor that's pumpkin paranormal pumpkin just in time for Halloween. But Built Bar is what you need in your life. If you like to snack on stuff and maybe have a sweet tooth, which was your favorite? That's so hard to pick. Probably the coconut puff. Do you tell Cherry Garcia that they're that he's your favorite? Is that what you do? Is that what you do? Sarah, do you tell the other flavors that they're your favorites? No. Is that only a thing she does? But Built Bar is it's really, really delicious. And it's high in protein. It's low in calories. And it doesn't get hurt feelings whenever you have conversations with other people. And you don't know that the other ones are listening. You can go to built.com. If you use promo code News15, you'll save 15% off of your first order. You've got to go get a mix box if you're not sure of the flavor that you want. Go to built.com. Use promo code News15. So we just talked about this spending bill that the Democrats have planned for us. And of course, they want to spend all of this money at the same time that economic growth in the country slowed more than expected in the third quarter to the softest pace of the pandemic recovery period with all of the supply chains. And you know, there are surges of COVID cases, what up north now, which I feel like was kind of like predicted by anyone who like looked at seasonality and how this was going to affect places. But I don't, I mean, Anthony Fauci didn't say it. So who would have guessed? And so gross domestic product expanded at two at a 2% annualized rate following a 6.7% pace in the second quarter. This is from the Commerce Department's preliminary estimate. So we've got all of these great, great economic numbers at the same time that the Democrats want to spend all of this money. And we're seeing inflation. And then of course, consumer goods maker Kimberly Clark plans to raise prices for the second time this year, which you may recognize that brand because it's probably who makes your toilet paper. So you're going to be paid. Look, when I say that the Biden administration just makes things. That's I really mean, the editors hate you. You're really mean. Come on, you couldn't expect me to not go for that joke. No, it's about toilet paper. It was it was legally mandated. It was that's true. It's funny because, you know, first of all, this inflation doesn't seem to be all that transitory. We kept hearing it was going to come and go and everything was going to be fine. And also that it was actually a good thing. It was actually a good thing. And then in the speech today, Biden said, actually, all these new policies are going to help inflation. The multiple trillions of dollars are going to lower inflation. We'll let you work out the math on your own time. And it's paid for. Yeah. But like, it's interesting because we obviously have gone through the last couple of years have been crazy, right? Like with COVID and all the interruptions, some of it, I think really bad, some of it self-inflicted. But we've we've all known that this has been a really rough time. And we really haven't paid the price for it. You know, it's like you look at like in the speech, he talked about how these payments that he's giving to families, they're going to take 50% of kids out of poverty. And like, you know, in some ways, you would say, okay, well, some of that makes sense, right? Like if we just throw money at people constantly, no one's in poverty, right? I guess if we had an up, just got printing money, until we get to that hyper inflation point, everyone's out of poverty. Zimbabwe was getting trillions and trillions of dollars a day, you know? I mean, it was the people were fan, they loved it. They got trillion-dollar bills. But at some point that runs out. And at some point, you have to pay the piper. And the fact that we've gone through and had said $7 trillion plus in spending for COVID, we've gone through that period. We were able to prop up the economy in a lot of these particularly blue states that stayed closed, even when there weren't terrible outbreaks. And then now we're getting to that point where they want to spend trillions of dollars more. You just can't do this forever. And we have not like really had the pain that you would think would be associated with shutting down a country's economy for a year. It's been rough at times and we've all dealt with the terrible consequences. But like, this is the serious thing we've gone through here. When you shut down businesses across the country for a really long period of time, you're going to have some consequences from that. And you can spend your way out of that for a while. When you lose a job, you can borrow on credit cards for a while and maintain your lifestyle. But at some point, you hit those limits. And I mean, it certainly seems like we're there. Well, it blows my mind that the Biden administration fails to recognize that when prices raise, if a company is having to spend more money, they are going to raise their prices. As we you see Kimberly Clark, I mentioned, as you know, they make Kleenex and toilet paper and all those things. But I mean, obviously they're far from the only company who is having to raise their prices to compensate for everything else. And they don't factor that into, especially when they say, even if you believed the lie that no one making under 400,000 would be taxed more would have to pay more money. Yes, they would in all of these types of things. It's been really interesting to be in this inflation thing first person because we make a food product. And so we use a whole bunch of ingredients that have all gone double and triple in cost. And you know, the reason that grocery store CEOs and others are saying, okay, look, by, you know, next spring, things are going to go way up. It's because you eat it for a while. You do eat that cost increase. At least we have up until up until now. And we still are, actually. But eventually we're going to start losing money and we can't stay in business if we lose money. So what you're saying is you're a greedy business owner. A greedy bastard who isn't going to keep doing it at the same price when all my costs have gone up. I can't do that and stay in business. And I think it was Jen Psaki that said that they expect businesses to do just that. Like, why would they do that? It doesn't make any sense for them to raise the price. Well, they have to. They have to. We're going to have to eventually raise the price. I think she didn't she even she it was some insulting remark. She said something like that's absurd and unfair or something. It's like, oh, so it's fair for the company to just what go out of business because they can't maintain their profit margins. Like they don't understand the market at all. Yeah. On a very. I mean, either that either that or they do understand it and they're just purposely doing this to tank everything. True. I think it's a moment to say that I'm very nervous about the future of Pat's family that he went through that whole story without saying kexie cookie dot kiexie dot com. He didn't even mention he just said we are raising. We are having higher costs and not raising prices. We have a company where he doesn't even mention the name of his own company. And that is I mean, that that's what's wrong with the economy. It's people like Pat who go on shows who tell the whole story about their great cookies and then don't say kexie dot com. Well, which actually really do those they have the best cookies ever. That's true. Best cookies ever. But I mean, in all seriousness, that is you are a great example of this. It's like, yeah, like Pat's not Elon Musk, Jeff Bezos. It's just a small business owner. And we're the people that are making the 400,000 a year, a little bit more than that. And getting taxed out of business on that. Right. Right. It's it's outrageous. And then expected also to eat all the costs of the increased cost of doing business. It just doesn't make any sense anymore. I mean, people aren't going to get into business anymore. Right. Right. Right. Well, I mean, Joe Biden, again, says he wants people to try to become a millionaire. Yeah, that means it's going to happen. Come on. No, probably. Yeah, they don't want you to get there. No, it's on your evil. Yeah, it's funny. Well, I mean, unless you're one of them. Yes. Half the party is basically come out and said we don't think billionaires should exist. So I mean, you know, he's trying to walk this line and saying like, I'm not AOC. I'm not Elizabeth Warren. I'm I'm Joe Biden. Remember how you guys liked me when I was I acted like I was moderate? That's what he's trying to walk here by saying by saying the words I am a capitalist means nothing to us because we know he's not but it does mean something to the AOCs of the world. He he's trying to he's trying to distance himself. But I don't think anybody believes it. I don't think the the the people in the middle of this country who actually have worked in a world where capitalism is important to them. It's not important to you when you're a senator, when you're you're a senator and you're if you've been in office since 1972, you know, like it that this stuff doesn't connect to you at all. You're not you're not you're not shipping cookies around. You're not making makeup. You're not doing the things that you know that business owners are doing. You're living in a different world. Right. By the way, that makeup can be found in American Beauty by Sarah.com. That's how you do that. There you go. That's how you do. American Beauty by Sarah.com. No H and Sarah because it's just an extra letter. It's unnecessary. Nobody even pronounces it. All right. We've got more to come. But first a message from our sponsor. There is a new audible original. It is called Bad Republican by Megan McCain. In her debut audio memoir, she of course is the departing co-host of the view, Megan McCain, gives the listener a first hand look into the life of a conservative rebel. You can hear what it's like to grow up as the daughter of John McCain, of course, what it's like to mourn his loss, go behind the scenes of America's most watched daytime talk show. Find out. That's what I want to know. Honestly, I want to know how she didn't lose her ever loving mind. She seems dedicated. She kind of did. I mean, I don't know how you don't end up in the loony bin having to deal with Whoopi Goldberg and Joy Behar. That's how they work. Bullied her. Really badly. So I find out what it's like, you know, listen to her thoughts on things like cancel culture dating, how our country treats new mothers, which I actually she and I had our babies around the same time. And it's been interesting seeing her, you know, hearing her relate to things at the same time that I am relating to them with the new one. You can go beyond TV and your newsfeed go to audible.com slash bad Republican. That is audible.com slash bad Republican. Start listening now. Marlise Davidson, who is the president of Los Alamitos Unified School District Board of Education, was apparently picked up on a microphone during a school board meeting cursing at a parent. Have you guys heard the story? I heard about it. I haven't heard the actual audio. It's so in raging. So this woman, so there was a parent up and speaking at the microphone who raised concerns over the mandates, the mask mandates that were placed on the students. And she also questioned the decision to give the COVID vaccine to children. Okay, so I don't believe an anti-vaxxer, just like, hey, we probably shouldn't give this to children arguing that the risks far outweigh the benefits. And she she accused one member of the education board of criticizing parents as selfish. And as she's speaking, the school board president's like, well, I'll just let you, I don't want to get in trouble again. So I'll just let you listen yourself. If you remember parents parenting on walls at the state Capitol of 2019, in hopes that their voices would be heard, their voices were shamed kind of like Scott just said, we are selfish for being vocal. Scott, we are vocal because we are children's biggest advocates. Okay, choose your own path, Scott, choose your own path. That was very rude to you to say parents are selfish. You say Margaret Snacks. Thank you. Your time's up. Yeah. So that was a FU. Except she said it. Oh my gosh. Yeah, to the parents. So the the president of this board of education just cursing at a parent for expressing her opinion at her own school board meeting. Now she has apologized, of course. After yes, after she was caught on the hot mic, she said, let's see, she said, I reaffirmed that she's sorry. And she said, I reaffirm my commitment to serve our community, dignity and integrity. And I hope they will accept my sincere apology. Guys, this is what these people think of you and your children. Stop sending them. Yeah. Yeah. Amen. Please stop sending them to these hellholes. Please. And or you could do what Southlake has done multiple times and they're trying to do it. I think again in the upcoming election, Southlake in the greater DFW area, a really nice community and they they had problems with their school board. So three of the parents ran against three of the school board members, all of them won. And I think the lowest margin of victory was 70 to 30%. They crushed these people. Yeah. And they're about to do it again. And so they're just re taking their school board from these idiots. Yeah. So there's that or you could get involved with your children's education by homeschooling. Yeah. Because I don't know. The alternative is look at how they boarding think about you to send them off to Mcchickin. Morning school. Yeah. Right. And military school. It's like have they completely forgotten who pays their damn checks? Absolutely. They have. I think they have. Don't care. Yeah. They somehow it's like our lawmakers in Washington. They somehow have it in reverse. But we are somehow the servants to them. Right. And they are not supposed to be the public servants to us. Yeah. When you don't prioritize personal liberty, you set up these situations to happen. I mean, like, you know, these policies are creating a circumstance in which the school board is supposed to sit up there and enforce them. And the people half the parents want them enforced and are pissed off if your kid doesn't show up with a mask and vaccine. And the other half is pissed off because they don't want it. And you're creating the situation where conflict is almost a necessity. And when instead, if you if you emphasize personal liberty, everyone can make a different choice and everyone can go about their own lives. I think that's the better way to go. Although I will say, I think your answer is actually much better than mine, which is get your kids out of these schools if it's all humanly possible. Yeah. You just you can't. This is where we can win on from town to town. And some circumstances, we can win here and there and everywhere and bits and pieces. But like long term, the government being in control of your kids education is a bad idea. Yeah. And it's I mean, because of the way this is set up, because everyone has to pay taxes and it's it's impossible for a lot of people to be able to do it. But we're moving in the right direction on that. And there's some great charities that are starting up to be able to make that easier for particularly conservative parents to be able to get their kids out of here, even if they can't afford it, because it's that important. It's worth it. Yeah. I mean, I would argue maybe that we need both happening at the same time. Yeah. Because we still do need. I mean, the left has been so great at infiltrating school boards and all of these local, you know, places, local levels. And we're seeing the results of this. Yes. Yes. And conservatives, I think are too busy. We're like, I'm too busy working and raising my family. I don't have time to go run for school board, but it's a necessity if we want to take our our cities back even. All right. While we're on the topic of COVID and, you know, masks and vaccines and all that since I have Mr. vaccine here, I wanted to also bring up, I just saw this headline while we were here sitting during break. The CDC said now that the immunocompromised people may receive a fourth dose of the COVID-19 vaccine. Yeah. Finally. Yeah. Well, fourth dose. And do you think a fifth dose is not going to be talked about and approved soon? I just want to know when I mean, this has got to be a record here that just was released in January and they were like, you just need the two shots. And by the way, it's going to prevent right the the virus. And then they were like, right? Well, you may need a booster. By the way, it's not going to prevent it at all. You just have less of your symptoms. Wait, wait. You also may need a fourth shot. In fact, just keep getting shots for the rest of your life. You mean like the flu shot that I get every year? Yeah. Yes. Okay. No, but hold on. But hold on. But it was just brought out in what January released to general public what? But we met March there. And it's now no, hold on. It's now October. Don't let him talk for a shot for and we're on shot for so you cannot compare this to the annual flu shot. Not once per year. This is already loading four into someone's system. Plus the flu shot's not really a vaccine. Right? It's a it's like a guess. Yes. They like guess the strains. Yeah. When do I get to go ahead? Never. Okay. No, look, here's the thing. I won't I won't even bother. I won't even bother. It's your show. I won't even bother going through all of the things that I would say that I would slightly disagree with some of the things you've said. But what I would say is no policy that you, Sarah Gonzalez would implement would prevent me from getting the vaccine. No policy that you would implement would make me get not be able to get it. And that is again goes back to that same point on personal liberty. It's like we can all you should be able to look at this data and say, you know what? I don't like it. And I should be able to look at it and say I do. And then we should be able to do our own freaking thing. Right? And I thought that was America. I thought that's where we were. I mean, again, we're at a point where 80 percent, 80 percent of adults, not are considering the vaccine, not are thinking they might get it someday have already received it 80 percent. That is beyond way beyond what I thought would happen. But what in America 60 65, 80 percent is really good. Well, I mean, when you tell them you're going to mandate it for everyone. Well, but they haven't mandated it yet. Right. And we're at 80 percent already, which is my art. One of my big arguments against a mandate. You don't need it. People got it. When this thing first started, only 34 percent of people said they would be first in line to get it. Okay. There's another 39 percent that said, hey, you know, I'm going to consider it. We'll wait and see what happened. All of those people have gotten it. There was another group that I think it was a 9 percent of people who said, I will only get it if I'm forced. We're up to that level now already. And they're complaining as if no one's taking it. It's like, what do you expect people are going to disagree? And that's okay. You need to be able to sit back and say, look, here's the product that we have. We think it does a good job. Here's why we think it says a good job. Sarah will say, I think it sucks. This is why I'm not going to take it. And then we can all just go about our lives. It's when you try to enforce your views on everybody else and make their decisions for them when you run into these problems and you see these battles at the school boards and you see everybody hating each other. There's no need for it. There is no need for it. Take it if you want it. Don't take it if you don't want it. Yeah. Pat, last word on this. I, you know, the CDC and all of these figureheads over at the federal government, can't imagine why there's vaccine hesitancy. Yeah. And they're like, well, you may need another one. Well, the third one may not have worked. And we're expected to get it now to protect those who are already supposedly protected. Why? Why if you're protected? Why do I have to protect you? I agree with that. It's absolutely. They need double triple protection. I mean, what is the efficacy rate now on Pfizer and Moderna? 67. So you're about six times as likely to get COVID if you're unvaccinated. About 11 times as likely to doubt. But how many people how many vaccinated are getting or having the breakthrough case? It's about one out of every seven as a breakthrough. So what are we calling that a breakthrough or? Well, that's like one out of seven is 14% 14% percent. So 86% of cases are unvaccinated. Huge. No, be berated like this. And they feel like we're murderers, you know, that we're carrying around an active chainsaw and cutting people in half. I mean, if you wanted to make that argument, and I know we got to go to break, but if you wanted to make that argument, I would say, wouldn't you call the people who, and I'm not saying this, but I'm just saying, it wouldn't you then call the people who are vaccinated the murders because they're walking around not knowing that they are spreading it because their symptoms are not severe, right? They're like, Oh, I just have a headache. It's fine. I got vaccinated. I'll go to the grocery store. I'll go to a bridal shower. I'll go to a restaurant. And they're the ones and they're spilling their spike protein all over the tables and stuff. Maybe we don't call protein. Maybe we spike protein away. I'm going to save the term murderer for, I don't know, people committing abortions. I'm going to keep everything else. I agree. I agree. I just said, all right, fine. We're ending the segment. We'll be right back. I'm staying angry. Yes. We're still talking about vaccines here. A new Halloween themed commercial for Twix Candy bars. Oh, you're going to love this. Have you seen it yet? No. I read about it, but I haven't seen it. So it apparently features a transgender child and a nanny. Okay. Okay. I mean his nanny. Well, wait, wait, I need a, okay, I need a flow chart. I'm already confused. Let's go ahead and watch it. You buckled? I'm still wearing my princess dress. Do you want to wear it? I love you. Princess, you look like a girl. Why are you wearing that? She's dressing like this makes me feel good. Is that your nanny? She looks weird. You look weird, your nanny looks weird. You guys are both weird. No, we're just different. We don't wear dresses. Whoa. Whoa. Where is it coming from? What's happening? So we kill him. Oh, we should go. Will he come back? Will he come back? Yeah, probably. Probably. I don't know. I'm going to kill him because he backs asked me. But you know what? He deserved it because he said we were weird. So that's your twix. Hell, I guess. What's weird? Is that bizarre? Oh my gosh. I mean, which again are all acceptable and you would think like reasonable things for kids to, I mean, you don't want to bully people, but like they're like, you're wearing a dress. Why are you wearing a dress? You're a dude. Like these are all normal kids to say. Yes. And that's what Twix doesn't want you to think anymore. Okay, they want to change your opinion. Twix can tell you the cookie in the caramel. I'm ready. You're supposed to immediately think that is wonderful. It's that's a really good choice. Whatever you want to do. Now, can we not call the nanny weird though? First of all, she's she is dressed like a psycho and second of all she just killed a child. Can I not call that person weird? Is that okay to call them weird? I think it is. Like it is. And like, just Twix really think this helps them. That's why I like, I just probably they're woke now, right? It's a junk candy bar that maybe people want to eat for Halloween. Could you just stick to like your brand here? Yeah, no. We did a segment on last night's show about baseball and all the woke stuff that was going on with it. And I went through the coin base statement that they sent to their employees. I don't know if you know the stories from a few months ago, but they basically were noticing whatever company was noticing. Everybody's fighting with each other on George Floyd and all this other stuff. And they just they just let out the statement just like, Hey, here's what we're going to do. If it's about crypto and it's a law, we'll talk about that and we will have a position on that. If it's not just do it at home, like don't do it here. No, we're fighting about social justice here. We we we might even agree on all of this, but we don't know what path we might not agree on how to do it. So therefore, we're going to keep to our mission here. And like, that is a statement that every company should release. You know what? Like, I don't need them. Like, I like, I love companies and we have we do business with a lot of them that say, Hey, we're conservatives and we want to serve, you know, conservatives. I love those companies. They're great. But like, also, I love companies that just don't want anything to do with it. It's just freaking let me serve you a hamburger or a Twix bar or whatever it is. That's the right way to do it. And so many companies are terrified. They feel like they have to please this woke monster when if they're just upfront and honest about it, you're never going to hear a comment about bathroom policy from us because we're not and we don't make bathrooms. So don't expect it. We're not going to represent your views publicly. That's not what we do here and be upfront about it. Well, those companies that you mentioned through, I feel like people can find them at kexie.com. That is a company they want to sell cookies. What? Yes. And they're not looking to what? Well, they're company two with a head. It didn't have an H at the end. I just remember ended with an A. Oh, yeah, yeah. It's a makeup brand. It's American Beauty by Sarah. No H no H no. The H is a waste. Right. Yes. It's just an extra letter. Consonants. Two companies. If you are looking to put your dollars to just give to not even just it's like I want to I mean, you will give it to a conservative company, but just a company who doesn't hate you who is not trying to change your opinion on anything who just you just want to support those companies. And I mean, we may be biased, but I'm just saying. But there's two of them. Right. Right. Right there. All right. We got to take a break. We'll be back. We just started company. All right.
