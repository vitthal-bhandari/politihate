    "text": " politics without the soap opera with unfiltered constitutional conservative true the conservative review with Daniel and welcome back fellow American Patriots and Minutemen standing at the ready to protect our liberties and take back some sort of refuge in this country this is your host Daniel Hurwitz here at CR podcast blaze media on Thursday May 6 another terrific day of broadcasting where we skate to where the puck is headed not to where it's been where we focus on the issues that matter how they matter and what way they matter and what we can do about it that's what sets this show aside from every other allegedly conservative broadcast we are truly independent conservatives just trying to achieve constitutional outcomes to save our country what is left of it what we can salvage we're not here to grandstand and you know folks if that dichotomy were ever brought out more starkly I don't remember it because we're experiencing now when all my colleagues are talking about Bruce Jenner which they won't even call him Bruce a guy who is mentally ill and thinks he's a woman running for governor of California state that we can't do anything with anyway and they're focused on Liz Cheney versus a least a fanic fecal matter or urine I'm sorry for the crude analogy on a position that doesn't matter in a body that no longer matters and we'll get back to that later while I was on radio in Idaho earlier today gunning for their rhino governor talking about COVID fascism there making Idaho a sanctuary talking about our Constitution action network hopefully we're gonna have some team leaders in place in Idaho so definitely sign up there that is what I'm doing taking my audience putting them together to actually do what matters where it matters on the issues that matter to fight for people who will actually fight for us rather than for mental illness so we'll get back to that a little later the whole Bruce Jenner thing and the Liz Cheney fight my thoughts on that but first we have to understand the gravity of what we're still up against on an issue that Republicans will still barely broach that conservative talkers will still barely touch in a meaningful way and that is we still live in a country 14 months into this when we have codified into law a form of guilty until proven innocent but it is sick until proven healthy that is what is essentially codified to varying degrees in every state in nearly every county and I'm here to tell you what we need to do about that but the first thing is to recognize that we need to do something about it indeed that the red states are not well off on this issue and we still have sick until proven healthy in most places that matter first today's sponsor we talked a lot about violence yesterday if we have time we have a lot more news on that but with everyone buying up guns and ammo people forget you need a quality gun belt and a holster those of you who go out to our front site trip with Constitution coach.com understand this our next trip is May 30th you could sign up there there still is some time and space but in order to have a safe and effective carry but also if god forbid you need to draw your weapon in effective quick draw you need a holster that sits securely in the right position we the people holsters has you covered with almost every firearm you could imagine right handed left handed inside the waistband outside the waistband go to wethepeopleholsters.com slash cr and get your american made holster starting at just 40 bucks lifetime guarantee if it doesn't fit perfectly you could send it back and also you get an additional and hold 10 dollars off with offer code cr so again we the people holsters.com slash cr offer code cr don't have your gun sit lonely without a quality holster now folks I saw an image that disturbed me and in observation I don't think anyone else has had there was this story a couple days ago somewhere in Tennessee about a toddler that somehow got caught in a barrel so feet first you know was playing in it and then couldn't get out and they had to take him to the hospital and I think eventually they cut it out so I forget about the story the article it's not even important I just saw an article it's the picture that matters there was a picture of him in the barrel with the barrel situated on the hospital bed and he was in the barrel up to his like neck chin or neck and you could make out a picture like very vaguely there you could see he had his mouth and nose covered with a mask and I was thinking I don't know if this kid is two three years old it wasn't more than three coming in in such duress stuck in a barrel very scared and obviously someone had made him put on a mask so you know there's this notion that somehow I mean this is Tennessee this is Tennessee somehow the mask is over in red states but folks where it matters most is people that are employed in jobs for seven to ten hours school kids seven to eight hours people under trauma in hospitals where we're always like yeah hospitals that's the end you know that's the lowest hanging fruit for their side that's where a mask is most justifiable it's in a hospital no all of them are all the personnel are vaccinated anyone who wanted it for months they're all wearing their PPE it's when you're under the most stress that it makes no sense who comes into the hospital people with medical needs people in pain people that have trouble breathing kids there's stories of people having to go under surgeries with their nose and mouth covered scariest anything we need lawsuits on this we are being treated as sick until proven healthy there is no such power to take away a fundamental right to breathe based on those grounds the entire we seem to forget it's important to preach to the choirs i always say because sometimes we ourselves forget the a lot of you are emailing me which i say to um you know my county commission or a lot of you are speaking out in front of your school boards and this is terrific this is what we need to be doing we also need lawsuits and one of the things we forget is we start arguing on their premise and we forget that quarantine only is someone who is known to have the disease you stay home for ten days and then you're done once you're you you passed but the notion that every healthy person indefinitely could be treated as sick and it's not even sick until proven healthy because even if you would prove you're healthy even if you have a you're vaccinated you had it already and you show them a negative result you still have to wear a mask on an airplane in school in a hospital if not everywhere else or most other places that matter it's very few places where you still don't have to wear a mask in the in the places that supposedly took them off it violates medical privacy bodily integrity ada osha fourth amendment first amendment fourteenth amendment fifth amendment violates due process so the only way this was justified was saying we have a virus that is so prolific and it's also potentially at least unused somewhat unusually deadly and we don't know what what to do we don't have any way to deal with it that is what justified what happened what occurred march of last year i'm not saying it what he i agreed with it but that was the only legal justification here we are fourteen months later when it is literally impossible to overrun the hospitals it is impossible it is less than the flu right now every state the levels are much well under the flu and it's impossible for it to get over the flu much less an unprecedented event because of the number of people vaccinated already had it we have the therapeutics anyone who wants this who wants to be shielded from it has government approved whether we think the vaccines are great or not they're saying it is so you have no leg to stand on yet this is still continuing in every red state and almost every county to a degree that is well beyond where it should be even if it's better than in blue states that is where we need our teams to work even if a lot of you are like the state legislative sessions are already you know waning some are over with and i get that and you know unfortunately we're not going to be up to speed until the special session and the next year's session but all the county governments we need to start passing sanctuary resolutions affirming that the government the state that at least the county government could never implement a mandate on a human being who is healthy until proven that they're sick mind you even if you're sick at this point even if you i mean i'm not saying look if you know you have covid i'm not saying not to stay home i'm just saying it's not so simple that the government has the power because remember that they're arresting you they're violating your freedom of movement it's not so simple that they even have the power to do that quarantine could government quarantine you for a cold no and at this point with anyone vulnerable having had the opportunity to be vaccinated anyone everyone who's an adult has had the opportunity people have had 40 percent have had it there's no way you could even have a problem from this anymore it's not so simple they could even do it if you have it but this is the point we need to really bang away at you cannot implement policies indefinitely predicated on treating people as sick until never proven healthy then again that's another form of this lack of due process we've had for trump supporters while they're innocent even after proven guilty our people are guilty and can never be proven innocent i have an email from maria in a trump plus 50 or so county in west virginia today the school nurse called to tell me my seventh grader would have to stay home quarantine for the second time this year because she sat about six feet away from a child who tested positive my daughter knows the student and she has no symptoms had the rapid test first which was negative then another test which was positive there are only seven students left in my daughter's class this week this is absolutely insane even students who had already had covid have to be quarantined the governor says that he's gonna mask the state until 70 percent of the population are vaccinated just like the blue state governors are saying we only have 45 percent with one dose folks this is happening west virginia most states are continuing with the masking of of the children in school the quarantining of them even after they had it no symptoms this has got to stop we need lawsuits we need lawsuits this is continuing to happen it's demonic where is the focus from the conservative talkers to do what i'm doing to fight in the

at you know going back to these you know red legislatures you know most legislatures we're trying to end mass mandates so one sent me one of our uh perspective leaders in north carolina that evidently they passed a bill in north carolina remember republicans have not quite a super majority but very strong majority is there there is a democrat governor and you know this was supposed to like it was a milk toast bill and and the governor did initially veto parts of it because he felt it went it was too strong even for him but it was basically like get the kids back to school under the guidance of the state health department in other words it had language in there basically codifying into law that citizens and students have to abide by the toolkit they called the toolkit there which includes mass mandates so we have republicans i mean this is how the the overtone window has moved over so much we have republicans who can't categorically speak out against the masking of children in red states or or legislatures that they control how many others are speaking to this how many others many of you have seen the demonic statements made by cdc that should demonstrate that everything they said beforehand is a lie as well new york times reports so we were wondering what are they gonna do how do they balance the cronyism of trying to get people to get the vaccine but keep the tyranny going so one of the ways they're doing that is by moving the goal posts to make the tyranny even stronger and then pulling it back one notch if you're vaccinated so they're now openly saying for the summer that children in camps outdoors need to be double masked while playing sports w h o says it's dangerous which obviously it is but that's what they're saying then they pulled it back new york times as an article vaccinated 12 to 15 year olds may remove their mask outdoors ha ha this is how demonic they are a child for a virus that doesn't affect them this is there are no words to describe this form of sick until proven innocent they'll prove unhealthy which which they never allow you to prove then the cdc director whatever Walensky whatever her name is she said on cnn yesterday i'm not kidding you heavily breathing kids on a soccer field should wear masks and yet you have every one of these dirtbag governors that are republicans Idaho Wyoming North Dakota um Indiana West Virginia certainly Ohio Alabama just to name a few still legitimizing everything cdc says and that is still codified in state policies county state health boards this is why we need we need a sanctuary resolution and I will help draft it for our team leaders this is what we're going to push in as many counties as we can in as many states for the county commission to adopt a sanctuary a statement of principles that people have the right to breathe to move freely to open their businesses unrestricted you're healthy until proven sick there's due process rights and to ban all of this stuff on children in school school boards this is what we need to adopt it's that simple it is that simple that's the thing we need that principle to bar all of this stuff and to affirm the right of every individual to maintain their inalienable right to self-determination to make their own health care decisions whether it's vaccination testing physical or mental examinations medical treatments medical devices including masks participating in tracking and tracing programs sharing personal or medical information and data it must be optional that needs to be affirmed in every county it is shocking that 14 months into this sadistic insane illogical nutty craziness from cdc we still have this going on but then again we don't even have a Republican party or a conservative movement that can affirm natural law and sanity you know in Kansas the legislature the state senate failed by one vote to override the democrat governor's veto on a bill I think this was the transgender athlete stuff it was one of those so yes there is a democrat governor but the republicans have the votes to override but because we do not have a movement to focus on who these people are this is what we get saddled with is what we get saddled with in every state truly disgusting truly truly disgusting you know even in Sweden it's funny we talked a lot about Sweden recently they were always extremely socially licentious but even they are more logical than we are one of Sweden's largest hospitals just suspended the use of hormone blockers in children and yet we cannot get this bill passed in south dakota and other states with republicans most other states we cannot get this bill passed what Sweden's largest hospital university hospital voluntarily discovered this is where we are and then we're at a point where hormone blockers for children are safe experimental mr and a that failed to work and cause damage in animals when it was tried last decade are forced upon people that don't even have a risk for the virus but it's not safe to take cheap therapeutics that have worked for years there's a lot of news on ivermectin i don't know if you guys have seen this but this is from fox 32 in chicago another court case after a short but tense legal battle edward elmer's hospital has agreed to allow an outside doctor to administer ivermectin to one of one of its patients she looks calm relax she looks comfortable so this is all i could tell you right now said desi fight who has been fighting for her mother 68 year old nerji fight to receive ivermectin she was put on a ventilator on april 28th with her condition not improving and they had nothing else the dot the the hostel offered nothing else i know dr p or cori filed a deposition in that case an expert witness and the judge gave an order and said you have nothing else to offer despite the judges orders the hospital still refused to administer it and finally they agreed to allow an outside doctor to administer the first dose after the first dose um the the ventilator had been reduced from 75 to 65 percent after just the first dose and and and remember you know ivermectin like anything its efficacy is going to be limited when you're at that stage but it's a there's no reason to ever wait to get to that stage because you see this coming a mile away which leads me to india life site news has an interesting article on that so every news outlet is screaming about india it's funny notice how now we have to own india's like numbers they don't they no longer it's it's dead in america so every day we have to i'm now hearing it on all the news blurbs record cases deaths like like we had in america so now we own india when india is behind us they came later they didn't have their thing they have a billion and half people in the in the in the country so there's a lot more herd immunity to be achieved but um basically jol hershorn has done a lot of work on on therapeutics i'm covering this in india so he he says the history here's the truth of what went on in india during 2020 and the first few months of the year india barely had anything um you know hydroxychloroquine and ivermectin were made available now the mainstream media waged a war against early home outpatient treatment successfully and what happened was the indian government then advised against it and what happened was is that you know they weren't using it right at the time at least in most places right at the time when they needed it when it started coming there and again mind you it's not like they have a worse death their death rate is still um not as bad as most european countries in america either per capita and this is their worst wave which they haven't had much so it's logical in a place that large that you're going to have this it's not such a bad outcome but finally as this started going in april 14th there was an article written um about doctors believe ivermectin drug can help india stop covid-19 second wave india times talked about dr surya kent trippathy head of respiratory medicine department at king george medical university in luck now that he was pushing ivermectin and now it's being used and we're going to see what happens there and udar udar proddish and marjis i can't pronounce this marmara shtara are two states that are heavily using it and basically there was an analysis showing that when india stopped prescribing ivermectin and started vaccinating see the vaccine movement kill divermectin they stopped using their death shot up now again it's not that it caused the deaths the death shot up because seasonality geographically they didn't really get the winter spread so their southern latitude they get it later and they didn't have much before they're going to get it but folks this is very much some of you might have seen the country of seashells if i'm pronouncing it right in africa an archipelago country they now have a higher case per capita than india even there i think they're the most in the world they have something like 90 percent got the first shot and by the way they've had a mass mandate forever and then 90 percent they have the highest vaccination rate and and and it's it's spreading and again it's you know it's all relative it's they haven't had it much before but it's the fastest increase of anywhere at this point it clearly demonstrates that natural herd immunity is the 800 pound gorilla in the room whatever efficacy the the vaccine is it's not 0 like lockdowns and mass it's more than that but it ain't 94 percent and we're seeing that it's just not everyone it's fine i sound like a broken record i said this 14 months ago but here we are every day i'm proven right everyone is going to assume you have to get it until it burns out with herd immunity the question is are you going to inform people to prophylax and take early treatments to minimize the deaths and then live normally once you have that to minimize the pain or are you going to have all pain and no gain block treatment give people false hope but still lock them down and destroy their physical emotional mental and economic health those are the only two paths we're seeing it like clockwork all the places that beat covid well they didn't beat it they're now getting it see there was this thought some people might have said you know what maybe those countries did beat it because they staved off whether they wound up really staved off or just naturally it didn't come there until later but they're luckier because once it did come now they have the vaccine whereas the countries that got hit earlier it was before they had the vaccine we're not seeing that we're seeing the places whether it's Argentina seashells um india all the areas the entire far east from tailand and campodia and japan and all the places that really didn't have much they're getting it regardless of the vaccine those are the most masked places around japan now again there is this partial immunity in east asia probably from other coronaviruses that you know and they're healthier dr kohl is a strong believer that almost all of them have type o blood type and he explained to me why that makes a difference um vitamin d levels there's belief they're they do better with their diet there there's a lot of reasons there that they're healthier and better off and the deaths per capita are always going to be lower than they were in europe and in america but that has nothing to do with the masks and the non-farmaceutical interventions and the vaccines that's just because of the health status there but the cases are spreading as wildly as they would spread it's like all the premises they made oh this country did well because of this they never revisit that 14 15 months later it's all come out in the wash you know my buddy um why it's sheepy that's his twitter handle his name name is nathan hiat from ohio we've had him on the show a couple times he's a mathematician he's so he's done run run the numbers on on even demographics everyone talked about blacks and aspanics being worse off you know what the more the pandemic goes on the more everything equals out it fills in there might have been reasons they got it first it's kind of averaging out now same thing with the states everyone built a whole mountain out of them out of a molehole of like oh this state did very well because of this well now they're not they did well because for whatever reason they didn't get it much now precisely because they didn't get it enough they're getting it you're gonna get it until you get it everyone's gonna roughly equal out in the end that's what we're seeing with with few exceptions every state every country is going to fill out the the vaccination everyone talks about israel okay and how few cases they have but look at how few cases albania and maldova and all those eastern european countries that have three percent vaccination rates have it's seasonality israel when when they what once they started vaccinating they already had peaked they got nailed israel got nailed they reached herd immunity mainly again i'm not gonna tell you that there is zero efficacy short term ten of the vaccines of course there is the broader issue is that you know given the risks and the side effects and the fact that it's not like you're even getting bulletproof efficacy out of it for covid and that we have so many cheap effective therapeutics that people need to be taking that are so much more proven plus don't have side effects what is the reason to push vaccines other than control and big pharma again i am not i am all in favor of a safe and effective vaccine i am i'm in favor of the concept of a vaccine some people disagree with me i'm i'm in favor of i have no problem with that that's not what we have now we have an unproven vaccine that more and more seems to be more like along the lines of flu shot degree of efficacy which is what we predicted from day one by the way but much more dangerous than the flu shot for a virus that brawley doesn't affect a lot of people and for the people that it does there's other things we can be doing this is the narrative that needs to be adopted by every red state in county i want you to keep pushing this if the state legislatures are out then we need to bring in our expert witnesses and i'm willing to bring them in to county boards this is what needs to happen and this is where we are folks sick until proven healthy that needs to end immediately so there's a lot more obviously there's this big article on everyone's talking about that was published by Nicholas Wade on medium really a deep dive into why he thinks um from a pathogenic standpoint this was made in the chinese lab um but to me what's more important is that the response was made in china they did it on purpose they signaled lockdown that's how people adopted such an insane thing the whole world adopted it doesn't make any sense but that's where we are in the covid stuff so i just wanted to get back to some of that but but but let's get back to where we are so here we are with the issue of our time everything we ever warned about if you're a republican a conservative liberty communism liberty being taken away this is where we are yet 90 percent of republicans adopt at some level fauci's premises and policies and rhetoric and that's not a deal breaker almost every republican in leadership whether it's at a federal level more importantly whether it's at a state or county level i mean uh you know if it's an legislature it's the speaker the senate pro temp senate majority leader the judiciary committee chairman the health committee chairman the state affairs committee chairman almost every one of them supports covid communism mask fascism and somehow that's not like an impetus to get them out suddenly we have liz defies trump's personality oh she's got to go and and don't get me wrong i'm all in favor of that but my point is we need to liz chaney all of them everyone in leadership is like that and most republicans are like that liz chaney is not an aberration she's not an exception she's the rule she's not a bug of the gop she's a feature of the gop and the biggest proof is they now want to replace her with a least a fanic a woman who voted against trump tax cuts who voted against trump's oil drilling who voted to require trump to a bill that if it would have passed would have required trump to join the paris climate accords voted for amnesty multiple times voted against the border wall big tranny supporter that's what they're missing the person to replace her with is that that's vintage gop now look i don't even care the third ranking position in a body that no longer matters at a federal system that's irimidably broken i don't care doesn't matter heck you know what if i were there i might even vote for a least a fanic just to throw out liz chaney and just at least a throw at arino and and at least send that message but they're missing the broader point why is it that you could be a tranny a legal alien pro criminal pro-covid fascist pro big government government pro welfare pro government health care republican and you're not unfit to serve in leadership to represent our values it's only you go up against the trump's personality so a least a fanic is a funny situation where she's one of the most liberal members of the house but she kissed up to trump so that's okay i mean really that's where it's all at now and this plays out in a lot of primaries where you'll have a rhino that kiss up to trump will endorse them again like of course liz chaney was it was insane to vote for impeachment to make trump krynnally responsible for january six but what i find even more appalling is she tweeted out last year something about how fauci is not partisan he's a dedicated servant and because she was like hitting back against conservative attacks on fauci and she put out all these mask memes and everything that is more offensive to me that's more consequential to my life why is that okay and this is true in every state legislature where it actually matters i don't care about i mean it doesn't matter who's in the number three person in the house what does matter is when you have these four to one GOP majorities in legislative chambers within states where they have trifecta control where we could accomplish so much and the majority leader is a dirtbag the health committee chairman is a dirtbag see when you're talking about leadership positions the left they elevate to positions of leadership whether it's a committee chair whether it's a floor leader whether it's a nominee for a high position of senator or presidential nominee they take their best fighters who most of us siferously fight for them and they pick their best leaders on that issue to focus on that issue set so if it's the health committee chairman it's going to be the biggest communist if it's a budget committee chairman you know who's the senate budget chair bernie sanders if it's judiciary it's going to be the biggest open borders pro criminal guy we have the opposite rather than the most conservative on those issues will have the most liberal pro government run healthcare pro public health pro big pharma guy limar alexander for years has been the senate health committee chairman no one ever had a problem with that this is what bothers me they're like little doggy is like whoo look at the biscuit the these talk show hosts these fox news guys these entities they're so dumb they only know what's put on their plate oh twamp twamp twamp oh keitlyn jennel keitlyn jennel i mean putting even the values issues aside and the guys an incoherent fool and you couldn't even trust them on the issues anyway but just from a mental illness standpoint gender dysphoria i mean i feel bad for the guy i i had an uncle who was schizophrenic he thought he was all sorts of things people think they're animals you don't legitimize that and then elevate them to governor when someone's dealing with a very severe mental illness mental illness is a serious problem you feel bad for people like that there's all different kinds of that but you don't run for office when you have that the conservative case for trans you know you either the conservative case the conservative case for mask wearing this is what this movement has become it's shocking to me this is what they focus on and yet where we can make a difference how we can make a difference with the candidates that we can make a difference on the issues through which we can make a difference they're nowhere to be seen nowhere to be seen you have these lockdown fascist governors in trump plus 30 states that we can't get a movement to get trump to endorse the big talkers on fox news to focus on this is where we are Caitlyn Jenner mentally ill what's going on we've lost our our sense of humanity these are the same people that they're not they're not pained by covid fascism they're not pained by the masking of children in fact Hannity supported it mask up was his line what is wrong with these people we have the foxes guarding the hen house we have the biggest voices that have the biggest megaphones supposedly representing our side as the biggest champions of the other side's values and this has been going on for years you know i'm reminded you know one of russia's kind of like parody type of things he would always put on that funny voice when he talked about the palestinians and the two state solution you know the obsession of the two state solution that it always became an institution as an end to itself so he had it had this line he would say mobby when i grow up i want to work for the two state solution remember that i mean he used to always say that so it reminds me of like when i grow up i want to work for the conservative movement it's like an institution that perpetuates its own failure what is it what does it even mean the word conservative has lost its meaning by a mile watch for all the articles from national review and all these types fox news like you see the media is double standard they're they're you know biased against trans conservatives they only like the trans liberals jeez if you if you if you can't laugh you just have a heart attack in this day and age there's a lot more going on as i said i want to start talking about what i think states could do to push back against illegal immigration it's going to be part of our agenda items and you know obviously our movement for constitutional sanctuaries within the counties that needs to be pushed um it's something that could be adopted all year round you know usually you could pressure your your councilman it's not like like state legislatures that are only part-time there's a lot we need to be doing about this i just want to share with you now we have a lot of crime stories i really want to hit but i want to share with you one other story that i felt is important there is this muslim leftist whose mayor of is he mayor of dearborn no he's um he's running for mayor of dearborn he right now he's a state house rep from the area in michigan and this guy basically wrote at a rally we had a campaign rally and he said the following where is this darn now now i can't even ring this up can't even find it but basically it's something to the effect of he told everyone you have to vote for muslim and arab candidates if we only get like 6 000 people we could run the city and he you know there's different um candidates and he said i maybe there's a runoff and he said if i lose i pledge to support only a muslim candidate and i was thinking like this has become the problem in our country this is the the racism that the two-tier system um we would ever tolerate if someone gets up there and says you know we have to preserve the anglo-saxon-christian tradition i'm only going to vote for a christian white anglo-saxon um candidate uh you know if we only get out there and have you know just assert our voices we'll be able to ensure that it's only white christian anglo-saxons are able to uh to win you know and and and we tolerate this the only systemic racism in this country is from non-whites and we all know that you know someone pointed this out yesterday to me um there's this case everyone's talking about this florida teen that's accused of rigging a homecoming election now you know it's cheating it's not good but she's being tried as an adult with a maximum sentence of 16 years so i want to say two two points on this number one you know what has roped in so many and even some listeners email me like libertarians into criminal justice reform they say you know daniel this is over criminalization of our life and yeah i mean we all agree but i'm like dude that is not what they are reforming and and and this is one of many examples of we are 10 years into jailbreak where basically violent gangs and drugs have been legalized so you'd think at least the ancillary benefit is we would not have this over-cream of kind of like nebulous bs crimes no that stuff they'll clamp down on and the other point to be made is the two-tier justice system this girl is a 17-year-old girl who is white i want you to think about this for a minute a black girl who murdered actually a muslim cab driver mohammed anwar in dc she's being tried as a juvenile plea deal and if she serves any prison time at the latest she'll be out at 21 white girl attempting to rig a home homecoming election is being tried as an adult with a maximum sentence of 16 years and they're not taking a plea deal folks we don't have anarchy in this country we have systemic persecution what appears to be anarchy for some is merely a part of that persecution so it's not even so much anarcho tyranny it's really all tyranny but it's tyranny in a sadistic persecution that is very targeted at achieving very precise outcomes for certain people and groups of people look you're always gonna get the brutal honest truth from me and the reason why i think i have better solutions and more solutions and more ideas and other people is because i'm willing to actually diagnose the problem we're gonna have to fight on a local level illegal migration crime covid fascism two-tier justice system cultural rock gut again anyone who runs on i'm for lower taxes i'm pro-life and pro-gun and they have nothing to say about the issues of our time you know there are fraud and frankly they'll sell us out on those issues as well so again um you know if you are willing to be a leader you could email me dharwitz at blaesmita.com um if you want to secure email it's daniel harwitz at startmail.com follow me on twitter at dharwitz at i'm sorry at rm conservative daniel underscore harwitz on gab um i do want to put out more rumble videos i'm on rumble um and uh we will start juicing that up more sign up for connection.network and again please send this show to all your friends and relatives i'm not in this for money for anything i want to make a difference that's why i work so hard but we need to have our voice heard by more people if you haven't done so by now if you'd be so kind to drop us a five star rating on iTunes it will really really make a difference in um the algorithms and getting the show out to more people because look folks if it's not me it's going to be people like hanadi that's the reality who do you want to represent our side of the story that is the question and if the answer is yes i need you guys to help us support our show support our sponsors um we the people holsters uh today is one of our sponsors as well as uh go specs lenses and again that is better spectacles.com slash conservative and we the people holsters.com slash cr till tomorrow god bless y'all and thank you for listening"
