Japan has the red dot inside a white rectangle. Mexico has the red, white and green vertical stripes with its national coat of arms in the center. The Russian flag consists of white, blue and red horizontal stripes and many different flags across the world. And then we, of course, have our national flag, which is the gay pride flag, the rainbow. The pride flag was invented in the late 70s by a gay activist at the urging of his friend Harvey Milk. And Harvey Milk, of course, is the San Francisco politician and bureaucrat who had a penchant for molesting drug addicted underage boys. So it's his idea that he passed along to his friend and activist. And that was a man named Gilbert Baker, who was a radical leftist and drag queen who, for a time, was a member of the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, a blasphemous group of cross-dressing men who run around dress like sexualized sacrilegious nuns. The flag was a political statement. It was a far, far left political statement from the very beginning. And it still is, of course, which is why it's changed over the years to accommodate the political needs of the far left. Today, of course, the pride flag, which was always tacky and gaudy in appearance, now looks something like something maybe designed by a blind schizophrenic. It is in appearance as ugly and objectionable as the agenda it represents. The left continually defiles its own flag, adding clashing shapes and colors, making uglier what was already hideous in the first place. The flag defaces itself to symbolize what it seeks to do to the culture, essentially. At one time, it was flown primarily at pride marches and far left political rallies, but that has changed in recent years. Now the leftist regime that controls our country, our cultural elites, have taken this unsightly banner and elevated it literally and figuratively. They have made it into our new national flag, the flag of the United States of Gay, we might say. For the stars and stripes, it was supposed to be our actual national flag. We're meant to kneel to turn away, to have a conversation about its problematic history. But for the pride flag, we're ordered to stand at attention, honor it, show it deference. That's why the pride flag now flies over our embassies abroad. It's why the White House has been lit up in its colors. It's why the flag flies over state houses and cabinet departments and the FBI headquarters flies over school buildings. It flies inside classrooms. The government at every level, from local to state to federal, now waves this flag. But they don't always wave it. We should be clear, because sometimes they paint it in the street where it can't really wave. Many cities across the country have taken to a painting enormous pride flag murals in the middle of their streets and intersections. Ironically, it is certain, I would say, that all of these cities that have painted these pride flags in the street, they've also issued various PSA's and put up signs warning about the dangers of distracted driving. And I know that because you find that in every city in America. Because it's really important to pay attention and focus while you're on the road so that you can be blinded by the rainbow landmine we've painted in the middle of the intersection. Most recently, the city of Fort Lauderdale paved essentially one of its entire streets in the clashing colors of the gay rainbow. But then disaster struck. Apparently this mural, which again was painted directly on the road where cars drive was defaced by tire marks. Almost as if cars had driven over it on the road, if you can imagine. Here's seven news of Miami with the shocking story. Listen. Well, it's a brand new installation in the city of Fort Lauderdale pride flag. And it was already vandalized, not once, but possibly twice. Only on six tonight, it seems that a group of men on bicycles may have targeted the flag first. Alyssa joins us now with more and police are now set to review this other incident. Alyssa. Right. Well, police are now looking into that latest video. In fact, police for Lauderdale police were back out here just about an hour ago to pick up that new surveillance video. They're understanding that they're going to then review that video and look to see whether they believe that this was another intentional act of vandalism against this pride flag behind me. New video tonight, raising even more suspicions after a new pride flag installation in the city of Fort Lauderdale was found to face left covered in skid marks for Lauderdale. Police was already investigating the vandalism after surveillance video from the nearby Mary Weather Resort showed a pickup truck on February 28 doing a blowout over the length of the flag, leaving dark tire tracks behind all while the passenger of his car gets out in films. I just see people that just have time on their hands that are destructing property and spewing hate. Mary Jo Whitehurst who manages the Mary Weather also found this surveillance video from a few days before that. Guests had mentioned bicyclists leaving behind skid marks. The new video which she only discovered today is still being reviewed by police. It shows at least three young men on bicycles circling the flag, leaving tire marks several times. Yes, how dare that guy in the pickup truck stop others from living their lives by leaving tire marks on the road. How exactly is anyone in the world prevented from living their lives or prevented from doing anything at all by tire marks on a gay pride flag in the middle street? I mean, how does that work exactly? The man says that the vandal has scuffed up someone's life. Well, whose life precisely? Was the mural a living being of some kind? Did it cry out in pain as the kids on bicycles rode over top of it? How does that work? Well, however it works, the police are on the case. We know that. They will find the evil doer. It's actually multiple people. This was a look, this was not some minor crime like armed robbery or murder or something like that. This was an act of disrespect against the regime's sacred symbol and that cannot be allowed to stand. As the mayor of Fort Lauderdale has made clear, such blasphemy will not be tolerated. In a statement, he declared, quote, if they were sending us a message, I have a message to send back to them. You are not welcome. Take your hatred somewhere else. We will find the perpetrators. We will track them down. How heroic. This is basically the mayor's George Bush moment standing atop the rubble of the towers, promising to bring the terrorists to justice. Although of course this is way worse than 9-11 goes without saying. To make matters worse, this hate crime committed against the road is not an isolated incident. Shockingly, many of the other pride flags painted on streets across America have also wound up with tire marks of their own, leading to man hunts to track down the culprits. Law enforcement in places like Reno and Atlanta and other cities have launched investigations into similar incidents. So this is the process now. This is what they do. The city's paint rainbows all over the street and then wait for tire marks to end up on the rainbows and then they send the police to go find who was the dastardly villain who drove on the street over the thing that they put in the street. Just a few months ago elsewhere in Florida, a man was arrested for defiling a pride flag painted across an entire intersection. The culprit as local media reports, Alexander Jerrick broke down in tears in court and up pled for forgiveness as his lawyer in an effort to explain his actions because of course his actions were so heinous that they needed to be explained this way. His lawyer, according to the reports, compared him to the mentally disabled character from of mice and men. That's what his lawyer said. The judge ultimately sentenced him to probation, community service and mental health screening. Because if you make tire marks on a gay pride flag, if you disrespect a gay pride flag, then obviously you're crazy and so you have to get a mental health screening. And that wasn't it either. He also forced the guy to write a 25 page essay about the shooting at Pulse, which is the gay club in Orlando. Now this is likely the harshest sentence ever given to anyone for the crime of making tire marks on a public street. But it wasn't enough for gay activists in the city. Nicholas Coppola, who's a board member of the Palm Beach County's LGBTQ community center, said that he should have been charged with a hate crime. In a very revealing comparison, he said that Jerrick's actions were no different from desecrating a church. But Palm Beach County State Attorney Dave Ehrenberg explained that the law would only allow hate crime charges if Jerrick selected a specific victim based on sexual orientation, that the victim here was the city technically and as Ehrenberg clarified, and I'm quoting him now, the city has no sexual orientation. Yes, we've reached a point where that needs to be explained. Now let's not be coy about this. Yes, it should be expected that anything painted in the street will end up scuffed and tire marked. That should be expected. But also, yes, clearly from the video, the tire marks on the Fort Lauderdale mural were put there on purpose. And this was an intentional act of vandalism. It wasn't. The guy was obviously doing that intentionally. You can tell that from the video. And to that, I say, okay, now I'm not endorsing the destruction of public property. I certainly am not encouraging anyone to engage in such behavior. I couldn't say that. But what is it that the left said about the BLM rioters, the ones that caused quite a bit more destruction of public property? What was it? They're speaking in the language of the unheard. That was it, right? Well, here you go. I would say something similar in this case. Lots of unheard and powerless people are looking around at our country and noticing that this far left political symbol is being shoved in our faces everywhere we turn, including and especially by our governing authorities. And it's being elevated to a place of greater importance and status than the American flag itself. And these people are disgusted by it. And they're sick of it. And they are beyond frustrated and they should be. Let's just put this plainly. The pride flag does not deserve our respect. In fact, it deserves our disrespect. It deserves our contempt and mockery. It is not the flag of gay people, okay? That's not what it is. Gay people in America? They already have a flag. It's called the American flag. It's the flag we all share or are supposed to share. The pride flag, which was invented by a far left activist drag queen, represents not a person or a people or a community, but an agenda, a political and cultural agenda. It always has. It has from the very beginning. It still does now. And today, nearly all of the most depraved and perverse attacks on children, on tradition, on decency, on common sense are waged under this banner. That's what it signifies, okay? The gay pride flag signifies drag queens dancing for toddlers, males invading women's bathrooms. It signifies castration drugs given to children. It signifies the destruction of the nuclear family. When government officials send that thing up the flagpole or paint its ridiculous colors in the street, that is what they're promoting. It's what they're advertising. It is the cause they want us to salute. Not only should we refuse to salute it, but we should treat it with disdain. We should treat it as a hate symbol because that's what it is. They fly the flag, that flag, because they hate you and your values and what you believe and everything you stand for. And so we should respond in kind to this symbol. In other words, we should give the pride flag all of the respect that the left shows the American flag. Let's just put it that way.

The Biden administration, this is daily why I report Biden administration awarded a biological man an award for courage in honor of International Women's Day during a Wednesday ceremony at the White House. Alba Rueda, a man who identifies as a woman, received an International Women of Courage Award alongside 10 women from Secretary of State Anthony Blinken and First Lady Jill Biden. Rueda is Argentina's special envoy for sexual orientation and gender identity. I'm sorry, wait, special envoy for sexual orientation and gender identity. This is what we're doing now. You need countries needing an envoy for sexual orientation. Nobody knows what that means or what that actually entails, but that's what it is. And it's also the country's first trans identifying politician to hold a senior government position. According to the State Department, the award is meant for extraordinary women from around the world who are working to build a brighter future for all of us. We have a video of that. Let's check it out. In Argentina, Alba Rueda is a transgender woman who was kicked out of classrooms, barred for sitting for exams, refused job opportunities, subjected to violence and rejected by her family. But in the face of these challenges, she worked to end violence and discrimination against the LGBTQI plus community in Argentina. So there you have it. Only 11 women earned the International Courage Award. These are women from all over the world. So these are supposed to be the most courageous women in the entire world. Those of women, and we're given the award to 11 of them, and one of them was a man. So what does that tell you? This is obviously yet again, womanhood being appropriated, women being demeaned and excluded, and all of that. And you know, of course, how I feel about that. But I've been, you know, I've been thinking about something else too, yesterday was International Women's Day, but the whole month is Women's History Month, which is of course just another opportunity to celebrate men, but not men, because we can't celebrate men who identify as men. No, we can't do that, but we can celebrate men who identify as women. And I've been thinking about this, and we always talk about the appropriation of womanhood. And yet if you notice, we rarely, if ever, talk about the appropriation of manhood. And why is that? Because after all, there are plenty of females transitioning the other way, right? In fact, that is more common, at least among kids, among adolescents. And I don't know, across the board, including kids and adults, you know, how it all balances out, but certainly in the coming years, given this deluge, this just tidal wave of adolescent girls who are quote unquote transitioning, if the scales have unalready tipped in that direction, they will. So, a lot of girls and women females who are transitioning to try to appear as men. Yet we aren't concerned really about manhood, about masculinity being appropriate. And why is that? And I think the answer is this. I'm concerned about how masculinity is treated in society, degraded, cheapened, shamed, etc. But the great threat isn't really women becoming men or pretending to. It doesn't seem to be as much of a threat that direction as it is the other direction when men become women. And I think it's because the motivation to transition tends to be very different for males than it is for females. So females, especially adolescent girls, infected by this social contagion, they transition as an act of rejection of their femininity, of their femaleness. It is self-loathing. It is self-rejection. And that's why you see that often they take the hormones, they have the breasts chopped off, but they don't always make, and oftentimes they don't make any serious attempt to actually appear as men. Instead they end up as settling as kind of de-feminized females. That's a lot of the transition quote unquote that we see of girls. It's not becoming boys or trying to become boys, but becoming a de-feminized female. There's a reason why you don't see many girls fully embracing the kind of masculine cartoon stereotype as men do when they try to transition to become women. They become like cartoons of women. You don't see it as much the other way. Girls, they're not trying out for the football teams. They're not going to the gym and all of that. There's some of that, but there's not much because they aren't actually interested in trying to be boys. They just want to not be girls. They want to not be who they are. On the other hand, the men who transition, and this is especially the case for men, the adults, often they're motivated by a fetishizing of femininity. They don't want to fully reject their manhood. There's a reason why quote unquote bottom surgery for men is still relatively rare. It's more common now than it used to be, but it's still relatively rare. So a huge number of these men who go around identifying as women, they haven't gone through the surgical transition because they still want all of those parts. That's because they don't reject their manhood completely. They just want to absorb womanhood in order to satisfy their desires. This is not a blanket statement that covers everyone. There's plenty of self-loathing among men who identify as trans. There's perhaps some fetishizing of manhood by women who try to become men. Some of that goes both ways, but I think that this is a trend or a noticeable pattern that we should be investigating more. All right, so two clips that may seem unrelated, but they're really not. First here is Hillary Clinton talking about climate change. And finally, I'm so glad that Elena Zelenska is here because women are... Women and children are the primary victims of conflict and of climate change. And there is no place that unfortunately, tragically, shows us that more dramatically than Ukraine today, but there are a lot of other conflicts, a lot of other challenges that we have to take into account as we look at gender apartheid in Afghanistan, the persecution and oppression of girls and women exercising their freedom of choice in Iran and so many other places. Women are primarily affected by climate change. So the world is coming to an end. We're all going to drown. The ice caps are going to melt. Women most affected. Maybe so, but that's why we shouldn't have destroyed gender roles, Hillary. Have you thought about that? Because if we still had gender roles, we still had concepts like chivalry, then women would be guaranteed first crack at the lifeboats when the ice caps melt and the whole world is flooded. Because that's the way it used to be. But you got rid of the gender roles. That means we're all drowning now. Or it's just going to be a mad rush for the lifeboats and whoever's strongest makes it in. And so in that way, women are the most affected. But be that as it may, she says, women are the most affected by climate change. Here's Cory Bush pulling kind of a similar move in a different context. But let's listen to this. You describe that the price increases had a disproportionate effect on black, brown, and low income communities, families. How did the administration's actions and the ensuring the ensuing drop in gas prices, how did it help those same families? And while there are a number of factors that affect the price of oil in an interview with Oxford, I believe, Dr. B did concede that the strategic use of SPR did have an impact. It's hard to quantify and hard to tell, but it definitely had an impact in the price of oil. We need to focus on making more public investments to lower our energy demand by taking actions such as expanding public transit and installing energy efficient technology like electric heat pumps. Mr. Drummer, how does making investments in people through safe energy systems and people benefit climate justice and energy security? What are the exciting things from the inflation reduction? I think we'll see enough of that. So you have climate change, world's coming to an end, women most affected by that, and then gas prices increase and black and brown people are the most affected by the increase in gas prices. Now, I've never seen at the gas station like different prices listed, depending on the color of your skin. And so if you have darker skin, you got to pay more. I've never seen that. I'll say one thing for sure. If that exists at any gas station, if Corey Bush isn't counter that at a gas station, then I absolutely oppose it. I do not believe in racialized pricing for gas. But I don't think that that actually exists anywhere. So what that means is that gas prices increasing, it affects everybody the same. Well, anyone who drives anyway, if you don't drive, then I suppose you're not as affected by it. But if you drive around, you're affected by it. Prices are the same for everybody. But what you notice is that these people on the left, they can't even pretend to care about everyone. They used to pretend. They used to at least pretend. They put on a little bit of an act to pretend that they were concerned about all people and all Americans and all citizens. They don't do that anymore. They don't even pretend any kind, any problem, whatever the problem is, they need to find a way to position the problem as an attack on the marginalized, quote, quote, marginalized groups, their favorite groups in order for them to pay attention to it. They have to justify paying attention to any problem at all by making an argument that this problem disproportionately impacts their favorite groups. And if they can't find a way to do that, if they can't find a way to argue, if you take any problem at all, whatever the issue is, whatever the problem is, even if it's a made up problem, like climate change. If they can't find a way to claim that this is really in some ways inherently racist or sexist, then they'll just ignore it. That, of course, is the Ohio train the realm. And that's how you explain the reaction by the federal government to the Ohio train the realm, or rather the lack of reaction until they were forced, eventually they were forced to pretend to care, but talking about three weeks, because they looked at it and they said, well, this is a working class town in Ohio. It's a white working class town. It would be very difficult for us to argue that this trained the realm, right outside of a white working class town, disproportionately impacts black people or women or trans people. And because they couldn't figure out a way to make that argument, I mean, I just didn't talk about it. Because they don't care about all Americans and they're done even pretending that they do. Speaking of the climate, here is Kamala Harris with a new leftist buzz phrase that you can add to your dictionary now, if you're keeping track at home. Here it is. I mean, one of the young leaders was talking to me about climate mental health. I said, tell me what's going on with your peers, climate mental health. And she talked, I said, I think I understand that, but unpack it for me. And she talked about how her peers are thinking about it. One example is, you know, whether when they're ready, could they start a family? Worried about what that would mean. And the stress of it, they were talking about it in terms of their peers trying to figure out, you know, they're going to have to get a job and they're going to have to make a living. But what can they do and how can they adapt the education that they're having now to their activism? Climate mental health. So we've heard about climate racism. We've heard about climate sexism. When the climate, you know, is racist or sexist. And now there is climate mental health that she is going to add to the lexicon. And aside from, and of course she only is able to speak in buzz phrases and buzz words. So why you hear even there, climate, we have to unpack that. That phrase alone is already nails on the chalkboard. Let's unpack it. It's even worse than when someone says, lean in. We got to lean into this issue. Let's lean into this issue and really unpack it. And then she throws climate mental health in there. And it's simply too much to bear. But also every time I hear about this, about these kids that are their mental health is being affected by what they hear about the climate, about worries that the world's coming to an end. And that all the coastal cities are going to be underwater by the time that these kids are old enough. And I hear this. And my first instinct is to assume that it's completely made up. Not that what their claiming is going to happen with the climate is made up. Well, we know that's made up. But to assume that these stories about kids that are devastated by it and are like up at night, anxious and stressed out and they're depressed because they're worried about the climate. Every time I hear that, my instinct is to say, well, that doesn't exist there. Kids like that, you're making this up. And I assume that because my own kids, I'm only around normal kids. My own kids are normal. I'm around normal kids, normal parents. So I'm only around normal people. And that's that's how I choose to be around. And among normal people, this is not a thing. Okay, you go like normal people, you just you take your kids out, you go to a playground. And some just neighborhoods, suburban neighborhood. And normal people out at the playground, normal kids. No one is talking about climate change. The kids aren't sitting on the on the jungle gym, lamenting the fact that the climate is changing and everyone's going to die. So I tend to think that it's all made up. But then I realized that these people, they have some of them anyway, have kids of their own. A lot of these leftist climate chicken littles, they do have kids, some of them anyway. And so they are actually creating, this is intentional, they're creating a generation of kids trying to create a generation of kids who really are up at night worried about the climate. So I would much prefer to think that this is made up and it's a lie. They're making this up and these kids don't exist. That there's there's there's there's no kid that's actually feeling burdened by the the weather. But I think situation is much worse than that. And there are some kids, probably a lot of them who actually are having their mental health affected by this. But the mental health is not being affected by the climate. Their mental health being affected by what they what they are told about the climate. They're being told by the adults in their life that the world's coming to end. And yeah, you know, you don't have your future, you're not going to really have a future, a future you're going to grow up in is going to be terrible because the climate. Yeah, I would think that if you do tell kids that and you hammered into their heads, yeah, that probably would affect their mental health, I would think. And it is a it's an insidious thing to do. Nick Cannon is infamous for having lots of kids. I think he has 12 kids now. And I say infamous not because there's anything wrong with having lots of kids. I know as a father of six, I wouldn't be able to claim that. But because he has them by a bunch of different women who isn't married to. And now his his penchant for creating fatherless homes has led to or maybe has led to this show. Watch the commercial here. Guys, you're on a game show right now. Kevin Hart and Nick Cannon are coming to eat for the mother of all game shows. Having my baby with Nick Cannon. You got my role. You're going to get some contestants that want to have your baby. We're not kidding around. Any, many money. Let's go. Who's having my baby with Nick Cannon hosted by Kevin Hart this spring only on E. Who's having my so contestants competing to see who can have Nick Cannon's baby. This is literally something out of idiocracy. We are we're at the point now where people in charge of this stuff. They just they watched the movie on idiocracy and they took it as a as a as a as a plan, you know, as a they saw it not as a warning of the future but as goals to achieve. Now I have seen I've so I've seen conflicting reporting on this and some outlets have reported I think Variety for example reported that that this is a real show that they really are going to do this. Now other outlets are saying that it's fake. Daily wire reports that it's fake that it's some kind of skit for something else they're doing. Which maybe it is. I'd like to think that it is. But either way it's it's disgusting either way because the whole joke right what's the joke here. The joke is that this deadbeat Nick Cannon this scumbag deadbeat has lots of kids that he doesn't raise. Look I'm creating fatherless homes isn't that hilarious. Isn't that so funny and quirky. No it isn't you dirtbag. You're behaving like an animal okay. Topulating with whoever is willing and creating lots of offspring that you don't raise. That's what animals do. Okay that's that's one of the things that's supposed to separate us from animals is that we don't do that. Now that may come as news to you Nick. But as as human beings we create children and we get married and we raise them. So it's really nothing really nothing funny about it. Now somebody has lots of kids and they marry the woman that they that they make the kids with and they raise the kids. And we want to have a fun time with the fact they have so many kids that's fine again it's that's me. But creating a bunch of fatherless homes not exactly funny. But I did find this part of the daily wire report about this. So the whole idea of like having fun with the fact that he's creating a bunch of fatherless kids who are going to suffer the consequence that that's not funny. This is funny though this is the part that I think is not supposed to be funny. So the daily wire lists the kids that that this guy has. And let me just read this part. Nick Cannon shares twins Moroccan and Monroe with ex-wife Mariah Carey. Sons Golden Segan and Rise Messiah Cannon and daughter powerful queen with Brittany Bell. Twins Zion Moxeliden and Zillion Air that's Zillion one word H E I R A R Zillion Air and daughter beautiful Zeppelin with Abidellarosa. Then also son legendary love with Brie TC and then daughter Onyx ice coal with La Nisha coal. Those are the names that he's given these kids. I like especially Zion Moxeliden which sounds like some kind of prescription drug. He got that from he's always watching is up late one night. And some one of the some commercial for an antidepressant came on and he decided to give that name to his kids. I don't know what this is. This also actually isn't really funny on second thought because these are kids are not only our fatherless but now they've been given these ridiculous names as well on top of it. Maybe this is kind of the boy named Sue strategy deployed on a massive scale. Well you're not going to be there to raise the kids so you give them a ridiculous name to try to toughen them up because you know they're going to get made fun of it for for it in school. I don't know if that's what he's going for but that would be my theory anyway. All right one other thing before we get to comment section in New York Post has this headline. Woke moviegoers say cocaine bear not for kids. It encourages drugs. Article says Woke moviegoers saw the new cocaine bear and they think it's way out of line. Cocaine bear has been getting rave reviews raking in 8.65 million dollars on his opening night. According to IMDB's box office mojo but not everyone is so fond of the movie. Some woke viewers complained that the new film is encouraging drug use and is not suitable for kids. The movie which is rated R for bloody violence and gore is loosely based on a true story. 1985 a bear was found dead in the Georgia woods after consuming a drug smuggler stash of cocaine that was dropped from a plane. Okay to say that this was even loosely based on a true story that is the word loosely is doing a lot of work there. So the only similarity between the movie and the real story is that there was a bear a long time ago or decades ago that apparently consumed cocaine and died. In the movie the bear consumes cocaine and becomes this super natural monster and then hunts down and viciously gores and mutilates and murders a whole bunch of people. So very very loosely based. Some moviegoers were not satisfied with what they saw. As extreme movie enthusiasts that I am I found this movie was lacking some soul and desire one viewer criticized. And then some other ones were saying that it wasn't appropriate for kids and encourages drug use. Okay here's the only point I want to make about this. Obviously moviegoers should not be surprised that a movie called cocaine bear has drug use in it. The title of the movie is basically a bear does drugs the movie. So you shouldn't surprise you when you sit down you watch is this bear doing drugs in this movie. That said can we not do this with the term woke can we can we please not because being concerned about drug use in a movie is not woke. Being worried that a film is not appropriate for children is not woke. It's silly in this case because the movie isn't made for kids and the content is not hidden. It's very clear what the movie that is. I couldn't be more clear. It's one of those movies that just based on the it's like snakes on a plane kind of based on a title alone you know everything you need to know about the film. But but it's not woke. And I am a little bit worried I see this happening a little bit where this is what's happening with the term woke. It's being expanded in this way. To the point where if anyone has any kind of like moral concern or especially when it comes to entertainment anyone who says that any kind of entertainment isn't appropriate or has some problems automatically it becomes woke. Now that is not woke. It's actually the opposite. Woke is bringing your kid to a movie with drug use and inappropriate content and not caring. Woke is is intentionally exposing your children to inappropriate material. That's what woke is. Being being overly concerned about inappropriate material for kids that is that's that's anti-woke that's the opposite of woke. And I wish that was our main problem as a culture. I wish we still lived in a culture where you could even claim that people are a little bit overly concerned or too concerned. They overreact to inappropriate content. I wish that was the case but that's not the case here at all. All right let's get to the comment section.

Jordan says I love how Matt makes fun of plushies while having a walrus plushie in the background on the left hand side of this video. Well that's entirely different that's completely that's a different sort of thing Jordan okay because yeah I make fun of adults who buy plushies or have plushies unless it's one that I'm selling okay that so I take a prince I'm a man of principle and I'm also a capitalist and so that's that's the principle here. You absolutely should not own plushies as a grown adult unless you're buying it for me in which case exceptions can be made. And you can go to dailywire.com slash shop right now and get your own walrus plushie. I'm sorry very much recommend you do. Kyle says never apologize for the Valentine's Day massacre what was said about Mulvaney is spot on and needed to be said. I like that we're calling it that monologue the the Valentine's Day massacre. I don't know if this is a thing that's caught on but I but it should let's let it let's forever refer to it as that. And it you know Valentine's Day massacre when it's just a monologue about something that may seem a little bit overblown but I have been told that it was a murderous genocidal thing. They were just words but they were murderous and genocidal and so I think Valentine's Day massacre actually is appropriate. Bad Mr. Frosty says I could not imagine being lucky enough to work somewhere as cool as a daily wire. Can you imagine actually being able to work there and quitting? I live in North Carolina. If you guys have anything I could do remotely from here please let me know I'm with you. It is I mean I have to admit it is pretty great and and also it's it's like it is the best game in town. If you want to do anything it's like in conservative and media you want to have an impact on the culture in the media if you want to do anything like that where else are you gonna go? So we talked yesterday about the daily wire employee who left because we don't have to rehash all that but in part because she was upset about some of the things that I've said some of the things Michael Knowles have said has said about gender ideology were too mean were too blunt to whatever. The divisive I think in our rhetoric was what was claimed but so I go ahead you could leave you know I mean said no one has to stay here you can leave. Burning the bridge as you leave not a smart move. It's not it doesn't help us in the cultural fight it's also not good for you for your career it's just it's a bad idea like I really can't emphasize that enough by the way for any young people if you're listening to this whatever whatever job you have whatever you it doesn't matter if you're a media or not whatever your job is if you're young right now and you're working a job you're probably not going to be there for the rest of your life you're gonna be you're gonna quit you're gonna leave at some point you're probably going to quit and leave a whole bunch of jobs before maybe you finally settle on one that you'll be at for a while it's generally how it goes and it is just there may be very rare exceptions okay if you're at a place and something something legal is happening or you know people are being being seriously harmed in some way there's something seriously seriously unethical is happening behind the scenes and so but now you feel like you have to expose it then you're in the position of being like a whistleblower okay so there could be a situation where it's it's it's you were called upon morally to be a whistleblower that's different from quitting and burning a bridge so putting those kinds of situations to the side I really cannot urge you enough that to to understand this that if if you're leaving it is just not a good idea to burn the bridge on the way out to publicize your complaints about the place where you worked and all of that like keep it to yourself for your own sake keep it to yourself I know we have the internet and we're all I know I just like I am we're constantly talking and broadcasting our every opinion and everything on the internet but then you don't have to do that it doesn't mean it's not a requirement okay and there are actually things that can happen in your life that you that you don't you shouldn't tell everyone you don't need to you really stand to gain nothing from it but you stand to lose quite a bit because also remember that when you when you burn the bridge and you attack your former employer yeah you've burned the bridge with ever with with the employer and everybody works there but also other employers saw you do that and they're going to keep that in mind when you come to them and say hey can I work here they're gonna they're gonna think well she you worked at that other place for a few months and then left and and insulted your colleagues on the way out the door are you gonna do that to us I hear this all the time from from uh from people that do you know work in HR departments and they do interviews and stuff and they say that even when it's not a public complaint yeah I've heard I've heard many times at a big red flag when uh for someone for the for the interviewer is when the interviewee comes down and one of the first things they do is start complaining about their former employer even if the complaints are valid when the interviewer hears the interviewee going on and on about how much they hated the other place okay that means that that application that resume is going right in the circular filing bin okay this this interview is over we're not interested in you so just something keep my little bit of career advice um mr. Jake the cat the confrontational jerk community I found my people a tear in my eye thank you it's it is it's I guess we we need an acronym CJC confrontational jerk community maybe we can you know it's where our own victim group now since we have the acronym Jillian says Matt do you ever wonder why Dave Chappelle who was one of the funniest people on the planet suddenly lost all his talent darkened his skin color lost two inches in height and went from having long skinny fingers to short pudgy hands yeah me too is this an actual conspiracy theory that is this is this a thing that are you making this up is this a conspiracy theory that you are is this the uh the birth of a new conspiracy theory or is this a thing if I went and googled it when I find a bunch of reddit posts and all these other forums with this conspiracy because what is the theory the theory is what that Dave Chappelle has been replaced by a body snatcher there's some sort of is he was killed and there's a body double now pretending to be Dave Chappelle that's an interesting conspiracy theory I don't know what I don't know why um but uh but sure let's let's go with that I'll take that following the arrival of the sweet

just head over to my swag shack at dailywire.com slash shop to get yours today also what have I told you that there's one book that has done more for literacy than any other book in a shape literature art culture government and countless lives I'm of course referring to the bible you know who else just had an influence on uh this this book said influence on of course it's Jordan Peterson in addition to his Exodus series Jordan has a documentary called logos and literacy where he traces the bible through history to show you the impact it's had on the western world it's really interesting series here's the trailer I was very much struck by how the translation of the biblical writings jump started the development of literacy across the entire world illiteracy was the norm the past is home was the first school and every morning it would begin with singing the christian faith is a singing religion probably 80 percent of scripture memorization today exists only because of what is sung this is amazing here we have a Gutenberg bible printed on the press of Johann Gutenberg science and religion are opposing forces in the world but historically that has not been the case now the book is available to everyone from Shakespeare to modern education and medicine and science to to civilization itself it is the most influential book in all history and hopefully people can walk away with at least a sense of that most the part where I would normally tell you that logos and literacy is only for daily wire plus members but we're making it available for free for everyone and this is this doesn't very often but you got to go to dailywireplus.com it's only for a limited time so you can watch logos and literacy today anyone can dailywireplus.com now let's get to our daily cancellation today we cancel someone named hunter avalone he's apparently a youtuber and twitch streamer with a moderately large following though i'd never heard of him it came to my attention thanks to a clip posted at twitter by Addison smith of oan and what came to my attention is that hunter posted a lengthy video to his youtube channel reacting to my testimony in front of the Tennessee house committee about their now past legislation banning child gender transitions hunter is apparently a big fan of child castration is a fierce advocate of castrating children and so as we'll see he doesn't like me very much here's the the clip that was on twitter it's very short check it out blessed children um as far as surgeries you know double miss wait giving kids the puberty blockers after they've been confirmed gender dysphoric and they've consented and the therapists have consented and their doctors have consented and their parents have consented and they've been persistent in gender dysphoria for a minimum of six months yeah that's actually a good thing that oh six whole months you say well uh we all know that no child would outgrow with phase after six months six months is when it's set in stone i have never seen my own kids be interested in something or go through a phase that that last six whole months i mean six months this is their identity now might as well chemically castrate them right what else are we supposed to do i mean we could do exactly what we had already been doing for all of human history up until 18 seconds ago we could just let kids go through their phases let them grow out of it instead of locking them in place and turning an awkward moment into a lifelong identity crisis we could do that but before we get too far in addressing hunter's points we should be fair and get the entire context i had a little bit of a back and forth with him on twitter yesterday where we he fleshed out his argument such as it is he explained that children can consent to these quote treatments because the parents and doctors also consent i asked well how does the consent of the adults somehow validate the consent of the child in other words if a child cannot consent to making permanent life altering decisions how does the consent of the adult around the child change that and he responded that he's only talking about puberty blockers not the cross-sex hormones or surgeries in fact you clarify that hormones and surgeries should wait until the child turns 18 according to you know by his in his opinion but but puberty blockers are different because they are a life-saving medical intervention he claimed he also noted that i am an ape and i should go f myself now when i asked how it could ever be appropriate to chemically castrate a child which is what the puberty blocker does he answered this quote firstly too much tylenol can kill you they aren't death pills puberty blockers can be detrimental if given in large doses but beneficial when given in proper doses why is this so hard for your chimp brain to grasp medicine can be good too much medicine can be bad he later insisted again smaller doses of puberty blockers are not chemical castration i'm fine with puberty blockers for minors surgery and hormones shouldn't be given until uh unless in less 18 years or older go back to being the creepy dude hanging outside the high school you degenerate scum i had to ask about three or four times for any evidence that puberty blockers are life-saving as he claimed and finally after furiously googling for whatever random studies he could find but certainly not read he responded quote sure i've attached some evidence below since your two were tarted to read yourself firstly here's a cohort of trans people over 40 plus years showing that no increase of suicide was present after transition although the suicide risk remained higher this was due to social issues not transition secondly here's a study which found that puberty suppression and affirmation care was correlated with a 70 decrease in suicidal thoughts so again go f yourself you pathetic ape man okay so our everyone's up to speed a few points hunter first of all you appear to be about 13 years old but as far as i know you're actually a full grown man technically which means that you should understand by now that a weak argument doesn't become strong just by tacking an insult onto the end of it actually that makes your weak argument look even weaker and it makes you look like a child in the process and this is a special problem for you since you already look like a child and if you are going to go the insult route you probably don't want to throw terms like degenerate around remember you're the one in this conversation passionately defending the right of a doctor to give a child the same drug they use to chemically castrate sex offenders i'm on the anti child castration side discussion you're on the pro side so you're free to stake out that ground if you want but you are unfortunately precluded from ever calling anyone else a degenerate ever again in your entire life second i'm afraid that i'm not impressed by the ability to google a study that confirms whatever conclusion you'd already landed on and then fling it at the other side after briefly skimming the abstract okay it's not how you how you win an argument you know just go to google studies that confirm what i already believed oh here's one see the problem with the study food fight is that two can always play at that game and in this case i can play it better i have for example the most thorough study ever conducted on the subject which spanned 30 years and found that suicidality is highest for trans people 10 to 15 years after medical transition highest you on the other hand have one study that focuses on people who transitioned as adults not as children and which according to you found that there was no increase in suicide rate not that there was a notable decrease but that there was no increase and at the suicide rate was still much higher than the general population now you blindly declare that this that this higher rate of suicide was due to quote social issues not the transition because uh what you somehow know why all these people killed themselves how do you know that well i mean well you made it up of course and whatever the reason for the suicides the fact remains that the rate the suicide rate is still very high and so that would seem to be a pretty good indication that the transition meant to prevent that outcome failed to prevent it and this is a study you provided to prove your point you also give another study which claims uh these findings and i'm reading now quote in this perspective cohort of 104 trans and non-binary youths aged 13 to 20 years receipt of gender affirming care including puberty blockers and gender affirming hormones was associated with 60 percent lower odds of moderate or severe depression and 73 percent lower odds of suicidality okay well at least this one pretends to actually prove your point rather than directly refuting it like the other one but do you uh you know anything else about this study like who funded it how was it conducted how did they find their study subjects how did they how did the researchers guard against things like selection bias did they rely entirely on self-reported data do you understand how infamously unreliable self-reported data is how do they quantify suicidal thoughts a 70 percent decrease in suicidal thoughts how do you quantify that to begin with of course you haven't considered any of this but it doesn't really matter because there's a fatal problem here well there's a lot but let's just focus on one and it's it's the same one shared by nearly every study claiming to prove that gender affirming care has positive results the problem is this and you would notice if you read the thing that you googled which next time you should think about doing that the results are based on a 12 month follow-up okay they report that these kids 12 months after beginning the transition say that they feel better you know what that tells us you know what it proves absolutely nothing not one single thing i am not surprised that kids have been kids who have been told that transition will solve their problems would then report shortly afterwards that it has indeed solved their problems if you gave a 13 year old a really ugly tattoo it's pretty certain that he'd still think it was cool when he's 14 and if the third if the 13 year old gets tattooed and then it 14 says i still like this tattoo it would be very stupid for you as an adult to say well look this he turns out getting the tattoo was a good idea he's 14 and he still likes it so the question is not how the 13 year old feels at 14 the question is how will he feel five years from now 10 years 20 years how does the adult version of the same child feel now that he has to live with the consequences of decisions that he made as a child regret is not likely to set in within the first year though it very well might usually it takes longer and you'll notice that many of these studies they stop doing the follow-ups with the patients at precisely the moment when the regret might really start setting in what we need are long-term follow-ups with people who transitioned as children but as i'm constantly having to explain there aren't any reliable studies like that because we just started doing this to children on this scale very recently so these kids are the test case they are the guinea pigs but anyway you never answer my question i asked for evidence that puberty blockers are life-saving you shouldn't need a survey to tell me that it should be a relatively easy thing to quantify there was no such thing as a puberty blocker until recently and if these blockers are life-saving medications then that would mean that billions of children lived at a time historically when the life-saving medication was not available to them and that would mean that a great many children died because they didn't have access to it okay then give me some examples who died due to a lack of access to this life-saving drug you're saying it's life-saving that should mean that many many children have died because they didn't have access to it so can you give me some examples how many children died because there were no puberty blockers available we should be able to see in history this enormous wave of child deaths due to a lack of chemical castration do we i mean i could quite easily point to deaths that happened because penicillin hadn't been invented yet for example so where are the historical deaths that we can pin on a lack of puberty blockers this is a life-saving drug is now what you said where's the historical evidence do you have even a single shred of it no of course you know that is interesting though that you you can't bring yourself to endorse cross-text hormones and surgeries for minors at first plus this would this would seem to make you slightly more reasonable than the other child sexual mutilation advocates but upon further evaluation it actually makes your position even more incoherent if that's possible after all the very medical establishment that you trust implicitly when it comes to puberty blockers also says that hormones and surgeries can be life-saving medical interventions for children so why do you trust them on the blockers but not on the hormones and surgeries if they're lying or let's be very generous catastrophically mistaken about the latter two doesn't it stand to reason that the same would apply to the first blockers hormone surgeries they're all part of the same process of medical quote affirmation what you're saying is that you agree with step one but you think they're wrong about steps two and three this might not be an insurmountable logical problem for you except that the only reason you agree with step one is simply because you're taking their word for it they claim that puberty blockers save lives and you believe them but why don't you believe the rest of the story they tell and if you don't then have you considered that your skepticism should be more consistently applied third finally have you thought about just using your common sense maybe as that thought occurred to you you tried to rely on studies that blew up in your face you want to appeal to authority except that even you can't figure out whether you should trust these authorities or not you're all kinds of confused you don't know which way is up which way is down maybe consider applying your own mental faculties to this situation here's a very simple question does it make sense to you does it actually make sense that a young boy might in some sense be a girl somehow necessitating the use of chemical castration drugs to suppress some of the physical effects of male puberty does that proposition make sense does it make sense to take a boy who is male and try to alter uh you know him in some way in an effort to make him into or make it appear as though he has been made into something he can never be doesn't make sense to medically affirm the boy's confusion rather than trying to treat and heal the confusion I think you know that it doesn't I think you're smart enough to know that it doesn't at least I'm going to give you the benefit of the doubt on that point a benefit that you perhaps haven't earned though you have earned your turn today being of course canceled and that'll do it for this portion of shows and move over to the members block hope to see you there if not talk to you tomorrow godspeed you"
