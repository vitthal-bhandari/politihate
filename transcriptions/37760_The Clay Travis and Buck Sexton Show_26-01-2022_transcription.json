Join the millions of listeners on the iHeartRadio app. Free never sounded so good. Hi iHeartRadio. Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Third hour of the Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show is here, my friends. We are so pleased, so honored to have you with us as always. Actually, a lot of news today, not just analysis, conversation, bringing you up to date on some stores we've been following for a long time. But the big breaking news was the retirement this year of Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, which means there will be a Democrat appointed Biden appointed Supreme Court nominee to take that position. And we've got a big year for Supreme Court cases in general that won't be affected by this per se. But in this year on the Supreme Court, you're going to have some major monumental decisions that could be coming down. So be watching that one closely and, Clay, and I'll be giving you a lot of analysis on that. Because of now we still do not have any Russian invasion of Ukraine to speak of over 130,000 Russian troops spread around the eastern border of Ukraine in what seems to be a preparation for invasion. Some people are even talking about a Russian blitzkrieg that could topple the government in Ukraine and try to overrun all their forces in rapid fashion. Pentagon is right now actually on Fox. You've got Pentagon spokesman Kirby talking about sanctions and all the rest of it. Anything comes to that. We'll let you know. You've got the White House briefing up in just a few moments too. If Jen Psaki says anything well, I was going to say worthwhile. It's not says anything that we have to either refute or make fun of or usually both. We'll certainly bring that to you as soon as it happens. But I saw this and I was hoping we maybe move a little bit into discussion of where the Biden regime is right now with with the economy and a few other topics. But I got to tell you, let me by the way, before you get to that, I got to give you props. You drove like the entire news cycle yesterday with your analyzing the border in Ukraine versus the complete lack of focus on our border on the southern border. I can't tell you the number of places I have seen since our show yesterday for people who were listening, Buck made a really what I think is a student observation that the Biden administration is far more concerned about the border sanctity of Ukraine than they are the border sanctity of our own country and in fact has given far more attention to what might happen on the border with Ukraine than they have with what might happen in the United States at our southern border. And so you laid all that out yesterday. And then what happens, basically the entire apparatus of media discussion follows that throughout the rest of the day. So I can give you props. I hope people recognize that Fox News dot com picked it up and wrote an entire article about it out of our show. And by the way, I think that's a good sign for the show that we are having influence beyond the audience that we have right here. We love everybody out there listening, but the way that you change things is not just talking to your island of listeners, even though it is a big island, it's to influence the overall scope of discourse. And, and I think as it pertains to Ukraine in the border, you did that on behalf of the show yesterday. It was well done. Thank you so much, sir. I'd say I feel like our mission here continues to be. I've said before, we're the unsingable aircraft carrier of free speech, but I really also mean that aircraft carrier analogy goes to, I want other conservatives to know that they can stop on our deck refuel, go take their mission, go do what they got to do. You know, I want us to be a gathering place, say a resupply, a strategic forward operating base, if you will, for all of our fellow conservatives making the case. That's why we try to borrow a term from the left. The platform people, I prefer my aircraft analogy, but the platform people, and we're going to continue to do that here because we're about the movement and the team folks. We're about winning. We're not, we're not trying to play any of that petty nonsense within our own team on the right. And, and, you know, I just saw this in the, in the, in the commercial break. We're in a moment ago. And I just want to bring folks up to speed up because the White House just put this out apparently. And I mean, you got kids. So you're actually somebody who has to deal with this decision. I know a lot of our listeners have children that are dealing with this decision. This is from the New York Post just now. The White House said Wednesday, the COVID-19 vaccine regime for kids younger than four years old will likely be three doses when it is approved. Two clinical trials of the Pfizer vaccine on children age six months to two years old and ages two to four underway. But the older group hasn't yet met standards according to White House chief medical advisor, Dr. Anthony Fauci at a press conference. Dose and regimen for children six months, 24 months work well. But it turned out the other group from 24 months to four years did not yet reach the level of non inferiority. So the studies are continued. Clay, three shots for your three year old? Well, and don't mistake what he's saying there. The shots didn't work. And so now they are saying you need to get more shots. Let me just, I have a 13 year old actually turning 14 tomorrow. Maybe early birthday to my oldest son went out to dinner with the family last night to help celebrate. I've got a 11 year old and I've got a seven year old. So I've got an eighth grader, a fifth grader and a first grader. There's no way on earth that I am getting them the COVID vaccine. And I don't even think it's fair to call it a COVID vaccine anymore. It's a COVID shot. If you are in my opinion, great thing about being a parent is at least so far you get to make choices for your kids based on all of the data, all the analysis, everything that you have learned as an adult. And by the way, every parent out there knows you make a lot of bad decisions too, right? Parenting is about trying to limit the bad decisions and maximize the good decisions to allow your kids to have the best possible outcomes. No parent gets everything right and no parent gets everything right with every kid. But if you are getting your child who is under the age of four, a COVID shot, I think you are bonkers. I think you are banshee level crazy based on all the data that I have seen. Now, unlike all these mask idiots out there, I'm not telling you, Hey, you have to wear a mask. I even still, I see a lot of young kids wearing masks. I think it's awful, but that's their parents right to make that choice. I'm not saying you can't do it. And I'm not anti-vax because somebody's going to grab this audio and they're going to be like, Clay Travis is anti-vax. He's an awful parent. He's trying to kill. No, I look at the data and decide in a rational, not fearful, not emotion that I can make for my family. And there is no way on earth based on the data that's out there that my young kids are in danger from COVID or in need of a COVID shot, not anti-vaccine, measles, mom's rubella, all that stuff when they're young, I got my kids the vaccines. Okay. But I am anti the COVID vaccine for young children. And I can't make it any clearer to anyone than saying that's the choice I'm making for my family. You have the right as a parent out there to make your own choice, but, but remember in the press conference, when some loser reporter, idiot reporter out there asked Biden, hey, when are we going to be able to get COVID shots for kids that are under five years old? And I was thinking to myself, who are the parents out there that are clamoring for their under five year old kids to get the COVID shot when they have zero risk whatsoever. And by the way, when frankly, I don't think these COVID shots are giving them very much protection as Fauci himself just said, they can't even figure out how to get the right immune response. The right immune response is get the facts, get, get the virus and get over it. That's the perfect immune response. That's how kids handle most viruses. There's also a huge tell here and, and I know we've discussed it, but we have to keep bringing these things into the conversation because they intentionally exclude these things from the conversation. Natural immunity. Think about the context that we're entering now when they're talking about getting kids shots. The chance that most of these children that we're talking about now have been exposed to and already beaten COVID and likely have lasting and perhaps even life long immunity against whatever the COVID strain is that we're now trying to deal with is very high. They make zero allowance for this whatsoever. They have no interest in addressing this whatsoever. And you can just tell all along, there's been this, there's been this completely unscientific approach to pretending natural immunity. Now the studies come out that let you know, you know, six months ago when, when the big dare or whatever it was, four or five months ago when the big Delta surge was happening, it was better if you had natural immunity from a previous COVID infection than the vaccine. Fact, that's now come out. What do we think we're going to find out in six months that that was some one off in the world of nature? No, but Clay, they don't care even though we used to be told that 40% of COVID cases were asymptomatic. So if that was the CDC's figure in the summer of 2020, I've never forgotten. That's part of how the justified mass, by the way, it always changes based on whatever restriction they need, right? So they said 40% are asymptomatic. If 40% of cases are asymptomatic in the general population, what percentage of cases are asymptomatic among children who we know all along have been much faster at clearing this? They make no effort to get us that data, those numbers whatsoever. It's disgraceful. We really should have since they're using kids like pin cushions out there to test them on the COVID vaccine, but why don't we have testing to know what percentage of kids have COVID antibodies? Wouldn't you liked? I would love to know that. I would my kids too, my youngest are in public school. I would love to know what percentage of kids. I think that would be instructive and knowledgeable data that parents would like to have. What percentage of kids in any given city or in any given school district already have at this point antibodies to COVID that seems like it would be a wildly useful statistic and you can test inside of a school. Like I would be comfortable if they sit in and said, Hey, we're thinking about testing at your kids, public school, your elementary school. Would you allow us to take a blood sample and check and see if your kids have had COVID? I would love to know that information. And then also be able to extrapolate it to the larger community and the larger school system because that would be important information for all these teachers out there that are continuing to say, Oh my God, we're in such danger. We can't go back and teach. Well, if you knew that 75% of kids have already been exposed to COVID, which I don't think would be a crazy number at all, wouldn't that influence in many ways the public policy discussion, finding masks and also surrounding kids being able to attend school because it would limit what risk factors are actually in play for so many people out there. And obviously a lot of kids 12 and up have gotten the vaccine. That's the choice you can make. I just think this is madness. Young kids newborns, six month olds. I mean, what are you talking about? It's insanity. Imagine a close family relative sending you an email today with a link attached. The note on the email says, click on this when you want to smile. And when you do, you're immediately your home family movies rather show up from long ago with the smiling faces and voices of so many relatives and friends. You're just a wash in those memories.

Buck, I don't know if you saw this yet, but all of a sudden left wingers have discovered this you pin swimmer story. Have you noticed this? I have not seen this. No, tell me your time yesterday had an article about it about the controversy and they said, so right wing media outlets are fed up about as if being in favor of women competing against women is a super right wing idea. And they're trying to pull. They're trying to turn it into a political issue. No, look, if you're a man and you decide to compete against women, we're not making that issue. But you chose to do that. And I don't even see this as remotely. I mean, I know that people sometimes fight against this idea, but I really do see this as not a particularly political issue because there's nobody out there arguing. For instance, if you just take outside male and female sex, if somebody was like, Hey, I think this 240 pound boxer should get to compete as a flyweight. You would say, no, no, no, no, you know, flyweight boxers are 120 pounds or less. It would be fundamentally unfair for a 240 pound heavyweight boxer. Obviously he would be the best boxer at 120 pounds. And I coach 10 and 11 year old basketball and if coach little league and all different sorts of stuff, if suddenly I trotted out a 16 year old on my team as a mustache fully grown, that kid would be the best kid on the court, but everybody in the stands and everybody on the opposing team. That's why we have birth certificates would say, no, no, no, no, you don't have to say don't get to bring in a 16 year old to compete in 10 year old athletics. And so this idea that you can just parachute in a man and that he's going to be able to compete against women because he now identifies as a woman as this being a right wing issue. What I mean, I mean, this honestly, but because I read the New York Times piece and they're trying to turn it into a real strong political wedge issue. What percentage of people in America think that a biological man in sports should be able to compete against biological women, like straight up if we were pulling this two or so percent. So I'd have to say this, I think you would get 20% of Americans right now to say to a pollster that they're okay with biological males, also just males competing against females. But I think that the moment, I think the number of people who would be okay if they were competing or rather they had a family member, a child college age competing with that situation is less than 1%. I think essentially no one who is touched by the issue would ever say that because it's so obviously unfair, right? It's such a common sense based issue. But you know, it's interesting, Clay, there's actually, there's some interesting studies out and you can see, I'll just tell you, I'm reading this book, it's just called testosterone because I want to know more about the gender, the gender debate. And one of the things that keeps coming up, you know, about about trans, it trans issues and all the rest of it is that they try to, within science, there's an effort right now within the scientific community, scientific consensus, just like the Fauciites with the COVID stuff to say that testosterone doesn't really affect things as much as we think it does. And it certainly doesn't affect behavior, desire, all the sciences against that, but it is fashionable. All the actual data shows testosterone is enormously important, not just to your physicality, male versus female. And of course testosterone exists in women too, but it's the level of testosterone, not only your physicality, but also your, your behavior, your deportment, your desires, all that is affected by it, but they try to suppress this because it all, it goes to what we're saying. Male chemistry, this is actually about science. So I also think it ties in Buck with the way that we decide what's acceptable and unacceptable when it comes to fair competition. Barry Bonds and, uh, and Roger Klimans are two of the greatest baseball players of all time. They didn't get into the hall of fame because they used performance enhancing drugs. So when you change your gender, that's a pretty significant drug that you're allowed to use that also gender is performance enhancing. And I don't understand how you're not spending more time as a larger sports society talking about the analogy there. To me, it seems like there's a big connection. It's cruel and deeply anti-feminist, by the way, to allow this to happen. And just point that out too. All right. I love my my pillows. Clay's got Giza Dream sheets. I've got Giza Dream sheets.

Why should Americans care about what's happening in Ukraine? Because it goes to a very fundamental principle of of all nations, which is that our borders should be in violence, that our sovereignty should be respected. Sovereignty should be respected. That was the Deputy National Security Advisor, the Biden regime yesterday. Welcome back to the Clinton Buck Show. I just want to point out, sovereignty is really important when it is 5 or 6,000 miles away in a country that is not America and is not even close to America. That's very important. If we have to send troops, the Biden regime wants you to know, we've got to send a whole lot of missiles. I'm seeing the photos of more javelin anti-tank missiles. Remember, Obama administration actually refused to send Ukraine javelin anti-tank missiles to provocative. Trump came in because he's such a Russian stooge and sent javelin anti-tank missiles, a dragon of sniper rifles and other lethal munitions to Ukraine. And now we're sending a whole lot more, it seems, in the Biden regime's preparation for the possibility of invasion here. But it is fascinating, isn't it? Sovereignty is important for Ukraine and Clay, we have an obligation, and again, I'm speaking from the Biden regime point of view here, an obligation to take risks and perhaps even blood and treasure spent to protect Ukraine sovereignty. God forbid, but that could end up happening here. But our sovereignty, a couple of hundred thousand people coming in illegally every month, a massive wave of illegal migration that the Biden administration is essentially waving into the country, every state turning into a border state because they're putting them on planes. They're flying them from, you know, they're flying them from McCallen and from El Paso and from wherever to New Jersey and New York and California and Illinois. And you sit there and say, wait, so everyone else's sovereignty is important, but our sovereignty is racist, I guess. That's what we're told, racist. Not only that, the media will actually cover the Ukrainian border issues and not cover the United States border issues. I keep coming back to the Biden presser because it's a such a clear window into what media focus is on. Think about how many questions we got surrounding Ukraine and how many questions we got about the border. We didn't get a single question about the murder rate, which is skyrocketed in this country. I saw a data point out largest US cities buck up 44% the murder rate is since 2020, since 2019. So in 2020, we were up 30%. We were up again in 2021 such that we are up 44% since then. We didn't get a single question about murder. We didn't get a single question about the border. And what that says to me compared to all of the obsession that is there with Ukraine is very often the media's focus is far outside of the scope of what your average person is thinking about. So I'm glad to live in a place like Nashville because I think sometimes you get seduced by whatever your environment is. If you're in New York or LA where there's lots of media, you know what people ask, talk about here inflation being up massively, masks on their kids in school. They talk about whether or not they feel safe being able to go out into cities. All of those things are what is going to decide the election in 2022. Whatever happens in Ukraine is unlikely to be a major story, but for the fact that much like Afghanistan buck, it can reinforce the overall perception, which is accurate of incompetence. Or usually foreign affairs don't dictate local domestic politics. But when those foreign affairs, like what happened with Afghanistan, reinforces a level of incompetence that resonates with all of the issues that are going on today with inflation and the murder rate and the border failures and everything else, COVID failures that are going on, that's when it has a significance. And I think that's what's happening right now. I think we've learned a lesson over the last 20 years, not just about why we don't want to be building other societies, thousands of miles away for other cultures and other other groups of people that are not America. I think we've learned that lesson in ways that I can barely begin to express here on this show right now. But everyone knows what I'm talking about a rock Afghanistan. But beyond that, you know, one of the things, one of the aspects of Trump's populism that really caught on initially was this revolutionary idea at the time of focusing that the government of the American people should focus on the interest and protection of Americans first. That was all of a sudden, it was like, wait a second, what do you mean? Don't we have to ask the UN for permission before we think about Americans? I mean, don't we have to go to the IMF and wonder what our domestic policies or maybe we could have some UN observers for our elections to tell us how to really do it? The rejection of that ideology was one of the key factors in Donald Trump's rising to what they thought was the impossible win in 2016, right? And still the Trump movement continues on and we may very well have another Trump presidency going forward as we know. But that that's something that I think you've seen the so called intelligentsia, a word taken from the Russian, by the way, that people learn about the original Russian intelligentsia that have a very different feeling about what they actually are all about. But anyway, conversation for another day. You can see, Clef, heads of late nights reading about presoviate Russia. It's very, very instructive about our current times with authoritarianism, the Democrats. You're one of the only people in America reading about presoviate Russia in any part of your day other than like Russian history professors somewhere. I do think to the point on Ukraine, when we went into Afghanistan, there was at least the argument directly connected to 9 11. We're going into advance American interests because these people attacked us. If we could go back in time, the right time to leave Afghanistan, in my opinion, and declare victory, which would have been a much stronger American foreign policy perspective, was right after we killed Osama bin Laden. If Barack Obama, I bet had it to do all over again, that's a clear line of demarcation. We went into Afghanistan. We have caught all the people responsible for attacking our country. Now we're going to leave. It would have avoided the disaster that Biden got there. But with Ukraine right now, the American public, the narrative of why we should care, there's no connection there. And so the idea of going in with American interests associated with Ukraine, I think, doesn't pass the smell test for most Americans who are even more skeptical after the failure in Afghanistan, after we went into Iraq on the presumption of weapons and mass destruction. This was another thing that Trump was willing to talk about, which was almost verboten in Republican politics. It was, hey, I don't think the decision to go into Iraq was the right one. Remember, I mean, that was a revolutionary thing for him to say that I think a lot of people responded to that that that connected this idea of American exceptionalism. Let's focus on America. We don't need to be the world's police. We have a Republican, a conservative base in this country, roughly age, let's call it 20 to 45. Well, 20 would be a little until recently we were still in Afghanistan, but let's say roughly 20 to 45. We have a conservative base of people who, and maybe my math is a lot. You could say into their fifties, but I'm talking about over the last 20 years. We've had people that have experienced the realities of an overactive and an overreaching foreign policy from the smartest minds in DC, by the way, on a bipartisan basis, Republican and Democrat, but the people that are listening this now who served the millions of Americans who served in those countries. I think saw a reality up close and personal in the most and the clearest possible ways of what it means when you take the conversations about sovereignty and universal human rights from a think tank near, you know, near Capitol Hill or in foggy bottom and turn it into we're going to send a bunch of other people to fight a war in a far off country. And we're not exactly entirely sure what not only the mission is going to be in the end, but why were there in the first place? I mean, certainly in the case of Iraq, that's been the conversation and with the extension of the Afghanistan mission too. So I think that's, this is why I'm pretty confident that the American people don't want anything in Ukraine, Clay, don't want us to be in Ukraine in any, in any way that would get us involved in that conflict. But it goes back to your point about what does this show us about the Biden regime? I mean, they're floundering. Yes. They're, they're having real problems. And one way to get the country mobilized behind you, if you can pull it off, if you look back at the realities of our past, have a war somewhere. And that's what really concerns me.

News for those of you who maybe got in your cars late, just as Stephen Breyer on the Supreme Court has announced that news broke right as we started the show today that he is going to be stepping down. And so sometime in the summer, there will be a Senate judiciary battle. One would presume over who that next nominee is going to be. Evidently Breyer is scheduled to officially announce that decision tomorrow to step down. Buck there's all sorts of craziness going on out there in the world on a day to day basis. By the way, thanks to Carrie Lucas, mom in Virginia, five kids, the mask mandate. We had a great discussion about that with her. She was our only guest today in the first hour. But I saw this story and you've got the details on it. We were just talking about it during the break. You know, things are wild everywhere, but a woman got attacked by monkeys. Like what exactly is this story? It's like playing the game style. This is crazy. Just a few days ago, it was on Friday, a woman happened upon the scene of a trailer crash, a pickup towing a trailer with a hundred monkeys. And she tried to assist and one of the monkeys, as they are known to do for those who have spent time around monkeys, spit at her and hit her. And now she has developed what is described as pink eye symptoms, but a woman happened upon a crash of lab. I guess there, I don't know what they're doing with these monkeys. I got it. I got to find that out. Oh, they're being transported to a zoo. That makes sense. Oh, wait, at the time Fallon said she learned the crates contain monkeys. She assumed they're being transported to a zoo because the driver never mentioned anything about the monkeys being imported and transported to a lab. Oh, no, that's the USA Today story. So they are testing, transport monkeys. This is, I believe, very close to the beginning of the movie, 28 days later, which is terrifying. And also the movie outbreak, which I think involves a monkey biting a person. So we used to do for people out there who are outkick listeners back in the day on our sports soccer radio show, we would do animal thunderdome stories and we were down in Fort Myers. And we were like, oh, I'm not going to be a question from a guy in the crowd who's like, can you bring back an animal thunderdome segment? And animal thunderdome was basically people getting attacked by animals. This is a pretty tough spot to be in. You don't want to hear that you have developed some sort of medical response to your interaction with laboratory monkeys. I mean, that's of the sentences that if you think you're having a rough day, unless you have been attacked by laboratory monkeys and develop some sort of reaction to that, your day's not that I'm at. Imagine you call your, your, your physician, you know, you're like, hey, doc, I got to come in and see is it what happens? Like, well, there was a lab escape of a bunch of monkeys. I don't know what they were doing the test with, but one of them spat at me. And now I can't really see out of one of my eyes. Like, I'm, I think the doc might show up with one of those big hazmat suits. You know, that by the way, we'll stop the virus. Um, just to, just to be clear, that actually would be a favor of a hazmat suit there. I might be in a hazmat suit. If I was that doctor, what is the scariest mono, mono animal for clay that mono, mono animal encounters that you're talking to animal thunder dome for clay Travis. I used to play this game of my, my siblings and my parents all the time. We played the, which animal would win game, but scariest animal mono, a mono clay. I, I see, I think water animals are scarier because you can't necessarily know where they are. So I think, I think a saltwater crocodile, like a big crocodile somewhere in Australia, like you're just, you know, walking along the bank and next thing, you know, a 15 foot crocodile comes out of the water after you is scarier than a lion or a tag personally. Maybe a hippo. Like I always see these people, you see these stories like, Hey, I was on an African safari and we decided to go down a river filled with hippos and like the hippos attacked. And I always think like, could you not see the hippos from outside of the water? Like, there's a lot of their, their very, their very good stealthy and their very territorial. It turns out hippos are quite dangerous. And there is in an otherwise horrible movie based on a Michael Crichton novel and I like Michael Crichton a lot Congo, there is a whole hippo attack scene for those. I think it's the only one I've ever seen on the silver screen. The hippos that go out for them, but that will actually happen in real life. I think hippos, we could, you guys could fact check me on this. Well, this is what happens. I think hippos are the most dangerous land animal in Africa, meaning they kill more people than lions, they kill more people than the other things that you're scared because a lot of people are scared of crocodiles, but the hippo are so territorial. And are you with me? I mean, I would love to go to Africa and go on a safari at some point, but I don't have any desire to be in like a canoe in an African river that's filled with hippos. It always feels to me like you're playing like canoes by themselves, by the way, are easy to tip. If there are crocodiles and hippos all in a river, why could you not just look into the river from out? I don't have a desire to be in the water. I think the worst way to go would be if one of those 30 foot long anacondas that they've occasionally strangled you. I think that's one of the, you know, cause you hate snakes, at least with like a lion or a bear, you probably get, you know, you get got by the neck and you know, it's not going to last that long. The snake, I think the snakes that were, oh, another, another horrible movie in a kind of movie. A lot of a chain low in anaconda. She was actually conservative stalwart father of Angelina Jolie on blank. John Voigt. That's right. He was in anaconda. That's a, that's a pretty strong, uh, that's a pretty strong cast to have John Voigt and JLo in a movie about a deadly anaconda. Yeah. But I just think snakes, man, snakes are bad with their own voice or even very anti-snake. Very anti-snake. Very anti-snake. I used to say this is a good question for you as a single man. If you walk into an apartment, you're in New York or a house or whatever, and a woman who is single keeps snakes, right? Like she has cages of snakes. How many would she, like, what's the line? I would, I would say, like, we're talking about breaking out the crazy hot scale and some degree of granularity here. That's what I'd say. So how many, how many snakes is too many, no matter how hot the girl is, where you would be like, I can't date it for the single guys out there. Listen to this. If she's got a pet snake, think twice, if she's got a pet tarantula run. Okay. I'll just tell you that. These are the rules. I don't make them on six snakes. I don't think I could date a girl that had snakes in her house. Like I would, I wouldn't be able to sleep at night. Yeah. I, I agree with that. I think that's a sound rule, Clay Travis, a sound rule indeed. See safety tips here in the program. Don't pull over if you see a hundred monkeys running out of a truck, a truck that's turned over. Let someone else handle it. And no dating ladies with, with tarantulas or a snake large enough to make you meet your maker. All right. That's going to be it for today. Some important news at the end there. Back with you tomorrow diving into all that matters."
