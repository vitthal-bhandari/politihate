    "text": " This episode is brought to you by Columbia Sportswear. It's snowing again, and that windchill is killer. But you're not worried about that, because you shot the Omni Heat Infinity Collection. It's warmth perfected with tiny gold dots that reflect your body heat inside, and protect you from the cold outside. No snow or chilly temps can stop you now. Go out anyway. Shot the Omni Heat Infinity Collection now at Columbia.com slash infinity. Welcome. Welcome to Fearless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. Happy Tuesday to you and yours. I'm so sorry I wasn't here to say happy Monday to you yesterday. But today, we will do our best to have a terrific, terrific show. Normally I sit here very confident, like we're going to have a great show. I'm not confident today, not because I haven't prepared. It's because I'm a little unsure if I've chosen the right topic. And so I'm going to do my best. It's what my gut tells me to do in terms of topic. But I have to admit, I'm not a thousand percent sure. Should I talk about what has gone on with me in the last 24, 36 hours, and why I'm frustrated and why I wasn't here on Monday? Or should I just let it go, have it go unexplained, not make too much of it, and just move on to what's going on in the world. There's a state of a union address tonight with Joe Biden. There's things going on in the sports world that I wanted to talk about yesterday. Should I just talk about them today and pretend like nothing has happened? I've chosen the direction I'm going because I do think it's going to be edifying for you and I think I can package it in a way that it has a larger point about what's going on in American society. So I'm going to ask for some patience from you as I unpack all of this. I don't know how much time I'm going to need to unpack it. I plan to get to Delano in the second half of the show, let him contribute to the conversation that I'm going to unpack here at the beginning of the show. But I feel good about it, but I'm not a thousand percent confident. I'm just caught in the middle. I could just move on or I could walk you through what has happened and why I'm frustrated and how I think it relates to everything that's going on with men and the world and modern culture. So I'm going to do that, but I want to start by saying I was out of town. I was down in Florida and when I got back last night and when I finally climbed in the bed around 9.30, 10 o'clock last night, I was reminded once again having just slept in a hotel, very nice hotel down in Florida. I was reminded again why I love cozy earth. There was a difference between the sheets I slept on in a nice, I'd say four and a half star hotel, it's a western down in Florida. It's a nice hotel, nice bed, nice bedding, the whole nine yards. But was it as good as what I have at home with my cozy earth sheets? No, it wasn't. These cozy earth temperature controlled sheets make a difference. That's why it's an authentic recommendation that I'm giving you. I can tell the difference. I slept. But it's not just my bedding, look I got good mattresses and the whole nine yards. It's the sheets. They're absolutely incredible. Cozy earth customers have penned over 5,000 well earned, 5,000 well earned five star reviews on their website. It's because they deserve it. Cozy earth bedding is temperature regulating. Now you can sleep more comfortably year round. I sure do. I certainly did last night. Whether it's their luxury seats available in five awesome colors, lounge wear, pajamas or premium waffle bath towels, you'll love shopping at Cozy earth. Hurry save 35% on cozy earth bedding right now. Go to cozyearth.com slash fearless. Enter my promo code fearless at checkout and save 35%. That's cozyearth.com slash fearless. I can't get any more authentic than that. I just was able to tell the difference. What I got home from Florida got into my bed. This is why I appreciate these guys for cozy earth. Fantastic job. All right. So let me begin the unpacking of and I'm confident you're going to enjoy and see the benefits of this conversation. I want I'm very frustrated. Yesterday was a very big day in the sports world between Kyrie Irving and demanding a trade and being traded to the Dallas Mavericks. Great topic to discuss. You should go. I've written a column about Kyrie on the blaze and talking about how Kyrie's freedom frustrates annoys bothers all these people in corporate media that know they're enslaved and they're not as free as Kyrie Irving. And so I've written a column all about it. Love to have unpacked all of this yesterday. It's a great topic. The John Moran situation. Another awesome fantastic topic that we could have got into yesterday. I don't know if you guys are fully aware but are surely because the media didn't make as big a deal of this as they could have in my opinion. But John Moran and someone in his traveling party or whatever the Indiana Pacers felt like they were threatened and that someone in their traveling party someone in John Moran's car friends otherwise pointed a razor led dot red dot into their car. Would have loved to talk about that and what's going on with the Memphis Grizzlies and the Grizzlies and all their players including John Moran taking on the mentality of Memphis. Would have loved to talk about that. Would have loved yesterday to have talked about the Grammy Awards and how satanic they were Sunday night on CBS. Another topic to illustrate and hammer home my point that this whole music industry is satanic all of it and the Grammys put that in everybody's face Sunday night would have been an awesome topic for us on this show on Monday. But I couldn't do it because I was in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. At the behest and the request of a man named Patrick Bette David. Patrick Bette David has a company called Value Tame. For those of you that are unaware he's very popular over YouTube. Many of you when you hear me say the name Value Tame and Patrick Bette David you know exactly who I'm talking about. Some of you may not though because again YouTube you can have a massive audience on YouTube but there could be a whole segment of people in the YouTube world that have no idea that you even exist. But Value Tame it has 4 million YouTube subscribers. Patrick Bette David has interviewed Kobe Bryant to Jordan Peterson to Andrew Tate to Neil DeGrasse Tyson. Andrew Tate has interviewed some of everybody. He's popular and he's basically a knockoff or the conservative version of Joe Rogan. Not as popular as Joe Rogan but really popular and really popular interviewing conservative people. And just anybody he can. I'm sure he'd like to interview anybody but his values tend to line up more with conservatives. He became really popular quite honestly. He started interviewing mobsters. Sammy the Bull, Gravano and real life mobsters and that made him popular and then he started enhancing his brand by talking to high profile conservatives like Jordan Peterson. I think he interviewed Kobe 4 or 5 years ago that's still up prominently on the Value Tame it YouTube page. But in mid December a guy that works their head of talent relations wrote me an email asking me if I would be interested in appearing on Patrick Bette David's Value Tame it podcast. And I sent back, hey what do you want to interview me about? Or what would you like because it was the Fearless Podcast and I say what do you want to interview Whitlock about? Or what if, can't remember if I said me or them. I know exactly what they wrote back to me and I'll read it to you. Thanks for getting back to me. The interview would cover Jason's career with ESPN and the Blaze. His show Fearless with Jason Whitlock as well as current events, trending topics and stories in the news. A full list of topics would be provided to Jason prior to the interview for his review. If possible we'd like to see if Jason's available for an in-person interview from our Fort Lauderdale Florida studios sometime in 2023. A value tamer will provide round trip airfare, hotel, ground transportation. Please let me know if there's any additional information I can provide. Please for your time and consideration sign Robert Gargullio I think, head of Talent Relations. That's in mid-December. Me and Robert go back and forth over email throughout parts of December, January and finally you know because it's very hard during football season I don't really like to travel. I like to be here, do this show. I take this show obviously very importantly it's my life's work and mission at the moment. It's something fearless, it's something this audience is very important to me and Mondays quite honestly during football season are clearly our most popular shows. People love to see me, Steve Kim and Jason Brown talk football. These are a big deal. I agreed to do it this past Monday yesterday because there's no NFL game. There's a week off between the Super Bowl and the conference championships. There's a week of delay before the Super Bowl kicks off and so I was like well I'm not going to talk about a flag football pro bowl game with Steve Kim and these guys and so this Monday might be the perfect opportunity for me to get away, do an interview with Patrick Bette David. It'll be great marketing for this show, good platform for me to talk about what we're trying to do with this show. Patrick Bette David based on his history and all the people he's interviewed and the interviews I've seen he's very respectful. He'll ask tough questions, he'll ask great questions, chance to you know he'll give you two two and a half hours. Again it's like the conservative version of Joe Rogan, no problem. It works in my schedule, let's do it. So I fly down to Fort Lauderdale, Florida to do this interview. My flights are all delayed on Sunday through no fault of anybody other than these airlines are a hot mess. I don't get in until late Sunday night, I was supposed to get there early Sunday afternoon, wake up the next day to do the interview, I think it's scheduled at 9 a.m., 9 a.m., yeah Eastern time. Get arrive at the studio at 845, sitting in a green room and Patrick Bette David walks into the green room that I'm waiting in and strikes up some small talk and I'm sitting there. You go down there and the valuetainment studios and building in office spaces are really impressive. According to the internet, Patrick Bette David has made a ton of money I think in the insurance industry and other industries. The internet says he's worth $200 million by the looks of his office space and the number of employees at this valuetainment that looks accurate. It looks like they have 50, 75 employees based on the office space and what I could see, God may have 50 employees working for him. It's certainly an impressive set of offices and studio space. When he walks in my green room I was like, hey man, I enjoy what you do, I have respect for it, I wasn't expecting all of this, this is really impressive. He makes small talk telling me how he's followed my work and how he respects what I do and then he says to me, hey, what's your take on Roland Martin? And I go Scooby-Doo on him. And I go, well, he's a stalker of mine, he's a troll of mine over social media but I don't think much of him, I don't think he's a serious person. And then Patrick McDavid asked me another question about Roland and I really, what's it going on? And then he drops and he goes, what do you think about debating Roland Martin? And I go, why would I debate Roland Martin? What's this about? Well, you know, I just like to have both sides and blah, blah, blah and I go, Roland Martin, I go, he's a troll, he's not a serious person, he's not interested in sincere engagement. That's someone I muted over social media four or five years ago, he's been trolling me and I go, and four or five years ago I had the guy he wanted an interview, I gave him an interview, invited him to my home in Los Angeles, sat down with him for two hours in an interview and the interview was disingenuous in a waste of my time. Roland Martin isn't interested in an exchange of ideas, he just talks and talks and talks and throws out accusations and if a question's not going or a conversation isn't going the direction he wants, he just switches topics. Mostly the interview was me listening to Roland Martin talk, he's just not interested in sincere engagement, it's all a stick. He wants internet, he wants social media fame, he wants clips, he can put out that distort the conversation and to hype himself up. The guy's a troll, I don't have an interest. We wanted to have you enrolling on a panel discussion, I go, a panel discussion, that's not what I remember you guys suggesting to me and he circled back, Patrick Ray David did, circled back again asking me to do a debate with Roland Martin and he tells me that look, it would be great, you'd have a moderator, I would be the moderator and I would be on your side and I was like, I don't need anybody on my side because I don't have an interest in debating someone like Roland Martin, he's a troll, he's not a serious person. So then after about 10 minutes, Patrick Ray David pivots to okay, well we'll interview you first and then we'll have Roland Martin come on to be interviewed. And Patrick Ray David walks away and goes off wherever he's going to his office or talk to his producers and I sit down in the green room and try to collect, I was like, what did I agree to? Because I want to live up to my word. What did I agree to and I couldn't remember off the top of my head and so I hunted down the email, I hunted down the email to refresh my memory of what it is I agreed to and what they requested and what they requested is what I read you in that email. The interview would cover Jason's career with ESPN and the Blaze, his show with Fearless, Fearless with Jason as well as current events, trending topics and stories in the news, a full list of topics will be provided to Jason prior to the interview for his review. And so once I re-familiarized myself with what I had agreed to, I said, okay, I'm out of here. And I got up, walked out of the room, walked out the door and started walking to a UPS store that was across the street or this shop, what do you call it? It's not a shop in my strip mall. There's a strip mall across the street and I started walking to this strip mall across the street because I'm going to call it Uber and take a ride back to my hotel. And so I probably get 50 yards, 75 yards on my walk out of the value-tainment business and I hear this producer, Jason, Jason, and I just keep walking because I got nothing to say to these guys. I just keep walking. Then maybe three, five seconds later I hear Patrick Bette David, Jason, Jason, and I just keep walking because I don't have anything to say to these guys. I've taken time out of my schedule to come down to Florida. I didn't ask, no one was paying me. No one was paying me. I had taken time out of my schedule and taken time away from my own show. Again, I thought the interview would be good for me to sit down with an interviewer who could probe me and I can explain what we're doing here at Fearless and what I'm doing with my career to a different audience. So there was some benefit. I wasn't down here handing out charity. But I also wasn't looking for anything and certainly if they had told me that, hey, Jason, we want to put you in a debate with a clown who you've already debated, who's not interested in a legitimate conversation, I wouldn't be utilizing my time this way. I wouldn't take away from the product that I owe you to go debate a clown. It doesn't advance what I'm doing in any way. And so Patrick Bette David races and catches me at a stop sign, a stop light because I'm waiting for the light to turn red and get the sign that I can cross the street. I'm stopped there. He catches me and he starts telling me that, hey, man, look, just come back and we'll just do a separate interview with you and it won't have anything to do with Roland Martin. And I'm like, why would I believe you? I don't know you. I just met you but the foundation of what we're starting here is based on a lie and based on you talking me into flying to Florida and abandoning my own show based on a lie. Why would I do that? And he kept making his case and eventually I said, hey, man, I'm a 55 year old man. I don't have this kind of time to waste. I go, you're according to everything I've read and your whole brand, you're a businessman. Surely you understand that I'm in business with the blaze and that I accept and get a significant sum of money for doing a show in conjunction with the blaze. And you just talk me up on a lie into abandoning my responsibilities and my partnership with the blaze to do something for you that it just doesn't make sense. And I go, you're a businessman. Surely you can understand. This does not sound business. What you just did and what you just provoked me into doing. I don't think he ever apologized but he seemed to acknowledge that and then he started telling me, what's your speaking fee? What do you get for speaking? I'll pay you whatever it is. It's a total misread and miscalculation of me. And I don't expect him to be an expert on Jason Whitlock. If you're authentically inviting someone down to basically do a two hour interview, you would think you'd do some research. And if you do any research, any adult objective, mature, research of me is like, you're not going to lie to me and then fix it with money. You're not, I'm really, really old school. If any, I don't care if you hate me or you can hate my guts, you can be totally bought into the rig job against me that I'm a terrible person. But there's no evidence. There's no proof that I have a tolerance for people lying to me. It would be just the opposite. If someone lies to me, oh yeah, I'm going to invest this much in this project and now I'm not going to do it and no one's going to tell me about, my history's littered with this. I don't like being lied to and I take a man very seriously at his word and there's no amount of money that fixes that. There's no, I'm just not that guy because that's how seriously I take my word. When I give you my word, death, illness, being held hostage, it's going to take something catastrophic for me not to live up to my word. And then if I don't live up to my word, I'm going to take action to address it, apologize for it, make it good and I just take my word very seriously. And so when a man lies to me, it's a deal breaker. I understand misunderstandings. I understand accidental. But these people lied to me and I'm going to walk you through how I know they lied to me and the whole thing was based in dishonesty. I'll walk you through how I know all that. And so the guy totally will cut you a check. How much do you get for a spirit? I have no interest in that. I'm standing in front of a person that lied to me, took me away from my passion project, the thing that I'm most committed to, this whole fearless movement. And then I'm standing in front of a man. Again, if you understand the fearless movement and what I'm trying, we are trying, we're trying to create with this fearless movement is men of honor, men who take their word very seriously, men who take their responsibilities very seriously. And so I'm getting the first impression of meeting Patrick Bedevid. This isn't a serious man. He's trying to get me in a ring with an even less serious man, Roland Martin. And so I don't say it because I'm trying to limit my conversation with him because I don't believe in talking to dishonest people because they'll twist the honest and turn it into something else. And so I try to limit my engagement with dishonest people because they'll take anything you say. They're like the police, anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. And so I, people that have been dishonest with me, they're like, hey, how come Whitlock never returns my calls or how come I seem to be blocked on his phone? Because I don't like to engage with dishonest people. It's too high risk for me. They don't take their words seriously. So I'm very careful about who I deal with in the media. I had to learn that the hard way through being very nice to people, very generous with people. But they can twist and they, I'll go back to anybody has ever seen me or heard me or heard, listen to me talk about what happened with me and Deadspin and the Greg Howard guy. That's all, that's all no good deed goes on punish. That was very nice to Greg Howard. This guy wrote an article contending that he's in his hospital bed fighting for his life and that I'm on the phone yelling and screaming at him while he's fighting for his life. And I have emails from him from when he was in the hospital bed with him thanking me for calling him with concern for he and his family. So again, these people are capable of incredible lies. And so I just, my reaction is to limit communication. I don't want to be twisted up in their lives. And I'm going to attach all of this to a documentary that I watched over the weekend, some, a viewer of the show emailed me fearlessblazeshowatgmail.com and recommended that I watch, this was on Friday I think or Thursday, recommended, hey you should watch this documentary, third Adam three. And third Adam three, the rise of the divine feminine. And it talks about the rise of the divine feminine energy. And that's what this conversation I want to have with you all today is about divine feminine energy. And how, and the documentary is brilliant, we're going to get into the documentary in depth tomorrow. Spencer Smith that put the documentary on, he's going to come to Nashville. Spencer Smith is a minister and a missionary. He's traveled the world doing missionary work. He put this thing together that explains what's going on in global culture and particularly here in American culture. This whole thing, divine feminine energy. The first time I heard, and I told Spencer Smith this today when I was talking to him, first time I heard of divine feminine energy seven, eight years ago, I'm watching a video by the guy, Chronicles of Judah. And he mentions divine, divine feminine energy. But he never, when I hear him talk about it, seven, eight years ago, he never went into great detail, or at least that I heard, I never heard him going to great detail, a definition of it. Spencer Smith in this documentary goes two and a half hours and breaks down divine feminine energy so that a baby can understand. It's a terrific video. And so I've asked Pastor Anthony to watch the documentary. I've asked Virgil to watch the documentary. I like for those of you at home so you can better enjoy tomorrow's show. I'd love for you to watch this documentary tonight so that when we talk about it tomorrow, you can understand it even better. But everything I'm talking about and going to talk about today as it relates to Patrick Beth David and to Roland Martin, it's about this divine feminine energy that has overtaken American culture and culture at large around the planet. It's satanic. It's about, I'm not calling these guys Satanists. I'm saying that they're caught up in a culture that they don't fully understand. And that's why men are no longer men and why men's words don't mean what they used to. They're used to. Most men, you took great pride in living up to their word. We've moved completely away from that. A man's word is not his bond. You can't make deals based on handshakes. Men will lie about any and everything, particularly as it relates to money. And so Patrick Beth David and Roland Martin aren't fully familiar of what culture has caught them up and is emasculating them and making them act like women. And this particularly refers to Roland Martin, but even Patrick Beth David, conservative, had a lot of success. He's Iranian. I think he and his family came over here when he was like 10 years. Great success story. I think involved in the American military as best as I can tell. Completely unaware yesterday like, oh man, you acting like a woman. No word don't mean nothing to you. You would trick another grown man into flying down to Florida to do your bidding rather than do it yourself. He ended up doing it himself because everything, and I'll unpack this further as we move along on this show, but everything, what he wanted to do, Patrick Beth David, he wanted to have a debate with Roland Martin. But filling unsure of himself and filling unsure that Roland Martin would just play the race card on him, he set up a gotcha moment for Roland and was like, gonna have some pen. Hey Roland, you're down here to do an interview with me. While Jason Whitlocks here and y'all going to debate. Because he didn't, he ended up, when I walked away, they played, I think they went ahead and taped an interview yesterday and Patrick Beth David engaged with this clown Roland Martin for a couple of hours and they played the interview this morning or the debate this morning and he went ahead and did it. But his plan yesterday was to roll out, hey I got this Negro from Nashville and it's like, this is all, he thinks he's Django Unchained and I think what the caprio, he was this guy that set up fights between black slaves. That's what Patrick Beth David thought he was doing. And he thought he was a good guy. He's with like, I'm on your side. I know Roland, again these are on his words but these are his actions, this is what he led me, I'm on your side. We're gonna beat up Roland Martin together. And I don't have a real interest in beating up Roland Martin, he's a clown. He beats himself up. He's full of divine feminine energy. His wife is a minister in the head of his household. She's the pastor. She's the spiritual leader in his house. I don't need to clown Roland Martin, he clowns himself. And I certainly don't have time to leave Nashville and to leave my audience that trusts me to deliver content to them and to talk about issues that interest them. I don't need to fly down the floor to wrestle with a clown like Roland Martin. Roland Martin's wrestling with himself. But I just wanna help set up a little bit more the divine feminine energy and what Spencer Smith argues in his documentary is that God establishes a natural order for humanity. Christ, man, woman, child. That's the natural order that we talk about on this show most days. And this whole point of view and perspective, our biblical worldview is driven by that. This man, woman, child. That's the cycle. Man submits to Christ who then, because of his submission to Christ, woman submits to man, children submit to woman and both parents. And keep in mind, I'm not suggesting that any woman should submit to a man who has not submitted to Christ. If you watch this show, you've sat and listened to me talk constantly that although I was a good dude and although I was a believer, I had not submitted to Christ and therefore it would be foolish for any woman to submit to me. I've been very open and honest about that, that I had life all screwed up. Again, a believer, but not willing to submit. So basically it just throws my beliefs out the window and everything we talk about on this show and virtually everything I've been talking about for the last seven years is about, now I need to submit. I got this whole thing screwed up. I got the arrogance that I have over the money, popularity, whatever level of fame I have, has made me arrogant and I've forgotten the whole process of submitting to God. I'm completely out of line with the natural order. And so what this documentary argues is that what woman is trying to do, what the devil is trying to do is put man and woman on the same platform. You won't leave God out because once you get out of God's natural order, you're leaving God out. And so I could sit around and I wrote pieces about and I talked about previously, yeah, I'm a believer in God, I'm a believer in Jesus Christ. But what it didn't mean if I wasn't willing to submit nothing, if I'm hanging out in strip clubs, what does it mean? Nothing. But so they're trying to say the woman is, and this whole feminist movement, don't worry about submitting to God, mean you will partner up, will be in balance. And we'll set this whole world ablaze. We'll create the greatest thing in the world, just man and woman, inequality. And that cartoon is the two headed goddess, I think of Agney or whatever. And it's a man and woman's head, sharing power. It's not what God intended. It's the representation of divine feminine energy. We just put woman on the same platform as man, oh, how great things are going to be.

I want to play you a clip from the wrestling match that went on on value-tainment show today between Patrick Bette David and Roland Martin. Let's play the clip. Roland, if you would have answered any of my questions\u2026 Oh my God. If you would have answered any of my questions in the last hour and a half\u2026 I answered a question which you don't like the answer. No, it's not. I don't like the answer. You say, tell me the policies. I'm asking you the policies. Oh, so you don't\u2026 I'm asking you to ask you the questions you can't give an answer? You can, but I would like\u2026 I brought you here. I brought you on your show and I'll give you the answer because I'm the guest. Wait, wait, wait. You want the show. First of all, even on my show, if somebody asked me a question, hell, I answer the question. I've answered your questions. You still can't answer it. And the reason why you can't answer\u2026 We've been an hour and 20 minutes now. You still have an answer to question. I actually have. You have not. Actually, I have. What policies? Here's why you haven't answered it. You blame the state. No. No. You blame surrounding cities. No. You blame Republicans. That's what you blame. No. No. I stay 15 and I tell you. I'm stating for 15, nine years\u2026 And first of all, systemic racism is a policy because it's actually ingrained in our system. That's first. What I'm also saying to you is, what I recognize is how do we fix these again? Institutions. How do we? How do we fix them? First and foremost, first and foremost, we got to stop denying that actually it's a problem, which you have done. Oh, no. That's first. I just showed you. It's a problem. 27 out of 30. No. It is a problem. We've got to stop. It's a big problem. We've got to stop denying the reality of racism in a housing appraisal industry by going, I need to see the 47 million. You just denied it. And I want\u2026 One million percent I need to see the data. And I want to hear it. One million percent I need to see the data. Here's the deal. And by the way, you give it a little too much credibility to New York Times. Here's\u2026 So, here's what I'll give Patrick David, Bette David credit for. He tried to rope me in. I refused and said, it's a waste of time, man. This guy is not an honest broker. You're not going to have a productive conversation for him. I didn't know what Patrick David was going to do. But he had probably hoodwinked rolling into town under false pretenses as well. I don't know if rolling was in on trying to bait me into a debate. I don't know. I can only speculate about that. But I'll give Patrick\u2026 Without me, he went ahead and had the debate and had the discussion, stood on his own two feet and found out just how unproductive it is to try to have a conversation with Roland Martin. Because Roland Martin has been trained well, he's an asset. He's a puppet of the Democrat Party and the whole surveillance state, the whole investigative branches of U.S. government or whatever. He's been trained in how to deflect, distract, filibuster, talk, never engage, never get pinned down. I went through it myself four years ago when I invited the man to my home, sat down, went in for two hours and just watched him deflect. I want to play a clip just an excerpt from when the guy came to me in L.A. and I made some of the same allegations and accusations that I\u2026 Again, that's not\u2026 I wanted that doesn't describe it. Let's just play the clip of Roland and me. It's just a short one, but it's very consistent with the same message I have about Roland today. A lot of media people are slaves to your Twitter feed. How? Yeah, Roland, you've tweeted it like 200,000 times. Okay. Everything\u2026 Do you know what you're\u2026 do you know what slaves to their\u2026 No, first\u2026 First of all, it's not a platform for us. First of all, it's not a slave to it. What it is is that it's a communications medium. Okay. Now, ask somebody again who's actually run three black newspapers, who's been\u2026 Who's there for black magazines, run a black website, who understands how to communicate with folks. It is a medium. So you operate this while you're a slave to it. No, I understand what it is. If you have the capacity\u2026 That's also\u2026 If you really want to expand this, when you ask Americans run a black newspaper and you have a circulation of 20,000, but yes, you build a following, you could actually move to more people with the platform and it goes beyond just the traditional following. So that's not a slave, that's knowing how to use it. Now that's an idiot, Roland, and it's someone who talks too much and tweets too much. And this is why I keep talking about the divine feminine energy. And this is what I've said about Roland for a long time. And it was funny going back and looking at some clips from four or five years ago when I sat down with Roland, I was like, yeah, I was saying the same thing then that I believe and say now. Roland, for a grown man to have at that time, for 200,000 tweets, now Roland's up to 623,000 tweets. And I'm just connecting this to the\u2026 Everything we're trying to accomplish with fear is about waking up men to like, hey, you're out of line with what God intends. And so here's the significance of 623,000 tweets. The guy joined Twitter, I believe, in 2008. 620,000,000 tweets is someone tweeting more than 100 times a day for\u2026 If you join it for 15, 14 years. 120 tweets a day. I've always said for more than 20 years, I've tried\u2026 I've told young people and I've told people that are off put by my personality when they meet me in person. People see me on TV, hear me on a radio. Those jobs require me to talk. In person, I tend to come off as an introvert and a shy person. I'm not shy. I'm not really an introvert. I just don't believe in talking all the time. I've said to people for more than 20 years, maybe 30. I can't remember when I first started saying it like, hey man, we have one mouth, two eyes and two ears because God had a plan for people. Do four times as much listening and observing. Then talking. That's why He gave you two ears. He could have given you two mouths. He could have put a mouth here, a mouth in the back of your head. So you could just carry on two and could have put a mouth on the side. So you could carry on multiple conversations with all kinds of people. But He didn't do that because He intended for us to do more listening and observing. Then talking. But when you come out from underneath God's order, His instructions submission to Him, you sound like Roland Martin in every environment. Roland Martin wants to talk and tweet constantly. He comes across, I'm not ladies, I don't want to be offensive, but I'm just keeping it real. He comes off like a woman. An overweight woman with long fingernails who thinks the more she talks, the less you can see how hideous she looks in that little bitty tiny dress covering up her 300 pounds and those eight inch nails she has. That's Roland Martin. He's Lizzo with three mouths. And here's what the Bible says. You don't have to take my word for me. We'll go to James 119. Know this, my beloved brothers, let every person be quick to hear slow to speak, slow to anger. Let's go to Proverbs 13, 3. Whoever guards his mouth preserves his life. He who opens wide his lips comes to ruin. We're designed as human beings and then as particularly men to be more reflective, more reserved, more interested in saying very few things that have a large impact rather than many things in coming off this flighty and scatter brain. That's Roland Martin. And I tried to, I didn't go into this kind of detail because again, I don't trust Patrick but David, I've met him based on a lie. And so I'm very reluctant to engage with those people because I don't know how they'll twist things. But what I was trying to tell him is like, hey man, you're about to wrestle with a woman who's going to over talk you, get emotional, shout at you. And in any time you try to have a specific conversation, he's going to switch the subject on you. And that's what happened over the course of their two-hour interview. I watched enough of it. I didn't watch all of it but I watched enough of it to see. Yep, this is Roland Martin. Patrick May Day would bring up a topic. Roland Martin would tell some personal story. I think he started off talking about an exchange where he and his kindergarten teacher or whatever. And at one point I saw him talk, he talks about all these obscure news stories and things that only he could know and you have to trust his word, that that's how it happened and that's how it played out. He never wants to talk about facts. He wants to talk about a narrative that he creates and he's in control of. And that way he gets to define the terms and Patrick Beck David was like, hey man you're on my show, answer my questions. If I come on your show, I'll answer your questions. Roland has no interest in that. He's always going to deflect and move to something, some narrative that he controls. He's not into logic and reason and fact. He's part of the divine feminine energy. He's into feelings. And Patrick Beck David's either greedy and just wants the friction of a controversial interview and had me misread about who I am. You're not going to fly me somewhere to fight your fight. A fight that I have no interest in. A fight that's a waste of my time. I was livid yesterday. Very robotic in my interaction and engagement with these people because again, I don't give energy to liars and dishonest people. And so I just went straight robot on them and I'm telling you as a man, that's how you handle these emotional line, dishonest people. Go robot on them. Don't meet their energy. Don't give them the energy they're giving you. Someone meets me with dishonesty. I meet them with silence and limited engagement. I don't meet them with lies. Someone gets emotional. I don't meet them with emotion. I go robot. That's how you handle dishonest people. That's how you handle people so far removed from the order of God so disinterested in truth. They're dangerous. They're trolls. They want to suck you in to their BS. Patrick Beck David got sucked in and he probably, I haven't monitored. He's getting good views off of that exchange he had with Roland Martin. He brought the other side on and he debated them and blah, blah, blah. Maybe it's a good look. Maybe it'll drive a lot of traffic. I'm not interested in it. There's no one that has come on this show, I believe, and you guys fact check me if I'm wrong and I will correct if I am wrong. But there's no one that's come on this show and there have been people I disagree with, people that I thought were talking straight lunacy. I'm not cutting them off. I'm not over talking them. I'm not trying to embarrass them. I'm treating them with respect. I'm giving them room to get their point of view out and let them do their thing. Roland Martin has no interest in that. He's an asset for the global establishment. He's there to discredit any person, but particularly any black person who suggests that, hey man, all this emotional energy, all this divine feminine energy that you're giving into is wrong and will lead to your demise. Roland Martin is a plant for the Democratic Party and the global establishment. The man runs around like he's the blackest, most masculine man in the social media stratosphere. This is what Roland Martin is. Let's play the clip of him doing a jig for Hillary Clinton. Let's play that clip. This is who Roland Martin is. That's how I tell y'all, me the music. Don't let the ass got to fool you. So just think for a second. Roland Martin is in a clip with me four years ago. I'm a journalist. I've run this black website. I've run that black website. I've done this. I'm a journalist. I'm a journalist. I'm a journalist. Show me a journalist who's tap dancing for Hillary Clinton, a white politician. Do you know any journalists that are on tape tap dancing for a political figure? I watched part of it with the Patrick Beck David where he's trying to pretend like, oh yeah, I'm not a Democrat or a Republican. I'm on neither side. I'm a journalist. He told Patrick Beck David this. This man was involved in leaking debate questions to Hillary Clinton. Donna Brazil got in that jam up where she was giving the debate questions to Hillary Clinton. You know who gave him to Donna Brazil? Roland Martin. But he's a journalist. This dude is tap dancing for Hillary Clinton and the Democrat Party. And Patrick Beck David wants, I don't have time for, this dude has exposed himself. I'm going to go a cut deeper and just the whole natural order and just how out of line and how out of pocket he is. His wife is an ordained minister. She's the spiritual leader in their family while Roland sits on Twitter all day tweeting and posting propaganda on Facebook and YouTube and just constantly just, constantly just running his mouth. If he's not running his mouth, he's tweeting. It's just constant, dribble. He takes no time for reflection or thought. It's just constantly running his mouth. His wife is a spiritual leader in her home. And this is how weak she is. She let this clown tweet out a joke about David Beckham. Four years ago, I can't do it. One of these World Cups or there was some commercial with David Beckham and Roland tweeted out a joke talking about, you know, anybody that's excited about David Beckham in their underwear needs to be slapped. Harmless joke over Twitter. Anybody with a brain knows what's happening. But when that alphabet mafia told Roland, dance, n-dance, what did he do? He danced. When CNN apologized a suspended him for the tweet, there was nothing in the alphabet mafia, the LGBTQ, glad, came in and told this nigro to dance. What did he do? He danced. Went on his show and apologized. What did he do? Ironically, I have historically supported many of the issues important to glad's agenda, such as ending don't ask, don't tell policies, gay adoption, and including gays and hate crime laws. These folks are facts. His wife's a ordained minister. Roland calls himself a Christian, but I support gay adoption. These are clowns. Roland's a clown. Roland stands for nothing. This is why I was so bothered like they really snatched my time away from this show, away from this audience, away from this conversation. To wrestle with this clown who stands for nothing, who acts like Lizzo. I want to reengage with that. I'm going to fly to Florida to wrestle with Lizzo. What happened? And Patrick, David, you owe me a sincere apology. You need to man up and offer a sincere apology because this was some clown feminine stuff you pulled involving. I want to take, let me, I want to walk you through here in a second why I know this whole thing was a setup. But before I do that, I want to take care of my great friends at Preborn.

So let me walk you through why I know this was a setup. So and why Patrick B. David had an opportunity to be honest with me but chose dishonesty. So I fly down Sunday night and Sunday night I look at the value-tainment YouTube page. And on it I see some reference to emergency podcast about criminal justice reform or something along those lines. And it says it's going to start at 9 a.m. Or 9 a.m. or 8 a.m. Whatever time it said it was the time that I was like hold on. That's when my podcast with Patrick B. David is. That's odd. And then I thought well maybe he recorded that and he's going to run that on his podcast and I'll be on the value-tainment channel. I just thought it was odd but I didn't think much of it. I was like well that surely doesn't have anything to do with his interview of me. That was the first thing that raised my eyebrows. I wake up the next morning and the car service driver, it's the same one that took me to the wrong hotel the night before. He sends me a text saying that hey something about picking me up at 9 a.m. or 8.45 a.m. I'm like well the thing starts at 9 a.m. and you know how could he pick me up at that time. So I'm downstairs like the email says pick up at 8.30 a.m. I'm down and I text him hey I'm ready to go. I'm downstairs and he said give me one minute he pulls around picks me up and he takes me on a 15 minute drive to the studio and during this drive a producer calls him and the producers are on speakerphone and he says to the driver that hey don't bring Jason to the front bring him around to the back entrance we want him to come in through there and the guy says okay or first thing he said is Jason's in the car with me and so I think that was letting the guy know that he could hear me that that that I could hear him and then he's and then the guy tells him hey bring him around to the back we don't want him to come in through the front guy says okay so we we come along come in through the back entrance again at this time I'm not thinking anything just not no red lights are flashing but after my conversation with Patrick and David after I walk out after I I decide let me call an Uber and I'm leaving I call an Uber comes and picks me up at that UPS store at the strip mall and it's hilarious the Uber driver takes me back to my hotel and he pulls up and I go hey man this ain't my hotel and he goes yes it is don't they say my hotel my hotel is 15 minutes away because literally he drove me back to my hotel in two minutes and I'm like this ain't my hotel my hotel is 15 minutes away this is crazy this is and then I look out the window and I go hold on this this looks like my hotel and it's like and it's like this is my hotel and I'm going it was a 15 minute ride that include I think we got on the highway to get to the studio and the guy taking me back I think made two left turns and I was at my hotel I could have walked from my hotel to the studio and so I was like this doesn't make sense and I go oh these guys were killing time they called and asked this driver to give him the run around and they had me delivered to the back of the offices because clearly there's something they don't want me to see at the front of the offices and I go that must be rolling Martin and then so I start hunting down I go to social media I wonder what state rolling Martin is it because at that time I'm thinking when I was over at the studio I was like I wonder they're having rolling Martin over Skype or whatever and then I discovered through social media like well rolling Martin's down in Florida too and so they had rolling Martin at the studio and had the driver give me the run around because they didn't want me to run into rolling Martin at the studio and so it just like all the lights all started coming like oh this was a setup from where to go and they were going to all these machinations to keep me and rolling Martin separate from each other and that's again why I don't know if rolling Martin was in on this at all I probably right now think he wasn't in on it that this was something Patrick McDavid and his crew decided they were going to pull off and Patrick McDavid told me during our our his conversations that rolling had no idea I was there I didn't know whether to believe him or not because you know rolling trolls me two or three times a week over Twitter again I've had the guy muted I don't see it but sometimes when people respond back I get copied and seeking rolling's handling it and I can tell that a roller must be tweeting about me again I mean rolling lives is dying for engagement with me I don't have any interest in engaging with rolling and so then when I get a ride back to Miami International Airport 30 minutes away I'm done with uh value-tainment and the ride that they set up with me so I call my own uber this is around one o'clock eastern time and sure enough the uber driver shows up immediately within 60 seconds and it's the same driver that had been taking me around for value-tainment and I'm like how why are you still here what what is going on I can't believe it's you and and so we get in his car I get in his car I'm gonna let the guy drive me to the airport whatever and and and I go hey man are you involved in this scam the value-tainment has been playing on me is that why you took me on a 15-minute ride to their studio and the guy admits that yeah that they told me to drive you around and you know just take your time and kill some time don't get him here until a certain time they told him to do that I go do you know why and he goes no I just I'm just doing what they asked me to do and and I tell him that I was like man you know I had this other uber driver just a two-minute drive and blah blah and and we go through all of that and then I say to him I was like hey man I got to be careful because I don't know how elaborate or what Patrick Bay David and value-tainment are doing I go but I see you got a camera here I don't know if there's some kind of candid camera I don't know what's going on but you know I got to be careful here I'm not sure what's going on and this this again where my philosophy serves me well I don't get in Ubers and want to have long drawn-out conversations with the uber driver I don't you know I'm really reserved and I'm an introvert and a luff when engaging with people I don't know the the guy had an innocent explanation for his camera being there a lot of uber drivers have cameras there to protect themselves or whatever but the guy did he told me stories about his Christian walk and all that and and I engaged him a little bit but the conversation seemed like he had done some research on me and was trying to walk me into a conversation or whatever because of this show but I just wasn't comfortable with the driver I was appreciative of the fact that he acknowledged that you know that clearly they had instructed him to give me the run around and it it clearly seemed to be he didn't know this because I don't think he picked up Roland Martin but I was like clearly they're trying to keep me away from someone or something they didn't want me to know and as I started replaying the entire scenario I can't and I want you guys to chime in on this via email via the comments over YouTube comments on Apple I would love for you all's take on what happened here my read as I've mentioned earlier is I think that Patrick Bette David is an a fan of Roland Martin thanks Roland Martin is a race hustler and race baiter wanted to have a debate with Roland Martin Roland Martin loves talking and loves attention from anybody probably was down in Florida offered himself up to Patrick Bette David because that's Roland's job go pick fights with people that disagree with the left defund the police anything the Democratic Party is promoting its Roland's job to go pick a fight with them and then use all the tactics they trained him in and deflection and distraction and filibuster and to use all those taxes and then you get a nice little clip out of it rolling and looks like I took on so and so and look how I mistreated them or blasted them blah blah blah but so I think Patrick Bette David wanted to have an argument with Roland knew that as a non-black person there was some risk in debating a race baiting clown like Roland because Roland will quickly go to or you ain't black so shut up and so Patrick Bette David thought oh I got Jason Whitlock I'll have him go into the ring and fight with Roland and I'll stay out of it I'll just referee the fight between Roland and Jason and I will lean the fight Jason's direction through my referee and Jason will be good with that because you know Jason's like me he doesn't really care about true he just wants to be popular he just wants to have viral videos and whatnot and that's not me that I actually do care about honest engagement and discussion and I honestly I'm not afraid of it as again I invited Roland to my home set down with him for two hours gave him all the time in the world dealt with the fact that he wasn't there to interview me or hear me out I did that four or five years ago Roland's not honest he's not a serious person he's filled with them in an energy I don't want to wrestle with the male version of Joy Reid and Lizzo no interest in it moved on from that Patrick McDavid I think initially didn't want to take the risk I walk out and Patrick McDavid says oh I got to do it I'll do it he has his show today it's I I if he satisfied with that if he enjoyed that thanks his audience was edified by that that train wreck of Roland yelling and screaming and over talking and sidestepping every question I don't think that uh promotes understanding I think it promotes division I I don't I almost think virtually all political debate political debate is is is dishonest at this point and is it really intended to lead to a higher understanding and that's why I don't like really engaging in political debate I try to promote spiritual enlightenment enlightenment about Christianity enlightenment about Jesus Christ enlightenment about the role that the Bible spells out for men I believe that is the fertile territory to have discussions to bring people together to inspire men to live better lives and if we do that then we have a chance at improving society but debating Roland Martin about politics there's no win there for anybody that there's no understanding given Roland Martin took Patrick met David on the merry-go-round Roland Martin takes everybody on he's just gonna go switching topics to topics to topics here talk about this here talk about this here talk about this and these are talk about things that only I know at this time let me tell you a story about what happened with Republican politicians in Illinois and blah blah blah and Patrick back David's that David sitting there going he's unpacking a story about Republican politicians in Illinois that wasn't some major national story that I'm familiar with in real time how can I engage or debate and he just kept doing it he went from state to state to all these examples to examples and again there's there's no way to debate a guy about all that stuff unless you know every piece of minutiae inside Roland Martin's head because he's in control of the narrative it's it's a very slick tactic and again when someone's telling you some story about what happened to them in kindergarten how can you debate them on that you weren't there you can't talk to the kindergarten teacher you have no idea if it's real or not it's just some guy defining a conversation that only he can engage in he's mostly having a conversation with himself and so I think Patrick back David was smart enough to realize how slick Roland was and was like hey let me bring in a ringer let me bring in Jason Whitlock and he'll do the fighting for me and and he wanted it so bad he was willing to pay me cash money or I don't cash it I don't know because I would have only someone this dishonest the only thing they can bring me is a briefcase of cash I'd check with balance this is a dishonest person we've met on a foundation of dishonesty I don't believe anything that comes out of your mouth and so I do think his motivation wasn't all bad I think it was cowardly I think it was dishonest but he wanted someone to beat up Roland Martin and if if if I don't want to play the race card on Patrick Bette David but I would be interested to know did he do this to Jordan Peterson does he do this to his other guest what he tried to do to me does he invite them down under false pretenses did Jordan Peterson have to back out of a debate with Roland Martin to be interviewed on his show would he would you invite Tucker Carlson down there Glenn Beck hey we want to come down and interview you Glenn Beck and then when he gets down there but first we want you to or not not first but or you know when you get down there we'd actually like for you to debate Michael Eric Dyson or one of the or Joy Rita one of these other race hustlers do this for my entertainment and pleasure I've given you a flea plane ride down to south Florida I've done you a favor what is is that how you operate Patrick I'm I'm I'm so beneath a level of respect and courtesy and honesty that you're comfortable treating me that way it it I and I have no idea what deal he cut with Roland Martin maybe Roland Martin knew he was coming down there to debate they put it out as there was a heated debate over critical race theory that's how they put the video out today yesterday they were promoting it as a debate about police reform or criminal justice reform I don't know what pretense he invited Roland there Roland was I think already going to be in Florida I don't know but why there was an attempt to rope me into that BS why Patrick met David seemed to think that little of me and again maybe this is my own arrogance again I didn't I told you I didn't know where this conversation was going to go but I was offended I would never treat anybody that way there's never been anybody in my entire media career that I've ever tried to sneak attack I would call people and tell them straight up hey man I want to give you a chance to respond to this because I'm going to criticize you in my column tomorrow in the Kansas City Star I want you to here's my angle and so here's the questions I want you to ask I want to ask you I don't I never ever try to stab anyone in the back I wouldn't stab the devil in the back I'd stab him directly in his heart if he had one there's just no but I find it unmanly to attack someone in any type of sneak attack way it gets me into trouble dealing directly with people having uncomfortable conversations with people it gets me into trouble it got me into trouble at ESPN because I try to deal with everybody in a straightforward fashion of this here isn't good enough this is how it needs to improve and there are people that can't stand criticism melt at the sign of criticism always have an accusation that any criticism is coming from a bad place I don't believe that but I just I just don't believe in a sneak attack and so this show and what we're trying to do in April with the roll call event in Nashville it is about trying to remind men that we have a responsibility in this world given to us by God we have to submit to Christ and then try to engage with woman and children and after we have submitted and there are people trying to disrupt this natural order and that's why I want you guys to watch third Adam three Spencer Smith's gonna be here tomorrow and he's gonna talk about this divine feminine energy and why men are so out of character and they don't even realize Patrick Bette David has no idea that his involvement with Roland Martin caused him to slip into female behavior because he involved himself with Roland Martin oh well let me be dishonest and disingenuous to Jason Whitlock that's what happened Roland Martin's caught up in his feminine energy he sucked Patrick Bette David into feminine energy and then all of a sudden that that feminine energy got down to me and I said not today devil I'm not playing this game I'm out I'm gonna fly back to Nashville get with my audience do my show and try to forget that this even happened but I think that's why I was saying I had questions like should I just move on and discuss Kyrie Irving John Moran the Grammys the State of the Union address or should I unpack this and try to use it and again it'll sound like I've done this just to beat these guys up I really haven't because they're on a journey just like the rest of us they can change course no different than I change course then you change course it's not over for them but I did want to call all of this out all of this behavior out because it needs to be called out men need to be reminded there was a time when our word actually meant something and we tried to treat other men of honor with honor and honesty now everybody's good with line and and and this is why I being a conservative is the most irrelevant distinction known to man being a conservative will not save America will not save you will not send this country a better direction just because conservatives are slightly by a hair better than liberals and I know that's offensive to many of you but there's a better c-word a far superior c-word are you a Christian have you accepted Jesus Christ as your Lord and personal Savior are you willing to submit to his will in his way of doing things if you're not and you're just a conservative you're going to fall to divine feminine energy you're going to get in line they're all getting in line whether conservative or liberal they're all getting into line because that's who they answer to politics politics is not going to save us not going to send America a better direction I as best I can tell from my limited research up and and and I had a very limited experience with Patrick McName he's a good guy he probably fits the standard of a conservative as soon as he's given an opportunity to lie to do something that benefits him what did he do because he's not standing on anything he's not standing on anything real being a conservative doesn't dictate that you not lie that you treat other men with honor and respect being a conservative doesn't demand that God does that's I can write it off the names of other conservatives no problem line when it comes to money and it comes to doing something that serves them I people get upset with me when I talk I don't know don't call me a conservator because I'm not I'm a Christian and and we engage in political conversation here and and I certainly have a preference politically but that's just a I have a belief in Christ and in Christianity and its ability to change and make men actually stand for something pulling that Republican lever doesn't make you stand for something you will fold without God I see it every day I saw it in myself there's a bunch of things that God prevents me from doing that being a conservative won't I I would tonight I'd be at a strip club if all I was was a conservative I'd be out in Vegas every weekend I'd still be living in LA I'm supposed to get to Delano I talk too much I pull the rolling Martin it's not gonna happen my throat my throat is sore I haven't drank enough water seems like I got a running and that's you know get on these planes you start changing atmosphere and weather I promise if I got a sore throat tomorrow and I struggle to do this show I won't be even more mad at Patrick bed David and and I'm rolling Martin Lizzo. Yes, I know I'm fat but I ain't Lizzo We'll see you tomorrow I wanna be I just want I wanna be I just want I want to be just want I want to be I just want I want free, I want free, I want free, I want free..."
