I'm Lou Dobbs. This is the great America show. Great to have you with us today. And we're 13 days out from the biggest midterm elections of our lives. And the mad Marxist Adams are desperate. Obviously so. They're flailing trying to figure out a way to hide old Joe and their party's commitment to anything and everything that's anti America and I family anti God anti life and pro Marx pro cartel. They want to bring you and me to our knees to destroy this great country of ours. And they'll do whatever it takes to achieve their end, which is the end of America. Biden has done more damage to this country in less than two years than any president in history. No matter how many years they had to screw things up. Whatever else Joe Biden is, he is fundamentally the screw up. But he can also claim to be doing exactly what he wants. Growing open our southern border, making the Mexican drug cartels ever greater fortunes with their smuggling of illegal's more than four to six million entering the US. It's Biden took office. Think of that. Four to six million and sex trafficking smuggling deadly drugs, especially fentanyl with the help of the Chinese Communist Party. Of course, that's right. The Chinese and Mexican drug cartels are in league, deploys and kill as many Americans as they can. Fentanyl is now the number one killer of Americans aged 18 to 45. And what is Biden doing about it? Well, you would guess nothing and you would be right. But today a little diversion from the public eye brought to us by the Biden Department of Justice. The DOJ held a press conference to announce they brought charges against more than a dozen Chinese intelligence agents. These range from stealing technology and equipment to obstructing justice against a Chinese tech company. No statement on how many of the spies were actually arrested by the FBI. Isn't that interesting? They didn't announce the number of arrests, but they do know all about the cases. FBI Director Christopher Ray said the cases lay bare the Chinese flagrant violation as he put it up international laws. What about that? They're violating international laws, not our laws. And what are we doing here? Is that what you do with spies? You bring in the FBI. I would like to see them do a little more than that. Where is counterintelligence across our intelligence community? I hate to break it to G man Ray that we already knew all of that all the way back in the mid 1980s. There were 3500 Chinese front companies operating in the United States then with a specific mission of stealing our intellectual property, technology and military secrets. And they've done a pretty good job of it, almost unimpeded by the FBI or any other government agency. The Chinese in fact have stolen about $500 billion in technology and intellectual property every year since then. And we've known that for decades. Garland and Ray look like fools for trying to make fools out of the American people. The question is, why did they only come up with 13 spies out of the thousands who have to be working in this country? That kind of weak minded stunt by this administration and other sons like it will be a big part of the reason that the giant red wave that slams into the Marxist dims on November 8 will be even bigger than expected. That kind of stunt producing that kind of result on November 8 and helping will be the fact they've gone after patriots like podcast star Steve Bannon. He's our guest here today, former Trump strategist advisor and great American Steve Bannon. Great to have you with us Steve and welcome to the great America show. Steve has been and is at the point of the spear in the fight against so totalitarian Marxist dims who are trying to destroy this country. Their politics of lies, deceit, personal destruction and their scorched earth tactics. The vinyl left has thrown all of that at Steve Bannon and more. And let's begin Steve with your assessment of where you are now your next moves in the battle with the Stalinist J6 and corrupt DOJ. Well, with that respect to judges decision like it respected the the juries given the limitations of what they can you know consider he laid out he laid out in court the other day the four major areas for appeal I probably have maybe in his May six. My appellate lawyers my lawyers are all over right now will will you know will signify that appeal before the 15th of November and then we'll go there I think the single my lawyers and all the research that's been presented to me. I think we have a strong case on appeal and we'll see how it plays but you know Lou I the Justice Department the FBI here in the congressional committee should be ashamed of themselves this thing has been run as a show trial everybody knows that there's no way to remember there's no minority counsel there's no way to look at the evidence across I think hopefully we put this chapter after November he put this chapter of American political history and back of us and get back to doing things in an organized method I do intend if it's taken up I mean I intend to press this executive privilege situation and separation of powers hopefully all the way to the Supreme Court because I think it's got to be sorted out in a great chair and had a great piece the other night on Fox and I think it's got to be sorted out that we got to get to we got to really get a conclusion from the Supreme Court about executive privilege and who's actually the president can talk to and about the privilege and all of it so there's a lot of work to do here my team's already on it and I'll keep you guys updated. Well I appreciate that Steve and this battle is one that that you have to win it just this is so wrong headed so upside down and evil in its intent it's this is no longer ideological these people are without question the Marxist Dems are trying to destroy this country and every tenant of our constitutional republic and they're trying I just am stunned that the there are so few judges that are not reacting to the constitutional power of this president and the the absurd abuse of power that that had been on their face just wrong deeply wrong whether we're talking about the law the Constitution or morality itself and this is a country under assault and I still swear to you I think maybe as much as a quarter thirty percent of the country really still doesn't believe that this government is as corrupt as it is and I also want to say parenthetically I salute you for respecting the courts and then respecting the the judicial process but I have to tell you right now I have no respect for it whatsoever because it is so it is an unmitigated corrupt process that we're going to have to deal with as a nation you know in war in American people about this not for decades and decades and decades but could have that point but the rule of law at 11 p.m. on Friday and Lou you know when the White House of the administration or the scenes putting out information 11 o'clock on a Friday night they're not looking for a lot of coverage they released the fiscal years numbers for the invasion on the southern border and it's so jaw dropping that you have all these laws on the books all these regulations that are on the books black letter on the books and you see what they've done to support immigration law and a final law to literally let millions of people I calculate there's six to eight million either gotaways or illegal aliens or false a final claims here in the nation today that Todd Bensman was on our show early he thinks it's four million four million to eight million and you sit there and you see about the judges and you see about the administration you see about Mark Garland this is I say Merg Garland you know with heck with my oracles I think Merg Garland and ultimately Biden will be brought up on impeachment charges I think the first article of Garland which I think there'll be many others I think Garland will be the invasion of the southern border with air you have all this other stuff to do on the Constitution all this other stuff they're doing about you know parents is domestic parents arresting individuals who are praying at abortion the Senate's praying the rosary and you see the southern border where we have an invasion that is it's mind boggling in his scale and they're happy with it and then glue the top it off they all went on the Sunday shows including my autism and Kamala Harris they go to Sunday shares a look American the eye after reaching that data on Friday night and say the border is secure they're just in your face with the list is beyond gas light this is just ball face in your face line and they expect you said 30 percent it's maybe even higher than maybe 40 percent right but it's not much higher than that are not paying attention enough to understand what's going on and that's a good banking up but now this is so spun out of control that it's got to be stopped and that's why November 8th so important November 8th is with that question this is our this is an existential perhaps the first existential midterm election I truly believe it and I don't know if there'll be a 2024 unless we win this election on November 8th it is really that straightforward to me and that dangerous a moment in our history you mentioned the domestic terrorists the domestic violence that the whistleblowers are telling the house judiciary committee Jim Jordan telling the Senate judiciary committee Chuck Grassley about the the efforts to to cook the books on of all things domestic white nationalism is what they're really attacking trying to to create the specter of a white nationalist force that is subversive and violent and should be considered the same as a foreign radical Islamist terrorists within our own borders it's all being manufactured by the deep state and the leaders so called at least the top officials of the FBI this is just a criminal to a point of almost unimagined corruption it's it's my body but you see now you get FBI agents are coming for it other people are coming forward know that they they've gun decked the statistics about about about domestic terrorism we know that they lied about they said they didn't have a tracking unit looking at parents Lou I think what the good news out of here is it's obviously the all of us it's something we've never seen before I'm breaking the wrong law and really turning into authoritarian state like the CCP is but the American people you know CNN's there's one of the top stories this morning is quote-unquote Trump lost the suburbs this is how the Republicans are winning them back you know this gets back to the spring and summer 2021 we were talking to war room about the mass mandates and the vaccine mandates and CRT and all these things are happening at the schools that independent women of moderate women democratic women who are not you know Trump fans we're going to form a coalition which we did around the Glenn Yumpton by Canada see what you have a hundred percent of MAGA turn up and you have a coalition of these parents who normally wouldn't be with MAGA on issues who are now open to the fact of when they see the gas prices they see their savings crumbling they see the house values crumbling when they see all this madness on the creative crisis of the Biden economic and financial emergency are now coming and I think this is leading to this potential sweeping victory if we can deliver the vote and if we get out the vote this is why Rhode Island too is in play for the first time since 1992 it's why Connecticut 2 and 5 these house seats are in play two seats in in New Hampshire now within three points is Gerald Malloy up in in Vermont for the US Senate 30 points down he's now with him three with no money he's got $250,000 at five million ads you see New York State they're 15 house seats in play including Sean Patrick Eloni who's the D who's he's chair at the today Wasserman a cook a political report puts his seat as a toss-up you're seeing across the country and the Democrats the Hill newspaper leads this morning that anxious building among the Democrats because they think they they focus on the wrong issue set you know this threats in democracy climate change abortion it's not playing out transgender rights you know overcoming parental rights it's not playing out they they've missed the mark and it looks like judgment but we have to deliver and I agree I think it's like the staff I think since 1862 in the first years of the Civil War we haven't had a midterm election and I would remind people that in 1862 that congressional election changed the course of the Civil War up until that time people are looking for a negotiated deal the Democratic generals McClellan these guys just would not take the torch to the Confederacy and I come from Richmond, Virginia that's my hometown but would not take it you know did not would not prepare to do what had to be done to basically save the union and after that midterm election things change dramatically and and I think you're gonna see it here I think that I think the country is just the same type of existential crisis it was in 1862 and I think here you're gonna see a fundamental change on the 8th of November if everybody does what we feel they can do which is own your vote help other people get there do a massive get up the vote a campaign right now let's have a sweeping destruction of the Democratic Party yeah I I agree with you totally what I do want to say is I do it's it's 1862 for me as well because I don't want to negotiate it's blue you I don't want to ask I don't ask to tell for questions you were there right I spirit I certainly was in 1862 the idea of a negotiated settlement was no more repugnant frankly than one would be to me now with the radical radical marks of stems these people mean business this is there's nothing to negotiate they're coming for our children they're mutilating our children they are talking sex and gender change and from K through 12 in this country and our public schools which are the great equalizer for american have always been they're treating it like a a trash heap and still of a pristine cathedral that it is for learning a for moving talent into its proper place and to support to support our values as a nation through our education of history in history and government and our civics in our public schools and they are fouling every element of our public education and both of these teachers unions have to be held accountable and they're coming for your children folks if you haven't figured it out the mark systems are coming for your children and if you're not scared enough before you hear that I hope you are now because it is exactly what is at stake I can't even imagine I was talking with James calmer congressman calmer the other day and who was a terrific patriot a great american and I said to him I said I don't pick you guys have got more than 60 days before you decide who your leader is you can go have an election for speaker on the night but the american people aren't going to have a speaker 60 days later if you act anything like you acted in 2018 what do you think well I'll tell you I think the birds gonna be our calmer shoulders and who the leaders are I happen to think and I just think that the deals already did cut I just assume it's going to be McCarthy and I assume it's going to be cartoon signals we got this is that it will he be he's gonna have to understand he's got a mandate here and that mandate coma is going to have a huge huge set of response from him because as I keep saying Lou and each kind of talking about appropriations appropriations is going to be the annual the investigation is going to be the hammer and I think we have to go in tough with the speakers got a back this to say we're not going to we're not going to appropriate anything the preparation is the most important bill because that's how the money gets did it go there's no we're not going to appropriate anything to deal J or F.E.O.T. until we see dramatic reform in dramatic I think action deconstructs in and filing the people that's why calmer the good on him is going to be tremendous he's going to be one of the most important people in this new congress but people want action they don't want any more happy talking what they definitely don't want is the traditional Washington swamp administrative state you know the old oakie dope where you head fake one way and you do something else people are living and this listen this is the greatest political comeback in american history on on january 20th of 2021 luigi you know better than anybody it was over at the same but everybody left washington president trump was back in marlago we had no political power you know biden was a quote-unquote sixty one percent they had media they had the wall street they had the global corporations had universities they had hollywood they had big tech they just silenced president trump he had no way to communicate with anybody he would put out a pressure in a couple of days we were we were crushed and it was it was maga in the deplorables that led us back this is their victory and they had been in action in the kind of days of happy talk about your ship think about the issues you've talked about and had guest on and debated over 2034 years and think of what we're talking about today this is my point this thing the stuff is so radical it it's so over the top and people are now incensed that's why they're going out to the polls this is kind of a self-organizing revolt there's a demand action absolutely and by the way i'm not going to give anybody 60 days i i am i'm going to raise my voice the second i even smell a whiff of weak need rhinoism on the part of anyone in leadership and i don't care who it is this country has got a demand real leadership and the republican party has got to get over itself and start doing what uh they promised to do which is restore this great republic i want to i want to turn though to if i may the appearance of the c o of dominion on 60 minutes just happened to be two weeks before the election guaranteeing that everything's just nifty and uh you know and i won't say anything about the interviewer who was asking all of those tough hard hitting questions and betranks is huge knowledge base about electronic voting they apparently had no research and no sense of what is reality but when for this guy to be standing up there talking about electronic voting as he did was an insult to everyone in this country uh your your reaction uh or are this along with the policy statement that we're going to win the house uh does this suggest you they know something the rest of us don't well i have a lot of people that call me some of what hey you know Katie Hobbs will react to be debating if it's really touching my whole but uh but dominion but obviously there's no you know there's there's no coincidence to see right it the drop that a couple weeks beforehand also you have this subpoena they got from president from for the committee they're demanding all the records of the source of mover the society before the trip before the tusac because they want to dominate the new cycle look i'm not a machine guy as i say i don't really understand that well i i'm a slumber leader we gotta go to paper ballots limited uh early voting i don't think you have a election month you have election day we do it like france i think that's our goal and that's what we're pushing for i believe the 2020 election was stolen and i think was stolen by mark eliza and the ballot ballots and what they did with the non-s a sort of and William bergie and shawirke all of it all the sensible we yes yes the board didn't do it reported it's just nonsense now the machines i don't understand them enough i just always say hey why does one can't go to a hand count uh why can we go to a hand count of paper if france can't go like be a nice day's good though we have enough volunteers that should be able to do it uh and so i but i'm a huge believer 2020 was stolen in fact i think if you look at these poll numbers we're buying so low if you look at where the republicans are actually looked like you could have an overwhelming tsunami that is also kind of the that's predicting the fact he didn't get anywhere in votes to start with i kind of think this is the 2020 election that we've taken out the voter fraud so there's no there's no coincidences i think it's very uh i think it's cbs being up in your face in doing this and look obviously there's a lot of court cases going on that all get played out in court but i think right now the american people should make sure that you own your vote and particularly you got to volunteer to be a part if you want to stop this you got to be inside the calendar that's going to be a poll worker or election judge this is it's on everybody's shoulder but you know where that where the election is really going to come and play and i'm not sure if it's a dominion or another company but this week in this sunday in in brazil is an election every bit as important as blanks was the trumps win in 16 you know balsamara's gone from colon crunch to the polls 16 or 18 points down there's those polls now these he's ahead in the in the supreme court there is anybody makes anything about the machines and they mentioned anything about voter fraud they're automatically like banned i rolled up by the police it's getting to be a it's getting to be at a police state i mean it makes mary garland i'm sure is that it's pencil out taking notes here about what's going on because their plants match about that in brazil okay well then i should whisper this so that mary garland doesn't get upset uh this you were talking about how little you know about them i've been reporting on electronic voting for 20 years these machines are too complicated for anyone uh certainly like you and me who uh you know i mean we're not uh i'll speak for myself i'm not a pc expert i'm not technical in any way but i do know one thing common sense tells you these machines are too complicated they're the clerks the county clerks the secretaries of state don't even understand what's happening in these machines and the companies won't even and the companies won't even tell me point in michael and down he's machine's got a lot of stuff this one they want but he had these technical people make these presentations and quite depth about these machines they're got it i sent that out to a number of hits like that and the response these guys get back and by the way most of the guys are sent out to this review are democrats and they came back and i said you know you would think these machines would be just as simple as cash accounting machines and vegas which do the cash count you know they were blown away by that point just made to go why are these things so complicated i mean these are technical people that invest in tech companies all the time their first thing that came back to me was and they had no idea they said we had no idea that these things had been complicated why didn't we have all the software why does this thing even open itself up potentially being hacked why is the complex it shouldn't be just as simple as the machines and vegas that really count cash and people are not certainly not trumpers not maggot at all pretty sophisticated guys came back with the exact thing they the first thing they answer is why is this so complicated just way too complicated for the task of hands i agree with you again a hundred percent i want i want to close here if i may with general david patreus giving an interview in france uh and saying this i will quote we are talking about the intervention of the north atlantic alliance in the event of an attack on one of the nato members it is necessary to consider the option of using not nato forces in ukraine but multi-national forces that have nothing to do with nato he then goes on to acknowledge that basically the not basically saying the united states may lead a multi-national force against russia in ukraine and i don't understand the rest of the gibberish that he as usual spews about not nato but u.s. these people are nuts and and the uros i mean it's it's just exactly what trump said the uros think we're going to defend them and our military industrial complex represented by the man who wrote the doctrine uh which is really a rationalization for failure called the long war david patreus wants us to lead the dam thing your thoughts uh of all the bad stuff that happened this weekend this most in amber some terrible things are the weekend that this may be the most disturbing remember they forward deployed a a elements of the hundred first airborne to Romania on the right my daughter's deployed to eastern germany before uh when she left the hunter first the hunter first is not been deployed to germany since world war two remember that's the band of brothers uh you know group so it's not been deployed to europe it's in will mania which not even the europe we fought for that was you know it's already named on the ukraine border and patreus is sitting there talking about something quite insidious it's not about nato coming together under article five he's saying no you take it out of the nato situation and it's a multinational force multilateral force led by the united states they're actually discussing in the white house the pine town you can tell this deploying combat troops into ukraine and people think the disaster the eventurism in iraq in afghanistan and in vietnam okay we're we're tragedies for the country you ain't seen nothing yet this has got to be stopped this way november it's so important makarti's action signal now that the open checkbook for your korean is over and i can tell you there's no issue out there i see in these when i go out and talk to people they'll have some more than the well i think writing off the tree taking the tree and dollars off the dead be social justice warriors the college jet and putting that on working class people may be number one but number two is certainly the billions of dollars in following in to the corrupt oligarchs in your korean and now thinking of deploying young men and women in the united states to combat rolls in ukraine patrisos not even a nato role but in a multinational or multilateral you know task force it's scary and i think that i don't know why the republicans are not calling congress back like now and saying hey is your declaration or here what are we actually doing well big a kevin makarti hasn't got the guts uh mitch makonnell is too compromised for either of them to do anything intelligent and responsible uh in the interest of the nation at god help us and god help us with this impaired puppet president at the top of our government along with the comala heres and no adjectives needed uh for her uh followed by then polosi and loyd austin and jake solivan and tony blinken this country has never been in greater danger from within that we are right now we always get our guests the last word and if you will steve your concluding thoughts my concluding thoughts is god bless you ludavs i'm so glad you're around you
