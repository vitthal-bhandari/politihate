    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals. A new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Today, a man wielding a Nazi flag is arrested after he crashes into White House security barriers. The Biden administration creates more of a demand for sex trafficking at the border and the LA Dodgers go all in on drag guns. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and last night, a 19-year-old from Missouri was taken into custody after he crashed a U-Haul vehicle into a security gate at Lafayette Park directly in front of the White House gated entrance. A bystander captured video of the man crashing the U-Haul truck and reports said that the driver immediately jumped out of the vehicle waving a Nazi flag before he surrendered to the FBI. Huh. Law enforcement officials say he told them his plan was to overthrow the government, kill Joe Biden, and take over the country himself. He is being charged with assault with a dangerous weapon, reckless operation of a motor vehicle, threatening to kill kidnap and flick Tarmon, a president, vice president, or family member, destruction of federal property, and trespassing. His plan was so well thought out, in fact, that he rented a U-Haul in order to fill it with, I mean, I'd imagine some tools, weapons, explosives, I don't know, something to help him achieve this ambitious goal of getting past all the Secret Service agents and multiple checkpoints killing Joe Biden and then holding ground after he had done so. Well, FBI agents confirmed the U-Haul was totally empty, other than, of course, that Nazi flag that they laid out so neatly on the ground for a perfect photo op while mainstream media did a victory lap that they could talk about the dangers of white people again. Just last week, Joe Biden called white supremacy the single most dangerous threat in our homeland. And I think it's finally time to admit that he was right. Christopher Ray of the FBI was right, white supremacy is a big issue. These days, you can't go anywhere without finding a Nazi on every corner waving their swastika flags in your face, trying to overthrow the government. This is quite possibly the biggest issue of our lifetime. By the way, did I mention this white supremacist name is Sy Vashif Kandula, and he is very not white. As a completely unrelated law enforcement is looking at a possible mental health component in this investigation. You think? But we are definitely supposed to believe that some random Indian dude concocted a dastardly plan to slowly drive a rented U-Haul into a barricade, immediately surrender with no resistance and no weapons armed with nothing but a Nazi flag that was conveniently spread out on the street for that photo op. Apparently white people are so bad at being white supremacists that they're having to outsource even that to India. Here to discuss this and more, we have Dave Landau. He is of course one of the hosts of the New Blaze TV show Normal World along with his co-host here, Court of Black here. Happy to have you guys here. Thank you for having us. I tried to make an off-color joke just for you. Was it? I appreciate it. I liked it. I like it. I just, it's like, it's, this is, are we just living in a simulation at this point? It really feels like it. Well, I think the Nazi flag is the 2023 way of planting drugs. It's just a new hip way of doing it. And also, it's the fate, like, the government thinks we're morons when they just lay out a flag, you know, evidence? Right. It was the neatest flag ever. Probably made in India, the white supremacist home country. It just doesn't make any sense at all how you would see that in any movie or any show you've ever watched like cops. It's like, please stay away from the crime scene. There's evidence and instead they're like, here you go. It's just right here. Is this good for the camera? Do you want me to see it? Take it out. Who runs a U-hole to go through a barricade? He didn't even, I mean, he didn't even give it his all. No, that was very, that was a very weak attempt. You won't top it out at 60. And maybe, maybe, that's a little rickety. That one was empty. So he could get a little faster. We'll speed on it. I mean, look at that. This is a poor attempt. It's just, bro, come on. Well, I'm crashed. What do I do? No, Nazi flag. That's a, and questions looking down like that's really good. Like, weird. I could do way better than that. Come on. Come on. Come on. Where do you get a flag? Where do you get a Nazi flag? Like, you can't just order that off Etsy, right? That's a good question. I'm going to look that up. That would be fine if there's one Etsy like, I never looked. Like, I'm into knitting, I'm gonna be in the flags. Amazon, maybe. All kinds of flags. I'm going to look this up. I don't. Nazi flag. Correct me if I'm wrong. You better watch out. Definitely about to go on a list. This is socialist party that ended in the 40s. I just want to be clear. Right. And they also hated Catholics and Italians and Irish, which is what I am. Probably Indians. Probably Indians. I would guess. Everybody sitting at this table, they would not be a fan of. And that's somehow the new version of white supremacy to America, which is the most ignorant thing. Like, there's no white supremacy. Right. Like, and if you have it, no one's listening to you. Yeah. I don't. Oh, it's a village idiot. I've never met a white supremacist and I've been accused of hanging out with them. Not like, you know, real ones. Not me. No. You're a quarter black. You're a quarter black. Well, yeah. But the white passing, though. Yeah, exactly. And I mean, you see this. This white supremacist. I could cut this mustache into a. Yeah. So you just never know. Good. I could do it. You could do a casual Hitler with a beard. Laid back. A laid back Hitler. I'm not finding any Nazi flags. Right. Where do you go? Amazon or Etsy? You only find them at the federal building. Right. Where he came from. We're a gun and knife show. That is true. Yeah. You talk about that. Because there will be like one guy who has stuff from the forties who's like, like Nazi flags. He's like, look, it's memorabilia. Yeah. He's like, it's earrings. Historical plates. It really is like he. So any of these other, you know, you go to some protest where it's like, oh, the all of these random patriot front members and some of them are have these flags. And they all clearly are just they've been taken out of the bag just then, right? Because they've got all of the perfect creases from being folded up perfectly. And they've just taken out of the bag. And then they're displaying it as if they're a member of this organization that like literally nobody knows anyone who is a member of. It looked like the police officer had the bag. It came in if you saw when he folded up at the end. Like he rolled it up the Amazon box. Just putting it back in the plastic. He's like, can we return this? Just really want my 999 back now that the cameras have taken photos of the Nazi flag. Who would run out waving a flag to? I know. Let's say your plan backfires and, for example, your U-Haul truck doesn't penetrate the giant wall that protects the White House. Which is shocking. Yeah. Are you going to run out waving a flag? That seems pre-planned. A little bit. Like who? There's no plan. There's no plan after he gets through the gate. Right. Because it's an empty truck. He's only got a flag. Was he going to hold up the building with the flag? The flag is very scary. It's very triggering. Make it very scary. The red and the white. It is very scary. It's just so annoying too because they talk about this white supremacy and just the shooting over in Allen, Texas. That was also white supremacy. And everything's white supremacy even if you're Hispanic or Black or... Or the whites involved in... Indian. Yeah. Isn't that fascinating? And you know, I just... Joe Biden's talking about white supremacy is the greatest threat. And then we see all these things happen right as they're trying to make white supremacy the thing. And every time, I'm like, or this guy was totally crazy because you'd have to be crazy to just drive a U-Haul with a flag and nothing else and think that you're going to overthrow the entire government. But we can't talk about mental health in this country. We have to talk about whites supremacy. No, and we also have to realize it's the supreme white people that are running this whole thing telling you that you guys should be angry and add the other white people and trying to divide us for votes. Yeah. Like the only white supremacy really would be the current president of the United States. Literally white, his hair's white. His kids, his kids snorts white. There's a lot of white in that family. A lot. Yeah, so when you look at it, it's very strange because it's like those are the ones who have actually benefited from a supposed white system. And now that's not in existence the way that it once was, where people are just a mishmash of everything. Right. Yeah, you. Yeah. Look, I'm Irish Italian now that that's crazy, but in the 50s, they would have been like, what are you? No, no blacks and Italians that are here. That's the end. No, no mix. I am. So I want to. It's a character. It's not us. No, I don't believe that. I think they make this fun. Yeah. So, so, you know, we're talking about, you know, I think that you're just you it's probably a lot of white supremacists when you talk when we talk about white supremacy, it's just white supremacy that has a problem with the border. So let's move to the border. So I don't know if you were to say like, Hey, all of these people are just flooding through the border. And that might be a problem because we're not vetting these people. I would just say you're a white supremacist and you're bigoted and also xenophobic. But I want to, I want to bring it somehow also sexist, transphobic, because you don't know how many of these good people have like blanket terms to your baby cager. Also a fascist. Yeah, that one is probably the most used one. Yeah, makes sense. In fact, when I was looking for the Nazi flags, I did see some F fascism flags and some middle fingers with fast anti fascism in the name. Very edgy. Very edgy. Yes. Morn by people who have no idea what fascism is. Correct. Correct. But so over at the border, the Biden administration is ending their familial DNA testing. So obviously the reason that they did this. Yes, the reason that they did this was to try to deter child sex traffickers from holding the hand of a little kid as they walk across the border and saying, this is definitely mine. I'm here with my child. And they're like, maybe we should test you. Well, like, nope. Yeah, let them write in Biden's like, actually, we like the sex trafficking. We like the child trafficking. We think it's great. And the elite, this is a leaked memo from CBP dated May 19th. And it says they are ending DNA testing on May 31st. What? Yeah, it's going on. It's so you ask that. And it's like, I can't fathom any explanation other than they literally want the destruction of this country. Nothing else makes sense to me. Like even the dumbest person alive would understand that this would be a huge issue. The lack of care we have for any child in this country, let alone any child coming into this country that deserves a chance has just gotten to the point that it's just disturbing. Yeah. Yeah. If anybody can just come in and go, yeah, that's my kid. And you're like, really, like, you don't look like him. He seems scared. Trafficking is so common to people don't realize that. Like it really is a disgustingly common thing. And now what our so our own country decides we're going to lacks laws on it. What's the benefit? What's the benefit of cartels bringing in people from another country illegally? It's for sex trafficking up until the point they're not worth anything. And then you're killed. Like, that's all it comes down to. I mean, I'm sorry. I can't really make it like light of it even because it's just absolutely I mean, I can. But I'll save it from my own show. It's like it's very dark. Look at me cancel. No, but it's just it's so disgusting and sad that a group of people that are supposed to look out for their citizens. I think they're just trying to like eliminate us. I really do. I don't feel like there's any protection of our own people anymore. Well, they're not even protecting kids. Kids. Them either. So illegal immigrants, they're not being protected and children are even less protected. So what is the reasoning behind them taking this down? White supremacy? Well, that's why that's why I'm saying I can't compute any other reason other than they want the destruction of this country. They want the chaos. They want the confusion. They want all of that. I don't I don't see any other. It's tragic. Well, it's been mass confusion given to the public. I was reading Michael Malice's book and I'm a friend of his and the White pill and even back to the early days of Hollywood and how they've kind of pushed socialism without us even knowing the way that it's built over time. And he's somebody who grew up with it and you look at it and mass confusion and chaos is the best way to do it. But now I truly believe people are stupid because if we're just laying out like like Nazi flags are allowing this to happen and the response of everybody in this country is like, oh yeah, that's that's you know, that's good because it's not racist. It has nothing to do with racism. It's protecting kids from being trafficked. Right. Right. Or protecting the country from strangers coming in who might not be the best for country. People that might shoot up shopping mall areas. You should be vetted. I just don't understand if I want to go to another country, I have to you know, get the proper documentation. I don't want a bunch of Swedes coming in. No, it's off the border. No, I'll take some. Really? I'll take Holland. They're pretty good makers. Yeah. Maybe. Is Holland and Swin? They're cobblers. That's a cobbler. They make good watches. Yeah. Well, we've kept the Canadians out and I grew up in Detroit on the border. We've kept them. Good surrupters and we'll put those over here. I mean, thank you. Especially under Justin Trudeau. I don't we don't want any of that. That guy is oh, that's a word. I'm not going to say it. They should hurt him though. I bet I think a lot of them do. They want to like stall and. Yeah, for sure. For sure. We didn't he didn't really say it though. Or Stalin still had enough decency not to wear blackface. Multiple times. All right. All right. Okay. Let's go ahead and we're going to take a quick break and we'll be back with more but we want to thank our sponsor, Patriot Mobile. So, Patriot Mobile is like they are one of the biggest companies when it comes to the parallel economy and contributing to the parallel economy because if you're with one of the three other mobile carriers, what you don't realize is you're paying your bill every month. You're with your hard earned money and they're taking a portion of that bill and they're donating it to left-leaning causes that you're spending probably time and energy and other money fighting against like causes that are trying to, you know, take away your guns, take away your freedoms, you know, trying to flip school boards blue. Patriot Mobile has been instrumental in fighting back against that especially when it comes to school boards. They have put some of their money in some really critical races across the nation and been very successful at flipping them conservative. They really are putting their money where their mouth is. So, think about switching to Patriot Mobile. You're going to support free speech, religious freedom, the sanctity of life, the Second Amendment and more and you're going to get the same service because they all share the same towers these days. It's the same nationwide service. You got to go there. PatriotMobile.com slash news. It is PatriotMobile.com slash news. Get free activation with the offer code news. All right. Those of you who are watching on YouTube, we are so close to 100,000 subscribers on YouTube. I listen, we're not making any money off of YouTube because they completely demonetize the channel. So the least you could do is make sure that you're subscribed. Okay. Hit the like button, comment, let us know what you think about news of the day and horrible, horrible, horrible white supremacy that we have going on. It's a good morale booster having the subscribes and the likes. Yeah, it really is. Well, yeah. Notification. Notification. Yes, definitely the bell. And I've had a lot of people who are like, I don't know, like a ton. I subscribed and now I had to go and resubscribe because magically, magically, I've gotten unsubscribed. Friends of mine. I'm not subscribed anymore. I'm like, I watch this guy like every day. What's going on? Yeah. So normal world I hear has a YouTube channel. They do. Those guys so cool. They just started. I hear it's funny. Yeah. Yeah. So let's go. Do we know the URL? Is it YouTube? Hey, Chad. Whoa. This show. This is the worst show on Blaze TV. You know why? Because they let guys like this on. Right there. I left this double up with him. Hi. Hi. The news doesn't matter. The news are why it doesn't. Black pill. Appreciate it. Never know what's going to happen around here. So I want to get to this the L.A. Dodgers story because I'm fascinated by this. So they originally the L.A. Dodgers. They invited the Sisters of Perpetual Indulgence, which is. That sounds like a hedonistic. Well, there they are, right? Well, it explains whether. Okay. Okay. Now that I see the picture, it makes a lot of sense. So they're drag nuns, I'm told. They're a group of drag nuns and they had invited them and then they got a lot of backlash. And so they uninvited them. Well, that's isn't a bit. This isn't a joke. No, no, it gets, it gets worse. Oh, yeah. It gets worse. This is the only way that white people could get preferential treatment in Los Angeles. So they invited them. They got backlash. They uninvited them. And then they got backlash from the pride community. So they reinvited them. Yeah. So now they are back invited again. And the L.A. pride put out a statement saying that they were very disappointed in the decision to rescind their invitation. As a result and in solidarity with our community, L.A. pride will not be participating in this year's Dodgers Pride Night event. And now they're still saying they're not going to go, which let's be honest, they were never going to go to the game in the first place. Am I wrong? No, I like balls. Yeah. They're fan. Yeah. But one of my friend Travis is gay. I walked right into that. He loves balls. He doesn't even bring a match. Any kind to get them. Any kind. Suck it to me. Whatever kind of ball, any game that has them. Really? Yeah. If there's pucks, no thank you. But no, he actually, like he goes to my friend Travis is gay and unmarried. He goes to Red Wings in Detroit. And he's like, I hate that they did that they added the LGBTQ. He's like, I just go as a fan. I want to be a normal person. Yeah. Just I want to sit there as a fan and not make a thing about it. Right. And they were invited, then disinvited and then invited again. And then they're like, we're not going to show up. Yeah. I remember when my dad used to take me to the old ball game in Detroit, we'd sit next to Devil Drag Queen nuns. Good response. You know, back in the 80s. Throw them on the field. When didn't you see those at a ball field? Nothing screams cracker jacks and peanuts quite like whatever these two people are. I mean, I be alive. So apparently the sisters of perpetual indulgence, you guys have been missing out because they were founded in San Francisco in 1979. They've been around for a while now and their motto is go forth and send some more. I can't imagine why San Francisco has fallen. Now, I'm sure none of them caught the virus. No. This is a case in the hall sketch. Like, what is this in there? It's right. You far enough. I don't understand. It's real. This isn't a joke. It's real. Look, this is from their website. They said, we believe in freedom of expression, teamwork, effort, and diversity. We are a family committed to social activism, social service, and spiritual development. It's just not the type of spiritual. I'm very spiritual. It's just, I guess, it's like the satanic spirit that they're looking for. But and they raise much needed funds for community charities, bring about a better understanding of gay spirituality. And they work to unite the various factions of the Southern California lesbian and gay community and raise drag awareness. Does anyone in Southern California need drag awareness? Is anyone in Southern California not aware? Do you think? I think they're fully aware. Yeah, I think it I think it roller blades by them at least 10 times a day. The saturation is is there. Well, I mean, why everyone's aware? I've been aware of it since I saw my first John Waters movie playing Pink Flamingo's what what we know what it is. What why do you want to raise awareness at a baseball game? Can we just have anything? No, no, I'm not saying you can't go, but why do you have to have these nights for anything? Well, that's why like I tweeted this last night. I was like, I don't understand. Let's just say Pride Month, right? Like, why do you think you're like, I know the entire month of June, we're going to sexual we're going to celebrate someone's sexual preference. Like, I don't understand that. Like, I don't need to celebrate a sexual preference. I just you can just like, well, you know, we used to have a wholesome culture and now we don't. Right. Right. That's why. Well, it it's just what pleasures you. I don't understand how it makes you need to be your entire identity. No, no. And I've always said that I've never understood it. Like, it's like, Oh, I'm gay. Great. But what? Well, who are you? Right. Like, I mean, when you when you're dressing up like a devilish, Sally Field, that's a different story. But I just don't understand why you're catering to it in the sense of like, Oh, this is Pride night. It's also a bat night. It's like, what is your skill? Are you why you're a magician? You do something you do, like puppetry or something? We're loud to make music. We bother kids. Okay. Yes. We make it a month. Yeah, we make something about it. It's obnoxious. I'll just say what it is. It's obnoxious. We I I like care. It's the world's ending. If you want to do this, I'm going to pretend. Do that on stage and have good music. You know, Elton John, big, crazy costumes and big glasses, but he could sing. I went to Elton. Yeah. It was amazing. Yeah. Have a skill. Have a gigantic, wonderful, fun show. We had a spatoon. We made jokes, but it's just that it was an amazing show. He's an amazing artist. Great. It doesn't. But who goes to Elton John? They thought he was straight for the longest time. Like a talent is it? You know, I don't know. Oh, yeah, they thought Liberace was straight. Remember when you go on old? Really? Yeah. You go on old Carson's and they'd be like, Oh, if you met, he's like, I just haven't found Mrs. Right yet. It's a lot of tail that day. Oh, that guy. He's always getting around. He's got a cough. So you mentioned the, um, the they're kind of after the kids as it turns out. We covered what Target is doing yesterday. Today. Yes. Today, which by the way, our friend Alex Stein has a video that he's debuting on his show, Primetime with Alex Stein. You're going to want to tune into that. I, you might not want to tune in either way. It's there value your eyeballs. Yeah, exactly. You'll want to bleach them afterwards, but it is funny. So Washington State is set to host an employee diversity training conference that will cost taxpayers roughly $83,000. And on day three of the training attendees will get the opportunity to hear a drag queen story, our fireside chat. I think they're getting paid. They're not getting paid enough. You think we should up it? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. For more. I just, I don't understand the look. I don't, I'm not looking to like ban drag shows from happening for adults. I think like whatever you want to do is fine. But I, I will just say I'm still judging these people because I don't understand as a woman, I don't understand why, what the fascination is with like women going with all of their women friends. Like the, um, you know, I go, I go to expose it, sadly. So I vomit a lot afterwards, but, um, but I see a lot of like bashler at parties and stuff like that. I don't find it entertaining to watch a man pretend to be me. And I certainly don't want to give them my money. That's what I don't get. Like I'm like, I don't, I'm not interested in paying you to pretend to be me. It's part of that like women like to have the gay best friend because they're like, Oh, you're a man, but you're like one of us and like, yeah, and Kathy talking or not. So it's like that, but extended to a big show. That must be what it is. It's gotta be one. I just don't, I used to pretend to be the gay best friend. That's a good idea. Like, do you think you can straighten me out? You're the one. Yeah. That can change that. Is that worked every time? Really? It works for you? Yep. I lost suits. Coming up. So, okay. So when we come back, I want to talk, I want to talk quickly about what's going on. We're on this, this LGBT issue. Let's talk about what's going on with Bud Light because man, they are still feeling the effects of their decision. What is week three? Yeah, to work with Dylan Mulvaney. First one, I think our sponsor, my Patriot Supply. So, the thing is, is even the president of the United States said pretty recently that we're going to have food shortages, and he said it way too casually for me to be comfortable. So you really need to make sure that you are prepared. And the thing about being prepared with food is that you can't wait until some sort of a crisis hits. What was it? Like a bunch of tons of ammonium nitrate or something just was found missing from a train. And a bunch of senators were given emergency satellite phones just in case. That's weird. Yeah, you know, like things are not going well as they put it on. So you took my Nazi flag. Oh, that's weird. That is weird. And so you just need to be prepared. So, might I suggest that you go to preparewithnews.com. They've got breakfast lunches, dinners from my Patriot Supply, which is the nation's largest preparedness company.

The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the blaze and I traveled to Maui for this first ever blaze original documentary.

The Wall Street Journal reported that Bud Light has a new plan to try and make it up to their wholesalers for their substantial obviously loss and revenue since its partnership with Dylan Mulvaney. Yes, well, they are actually they're buying back on sold cases of beer that have gone past their expiration date. So they are buying it back from their wholesalers. And I don't know how that's helpful for them necessarily, but we'll see what this graph is incredible. This is weekly sales volume in the US change from a year earlier and you can see white just huge drop. It's fascinating. You know, we talk about all of this trans issue and how they've been targeting women specifically. They're taking over men or taking over women's spaces. They're in their locker rooms. They're getting, you know, ambassadorships to sell makeup and sports bras and leggings and all these different things that they're taking away from women. And what is it men who drink Bud Light who are the ones to be like, you know what? We're not doing this. See, this is not it's not an LGBT issue. This is a bad beer issue. Yeah, you can fill that up. I'm so happy about this because people should not be drinking Bud Light anyway. It's a bad beer. It's not even beer. I'm giving it the courtesy of calling it a beer. It's not even a beer. And finally, people are waking up to that fact. As a recovering alcoholic myself, I would have drank anything and I skipped past Bud Light most of the time. So the idea that you're going to I don't understand why they would even use her, am I saying that right? Yeah, as the as the spokesperson because it just doesn't appeal to anybody. Like here's what the company should do. Have the beer being poured into a glass and then just say Bud Light. Like there's a there's a commercial from the 90s for Bud Light where it's men all dressed as women going to a lady's night and schooling them in pool. Yeah, that wasn't that long ago. And now they just have a real guy who's like, you know, he's getting like shaving deals, he's getting like Ed Shee what I had who knows. I just if you say shim, I feel like it covers both some covers. It's not like a slur. It shim does sound like a shimmy. I prefer it to be a slur. That's how I mean it. I hope you take it that way. But I like how they're buying back. Like why is this worth it to you? Like listen, you know the trans community we just completely pandered to we're going to buy all it back because we don't like you now. It's like you guys don't like you didn't like it anyway. Right. You sell it. You sell one of the last legal drugs. It's all I mean, I'm not saying there's anything wrong with alcohol. I'm sure many of you at home abuse it. But I'm just saying that it doesn't it what does it matter? It's just something that gets you messed up. Yeah, well, it's it's also been fascinating. I watched I'm sorry. I was with my friend Jesse Kelly earlier and we were talking about he his he had a great tweet thread earlier about how social media has been just like the worst asset to companies because they get these brand accounts and then all of these communists, you know, trolls go on there and scream at them whenever they do anything. And so they feel like that's real life. And then they do something like a Dylan Mulvaney partnership. And then it just backfires horribly because they don't realize people on Twitter who are bitching at you all the time are not that that's not your demographic. That's not right. That's not the real world. The same thing like you said with these brands. Same thing with movie studios with actors like actors should not have social media. We don't want to know the dumb things that go through your brain. We don't want to know. We want you to just act and pretend to be smart, especially when it's spewed elitism that you're forced to say. Exactly. With a lot of them. Yeah. Yeah. All right. I want to switch gears here and talk about report that has come out that Ron DeSantis is officially declaring his presidential run during a Twitter spaces with Elon Musk tomorrow, which I read is the same time as my show airs. So I don't know how many people are watching the show tomorrow. You should just live cover. I know. I know. I know. My producer was like, can we just like stream it live? I don't know. With a Twitter space, can we do that? I don't know. I don't know. I'll have the, I'll have the control room. Let me know. It's all audio. Right. So it's all about the Julie interest. Right. That's why I was like, I don't know with audio only if we can do that. But you don't need to what, I'm telling you what he's going to say. So you don't need to listen. He's going to announce that he's running for president in 2024. And then all hell is going to break loose in the Republican party. It's about to get wild. I'm not looking forward to it. I'm here for it. Let's get wild. I'm not here for the last election was awesome. I want Hillary to run again. Could you imagine? Do you think she will? I hope so. I think it turned out well the last time it's like the Santa is really collapsed. Talk about the power of the Clintons. Dude. Isn't it crazy like Hillary didn't win. And then just everything has been destroyed. So maybe if we do it again. Yeah. She would like out absolutely. All right. Even the powerful people don't get their toys anymore. You're down to suicide. Yeah. I mean really. I just, what do you, does, does Santa even have a shot? I, I thought so. Yeah. Because I don't, I like him personally. The polls do not look. They don't well. And yeah, Trump came back. CNN did the dumbest thing you could possibly do. That was a bad play on their part. But you could play for Trump. Great play for Trump. Yeah. So if you want to keep him, you know, out of people's minds, you don't give him the exact platform that made him present nasty person. Yeah. You're very fat. You're gross. You're gross. And then they're like, Oh yeah. I like this guy. Yeah. Exactly. He came out swinging. It's going to be difficult to fight against Trump because he is so like, there's, he's so loved. He came out of the gate swinging. Let's see what Ron does. Like I, I like Ron. I do. I do too. But going up against Trump right now is going to be difficult. But maybe he'll like, it'll just be during the, you know, it's not going to be the primaries. It'll be Trump. I think during the pandemic, do get out for a while. Yeah. Like, you know, Trump did do a lot of things that I think a lot of conservatives will not admit where it didn't involve closing the country listening to people. It was not happy. And DeSantis didn't. He actually stood up and governed his state and he stepped against the government and going against what they were telling him to do. And I have a lot of respect for DeSantis for that. Yeah. So I do genuinely like him. And I hope that he does have a shot because I think he is a good leader. I wish they would team up. Yeah, that's true. I do too. I really do. That'd be cool. I really, I would like to hear Donald Trump, who by the way, I feel like there's no right answer because I'm going to piss off half of the audience. It doesn't matter. Yeah. But it's like, I love both of these guys. And I think they're both very strong leaders. I would like to hear Donald Trump. Maybe in reflection, say that perhaps Operation Warp Speed was not the best decision. Or he thought Operation Warp Speed was fine, but the people around him played him. They duped him. He believed the wrong people, right? Like Dr. Fauci lied to him. They bamboozled him. You know, just some sort of recognition that the vaccine is maybe not all it was cracked up to be. And that's all that I'll say, Big Tech. Was that true? Whoa, that's the first time hearing of it. It's very safe, very effective. Oh. 100% effective. I've gotten five of them. Really? I've had six boosters. Okay. And they gave me a defibrillator with my last one. They just like in a gift bag for you. Yeah, yeah. When you leave the hospital, you're going to need this. That's really just for emergency. All right, let's go ahead and we're going to take another quick break. We'll be back with more. I want to thank Refuge Ghost. So look, Big Tech, big data.

I believe that she is in Canada, if I'm not mistaken, where the assisted suicide is now like, Why does she care about Asian kids? The thing. And she has been making these videos of her dying grandmother promoting, they're calling, I guess like we were supposed to call it euthanasia. I mean, it's assisted suicide to her 30,000 TikTok followers. I want to play. Papa grandma's, I like to call it. Yeah. Do what? Popping grandma. Yeah. Okay. They're really easy to kill. Yeah, they're slow. Yeah. I want to play. This is, it's just so weird to me. We're just going on that weekend. She's like, sell up. I don't know. It's weird. Let's watch. What are your thoughts as you as you like move closer to the day? It's like the light at the end of the tunnel. What are some of the precursors like the questions they asked to make sure you're doing it the right way through diagnosis? If it's fatal, how many more months you have, they give you time to consider. They keep stressing the fact that you can always change your mind. What is the actual day like? I know that they said in the apartment, they're just injection putting you to sleep. And the big pain is to prick in the hand to provide for the little valves. And then once you're in the deep sleep, there are other two other injections you get. I love to watch people. It's painless. Would you prefer it be at home? I think it might be something like a dude at the hospital. I came in widely. I said to people, are you nervous? Are you excited? How do you feel? Those people. It's putting an end to being dependent. Why don't you be excited? The girl was surprised that the damn purchase is it something you're going to take off every day? No, it's just going to happen. But why is she so put together? She's so, she's crying. She's so weird. She's so cute. She's like, I'm very sad. She's so cute. Those are real days. I know they're saying to both times. She seems together though. That's why it's like, yeah. She's really sharp. She wasn't like dementia-readle. Like my name, not until 96. Yeah. And I would like pick her up and... What a quitter. Yeah. And I, she'd be like, she has diabetes, don't take her to Red Lobster. She's going to ask. And I'd be like, okay. And then I'd take her to Red Lobster because I'm a good grandson. Right. So why would I not let you enjoy something? I don't care. The Tutter Bay Rolls or whatever they're going to be. What I say, I'm going to take you out of a home and not bring you where you want. Right. Yeah. Let's go have a Bob Evans meal. I just don't. Okay. So she, I want to show the post on Instagram that she made with this. To be honest, I was very resistant to euthanasia before she told me her decision. It felt unethical to me, but I have had my mind change after hearing her reasons. And I'm so happy she has the option available in Canada. How to live well and die well our codes. And she has given me knowledge on both to the goat with a champagne toast emoji. I just, I like... So what are the options there when you get there? Like, okay, you can, you can get an injection. You could drive off a cliff with a car. You could be a crash test dummy, you know, do some science. Right. Right. You know, like, I have a... I need more cool options. Yeah, they have like a Vorkin thing that looks like two empty two liters and some wire. Yeah. Yeah. Sorry about it. I, well, I remember whenever Canada just started rolling this out and they had the government made this very, I mean, it was high quality theatrical type commercial, basically advertising it. Yeah, again, Damien. Yes. Thank you. And I was like, man, we are at a really weird place where we are, they're sensationalizing, killing yourself. Yeah, a lot. I'm sure a lot of people want to groove with me. I mean, if there's a point where you are in such horrific pain and you can't go on and every day is just screaming and utter agony, I can understand that. I'm sorry, I do. But I don't understand why somebody who seems have sounded by mind and body is being encouraged to die. I don't think that makes sense. But it also goes along with healthcare in other countries. We've even said it here, mental health and all that other stuff is, what are you doing to actually treat her? Can she get the proper treatment? We don't even know. So if she's actually feeling that way, how much pain is she in and why can't she give the treatment for the pain that she's in? Right. Right. And to Dave's point, I think that it's not just those people. They've extended it to even teenagers and people who suffer from mental health problems. So you can be like, I'm depressed, I don't see a way out. I just want to kill myself and they will allow you to do that in Canada. Yeah, and some doctors like, yes. Yeah. I'm waiting for this day. Yeah, exactly. You're a gunshot. Yeah. So just... Come to my office. Yes, come on. Just some room covered in tarps like Dexter. Lay on the table. Well, it just doesn't make sense because that should never be encouraged. Just somebody who deals with depression bipolar. I had my mom dealt with that. It's something that can be treated and people don't realize that it really is a cliche of the long-term answer to a short-term problem. Right. But that should be the most encouraged thing. And we've had a problem with mental health care in this country for so long. It's an absolute disgrace and it's been going on since the 80s. Yeah. And it's why we see so many homeless people. We see so many issues with drugs. People can't get the right treatment. Right. And it's expensive. Yeah. And I mean that. And then you go over to someplace in Canada where it's like, well, we have universal health care. Now, it's like, all right, it's not the best, but we do have a universal suicide option. You like to get in the gas chain. Right. Right. Yeah. You don't like the health care we provide. You could just kill yourself. Yeah. And then we won't have to provide anything for you. Isn't that a joke in Futurama? The show Futurama, there was like suicide booths you got in and you just ended it. Yeah. Like that is reality. Yeah. It just doesn't seem like, yeah, it should definitely be this option for somebody who clearly has life in them. Right. Especially if you're very young, a teenager. It's like, oh no, you should be depressed. This is going to teach you that life sucks when you hit 25. And then when you 30 and 40 and you realize that everything is emptying this in just disappoints. All right. Let's go ahead and we got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. 50 Marines witnessed what they believed to be a UFO hovering over their California military base. This was footage from back in 2021. So this is a triangular shaped UFO. And it had obviously, you guys were listening, you're missing it. It has these flickering lights. Let's go along the edges. Isn't that wild? And it's closure. It said it hovered for 10 minutes. It's moving. Just hovered there. And then it vanished without a trace, they said, after about 10 minutes. And they estimated that it ranged from the size of a stealth bomber to approximately half the length of a football field. So it just looked at California and was like, we should get out of here. This is what they're trying to do. It's poison. How wild. Okay. So is that, is that, are those aliens? Yes. I believe in aliens. Weather balloon. I don't, I think there's probably some kind of alien life forms. If there ever came to Earth, I don't think so. But that's pretty weird. I wish that would end Earth. It would end racism. They should show us. Because we all have something new to hate. They're like, we hate the green guys. Yeah, it would be so easy for everybody to be like the purple octopus people are now the enemy. And then we all unite like Independence Day. I like it. But yeah, I believe they could be out there. The universe is infinite. I mean, if you look at alien life form could be a plant. So is there a plant maybe in a galaxy? It could be either aliens or our new Chinese overlords ready to come in and take over. I mean either way. I've been broked. All right. Tell everyone we got like 20 seconds. Tell everyone where they can find you. YouTube.com slash normal world. Normal world. Normal world. Our brand new show starts June 20th right here on The Blaze.
