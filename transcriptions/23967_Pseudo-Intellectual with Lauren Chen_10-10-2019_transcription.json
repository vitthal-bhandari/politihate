    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. My name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. We really appreciate you tuning in and a big thank you, especially to our live viewers. We have a fun show. We're going to be starting off with the discussion of the Antifa member who was part of that blockade that was harassing that old lady in Hamilton. He was found to be a Syrian refugee and now people are apparently sending his family death threats. Then we have Trisha Paytas who has come out as a trans gay man who is still feminine and then some news about Sweden's issues with migrants. And we're going to be finishing off the show on a wholesome note about Ellen DeGeneres. Yeah, something a little bit uplifting for once. And before we get into that though, I just want to say that if you guys are watching and would like to support the show, if you're watching live, don't forget you can give us super chats. We want to say a big thank you, especially for last week's show. You guys were beyond generous. We really appreciate it. So we're not going to be reading those during the show. But if you wait until like an hour into the stream, we are going to be going through all of your comments, questions, concerns. And don't forget, if you want to go even further to help out, you can of course always head on over to BlaseTV.com slash Lauren for 10% off all of, sorry, I'm reading two different promos. Is it $10 off your $10 off yearly subscription with code Lauren. And then the new news we have today, another way you guys could chip in is we have lovely merch. Yeah, you can get mugs, pseudo intellectual, Blase media, not just for our show, but any other show that's on the Blase network, they're having a special right now. And that code is Lauren 10 for 10% off guys. I'm sorry, I put my phone on silent, but it's a new phone. And I don't, I don't know how it works. You have to help me. It's an Android, I was an iPhone user. All right, so yeah, it's 10% off the entire order. If you go to shop.blazemedia.com, and there's no minimum purchase requirements, you can use that code as many times as you want. And the discount ends on the 13th at just before midnight central time. So Sunday at midnight. So I'm wearing this one. If you're an audio only listener, you won't be able to see what it says pseudo intellectual. There are a lot of fun designs and not just our show, but you can get chat Prather stuff, Ali Stucky stuff, whatever. Good designs too. I have to say I was impressed. Yeah. And yeah, so to get right into it, Antifa. So a couple weeks ago, I think it's two weeks ago at this point, Dave Rubin and Max and Bernier did an event for the PPC people's party of Canada, Canada's I guess center right libertarian party in Hamilton, Ontario. We did our own coverage of the event. You know, that video is up on anywhere you watch us. And something that happened at the event that went viral was that Antifa members were blocking the access of an elderly couple, including an older woman in with a walker. They were calling the elderly couple Nazis blocking their path. It was it was just awful. Here's a refresher of what that looked like in case anyone has forgotten. That was obviously upsetting to watch, which is why that clip got so much attention. I think last count it has over 7 million views. Yeah, at least. Yeah. And that's just one version of it. It was it was everywhere. And it really didn't take too long because it is the internet for people to begin identifying the Antifa members in that video. As you could see, they were all kind of wearing max masks or covering their faces. But apparently some of them did things like took smoking breaks outside of the venue that they're protesting or just took off their masks on the way home. So people did end up getting pictures of what they look like. And then they were tracked down. So not the best mastermind criminals and actually one of the members that was identified, the gentleman in the orange shirt, it turns out is a Syrian refugee who was settled into Canada in 2015. And andy andy know how to tweet about this intelligence group. X Intel reports that one of the masked Antifa militants who harass the elderly woman with the walker is Allah Sufi Dallua, or I've also been seeing him identified as al Sufi. I can confirm that I independently verified this as well. Dallua is a Syrian man who's settled in Canada. Now I think there has been some questions over whether that was doxing. Yeah, I was gonna say like, is that that seems like something that we might be against? Just putting out these people's names and their faces. And that I understand that. And my thoughts did go to that as well. Initially, when, you know, people started circulating their pictures and everything. But the thing is, they're, the police is investigating the incident that was caught on on video right now. They're saying it might be possible charges include intimidation, assault, disguise with intent and mischief. So what what we witnessed just then was a crime, according to Canadian police, right? So I think there's a difference between trying to dock someone because of their political opinions and trying to identify criminals so that they can be charged and prosecuted. Right? I mean, I think we see this all the time. Police will issue like, be on the lookout for this person or whatever. I saw it all the time when I was in university campus, when they had people suspected of thievery and things like that. I think there is a difference between trying to help police identify suspects and just doxing with malicious intent because you don't like someone's views. That's how I see it at least. And in any case, let's see, the latest development in this story, because their identities were leaked, I think sometime last week, very shortly after the event itself actually occurred. Apparently, this guy, his family owns a family restaurant in Toronto that serves Syrian food. And the family restaurant has now been kind of involved in the controversy. They've been featured as it kind of seems like success stories for how great refugees and migrants are in Canada, which doesn't really make sense because from the reporting that I've seen on it and I wasn't able to independently verify this myself, it kind of seems like before they were in Canada in Toronto, they actually were living in the Gulf and owned a beach resort. That's what people are saying online. I wasn't able to see where they got that information from. If that is true, kind of seems like a misuse of the refugee system, not saying that they wouldn't deserve to come over because I'm for people bringing money and opening businesses in Canada like a restaurant, but refugees get a certain type of benefit that it kind of seems like maybe these people didn't need, right? They get handouts and stipends and things like that. I will say that I also, I kind of hate that they're considered model citizens because there's that old stereotype where everybody's like, oh, migrants are so good. Don't you like Chinese food? You know, don't you like Syrian food? It's like, all right, food's good. But, but I think, okay, I agree. Food therefore open borders. Open. I mean, I love ethnic food doesn't mean it's good enough for open borders, but I think the point was that they're business owners. Yeah, no, absolutely. Yeah, because Toronto is one of the most expensive cities in North America. And I mean, so that's just one of the reasons why the story of them being refugees doesn't make sense. Like, how do you get the money? Within a few years of coming to Canada as refugees to open up a legit brick and mortar in Toronto? It's strange, but in any case, nothing against the family aside from that. But because of their son, his identity being revealed, people were kind of, I guess, drawing attention to the fact that his family owned a restaurant. And so the restaurant is named Sufis. And they actually released a statement on their social media regarding their son's involvement in the protests. We have it here. They said in light of Sunday's events and the photos slash videos that have been circulating around Facebook and social media, we would like to formally apologize for the unfortunate incident that occurred with the elderly woman. Allah regrets that he did not step aside and or stand up against the act of verbal abuse that occurred against her and would love the opportunity to personally extend his apologies to her. That said, we affirm that he did not in any way verbally or physically assault the elderly woman or any other person. From what I can tell in the video, it doesn't seem like he specifically was yelling at the woman. So I think I heard him a couple times. But he was definitely out test Austro on by the other two. Yeah. They continue our family and business do not condone acts of hate, violence or harassment in any shape or form and advocate for peace, equality, and free speech for all human beings. Our family immigrated to Canada with the intention of living and working peacefully. Our family's restaurant is the product of our desire to share and spread our love for our food and culture. We are extremely lucky and grateful to be here and are in awe of the kindness and warmth of the Canadian people. We respect people's opinions and judgments. However, we kindly ask the people refrain from sending abusive and or threatening messages to our staff and family members with love the al-Sufi. So I mean, I think that's a pretty good statement for them to have release. I like that they, you know, they talk about how they don't condone her hate, harassment, violence, they stand up for peace, equality, and free speech. Love that. The thing is though, and I, by the way, I don't condone them being wrapped into the situation at all, right? Because I, from what I can tell the guy's parents own this business, why this involves them, I still will not understand. But I will say that it doesn't seem like their defense of their son seems very legit in light of some of the things people have dug up of him at past events. And you know, I'm not saying that these parents were lying because again, I don't know them and it's completely possible that he came to them and said, Mom, Dad, I don't know. I like, I was invited by friends. I had no idea what was going on. I just, you know, it happened so fast. I think he's been saying that the mask he was wearing was someone else that like they gave it to him or something. So I mean, put it on him. You didn't have a choice. Yeah. I can totally see that maybe this guy is just lying to his parents and the parents wanting to believe their son or sticking out for him. But I think we know that's not the case, aside from the fact that it's very, I would imagine hard to stand in front of an old woman while people are yelling at her and still think you're in the right there. There is a Twitter user, actually, I think several of them who've been compiling footage of the same guy at different Antifa protests, taking part in violence, taking part of like, I think it looked like at one point he himself had grabbed someone's hat off and was like in a confrontation with the cops. We have this clip here and I'm sorry to these parents. Don't know what to tell you. Seems like your son's a piece of crap. Some of it I will say you have to look for the guy in it. But a lot of it is a lot of it's obvious, but certain ones like the fight scenes you have to look from in the background. Yeah, but he's there. Yeah. With your feet in the air and your head on the ground. Try this trick and spin it. Yeah. Your head will collapse and there's nothing in it and you'll ask yourself. Where is my mind? The rock. So the idea that he didn't know what was going on, he was just wrapped into this, having a trouble, having a hard time believing that. But you know, dirt bag, sun, aside, people actually started sending this family and their restaurant threats. And that is not okay. I mean, I don't even think threat should be sent to the sun. Don't send threats to everyone. I think the sun should be held accountable for his actions because I mean, like getting violent and up in people's faces. That's that is illegal. I fully believe in holding people accountable under the law. And you know, definitely maybe we rethink our immigration system. I don't think that political violence or intimidation is really in line with Canadian values. If you ask me a little values test might be nice, but ultimately two wrongs do not make a right. Sending someone a threat doesn't say anything about their behavior. It says everything about your own behavior. It's morally reprehensible to try to threaten someone and not to mention illegal. You are committing a crime if you threaten someone. But especially don't send threats to their family. Yeah. I was next level. Yeah. You and I get a lot of crap doing this show and just our parents, our family, they don't have anything to do with this. I'm imagining it's the same for this person. And just I hate that in today's society. And we'll get into this more with the Ellen segment. But our first instinct is who who surrounding them? Can I hurt like, can I go after their friends, their their employment, their family, their family's employment? It's just awful. And what really made the story blow up is that it was announced that in light of all of the threats and harassment, they've been receiving the families actually now closing down their restaurant. They posted this onto their Instagram account permanently closed. They wrote as a result of numerous hate messages and death threats we've received over the past week, we've decided to permanently close our shop. Our decision is made with a heavy heart in effort to maintain our family and staff's safety. We would like to thank our lovely customers and Queen Street neighbors for their wonderful support over the past two years. And it just goes on with that with love the al-Sufi family. And I know a lot of people when this kind of things happen happens, they say, okay, are they exaggerating? The family actually did provide screenshots and photos of threats that were sent to them on social media. And when it comes to actual physical altercations one on one in real life, I'm totally with you guys for being skeptical. But when it comes to death threats online, I don't have any trouble believing a person has received death threats online. You can post the most innocent thing and you'll still get death threats online, not that it makes it any less serious, but it's like it's disgusting. It's very cowardly, but in light of the media surrounding their son, I don't have any trouble believing that they did get death threats because yeah, absolutely. But I guess to me where my kind of lizard brain goes is like, did this really force them to close? Or was there also financial reasons they weren't doing that well already? Because I don't know anyone that would shut down their profitable business or something like that. That seems very strange to me. And I really hope maybe be really jaded right now, but that they're not playing this like a victim card in hopes of profiting off at some way. Some very lucrative go fund me. And I think that's like a reasonable thing to question from what I saw the police is going to start looking into these threats. Because I mean, and maybe we are so jaded being used to this sort of like online onslaught of hate and stuff. But it's like, there's a difference for me between some random person saying, I'm going to kill you, we get that a lot versus something that looks like an actionable threat. And like, I'm at a point now where maybe maybe we're just more used to it than these people were. If it's just some random crazy online is not going to scare me, it's not going to change how I behave. It would be very different. If you know, someone had home address or personal information, I actually believe that they were going to do something. So I mean, maybe the police and stuff, the family, no stuff we don't know, their address with this restaurant is publicly available. Maybe that's affected things as well. But yeah, a lot of people are condemning the hatred and violence against them, which is totally legitimate. But it kind of seems like I'm referring to Canadian politicians specifically, Justin Trudeau and Andrew Sheer, who if you're not familiar with him, he's the leader of our fake cook served party here. They've both condemned the harassment against the restaurant. But it kind of seems like they only care to condemn hate when it affects their own constituents, because I mean, with the whole incident with the older woman being harassed by Antifa or even the Antifa presence at the PPC event at all, I don't think either of them said anything. I didn't see a peep from them. No, I didn't see a peep from them. So I mean, not to say that they're wrong in condemning this, they should, we all should, but it's like, why, why just now? Why didn't you say anything about how awful hatred and division is before when it was your political opponents being affected? It just seems kind of fishy to me. And Max Simbernier, who is the leader of the PPC, who was actually the event that the Antifa conflict happened at was his event with Dave Rubin. He released a statement on it too, saying, unlike Justin Trudeau and Andrew Sheer, I condemn both the hate and threats directed at this family because of the actions of their son and the hate and verbal assault from Antifa thugs directed at an 81 year old woman at our Hamilton event last week. So it's not hard to condemn both, both instances as I think they're trying to play into the card where look, Max Simbernier is fans are harassing this immigrant family. Like trying to make the PPC look like a racist party, what has been the go to for, you know, the Republican party should be used to this in the States. That's the same thing over here with the PPC. Yeah, that's that. And that's what they were chanting. You know, they're calling people Nazis on the street. And in some way, the Prime Minister and Andrew Sheer are getting behind that by not condemning their actions and by trying to make Max's party supporters look like, you know, racist. Yeah. And I will say that, okay, the video of the couple being harassed, that has 7 million views. Yeah. I would love to say that the PPC has 7 million members. But we don't, you know, my hope in the future of Canadian politics would be very different if we did. But it's like, there's no reason to believe that, you know, Max Simbernier or the PPC or its members are directly related to the threats. There's not enough there. And even the way that Canadian media has been reporting on this, they've been saying like, you know, threats related to Max Simbernier force restaurant closure of refugees. It's like, really, that's how you're gonna, what a smear. That's how you're gonna frame this. So it's just, yeah, just an unfortunate incident all around sympathies to the family. I hope they're okay. I hope that people who have sent them threats, the police that, you know, they get to the bottom of it. And I also hope that the people who are assaulting the lady get held accountable for their actions because there's just, it seems like there's like a lot of trash out there lately. And I hope things get cleaned up a little bit. Moving on to Trisha Paytas. So if you don't know who Trisha Paytas is, how do you describe her? I want to see a beauty. No, no, she's just like a youtuber of logger, a drama youtuber almost. Yeah. And she's also an adult entertainer, which we didn't know. We didn't know until we took a look at her Twitter. Yeah. Anyway, graphic. Don't do it. At least not in public. No, no. So she has millions of followers online. I think she's like one of the OG youtubers. I I've never really been a big follower of hers, but I've always kind of known or heard about her senior videos pop up for like years and years now. So she has millions of followers. And she is best known for kind of being involved in drama and controversy. She often does videos crying on her kitchen floor about various things. That's the only time I've ever seen any of those things. No, same. Because that's when they bleed into the rest of the YouTube realm. And this is where they get a lot of attention. Right. So she like in my mind, that's what she's best known for crying on her kitchen floor about various things. And she's also people. I mean, I don't follow her enough to be able to make any huge comments about her character personality. But I know in the past, she has spoken out about being gay. And then she came out as bi or maybe bi first then. I don't know. She's also said that she was black ones. She did a video about like changing her ethnicity or something. She's also come out as like a Trump supporter or Republican at one point, like a Christian other point like she's she is all the things basically. Yeah. Yeah. So like as much as we are going to talk about a segment involving her, the the gist of our segment, we don't really want to talk too much about her because because the content, you know, like she she might be wanting it. This might all be a play to some degree. Yeah. So this really isn't about Trisha Paytas so much as it is the trans community. Yes. Because the latest thing she's claiming to be is a trans female to male transgender gay person who still presents feminine. Yeah, it's a drag drag male. That is attracted to gay men. No, she's the gay man attracted to. Yeah, but she's she's. Oh, yeah. And she is a male that likes to dress up in drag and is attracted to gay men. Yeah. And the man would need to be gay in order to be attracted to her technically even though she looks like a woman because she identifies as a man. Correct. Quite the world. We live in. Okay. So we have a clip of her announcing all of that here. That's why I identify more as a gay man because I like guys, but I also identify as a guy. If that makes sense. The thing that kind of like stops it is I do love, which a lot of gay men do too. I do love like glam and voluptuousness. So in my head, I feel like I'm a transgender female to male, but also like a drag queen. That's kind of how I've like rationalized it. That's a it's quite the thing. Yeah. Quite sure. I fully understand it, but you know, whatever. So when she released that people predictably had a lot to say and look, I'm not part of the trans community myself. I'm also not a huge Trisha Paytas viewers. So this is like, I've really just been observing this as an outsider and enjoying all the chaos around me. And it kind of seems like there were two or there's two different approaches to what we see going on. So I think if you're like one of the old school trans people, if there even is such a thing, but you know, one of the trans people who believes in such a thing as a gender binary, maybe someone like Blair White, who actually did her own video, responding to Trisha, then you would kind of see this as bull crap, frankly, right? Because you can't be a trans man, but identify with your birth gender, which she did say in the video that she still identifies with her birth gender, because that's kind of defeating the whole purpose or meaning of being trans. And basically everything Trisha was saying in her video just made it seem like she was kind of a tomboy who at the same time had a taste for drag aesthetics and was into gay men. But like that doesn't make you men. Like those are all your preferences, which are gray, but it's like your personality is not the same as your gender. So and also like she's not transitioning at all. So this is literally in some ways, it could be said her coming out as special yet again. But if you're someone who subscribes to the non binary sense of things, then I'm sorry, but the way I see it again, as someone who is not part of this LGBT community who is just trying her best to understand it, it kind of seems like you don't have any any right to say anything about the way Trisha Paytas identifies. That's what I would say. I mean, what what what grounds do you have to reject her identification? Yeah, and yeah, her lived experience as a trans man, because like, yes, she does present pretty feminine, but she like and to be fair, she's never said anything about gender dysphoria until now. But if I remember correctly, like, we're not supposed to gate keep the trans experience, right? People with rally down. Absolutely. Like, no, people were gatekeeping and it was wrong. Seems like that's what some people are doing now. And that the trans community isn't just for people who don't, sorry, the trans community is not just for people who actually transition, you can still be trans if you don't transition. That's something that I've heard a lot to. And that your gender identity and presentation doesn't need to fit neatly into the masculine or feminine paradigm if you're transitioning the gender. So you can still be a trans man who presents feminine and that shouldn't affect it. So from what I've seen, it kind of seems like Tricia is falling right in line with all the things that. In fact, did we read a tweet last week or two weeks ago that said the most transphobic thing you could do is say that you're not trans? Yes, I think we might something like that. I don't know. She seems it seems to fit in with exactly what the trans community is advocating for. But I think that and I'm not saying that the wrong, they kind of say, Hey, there's something up here. This might not be legitimate. But it's perfect proof that their system is highly flawed. Yeah, because I think a lot of people do think of Tricia Paytas as a troll because of all the things like I mentioned before, she's done a lot of kind of outrageous things that people do think is for attention. It's worked super big online. And I think she's been trying to market. When I did look at her Twitter page, there was some business stuff going on there, I would say, you know, trying to make the fuck off the attention that she's going to be getting. Exactly. But I mean, I just don't think people who subscribe to the type of ideology she's referring to have any grounds to disbelieve her from based on what they've said, because to be honest, some of the most vocal trans activists online that I've seen or non binary people, like frankly, looking at them and listening to them, you would probably just assume they were regular, feminine men or butte women. Like, I mean, the label of trans has become really stretched out with the whole inclusion of non binary gender identities. So it's like, is she wrong to be saying the stuff that she's people are upset about it? But I don't quite understand with based on their own logic. Why? And we have some examples of the backlash. She's gotten so Steph Senjati, who is a very popular male to female trans YouTuber. I don't know if she subscribes to this whole the non binary thing, but she says this would be more funny if girls weren't being killed for disclosing this fact. And then Tricia replies, it's not meant to be funny because I don't look like a traditional male on the outside. I'm a joke. Men can wear dresses, heels and makeup, you know, clothes minded and ignorant, which like, I mean, maybe she's just like the greatest troll of all time. That felt like a troll post right there. That almost like the clothes minded and ignorant part. I was like, that sounds like a Donald Trump thing right there. No, but she's right and saying like that is what they would say. Yeah, I agree. Like it is kind of heteronormative to say that a trans man can't wear dresses, heels and makeup. Yeah, I don't know. Someone else said you put trans men in danger with this video that I think is kind of unfair because I don't think I pretty sure she's maybe doing this for attention, but I still don't know if it's fair to say she's putting people in danger by doing this. That seems like a bit of a stretch. It seems like a bit of a stretch. But we also know that what they consider danger and violence is like a very arbitrary. Yeah, very loose definitions of those terms. So yeah, I don't know. To me, it looks like these trans activists have kind of backed themselves into a corner. In any case, though, Tricia, after all of this controversy over what she did, she released another video elaborating more on her transness. Is it an apology video? It's I mean, the video is called apology, but and she does say things that have the word apologize and I'm sorry in them, but it's basically. Yeah, because I'm sorry that your feelings are hurt, but I am a man and yeah, something that. And so yeah, we have a clip from that video. And I think you guys should note that she is, I think on her living room this time on the floor crying. So yeah, classic Tricia Paytas. I identify as a male a too. I don't know. It's so hard because I've been through therapy for the past six months over this. I've been through talking. I talked about this over and over. I know maybe I created this for myself that when I used to troll years and years and years ago, people just got into me seriously. And that's I guess just something I have to do with because he probably like hides something. So I mean, I don't know. And to be clear here, I don't hate anyone. Like I don't hate Tricia Paytas. She can I don't know what she's going through, whatever, but I don't hate her for sure. I would be willing to say that she probably from what I've seen with about her over the years, she probably actually does have some some mental issues. Yeah, and probably doesn't need professional help. And it does sound like she's talking to a therapist, but maybe not the right type of therapist, I would say, because the therapist has been advising her on specifically on the subject, right? Yeah, so maybe she's it's kind of like she's being led by this therapist, which I know can happen sometimes depending on the therapist you go to. In any case, I wish her the best. She I think is not in the best place right now, but I hope she gets to a better one soon. Why I'm interested in the story is not really to condemn Tricia Paytas, but it's just I'm not sure what differentiates her experience as a trans man, which apparently is clickbait and disrespectful to trans community to all that versus the experience of someone like Sam Smith, who came out as non binary, and everyone like loved and he was a brave trans hero for the community. Like, what what is the difference between these two situations? Because it just seems like to me, looking at them, they both look like just regular people. Yeah. So what makes one super brave and inspiring versus the other one clickbait trash doing it for money? I don't know. Frankly, I think it's fair to say that a lot of these trans activists may not be able to articulate why exactly they have a problem with this either without kind of walking back on things that things they've said before. Right. I would like to hope they would give them pause and maybe a little bit of you know, they have a little bit of introspection, a little bit of time for reflection, but I suspect that probably not. Yeah. I don't know. In any case, best of luck to you, Mr. Trisha Paytas. Our next story is about Sweden. So elections are coming up this month in Canada and next year in the US and I think like everywhere in the western world, really immigration is a really hot topic and not just immigration in general, but there's a real pushback, I think, to this uncontrolled mass migration, large scale refugee acceptance that we've seen for the maybe past five or soish years especially. So I don't have a problem with immigration as a concept. My dad is an immigrant. I've been an immigrant myself. I mean, immigrants can be huge boons to the culture and economy of a nation under the right circumstances. However, if you watch this show, you'll know that the way I feel about mass migration and like large scale refugee reallocation specifically is very different. Not a fan of importing the rest of the world into western cultures because of overwhelming light guilt, which I think is what's driving a lot of this. Yeah, absolutely. And I think the issue with the conversation around mass migration in North America, though, is that up until recently, because the last few years have been very migrant heavy, especially in Canada, then historically has been the case. But before that, we didn't really have much of an immigration issue like Europe has had for longer. So when people have spoken out about things like mass migration here and in the US, they're often called things like fear mongers, they're accused of lying to smear refugees, all of this kind of stuff. But the thing with mass migration is that we can actually look to Europe as an example of what happens when you let people into your country kind of indiscriminately. Yeah. And I mean, a few years ahead of us. There are a few years ahead of us. And I mean, I sort of feel bad about looking at their situation, their countries now. But I think best case scenario for us, we can use these countries as examples of what could happen depending on how we handle the immigration issue. One of the countries that's been the most, let's say, generous with taking in migrants is, of course, Sweden. And there have been a couple of reports that have come out recently that I think are relevant to discuss in light of our ongoing conversations over here in North America about whether we want to follow in Sweden's footsteps. So we begin here, Sweden, around 90% of 2015 migrants with residency status are unemployed. One of the things we always hear in the debate around immigration is like, but they're so good for the economy. This is amazing for the economy. Immigrants can be great for the economy. If we could take in like 1000 Elon Musk's per year, great. Let's do it. The thing is different people have different capabilities. And when you don't filter them at all, I don't see why you'd expect just like the best and brightest to come in when you're showing no preference for them at all. Because there are immigration systems that can favor things like high school migrants. But those are generally called racist now. And especially when we're in the business of phasing out low school labor. So it's like, there's no reason to not be important to Elon Musk's. But you don't want to import maybe people to compete with your native population that are competing for a smaller and smaller amount of jobs. That's right. Low school labor. Yeah. With automation, the truth is the minimum wage jobs, the low skill jobs, they are becoming fewer and far between. We see that. You know, Kia set McDonald's self check out at Walmart. This is a thing. Those jobs are already shrinking in number. Why would we want to import more people to compete for that small pool of jobs and and hurt the most vulnerable people in our economy? I don't really understand it. But Breitbart writes that of the 40,000 migrants with permanent residency residency status who are eligible to work, only 4,574 of them support themselves independently through working, according to Statistics Sweden's integration database for health insurance and labor market studies. A further 9,970 migrants received money to study in Sweden. I don't know why you'd pay foreigners to study in your country. Actually, something that I like about Canada is that when international students come to study at our universities, we actually charge them way more. Yeah. Well, absolutely. Well, I mean, actually, I don't know if that's at least at one of our universities. No, that is true. I mean, what is weird about Canada is that people from outside the province of that school pay more than international students. Yeah, that's also weird. But yeah, it makes sense. That's it. With international students being charged more. Because I mean, in reality, like the way it actually is working is the people that, let's say you're going to school in Quebec, you've already paid for a lot of the school via taxes, right? So it's like extremely painfully high taxes. Yeah, I will. But yeah, they continue another 18,405 are on municipal welfare programs, eight of the 10 municipalities, which took in the most migrants per population in 2015, also have unemployment rates far above the national average. Afton Bladet reports the figures come only days after the European Union Statistics, European Union Statistics Agency Eurostat revealed that Sweden was now 24th out of 28 member states in terms of unemployment. Figures released last year showed a stark contrast between the native Swedish unemployment rate and the foreign born unemployment rate. As a result, many municipalities, which took in a high number of asylum seekers in 2015, have recently announced major financial troubles, some on the verge of bankruptcy. So again, this is not to say that migrants will cost you money. It is to say that some might, and it's kind of up to you as a country, to be able to decide and distinguish who will be a gift to the economy versus a burden on the economy. And you know what, there's a reason to take in some burden for the economy if they're a legitimate refugee. Yeah, that's not the same as a migrant, right? There's a very big distinction there. Right, because I think in Sweden, a lot of Europe, what we've seen and Lauren Southern did a report on this, that a lot of the people who are fleeing coming in, they're not what you would think of as a classic refugee, someone who's fleeing a war torn area is being persecuted for their religious belief or whatever of that and is like imminent threat of danger. Yeah, you know, a lot of these people coming in, they're actually just, you know, your average citizen from maybe a developing country. Yeah, a young male out, you know, for Japan, right? You're wanting economic benefits that they wouldn't be able to have in their own country. And I understand that. I totally understand that. I would do that for my like, every we're all out to improve our lives the most we can, except for people in Sweden for some reason, who are like altruistic to the point of economic suicide, it sounds. Yeah, and I think it's a moral because you are hurting your neighbors that don't consent to that kind of thing. And your children who will now not be able to grow up in an environment with the same economy or safety standards that you grew up in. Yeah, and even more, these people that are coming here are told that they're going to get a job and be able to live this affluent lifestyle. And they come here and they find that they're living, you know, it's not that comfortable of a life. It gets cold in Sweden as well. And it's like a lot of them are put into slums and ghettos. Right. And I just remember actually in Lawrence, Southern's documentary on a bit of a side note, but I remember there was an African gentleman of some sort who had migrated to France. And you know, he found himself living under a bridge, essentially, they're saying, I wish I hadn't come here. What they told me wasn't true. And it was very sad because for some reason you couldn't leave the country at that point. But well, I think like a lot of them, maybe they come over without papers and are told, Oh, you don't need papers. Yeah. You kind of do like it's easy to get into Europe. It's not that easy. And then they find out they can't work when they're there. So it's like this is not, they may be doing this sorry with the hope of helping people. But they're not really, this is not how you help people. This has never been the way that you bring mass numbers of people out of poverty. It's just not another gem from Sweden. Apparently bombings and explosions are also up in 2019 45%. Breitbart rights statistics revealed by the police show that Sweden saw a total of 83 explosive incidents during the period from January to July, a number that has increased to 120 this year, Swedish newspaper Dagens Nihiter reports. And by the way, I know that Breitbart leans right. I'm not unaware of their bias. Obviously they admitted themselves. I encourage you guys if you're skeptical about this, if you want to kind of examine these numbers more, go to the the sources that they're citing, explore it for yourself. Because I know I've tried to have this conversation with many people and they'll dismiss the new source at first, but it's like, okay, but what about the actual reports they're citing? I think it's harder to claim those are just right wing propaganda. They continue criminologists Sven Granath commented on the explosions saying, yes, unfortunately, it has increased. Why we do not know this may be due to the increase in gun violence at the national level. Again, who can say why that is in individual locations? There may be one or more conflicts between criminal networks, but it is very difficult to know. Peter's Dracula, head of investigations at the South Police Department working against serious organized crime told Dagens Nihiter that the explosions are likely linked to organized crime and could be increasing due to stricter firearms legislation. The southern multicultural city of Malmo, I believe I've heard of Malmo before and maybe in reference to certain no go zones, not sure, has seen a particularly high number of explosion cases in the last several years with 58 cases in 2017, 45 last year and 23 so far in 2019. Earlier this year, the city saw three explosions in the span of just 24 hours. Okay, you know what, Europeans for a long time you've looked down on the US for the gun crime issue and I'm not saying that it's not something that needs to be looked at, but at least Detroit doesn't have grenade attacks. Like this is unbelievable. I don't know why this isn't getting more attention like worldwide. Why more people? I mean, like, well, you do know why. Yeah, I do know why it's not getting attention because I don't like why it's hate facts, right? Exactly. So yeah, unemployment up bombings up and oh, look at that gunshot wounds also up. Sweden people treated for gunshot wounds up 20% in 2018. The statistics from the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare Patient Register shows that in 2018, a total of 148 people were treated with gunshot injuries 26 more than the previous year. According to the board, the statistics do not reflect those who had died as a result of gunshots and died at the scene of the shootings. Okay, so what they're saying here is that these are the number of people who have come into a hospital and been treated for gunshot wounds, but there could be more people who are actually shot. It just so happens that they died at the scene of the crime. So it continues later, the head of the trauma center at Carolinska University Hospital Lenart Adam, Adam, Adam, since sorry, added, we don't see everyone here because many died before they come here. There are more violent acts of aggression. We can get an alarm, but they never come because they already dead on the spot that has changed. Last year also saw a record number of fatal shootings in Sweden with Stockholm police expert Gunnar Applegren describing the situation in the country as being like a state at war. And I think whenever any of these like crime increases happen, it's important to try to understand why. So it's like, I don't think it would be effective to call for grenade control in Sweden, just like I don't think it's effective to call for knife control in London. You need to try to explore why crime is happening more so now than before. It's like in London, it's not that just they're more nice available. And in Sweden, I don't think that 20 years there would be the same number of grenade attacks if the grenades were just more readily available. I think a lot of these issues do kind of stem from the migration issue. It's uncomfortable to talk about, but I'm guessing it's also uncomfortable to try to treat explosion and gunshot wound victims. It's awful. And finally, we wouldn't be able to complete a discussion of the situation in Sweden without mentioning rape. Apparently, there's been a 14% rise in rape reports since last year in Sweden. They write the Swedish capital saw a 14% increase in the number of reported rapes from January to June of 2019 compared to the same period last year. In the first six months of 2018, 930 rape cases were reported, a number that has increased to 1060 during the same period in the following year, with there now being an average of five rape cases reported in the city per day. So five per day just in Stockholm. And they later write that in June, the Swedish government announced they would be tackling steps to hire hundreds of additional police to help tackle serious sex offenses against women and children and other people deemed to be particularly vulnerable. The increase comes after figures revealed a 13% increase in the number of sex offenses involving children as victims in 2018 nationwide. The report released in January showed that overall rape attacks in Sweden had increased by 33% in a decade. And now when it comes to sexual assault in Sweden, I know people like to say, Oh, there's actually a change in the way that rape was defined in Sweden. It was kind of expanded to involve a lot more things, which is why it looks like the number has increased. Even if you look at the period just after that change in the definition happened, rape is still increasing, right? At an alarming rate. And it's again, it's not just women that are being targeted, it's children. I'm not going to say that Sweden is a hellhole because I'm sure there are certain places, plenty of places in Sweden that are completely fine. But I think it is fair to say that among particularly particular neighborhoods, it does kind of seem like it's becoming a little bit of a hellhole. And again, I'm not against immigration, but the thing is people may assimilate, but groups generally don't. And when you let entire groups in indiscriminately scores at a time and you allow them to ghetto wise, I don't see why you'd expect them to act any differently in your country from how they acted in their country. And I hate how this conversation has devolved into, oh, you want border controls, you're racist, you're a Nazi. I just think the people who advocate for these policies are naive. Like, I think their well-meaning, progressive, probably wealthier liberals who have bought into the narrative that the only thing wrong with developing countries is that they've been exploited by the West. And I don't think they understand that these countries have real problems of their own to work through and exporting all their populations into our countries doesn't fix any of that. I mean, you just have to ask why in most places in the world, all these stats are going in the opposite direction, right? We're seeing a slow but steady decline in the sense of violence. Which is amazing. You know, even sexual violence, even with some of the redefinitions that we're doing, even here in Canada, you know, we're all doing it now. But we're seeing a decline in all these numbers for the most part. But in instances like this, where you have the situation in Sweden, multicultural, we're seeing populations, yeah, it's going the opposite way. We need to be able to talk about why and whenever I try to bring up things like this, whenever people criticize mass migration, people will bring up sob stories of like these persecuted, extremely talented migrants who are probably disabled because we'll throw that into and it's like, no one is saying no immigrants at all. Okay, well, like five people on the internet are saying no immigrants at all. But if you look at people like Trump or even Max Imbernier, who again is like our the only party you could actually call conservative by American standards in Canada, like they're not against refugee programs. They actually want to be able to better vet refugees to make sure that the people who are in the most need who are being persecuted, like religious minorities that they get taken in because the system won't be full of all these other false claims of people who are really just economic migrants who want to come to the US or Canada, which again, I understand, but we don't have room for everybody to come. So yeah, I just wanted to be able to touch upon that. Obviously, this is an issue we've talked about before. We'll likely be talking about it again. It's just with all these reports coming out. I thought it would be a good time to do that. And again, I urge you to try to look at the firsthand sources yourself if you're skeptical about any of this. Okay, our final segment is a story that should be a non-story but has somehow evolved into a controversy. But at the same time, I think it is kind of a kind of uplifting, right? It's a nice one in a lot of ways. This is an uplifting story that I didn't bring on the show for once. It was Lauren of her own volition. So Ellen DeGeneres was who, by the way, is a like a daytime talk show host comedian. One of the biggest, in fact, she's huge, right? I mean, everybody knows who she is. Frankly, I'm surprised if you don't know, and this is the first year you're hearing of her. So she was recently spotted attending some sort of sports game. I don't know. It was a Dallas Cowboys game. Again, I don't know which sport that is. But anyway, she was attending us. She was seen attending a sports game with George W. Bush. People are going to be outraged at that. People are going to. That's like the biggest football team in America's football team. No, this makes sense. It just Texas. I don't know. Sports ball. Okay. So she was seen with W. Bush at the game and she actually felt it necessary because of, I guess, backlash she was receiving online. Don't look at me like that just because I don't want the. I don't even watch football at all. Cowboys. Yeah. Come on. Whatever. Okay. So she did a segment on her show essentially defending her French choices. And we have some clips of that here. I'm friends with George Bush. In fact, I'm friends with a lot of people who don't share the same beliefs that I have. We're all different. And I think that we've forgotten that that's okay that we're all different. For instance, I wish people wouldn't wear fur. I don't like it, but I'm friends with people who wear fur. And I have. But just because I don't agree with someone on everything doesn't mean that I'm not going to be friends with them. When I say be kind to one another, I don't mean only the people that think the same way that you do. I mean be kind to everyone. How is being friends with a Republican, even Bush worthy of a segment? Now, I don't. I don't understand. It's not. But the response is to this definitely made it a segment. Exactly. And so I mean, a lot of people really supported this. This got a lot of likes, a lot of people of all political persuasions were saying, yes, thank you, Ellen, for this positive message. However, you know, some people were also dismissing what she was saying saying, oh, no one's giving her a hard time for being friends with George Bush. She's just trying to get attention or like, there's no cancel culture. There's no outrage, mom. Literally, on the, I guess, the in response the tweet that she posted this video to people were outraged at her. So it's like, I'm sorry, if you if you think people weren't upset about this, you weren't paying close enough attention. Because unfortunately, we are living in a world that is cruel, that is vindictive, that does want to punish people who don't think the same way as you by trying to ostracize them. And I mean, I think this would have happened no matter which Republicans she was seen with. But because it was George W. Bush, there was a lot of people were bringing up the Iraq war. And the thing is, I have never been a Bush supporter. I don't support the war in Iraq. But a lot of the things that people were saying, I thought were ridiculous. So these are the tweets she received in response to her message of be kind to everyone, even when you disagree. Okay. So this guy with a lovely, if you're listening to this on, I to inspire Google play, his avatar is a turd that looks like Trump. So this just to prepare you for what's about to be said. Mark quoting her, she says, I'm kind to the guy who is responsible for the deaths of half a million Iraqi civilians, as long as you dance and make cute jokes, it's all okay. He also says, it doesn't matter that a boy is without his mom or dad because of the man's policies next to me, my PG 13 jokes and this ability I have to simply not care allows me to sleep at night in my mansion. Now let's dance. Okay, so this may be the like, middle studies major part of me. But if you think that Bush single handedly caused the war in Iraq, that's not what what happened at all. And again, like, I don't support Bush, I don't support the war in Iraq. But to say that he single handedly, not to mention the military industrial complex, not to mention a faulty intelligence reports. Yeah, that's what I understood was the main cause of a lot of it. Exactly. Not to mention Saddam. I'm not saying that it was right, the invasion, but I mean, you know, he refused to let an IE aid specters and like, this wasn't just due to George Bush as a single person. And find me a president that hasn't passed some legislation that has negatively affected family, right? Right? You know, it happens like a drone bomber. Yeah, never mind that. Of course drones are even if you're someone that like Clinton with Somalia, just like, yeah, every single president and not just American president, every single world leader out there. Well, of course, if you dial back welfare, even you know, stuff like that, you like people will suffer in some ways if you do anything virtually, it's like there is absolutely and it's just a reality. And the thing is like, this kind of talk, I think it's like, it's been escalated because it's Bush, but the whole rhetoric of this person has literally killed person, it applies to literally anyone who doesn't agree with you now, because I mean, I've been accused of having blood on my hands because I want to dial back the welfare state. And so, you know, that means people are going to starve and they'll die whatever I have blood on my hands because I want border control. That means that people aren't allowed to flee terrible situations and come here. So they die and it's like, and by converse, you've got blood in your hands. If you want a bigger welfare state, because then you're taxing people into poverty, and then they end up in, yeah, everybody's killing everybody. Yeah, essentially. And it's like, if if you are able to boil down the politics of, I guess, your opposition into they've killed people, they want to kill people, you're doing it wrong. You don't understand. Again, that doesn't mean the other person is right, but to essentially equate them with a murderer. It's just not a good way to be. And we have other people, this person says in regard to Ellen, look, I'm too rich for her decision. Sorry. Look, I'm too rich for his decisions to really affect me is what this boils down to. Someone else says loud and clear. I mean, are she talking about the economy? Like, I'm not even sure what just bush kills people. She's just a mean to people. Yeah, so it doesn't affect her. Now, the person says, the whole story is how badly you've sold out your LGBTQ plus brethren to hold onto wealth and power. Someone else says proof that classism comes first if you're in the right class. So apparently he's awful because he's anti gay war. Is it like, you know, all of the things? And nowhere in what Ellen said on her segment says that I agreed with any of this with anything he's done, you know, having sitting next to him at a game is not the same thing as going out and voting for him. And even if you are someone who voted for George Bush, I would be very, very hesitant to say that you've, I don't know, like you've literally killed people. It's just like we've become caricatures in each other's minds of just the worst form of our own political parties that you could possibly, possibly imagine. And I mean, I will say that, you know, I think this is most prominent on the left, you know, the way that people have kind of pounced on Ellen, although I will say maybe some people just hate Bush, it's not that they're leftist, but right wing, right wingers can do it too. We can, I think it's less organized and weaponized than it is among the left. But it's not like it doesn't exist at all. For example, I mean, no one was getting mad at Bush for hanging out with Ellen. So that is fair to say kudos for the right for not being mad at Bush for hanging out with Ellen. I don't know how you could get mad at anyone for hanging out with Ellen though, she seems nice. But Kathy Jew, who was the model that had her Miss Michigan titled strip from her for being a Trump supporter, essentially, she recently went to a free speech conference that featured several different panels and various speakers. And she was pictured with an alt right commentator who was also a speaker there. And so the person in question, I'm not familiar with all of his views. And so, you know, I'm not the one characterizing him as alt right. That's what other people are saying about him. I apologize if that's a mischaracterization, but they weren't even on the same panel, but they were at a speakers, it looked like a welcome dinner or something like that. And all the speakers took a picture together. And some people freaked out at her. They freaked out at her. It seems like she was getting more hate than the guy who was apparently so awful that people can't even take pictures with him. It was the strangest thing. Like, how does that even make sense? Like, are you going to catch the other person's views if you're in proximity to them for too long? If you think that you clearly don't have enough people in your life who have opposing views to you. I just don't understand what the thought process is there. Like, should there just be so award to these people? Should we just murder them? Like, should Ellen have what should she have done? Yeah, like, I don't know, like, if it's not acceptable to be in the same picture with other people, if we can't even attend a baseball game, football game with them, like, what, what is the appropriate amount of disgust and disdain that we should have for them? Because I think some people think that your hostility or opposition to certain ideas is best represented by how aggressive you are to the people who hold those ideas. So like, if I want to show that I'm really against, I don't know, let's say Hillary Clinton for president, I just have to go punch a Clinton supporter in the face. And then that will communicate how much I hate Hillary Clinton. Yes. Your virtue has been signaled. Exactly. By, you know, trying to shun, ostracize and hurt the people who actually like her. Darryl Davis, he's a man who through friendship turned literally hundreds of former KKK members away from racism, right? I think he's got like 200 or so of them where they've turned in their hoods to him and denounced racism and white supremacy. There are people out there, I'm sure, and we know this for a fact because Antifa did protest him in New Jersey at an event we went to. Unbelievable. Who will accuse him of enabling white supremacy because he befriends these people, which doesn't make any sense. But and some might say, oh, but it's different because he's trying to discourage them from racism. Whereas like, you know, you could just be friends with someone and not even try to change their racist ways. It's like, you don't know that. You don't know what someone's conversations with another person are in their friendship, what they talk about, how they settle their disagreements. You don't know that. No, at all. And I mean, if Darryl Davis didn't succeed fast enough, like with one guy, with one clan member, like with the appropriate thing have been for him to stop being friends with the guy, like what what is the appropriate amount of friendship time to invest with someone before you unfriend them because they're clearly not going to change their ways and start agreeing with you. Like, how long should he be waiting after establishing friendship with these people? And if someone doesn't change their views entirely, is it not possible for the other person to at least be like, I don't know, a balancing presence in their life to at least give them another perspective from time to time, even if they still don't agree with each other? Yeah, that's the thing. I don't agree with a lot of them. I've got friends on the right and the left, right? And you just someone talking to their ideas are quite wacky. And but that doesn't change me from being their friends. And hopefully, you know, having interesting conversations that I don't know, I would like to think convince them or you know, maybe they convinced me of some of my dumber ideas. Yeah, right. It's exactly like the thing with having friends have different political opinions about each other. Maybe you don't come around to each other's views. But at the very least, I would hope that it lessens the demonization they have in their heads about the opposition. Exactly. Right. So maybe my left wing friends don't turn me left wing, but they do let me see that left wing people are people who can be nice and kind and that like they're not all bad. So I shouldn't demonize all of them and assume they all have bad intentions. That I think is just as important. And the thing that I think is that kindness and forgiveness, they're supposed to be radical qualities. If you look at other civilizations, there aren't many civilizations who are cultures who emphasize the benefits or the virtue of being kind to your enemies, praying for your enemies or forgiving people who've wronged you. That's something that is pretty unique to Christianity and the West. And an example of that that I wanted to bring up is that Brant Jean, he is the brother of the man who was shot in his own apartment by the cop who mistakenly entered and thought it was where she lived. She was recently sentenced to some jail time. I think 10 years. Yeah. Very, very sad story. Um, a video of him, I think he was testifying actually went viral because in his testimony, he displayed a radical act of kindness and forgiveness. He actually forgave the person who accidentally murdered his brother mistakenly shot his brother dead. And we have a clip of this. A lot of people have probably seen it by now, but I think it's worth watching again in the context of this story. It was a simple gesture of compassion that moved the world. Can I give her a hug please? Yes. 18 year old Brant Jean embracing the woman found guilty of murdering his older brother, both of them. That was just my gesture of letting her know that I truly forgive her. After eight days of testimony, the jury found her guilty of murder in less than five hours. The prosecution asked for 28 years behind bars, but the jurors sent in Skyger to just 10. They were asking us to take an eye for an eye for both of them. And I feel like he, he isn't someone who would take an eye for an eye. He would turn the other cheek. I know a lot of people are not happy about the 10 years, but I feel like you can't compare this case to any of those other officers killing unarmed black men. Those officers that killed unarmed black men, when they got out, they went back to living their lives. Amber Geiger, ever since she killed that man, she has not been the same. Clearly a man of enormous moral conviction there. I don't know if I would have the strength to do what he did. He ended up actually hugging her. And I mean, there were people online after that happened that were actually mad at him for forgiving her. But the thing is, you know, holding on for these feelings of holding on to these feelings of resentment, that doesn't really do anything to the other person. I think hatred like that and bitterness like that really weighs on you as a person. So I think as a society, we need to stop thinking it's acceptable to treat people poorly or with a lack of kindness or respect because we disagree with them. That doesn't mean we have to enable everything they want to do. You know, I'm not saying Ellen needs to go out campaigning for Bush and his wars and all that. No, absolutely not. I don't think that this gentleman who whose brother died likes what she did, but it's just we need to be kind to make such an amazing act to forgive. Exactly. So I want to give some of our viewers a voice here because I'm sure that some of them feel like it's it's more pragmatic or like they have a more pragmatic sense of what's going on to some degree where they're saying, yeah, you're right. It's it's it's good to forgive people, but but it's good to try to be friends with the left and not demonize them like George Bush with Ellen to generous. We don't see too much backlash on his end. But it is going in the other direction. It's all the left on us. Shouldn't we fire with fire? Shouldn't we just say demonize them all? And you know, are we just going to lose if we don't do that? I mean, well, I hope there are no Christians asking me that because I think if if you are a Christian who's saying that kind of thing, you'd know what Jesus would say. It would not be positive. But I think even just in the more pragmatic sense, which a lot of people might be thinking of, the way that these people are acting toward Ellen for being friends with someone, they are alienating so many people who might consider them leftist or liberals otherwise, right? We see that with people like Tim Poole and Sargon who like, you know, other in another world might be, you know, hardcore on the left, but because of the violence and vitriol we see from some of these people, they're being pushed away. They're starting to reconsider. Okay, maybe I have some some things that I need to mull over because if you are someone who I don't know, is maybe really on the boat of progressivism and like, yeah, Bush is evil. I hate him, but you have Republican family members yourself who supported him seeing that you can't even be friends with maybe it's not right to be friends with your family members that must give you some pause and make you reconsider. If for optics, if nothing else, right, if nothing else, but for optics and the way it's going to look to other people, we can't start acting as poorly as these other people are acting and that actually, I mean, it's exactly like the the Antifa video of those people yelling at the old woman, do you think that looked good for Antifa? Do you think that endeared people toward Antifa at all? I don't think so. But in any case, I think that's all the time we have for today. Again, if you're watching live, be sure to stay on this stream. We're going to be back in just a few seconds with some exclusive Q&A, but for everyone else, we will see you next week. Bye."
