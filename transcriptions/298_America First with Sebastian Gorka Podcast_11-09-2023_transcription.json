Own a piece of history. Welcome dear friends to our hour long celebration every week of what it means to be a man masculinity and our dissection of the assault on the pillar of western civilization which is dangerous men who protect the vulnerable and the innocent. And a very special guest today because you know him. He's a very close personal friend. He is a co-host of our celebration of those values as seen through the lens of Hollywood every week in our making movies great again. He's the host of two superlative channels on YouTube. They are of course the Mr. Reagan channel and the Alfred critic. You should be subscribed to both of those superb channels. He is the one, the only Chris Coles. Hello, sir. Thank you for having me on. Finally this amazing show. Well I have to say you know they say familiarity breeds contempt. I think that's a little harsh. I think familiarity and friendship is it's easy to take people for granted. And I always feel bad because every week you come on you know from wherever you are in the world right now you're in Oregon not Oregon. I was told not to say that. From the depths the woods of Oregon and you know for the amount of money we pay you which is exactly nothing. You have dedicated so much time to us and your analysis has been even when we're talking about movies which is fun. I love it. We get to celebrate good movies unless you pick one of them like Uncle Buck. And as we celebrate those good movies you always have this philosophical inject about things that are in the movie that I don't get to dissect because you know I'm just a movie buffered a very superficial give me another you know bag of popcorn. I just love these movies. It's nostalgia. It's really my childhood. And then you'll come in about yeah and the message of this movie is fatherhood or don't you understand that this is about strong men protecting the innocent. So what a perfect perfect guess for the manhood hours. So Chris are you ready to face the challenge of standing up for everything that is hairy and masculine? Absolutely. I absolutely is very flattering your description of me. I will say it is indeed a terrible sacrifice every time I go on any Sebastian Gorzko show. But no, no, we have a lot of fun. You know it's great. You know there's sometimes you do an interview and it is a little bit painful. But you know you got to do it. That's our job. But this is always a pleasure always a pleasure to come on your show. And not only that we've roped him into whenever I have to guest host for Newsmax. I have my Newsmax show. But when I guest host for Rob Schmidt they have this mandatory segment. I hate these mandatory segments. It's like you's from the left and let's comment on funny clips about the idiots from the Democrat party and you. You are my go-to guest because you just make it. I actually end up laughing through most of those segments. It's just too much fun. All right. Let's begin with, and you have this unusual perch. So let's say nobody's seen any of our making movies great again or any of your segments with me on Newsmax. Just because this is a standalone hour. Tell a little bit about Chris Coles' story. So you're very successful YouTuber now. You're a body of ours here on America First. What is your life story today? Where did you grow up and what did you end up doing prior to Mr. Reagan and the Alpha Critic? Well, I originally came to Earth from a planet called Krypton and I was raised by these two farm folks. No, no, no, no. Look, I have pretty normal life. I grew up in the suburbs and life was pretty. I was in the Boy Scouts and doing all the normal stuff you would do in Oregon, going camping in the summers, chopping wood, all the kind of normal stuff. I think that all boys should do and fights behind the school at the bike rack and all that kind of stuff. The normal stuff a boy would normally do in the 1980s. I grew up in the 1980s. And that was back before computers were ubiquitous in every home. And I think it was sort of me and maybe one generation below me. We're kind of the last generation to grow up without smartphones and computers and stuff and kind of know what real life is like. I do worry about kids today and how they're growing up. But yeah, growing up in Oregon was good. If you ever seen the goonies that was kind of my childhood, riding bikes, looking for pirate treasure, that kind of thing. And yeah, and then I decided one day I was watching and this is for anybody who wants to start a podcast or a YouTube channel, this is how you be successful. I think I was watching Ben Shapiro. I was watching Stephen Cratter these guys. And it was one Saturday and back then there wasn't this many five years ago, there wasn't a ton of conservatives on YouTube. And I thought, oh, I've gone through the few shows that I like to watch. There's not enough conservative commentary. Some other idiots got to get a camera and a mic and do a show like this. And I thought, wait a minute, I've got a camera. I've got a mic. I'm the idiot. So I grabbed the camera, the mic. I did the show. And I kind of knew immediately as soon as I thought, okay, I'm going to present some ideas from just an ordinary American perspective. American guy grew up in the suburbs. I'm going to come up with this just typical American perspective that's just common sense. And I knew immediately when I came up with the idea, it would be successful. Not just because I thought my ideas had value, but I think it was because I knew that there was a big demand for this kind of content and just not enough supply. And that's how you, that's how anyone could become successful. You see something that there's a demand for and then you just fill the supply and then you can make some money. And what has that ride been like? Because I don't even remember, did I find you originally on YouTube and then did I reach out to you and DM you or something? And what was the genesis of our connection? Yeah, you must have wanted to interview me because I did this big video called The Brains Behind AOC and I kind of... Yes, you went viral. You went up, you exploded with this video about how AOC, the bartender, became a member of Congress. You haven't seen this. I think is it a two part Chris? There's two of them, right? There is a second part. I had to correct something because I gave Jank Jugger too much credit for having created all of this. The Justice Democrats who control AOC is actually run by a guy named Zach Exley, which I explained in the second video. But yeah, the first video was really the breakthrough video explaining that AOC is really just a puppet for this essentially communist group called Justice Democrats. And she was actually, they had auditions, didn't they? They wanted to put somebody in Congress and you actually broke down how they had... These communists, these social Democrats had auditions for who should be the puppet member of Congress and she didn't even apply her, brother applied on her behalf and she became the puppet who passed the audition, right Chris? Oh yeah. I mean, this is how they themselves explain it, right? And they present... And the reason they made this video talking about this and AOC is in this video talking about it is that they wanted to recruit new people to come in and they wanted to primary establishment Democrats and bring in these new, more radical left Democrats. AOC was one of them that they were successful with and they thought, oh, with AOC success on the back of that, we can bring in new people. So they're trying to get more people to come in and audition. That's why they made this video. And at one point, they say something like, I can't remember exactly, I'm paraphrasing, you know, something like, you know, you don't even, you know, kind of suggesting it what anyone can do it. Like, they're like, basically like, you don't even really do anything. You just listen to Austin, we tell you what to do. And she's like, exactly. And I remember watching that thinking, wow, you're kind of admitting to just letting other people dictate what your positions are in Congress and what your votes are going to be. And to me, that's like the antithesis of what you want in a representative from your region. You want somebody, you want to vote for whoever it is that you believe, you know, you voted for it. You don't want some kind of shadowy group to be controlling, you know, this person that you've you voted for and you thought was representing you. And how's it been since that went viral, then you do that incredible parody of the woke Gillette ad that I think is one of your most incredible works to date. And then you got really superb analyses on politics, the one you did on the recent election fraud is just incredible. What's the last few years been like as Mr. Reagan, Chris? I'll tell you, it's actually pretty stressful to have a YouTube channel these days that promotes conservative ideas. First of all, it's a very sedentary job. And as a man, as a man, I do think that we like to work with our hands, we like to be active. And you know, you can get fat doing this job. You know, it's very sedentary work. You're watching the news, you're writing down scripts, you're sitting in front of a camera that you're editing for hours on end. It's very stressful. And you put a lot of work into it, a lot of hours. And then YouTube decides, YouTube decided fairly early on, I think pretty much right when I produced that AOC video, oh, this is somebody that we don't like his messaging, right? YouTube and Google decided we're going to stop Donald Trump ever being elected again. They actually made statements to that effect. And it's like, all right, so how are they going to do that? Well, they're going to suppress a lot of the content on their platform. So Google owns YouTube, right? And so YouTube has been for years suppressing my videos, which is incredibly frustrating. You got removed from YouTube, which is unbelievable. I mean, a lot of these folks on YouTube, this is like our sole income. These are small businesses. I think this is a tragedy that in America, you start a small business using a particular platform and the platform can just delete your business like that. Yeah. Yeah. It's not even a cartel. It's a monopoly. But man, do you bring it every time? Please subscribe to both of his channels. I watch all of his videos. You will not regret it.

Did you hide a certain part of your body under a baggy sweatshirt, under a beach blouse or whatever it was? Because it is carrying a bit too much weight. If that's your story, have I got news for you? For 20 years I tried to lose weight. I kind of do it for about a month or two. It will all come back. Then somebody came to me, Dr. Ashley Lucas. With my wife's convincing me, we decided to try her PhD weight loss program and I lost 42 pounds. Look at that pair of pants. That actually was made for me. The next one is a vest. A vest that was tailor made for me. Like for some massive 400 pound warrus. With this program I lost 42 pounds. More importantly my wife lost 36 and she's ecstatic. If I can do that with my sweet tooth, anyone can. Find out today. Just make yourself a happier person. Be the healthiest you can be. The before and after picture of me is truly shocking. That could be you. 864-644-1900-myphdweightloss.com. Be a manly man who's fit as well. 864-644-1900-myphdweightloss.com. Okay, Chris, let the games begin. Are you ready to be entertained? Well, no. Let's do it. You need to entertain us. First question for all of our guests on the manhood hour. How serious is the assault on classic masculinity in the West today and in America? It's horrific. It's horrific. They are amplifying masculinity but only in women. It's a little bit weird, right? It's a little bit weird. They're trying to turn women into men, right? They're trying to turn women into men and let me just say this. What is masculinity? It's a big question these days, right? Because if you think about it, a lot of the jobs that used to be done, a lot of the hobbies that used to be done by men in say like the 1940s, the majority of men would work with their hands as I was mentioning before. Majority of men would do physical work. Even if you owned a corporation, you would go out and you would work on the floor a little bit. You'd maybe carry something, so throw something in your truck. A lot of the jobs like that have just disappeared because of technology. It's not necessarily a cultural thing, although that's part of it, of course. But technological improvements have made it so that a lot of men have very sedentary jobs like myself. I'm a YouTuber. I have a very effeminate job, really. It's a weak man's job. It's not a strong man's job. So what were you doing in the last few days in Oregon with your family? Well, you know, we have a farm out here, so I did have to, you know, are well broke, so I had to go and dig a trench about 10 feet by 4 feet trench with a shovel with my father. That was not so much fun with the clay that we got out here. And then we did, what else? Oh, yeah. We built one of the fences needed to be repaired, so we built this whole fence for the cows. And yeah, you know, and that stuff is actually great fun if you haven't done it in a while. Like you haven't actually got out and done any physical labor because you're writing scripts and making YouTube videos. It's kind of a bit of fun. It's good. It's gratifying. And, you know, even if you're a guy that works in the city, you work at a desk, there is this compulsion to go to the gym, lift heavy weights, do something physical. I think it's in the nature of men. And so, but I do think that you kind of have to redefine what is masculinity because certainly it absolutely is, you know, riding horses, riding a motorcycle, you know, lifting weights, you know, doing the masculine stuff, you know, fixing your car or, you know, being able to fight, get into a fight or going to war. All these things are indeed very masculine, but in a world devoid of the necessity for those things oftentimes, how do you define masculine? And I was thinking about it the other day and I, it occurred to me that like, there are challenges in life, there are challenges in life and there's two ways to face those challenges. You can look that challenge in the face and you can take it on or you can run away. And to me, it is quintessential masculinity to stand up to conflict, to stand up against conflict. That's not being combative. In combative, I think, is generated from lack of like in insecurity, being combative. So it's not being combative. It's just a willingness to stand up to challenges and not run away. To me, that is quintessential masculinity. And you needed to find it that way because of the society that we live in. But I wouldn't take away from those sort of traditionally masculine things. I do think that men should engage in some traditionally masculine things just to satisfy our nature. We have a nature that demands that we do that stuff and we do need to do that stuff from time to time, I think. I think I need a battle buddy. I love listening to you, you know, really unpack right now how you know you you feminized yourself, Chris, by sitting down and becoming a YouTuber. I think you and I, because I love, you know, I'm a lazy SOB as well, but sometimes I just love doing things like cutting wood. I mean, just, you know, cutting wood. I think every week, maybe we should do this now in front of three and a half million people. Maybe we should make a promise to each other. Every week we've got to tell each other the one really manly physical thing we did. What do you think? That's a great idea. You like bike riding. I'll be chopping wood. But you know, it's like the only thing I do of any regularity like that is with my White House buddy Boris Epstein, whenever we have a really good cigar, we send each other a photograph of the cigar we're smoking. I think this might be a little bit more important. Are you up for that? Absolutely. You know, hike a mountain, you know, swim in the ocean, fight a shark, you know, that kind of thing. Yeah, let me show you that. Yeah, yeah. Fight a megalodon. I love it. Let's go back to the assault on masculinity. We'll fix our own masculinity without text messages. You cover the culture so well with such a keen eye. This may be impossible to answer, but for you, is there a locus of the assault? Where is the assault being most generated from? Is it the schools, the teacher training colleges, the media, social media, the Democrat party, the remnants of the Frankfurt school? If you had to see, you know, who's the queen bee of this all? Where's it being generated most? Well, I do think at the core it comes from feminism, right? Feminism is a weird thing because it's not just about saying women are equal. They pretend that it's about that, but it's not. It's a lot of the hard, coretical feminists say that basically that women should be men and men should be women, right? They say men are too violent to therefore they need to, you know, calm down and become more docile like more like women, more feminine. And women are too weak. Feminists weirdly tend to believe that women are weak, that femininity is weak. And so they want to masculinize women. And this is, of course, terrible because what is the masculinization of women? It's precisely the toxic masculinity that they tell us is terrible and men. They say women should act tough. Women should be aggressive. Women should be violent. And it's like, well, that's exactly what you said men should not be. Men should be docile and weak. And here's the problem. Here's the problem with this. The really bad problem is because you can have more masculine women and it's not that bad for society. They're just a little bit less attractive. But if you feminize men, weak men make evil men. Okay. Strong men make good men. If you're strong, you're willing to stand up against any challenge. Think about it like that. Just imagine being in an office and there's a guy that annoys the hell out of you. And you know, you're a strong man. You go up to the guy and you say, this is my problem with you. This, this and this. And the guy says, ah, you know what? Look, it's just a misunderstanding. This is this problem. And you're right about that. I'm kind of a dick. I'll change that, whatever. And you can kind of maybe deal with it. Or maybe you just hate each other through the whole time. It doesn't matter. A weak man, you don't confront the guy because you're conflict of verse. So what do you do? You spread rumors about him. Yeah. You go to the boss and you try to get him fired. This is evil. Okay. Weak men run from battle. Strong men fight. And to me, it's a much easier path to being a good man by being a strong man. And for society to try to feminize men, you're weakening men across society. And you're just making society a more evil place to live. Yeah. Fabulously put, I think we have the title for this, uh, this episode, although I know we'll have much more superb to make note of weak men make evil men, whether it's the regular Hellcat or whether it's the compensated RDP with that miniature red dot.

All right, Chris, I love this question because we got all kinds of wacky answers from seals who said it was, you know, heroes of Tom Clancy novels to fellow radio hosts saying it was that football coach in high school. He's the one. Not everyone can have an amazing dad. For you, who most helped you understand what it means to be a true man? No, it absolutely was my father. I was very, very lucky. I'm currently, I'm not actually outside. This is a photograph I took of the outside of my parents' home. I'm actually in a big old factory out here in Salem, Oregon. My family produces plastic extrusions, which I'm not going to get into the details. But the point is they are the American dream, right? Your family, your dad, the factory. They're not just the American dream. They are the quintessential American dream. My dad started from nothing. He bought a couple of machines when he was laying carpet when he was in his 20s to be able to produce these plastic extrusions. We've now got post-tensioning cable in the Freedom Tower, which is phenomenal to me. That's part of the American fabric. Yeah, my father started this company. It's a pretty decent sized company now. I'm currently in that factory because my dad has bad Wi-Fi. We just got the Wi-Fi replaced in the house on the farm. But yeah, we've got really good Wi-Fi here. So that's why I'm shooting here. I'm streaming from here. Well, we appreciate it. You broke the image now. You've busted Hollywood forever. We thought you were on the balcony of your parents' farm in Oregon. But that's such a great story. Tell us what are the values, what are the characteristics that you internalize from your father. Give us some words for what he is or what he taught you. What is it to be a man for Chris Coles? You know what? When I talk about the conflict, not being conflict-averse, I don't think I've ever seen my dad throw a punch. But I've certainly seen him stand up to people who looked like they were going to throw a punch. I bet that's 6'2\". He's a pretty big dude. Everyone knows that Sebastian Goroka is willing to stand up to an annoying reporter from time to time. You may or may not be famous for that. But that's kind of how my dad is as well. My dad was always like, look, you've got to stand up to the bully. If you don't stand up to the bully, the bully is going to keep bullying you for the rest of the year or even for the rest of your life. So you can't be like George McFly at the beginning of Back to the Future. You've got to be like George McFly at the end of Back to the Future and knock the bully out. And that was always kind of how I lived my life. There was almost a pressure, even as a kid, even as like a 6-year-old, 7-year-old, if somebody was being a bad kid or wrong or bullying you or your friends, you had to stand up against them. And at that point, I stood up to a group of guys and there were some guys behind me and I was like, we're not going to take your crap, stand up to them and I looked behind me and all my friends were gone. And I was like, well, crap, this is just going to be me, I guess. But that's how my dad taught me. Don't back down from a fight, don't back down from a conflict. You've got to be a responsible man. And I learned how to build a business from my father. And I learned how to be, I think, a good father from my father as well. My brother's got kids, he's a great dad. And yeah, in my other brother, he doesn't have kids yet, but he's a really a good man, he's got a great business of his own. So yeah, we all turned out pretty damn good. And I think it's usually due when people end up good, like a whole family of kids end up pretty good, I think it's typically due to having a good father. Yeah. Yeah. And so much of what you say is about this concept of standing up to bullies. And I think that's, you can see that today in American politics. What is, translate Donald Trump versus the uni party or Donald Trump versus the deep state into playground English. And you're talking about standing up to bullies, whether it's BLM, whether it's the Democrats, whether it's rogue prosecutors, whether it's the FBI going after you because you're a pro life preacher, those institutions, those individuals, those entities are bullies. And that's why they did test this man. And that's why the mugshot exists of the 45th president of United States. And that's why that look on his face, I mean, put it out that we made a t-shirt out of this, that look is I am not taking your crap anymore as a bully. Look at that face. That's why they hate him. I think I have a theory. I mean, because he's a man, it's a man and he's standing up to bullies. If you support President Trump, you should wear that t-shirt with pride. You should get that mug.

Okay, I'm going to throw something back at you, dear friend, because it was so incredibly sagacious. You've done this many, many times in our multiple movie reviews. You talked about what it means to be a man. I like you to unpack what you said in that movie review. You said any other man in the world can be a potential threat, a real threat, not only to you, but to your loved ones, your girlfriend, your wife, your children. And you said something like, and I don't want to put words in your mouth. I'm going to tell you what I remember and then I want you to expand upon it because I've been discussing this with my wife since you said it. I mean, this is such deep, deep, atavistic truth. You said the ultimate test of a man or the ultimate definition of a man that a woman, a woman cannot do. You have to be the final line of defense because every other man could be a threat. God willing, they're not, but they could be a mugger, a killer, a rapist, whatever. And it is you, you that stand between that potential threat in your loved ones. That kind of hit me like a gut punch, the level of truth you said. Would you, would you just say more on that concept, please, Chris? Because I think it's essential to understanding what our job is. If we, if we have testicles, we have to understand what our job is. Yeah, look, I mean, what I was trying to say there is that being a man is, is tough, right? It's not as easy as people think. We never complain about it. We never talk about this. But being a man is a very lonely thing at its core, at its core. At its core, we are alone. Men are alone. Women are not. Women will have a husband, they'll have a family and we can rely on our wife. But at the end of the day, when it comes down to it, if there's the apocalypse and we got a fight for our family, we can't rely on anyone. It's us against the world. We have to defend the family. So I think at our core, we do view every other man as a threat. And it's very hard to make those very strong bonds between other men, really, because they are at the end of the day, potentially the enemy. Even friends can be the enemy. So you always look at the guy like, can I take that guy down? You know, if I can't take him down with a punch, what weapon would I need? You know, like every guy is a potential enemy at our core. So we're all kind of isolated from each other. And that's a bit tough. Yes, community is good. Yes, fellowship is good. Brotherhood is good. Church is good. But I do think there is that combative nature at our core that, you know, are willing this to engage in that potential conflict at the end of the day, and does create a little bit of a loneliness in men. But it is critical. And I think there's that true men are okay being alone. You know, if you really want to be a confident man, you have to be able to just be alone for a day with your own thoughts and be okay with that. And I think it's the men who are not okay with that for whatever reason. Maybe they've endured trauma, or maybe they're just a weak guy, and they don't like themselves. But whatever it is, you got to get over that and fix that if you want to be a truly masculine man in this world, I think. I want, you can be, you know, my age 52, you can be, you know, 16 year old guy listening to this. I want everybody who's listening to it to go away after the show and just think about what Chris just said. Because it no true word. You have to be okay with being lonely and not in the sense of being, you know, a loner. But you have to be comfortable with one concept, understanding that at the end of the day, you have nobody to rely upon. There's no excuse when danger comes, you, you are the answer to that danger. You cannot insist anybody else helps you. And that's what's happened to whole generations, this expectation that either I have to be safe or somebody else has a responsibility to keep me safe. You know, you are the person who's responsible for your safety and your loved ones safety. Tied to that, I love this idea of you have to be comfortable with being alone and the idea also, I think Jordan Peterson says, a man has to be dangerous. Not all the time, but he has to be willing to be dangerous when justified. I think that's what you're talking about. I want to ask Chris Coles, you know, be as honest as you want or avoid the question if you must. Why do you do what you do? Because I mean, there are people like you who have institutional support, you know, the Andrew Clavans or, you know, the, you know, the bench of heroes that have these multi-hundred million dollar institutions behind them to tell the truth or the Tucker Carlson who doesn't have to work another day in his life. Chris doesn't have, you know, a billion dollar industry behind him. He doesn't have a twenty million dollar a year contract with Fox who are paying him not to work. But God bless you, Chris. You are actually braver than all of them because you don't have that safety net. So I want to ask you right now as a friend, tell us how you have the courage to do what you do, Chris, and what makes you do it every day? Because some of the stuff you put out there on YouTube, nobody else has the balls to do that, Chris. So tell us why you do that. Yeah, no, I mean, being sort of an individual YouTube producer does, in fact, give me that freedom to some degree. I mean, obviously YouTube tries to suppress me, but I'll use code language, coded language and I'll try to get around the sensors a little bit. But look, when I was a kid, I was watching, I believe it was in Indiana Jones. We might have been Raiders. And I remember thinking, I want to be Indiana Jones. I want to be like him. I want to think like him. I want to do everything like him. And then I thought, wow, that's an incredibly powerful thing to have happened because I recognize that this wasn't real. I recognize that this was created by a writer. I love books or I was against stories. And I realized, well, writers have a lot of power. Writers can actually make a person want to be something they're not. You can make somebody think a way that they may not naturally think. You can convince people of philosophical ideas, religious ideas that they may not have believed before just by writing a character that believes those things and is compelling enough to make people want to be them. So when I was younger, actually, even from a young age, I thought, you know, Hollywood isn't a particularly good place. It's not filled with good people with good intentions. There are a lot of people are evil people. And I thought, I would love to have the same power as the Hollywood writer, but be a good person. That's actually what I was thinking when I was a kid. So I wanted for many years, I wanted to go to Hollywood, write scripts. I've written many scripts in my life. None of them have been produced. But I've always wanted to produce content that would change the world in a positive way. Like conversations like this that I'm having with you, but set in a movie context or TV show context or a video game, something like that. I was unable to be successful in that capacity. You know, Hollywood is a very leftist place. It's a very evil place. I don't really necessarily get along with all those kinds of people in Hollywood. I was a very bad at networking. One day I decided I'm going to try to do a YouTube channel about this kind of stuff, right? And instead of talking in stories, I'm going to speak directly about what I believe. And it touched a nerve and a lot of people agree with me and a lot of people liked the show. Well, you've impressed me greatly. I wanted to have you counted as a friend and to have you co-host our show every week here, where we celebrate those values through the good stuff that Hollywood made. So God bless you, Chris Coles.

Let's have a little bit of fun before we ask the last question to our guests here on the Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday, Monday. Last year, you came to the swamp. Well, I forced you to come to the swamp with your brother for the biggest concerted complication of the year. It is CPAC, of course. I think we all had a lot of fun, especially after the closing speech by my former boss, President Trump, where I said, damn the torpedoes and the secret service, we're going to go say hi to my former boss, and we're stuck behind the stage. We're going to be CPAC speakers board there, and you were hanging out with me and your brother. I think you turn up at the end of this video, and he stopped to say hello to me and then classic Trump style. He turned to you. He just met you and your brother, and he said, I love this guy, Gorka. He's great. I mean, he didn't have to do that. He didn't have to do that. I've got a theory I would have run by you. I think there's lots of political reasons, class reasons, envy reasons, whatever it is. I think a lot of the reasons they test this man so much they want to put him in prison is because he's so manly, and they're just such a bunch of beater, cuckold, soy drinking, latte, sad cases. What do you think of that theory, Chris? No, yeah. Donald Trump is exactly the kind of guy I was talking about. He doesn't necessarily chop wood or anything like that, but he is definitely a masculine, old-fashioned, masculine guy. And look, we've gotten to a place in society where we're so comfortable that we now have to create fake masculinity. There's fake masculinity now. Like this guy like Andrew Tate becomes, I was like, oh, I'm an old female. I'm an old male. He's obviously a nerd, a loser weak guy who decided I'm going to try to increase my value in society by learning to fight. And like fair enough, I respect that. The guy learned to fight. He became a good fighter. Good job for that. But then he goes out and he's like, I'm going to be a misogynist, a-hole. And that's going to show everybody how masculine and cool I am. Well, you're not actually masculine and cool. You're covering up for your insecurities. The guy's obviously one of the most insecure people I've ever seen in my life. He once said that it would be better to have sex with a transgender male that looks very effeminate than an ugly woman. Yeah. Okay, the guy's obviously messed up in the head, right? But he's the standard for a lot of guys of what masculinity is. And that makes me very sad because that is a weak person who's putting on the facade of masculinity as opposed to a guy who is genuinely truly a real man. I am so grateful. We never rehearsed any of this. We never do. And the fact that you said what you did about Andrew Tate, I could not agree with you more. He's a punk. He's an anti-man. He's a sad little weakling who actually likes to prostitute women and beat them up on camera. If you don't believe me, go to the Milk Bar account on Twitter and you can see the videos of what Tate is in real life. We'll be interviewing the man behind Milk Bar next week here on the show. And I think I think we could actually divert a whole hour to that discussion of who that man is and his influence negatively on the generation of men that are following his lead today. But that's for another time. Before we close our discussion with Chris, we have to discuss one of his best videos that goes straight to the point. It is the parody of the woke Gillette ad that talked about toxic masculinity, which is kind of stupid if you're selling razor blades. But here's just a little clip from Chris's response. We know that most of you men in America are unaware of this, so we at Gillette are here to educate you. Bullying is mean and bad. No seriously though, bullying is really bad and mean. Okay, is this kid who's hugging his mom, calling her a loser and saying everybody hates you, that's kind of mean kid. I don't. And how do they not see these other kids running through their house? Do they just not care or I don't really understand what's happening here? Look at this sexist cartoon. We had to stage this because we couldn't find any archival footage of men harassing women. So we had to invent some. That is one of my favorite lines from the video. We couldn't find any archival footage of sitcoms with men harassing women. So we had to make it up that Chris, I have to ask you, was that one of your favorite videos? Must have taken you days. Was that one of your favorite ones to make? Yeah, that was actually even before the AOC video. That was my first viral hit. That was a lot of fun. I put on the Wolverine voice for the voice over and yeah, it was great fun. You know, it was like, because Gillette had produced this video that was supposed to, I think in their heads, it was like, oh, this is, this is actually going to express the truth about men, right? And like you're selling razors to men. Maybe don't go around saying men are awful because that was essentially what they were saying and they were trying to say it in a clever way. And I thought, no, look, I'm just going to put it out there, what you're actually saying, literally, I didn't even really have to change the script. No, I just took what they did. And I made it more literal than metaphorical. And, you know, everybody laughed because they were like, yeah, that's what Gillette was doing. They are. You did that one thing though. And it was hilarious. He did that the thing that, and Jinger's are evil. That's right. Because they picked on Jinger kids for some reason. It was like, it was very strange. Last question of all, in all of these things, I could do this for another three hours with you, Chris. You're such a, it's such a jewel. On this issue of the assault on masculinity with the rise of Jordan Peterson, with some brave women who are standing up to the transgender freaks, like who's that swimmer, Will Thomas. Gains? Yeah, rally gains. Yeah. Are you an optimist or a pessimist? Are we going to win this war? It's tough. I am an optimist. You know, by my nature, I am an optimist. And it is very difficult right now because we are being attacked on every side. And I feel like, you know, with the 2020 election and the 2024 election coming away, just did a video speculating on how they're going to try to steal that by taking Trump off the ballots in the swing states. It's kind of terrifying. And I do feel like there's a lot of push from the left to change society to be more feminine. And just like there's this guy I talked to the other day here in Oregon who's like, oh, my kids are really conservative, but all their friends are gay and all their teachers are gay. Very leftist with a gay thing. And I said, tell him it's the expression of a mental illness. And I don't know if he's going to or not, but I feel like that kind of idea is slipping away. And I think that we are sort of encroaching and, you know, we're going more and more crazy. But I will say I went to barbecue the other day with all the folks from my brother's church. And I could not have been more impressed. It was like a real normal. I should have videoed it. It was like the most normal American day I've had probably since the 1990s that, you know, it was fantastic. And everybody there was just amazing, just really good families. A lot of little kids run around jumping on the trampoline and, you know, we're playing what he called cornhole and, you know, having hamburgers, you know, it was one of the most amazing days I've had in years just because it was so normal. I just outside of my own family anyway. It was just very normal. And it gave me a lot of hope. And I thought, you know, there's thousands, millions of families like this all over America having barbecues, wanting to have a normal life. And let me tell you, everybody there was a conservative and there was several people who were actually fans of my show, which was fantastic. Well, that's what we love to hear. That's the effect of this man. And we have to be optimistic because really the way America goes is the way Western civilization goes. Support this man. Follow him. The alpha critic, the Mr. Reagan channels on YouTube and on Twitter, Mr. Reagan USA. Keep doing what you do, my friend. I'm Sebastian Gorker. You've been listening to the manhood now, wherever you are, whatever you're doing. Keep you heading to the civil, watch your six, hold the line. Never give up. Never give in and stay frosty. Our fathers brought forth upon this continent a new nation conceived in liberty and dedicated to the proposition that all men are created equal. I know not what course others may take, but as for me, give me liberty or give me death. The world will little note a long remember what we say here, but it can never forget what they did here. I have a dream to do. Ask not what your country can do for you. Ask what you can do for your country. Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall. I can hear you, the rest of the world hears you and the people. And the people who knock these buildings down will hear all of us soon. And we will make America great again. This is America First with Sebastian Gorka. American Airlines, emergency line, police, nature emergency. Hey, this is Nudeen American Airlines calling. I am monitoring a call in which Flight 11, the flight attendant is advising our reps that the pilot, everyone from the staff. Nobody knows. Everything is okay. It's just nice to make any move. The vendor is sent at the airplane. That's a big flight. Nobody believes he is going back to the airport. Don't try to make any stupid move. Hey, can you look at your window right now? Can you see it got about 4,000 feet, about 5 each year up there right now? Looks like he's... Yeah, I see him. Is he just saying to the building also? He's just sending really quick, too. That's right, 100 feet now. He just said, drop 800 feet, Mike. Like, one, one, three. That's another situation. What kind of room for his neck? You guys tell? I don't know. I'll read it out in a minute. Another one just at the building. Wow. Everybody just said, wow, no way. They're all in. Another one just at the world's face. United 1523, did you hear your company? Did you hear some interference on the brake? I was here a couple of minutes ago, screaming? Yes, I did. 787. We couldn't tell what it was either. I got the piece to knock. You believe me? It's the Dean? We had them all of us. So was that. I also want to give you a head up, head up Washington. Go ahead. United 9-3. You got information on that yet? Yeah, he's down. He's down? Yes. Why did he land? Because we had to take the place in the house. He did not land. Oh, he's down? Yes. Somewhere up, northeast of Camp David. Perhaps that you've never tried a White House, now made a pomegranate. I don't know where the holder get married. I said, why should he leave me up too when I called Washington? They didn't know what the hell was going on. Flight 93 is down. Flight 93 landed? No. It's down. 22 years ago today, the air traffic control communications of that beautiful, clear, Tuesday, sunny morning. Events that would change not only the lives of the 3,000 murdered and their families, but of America and the rest of the world. The man who was responsible for that city, who was on the ground, who was responsible for getting it back off its knees. Probably the greatest mayor of the modern age, along with Teddy Roosevelt. We are honored to open today's America first with the one, the only one. Mayor Rudy Giuliani. Mr. Mayor, welcome to America first. Thank you, Sebastian. It was beautiful to open with you. Let's start. I don't send questions out in advance and with people like you, I don't need to. Why New York? Why did the terrorists choose New York and why the Twin Towers? I believe that they were attempting to attack our financial center, our political center, and in some ways our social or cultural center in order to crush us. I believe they didn't really understand our financial center and the World Trade Center, which they attempted to attack remember in 93. Yes. And did some damage, but didn't bring it down. I think they thought of that as attacking our financial center. I think the attacks on our, on the Pentagon was our military, our government, and then the attack on probably the Congress or the White House would have been on our political center. So New York, part of it would represent the financial and the cultural. New York is bigger than life. In many ways, when people think of the United States outside of the United States, they think of New York. Yes. Where, where for better or worse, the cultural center of the United States. And if you can destroy us, you can destroy Washington. From their point of view, you've pretty much done great damage to us. And I think they thought they were going to crack our morale. Right. Well, they chose the wrong city and they chose the wrong mayor if they thought they were going to crack America's. And the wrong president. You know, Bernie, carrot reminded me today that one of the things I said to him in the middle of all this, when we were being the second building was coming down, I grabbed his arm and I said to him, Bernie, thank God Gore wasn't elected. Oh my gosh. Just imagine. It came out. It was like a, I mean, I knew that Bush had an idiom to give them a response that would stop this damn thing, at least for a while. And it's the clip we use from ground zero, opening every show of the president saying the people who did this will hear from us and they will hear from us very soon. Mr. Mayor, you were incredibly gracious. Last year you opened your home to me and a film crew and we did a kind of oral history for two hours of what you lived through on that day. We'll be playing elements of that through the week. But one thing we only have you for a few more minutes and thank you for opening the show with us today. Would you say a few words because for us, the most iconic images. Are you at ground zero with the NYPD Ray jacket with an F D NY bait ball cap on? Would you talk to us a little bit about the NYPD and the F D NY that day? Oh, I sure will. I mean, they were, they were unbelievable. I can just repeat to you something that came up very spontaneously today. I met today, the son of Chief Gancy. Chief Gancy was the head of the fire department. He was the highest ranking uniformed officer of the fire department and he ran the entire effort and he was in charge. And when I got to ground zero, he was the person that I communicated with to make sure everything was coordinated. And when I got there, I was shocked to see a man jumping from the hundreds floor. We went through that. And in fact, to me, that was probably the critical moment that changed my entire perception of what we were dealing with. I mean, I've dealt with, I've dealt with a hundred emergencies before that. And I guess I began this with thinking, well, this is another emergency. Then all of a sudden I watched this man. I was trans six jumped a hundred floors and. Basically get obliterated on the street. I went right up the chief Gancy and I said, can we get helicopters up there? And the chief looked at me very seriously. He said, my men can save everyone below the fire. And in that one sentence, he really told me everything. What he told me was the people I was looking at up on the roof were dead. Which was a horrible feeling. I think my stomach dropped when I said that. Number two, he told me that his men had pretty much gotten to everybody they could save. And we were going to probably get a lot of people out, which felt pretty good. About three or four years later, the 9-11 Commission, which was critical of some of the effort. But largely, Florida, concluded that from the point of view of the police officers and firefighters, they got out 100% of the people they were capable of saving. And as a result of that probably saved about 12,000 lives. So what he told me turned out to begin the report, they saved everyone below the fire. Those are the people they could save. And they ran an all kind, the pastor ran into the building, the iconic photograph of the pastor's dead body being carried out. We salute every single one of them, EMS, the Port Authority officers, FDNY and NYPD on this day. Thank you, Mr. Mayor, for joining us today. Please support this man.
