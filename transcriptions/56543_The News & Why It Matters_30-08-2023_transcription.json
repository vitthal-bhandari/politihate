    "text": " Today, mask mandates are back across the country. Mitch McConnell freezes up in the middle of a press conference again and a big update in the 2024 presidential candidates. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and today if you woke up this morning and read the news headlines of the day, you may have thought you were in the movie Groundhog Day and somehow woke up reliving the year 2020. And 2021 and in some cases, 2022. Here's some headlines. As COVID cases rise, what will that mean for mask mandates? School mask mandates again? Why some experts think it's a good idea? Yes, the experts. You know, the people bought and paid for by the medical industrial complex who only profit when you get sicker. Well, the experts are doing exactly what we predicted they would do as we gear up for another presidential election. They're bringing back the mandates. Five US hospitals have now brought back mask mandates in New York, California and Massachusetts. And boy, they are doing this to you again. And why wouldn't they? COVID was just the test run and the people complied. The question is, are they, are you willing to do it again? That is if you did it the first time, because if you're a longtime viewer of the show, odds are you didn't fall for that crap. The first go around. I want to welcome to the program, the host of the high wire, Del Bigtree. Del, thank you so much for being here once again, my friend. And I just, I can't believe that I am reliving this talk of mask mandates when we've been saying this whole time for years now. They don't freaking work. I don't know how much science you need in the world that talks so much about science, but all the studies, including the Cochrane collaboration, which did a meta analysis of studies all around the world, determining that that mask has absolutely no value when it comes to stopping the coronavirus or the flu virus or anything else that's small. There, as it's been described, it's like a chain link fence that these things can just fly right through. So it's amazing to think that any university or any hospital would be mandating these things. I'm getting calls from people that say, you know, I know someone that's trying to go to university, they're going to make them wear a mask again. What should they do? I say pick another university. Why would you want to be educated by a university that is incapable of reading relevant science and forcing something on you that has absolutely no value to your life can only do harm. We're now seeing studies that show that the CO2 buildup behind those masks is far more dangerous for you than COVID was, especially when you're in the age between zero and 19 as anyone in university is probably in that space. And so all of it is really shocking and Groundhog Day is right. I think people like you and I, Sarah, you know, imagine and predicted that this would probably come back around, but even predicting it doesn't make it feel any better. Yeah, I totally agree. And, you know, they talk about, you know, trust the experts, trust the experts. And the only experts apparently have to be government affiliated. But I mean, even sometimes government affiliated experts slip a little bit, as you pointed out in your Twitter feed, which I saw there, the CDC, I actually think I think this was back the last time we did the whole COVID thing. And there were wildfires, but the CDC admits that the COVID-19 cloth masks offer little protection against wildfire smoke. They do not catch small particles in wildfires smoke. Like that can harm your health. It's not funny. I don't know why I'm laughing. But you've tweeted this out with the particle of smoke and then the smaller red blood cell. And then you've got this all the way at the end there. This is how small COVID is. And if you can't trap the particle in the mask with the smoke, how in the world do you think that you're going to trap COVID? It's really amazing. And this is the type of thing that we do on the highway. And I know you do it too. We are not like making up the science. We're using the CDC's own science. The CDC warning you don't trust that cloth mask. It is not going to protect you from smoke. Well, they can't protect you from smoke, which has a gigantic particle compared to the size of the coronavirus. Then what was it ever doing for coronavirus? This is the type of morons that we've now got running our regulatory agencies that are determining the future of this nation, our economy, our health, our children's health. It's really scary. And I think it's why we are seeing an all time low in the confidence that Americans have for our regulatory agencies, the confidence they have for the media that sold everyone on wearing masks, all the MSNBC's and the CNN's and the Rachel Maddows. And you've got to do your part. And now they're ready to get everybody to do it all over again. For what? I mean, how bad does the vaccine have to fail? I mean, things in absolute disaster didn't stop transmission. And now we know, even though they tried to guilt us into it, we've got heads of Pfizer like Janine Smalley saying in front of the European Union, we never even tested to see if the vaccine could stop transmission before it was released to the public. It's this disaster to the integrity of science that is the most concerning everyone in our regulatory agencies and everyone at these news agencies that sell this debunked crap need to be fired right away. I am very worried about the state of science right now and our ability to determine what is actually fact, what is science, what is provable, where is the peer reviewed science. Instead, we keep hearing expert opinions from people like Tony Fauci and Deborah Berg, who let us down the wrong path in every single department. When you look at the United States of America, we ended up in all of our lockdowns and all of our masking and all of our social distancing in our forced vaccination program. And Joe Biden for all the healthcare workers and and politically people working for the government, we look back and we have the highest death rate in the world. It's an absolute total failure, yet they're pinning gold medals to each other's jackets and shirts and handing out awards and celebrating how great they did. We were beat by Africa kicked our ass. So, okay, so you mentioned the vaccine, Del. I want to to your point. I want to play Joe Biden just at the end of last week talking about how he wants to send more of our money, you and I are taxpayer money. He wants to send more money so that we can create another vaccine and don't but don't worry. This time this this vaccine will work. I think he he had a little bit of a Freudian slip there. If we have Joe Biden at the end of last week, why don't you have a couple of cases. I'm very. Yes, I can. Matter of fact, I signed off this morning and I'm up the coast. We have to present to the Congress the quest for additional funding for new vaccine. It doesn't even have us here. It works. And tentatively not decided finally. Tentatively it is recommended that we would like to be recommended to everybody get a matter of what they got before. So he mumbles. So I'm going to I'm going to throw up an image here of the transcript. So he said, I signed off this morning on a proposal we have to present to the Congress a request for additional funding for a new vaccine that is necessary that works. Well, I don't know about you, Del, but that sounds a little bit to me like Joe Biden was just admitting the first one didn't even freaking work. But don't worry, we're sending more money so we can do it all over again. You would think that the that works part is sort of a basic requirement for any product mandated by the United States of America. But we now live in a world where that wasn't the case and they knew it wasn't the case, which is what is so shocking about this. And now I suppose we're suddenly supposed to start trusting the same experts that said things like 95% effective and 100% effective when they never even tested to see was effective at all. So I don't know what works means to Joe Biden. I don't know what it means to the CDC or the FDA. But what I know we do need to do as American citizens and really citizens of the world is we need to turn back on our highest level of skepticism for our government, our government agencies. They have proved to us now that they have no problem lying to us whether, you know, whatever you think their agenda may be. And, you know, if you're watching the highway and I'm sure your show, we present a lot of different possibilities. But they're myriad out there and what is actually going on. The only thing we can really sink our teeth into the fact that you can't sink your teeth into a single fact being presented by your government or the regulatory agencies now. Yeah, I mean, you're absolutely right, Del. So on that note, I want to throw one more thing your way here. And by the way, I don't, this part might not be on YouTube. So if you guys are watching on YouTube and you see, you know, all of a sudden, there's part of the episode that's gone. Make sure that you tune in to the rest at blaistb.com because we're not allowed to speak truth sometimes on YouTube as I know, Del, you know, far too well. I would say you're rarely allowed to speak to Del Bigtree on YouTube. I mean, that's the, I have this way of getting people picked up. Yeah, yeah. Our platforms of free speech. Yeah, well, yeah, they don't, which means you're well over the target. I think they're dull. But I see. Yes, of course. So I want to, I know that you talk to all sorts of doctors who aren't government experts, but have done a lot of studies themselves on, you know, things like unvaccinated children versus vaccinated children. And I just want to go over some of this with you. So I throw up here this pilot comparative study on the health of vaccinated and unvaccinated six to 12 year old United States children. This was done by Mossen, Anthony Mossen. And I believe it was 2017. And I mean, it is unbelievable when you look at a graph, a chart of the odds ratios of chronic diseases for vaccinated versus unvaccinated children. You're 30 times more likely to have allergic rhinitis, almost four times more likely for allergies. You've got, you know, five times more likely for learning disabilities, four times more likely for autism and ADHD. And the list goes on and on and on and on and on. And this is not the only study that has been done that concurs with this one. That's right. And I think it's always important to point out the limitations of any scientific study. This was a poll based study done by Mossen where he reached out to home school mothers. I believe it was across the country. And from I think somewhere in the neighborhood of a thousand different poll, you know, poll people came up with this data. But what makes it so shocking for me is as you've pointed out, there are multiple studies. You have Dr. Brian Hooker and Dr. Paul Thomas went through Paul Thomas who has tens of thousands of patients he's seen over the years. He compared all of his patients vaccinated and unvaccinated. And his numbers are almost identical. I know of several other studies that major groups have have conducted but are afraid to publish because they're afraid it will hurt their funding and things like that. And the numbers are almost exactly the same. We have a recurring problem here. And that's when you know you're really over the target. There's a real problem with these vaccines. It is showing up in the exact same fashion no matter how you do this study. And then people say, well, it wasn't powered enough or it was a poll based study or they had a bias because they had unvaccinated kids in their practice in the terms of Dr. Paul Thomas. But here's the point what we're seeing is a major signal and we're all asking the question, why is the NIH and why are the CDC refusing to do a proper vaccinated versus completely unvaccinated studies so that we can get to the bottom of this on much larger databases that our government is sitting on. And to be clear, people say, all that study's been done. What about the study that was done, you know, the Danish study? All of those studies are usually vaccinated versus vaccinated. Meaning, you know, one group got all the vaccines minus MMR vaccine and then all the vaccines plus the MMR vaccine. They say, see, MMR doesn't cause autism. Well, that doesn't work if other vaccines also cause autism like the diphtheria tetanus and acheleoprotusage, which is the most popular vaccine called out by parents of autistic children. So there's a problem with these studies. I call it the Jack Daniel study. This is how they play the game. I could give a group of people 10 shots of vodka and then grab another group and give them 10 shots of vodka plus Jack Daniels, send them both home, driving home and say they had the equal amount of car accidents. Therefore, Jack Daniels does not cause an abreation. This is how these studies work. It's a total game that's being played by our regulatory agencies, not just in America, but around the world and all of these governments that are mandating vaccines and more and more scientists, world-renowned scientists are waking up to this fraud and they're starting to speak out like Dr. Peter Maghola, one of the most, I think the most published heart doctor in the world. You've got Dr. Paul Merrick, the most, the highest, most published ICU doctor in the world. These are not just, you know, some quacks out there. These are some of the most researched scientists and doctors in the world that are now speaking the truth that millions of parents around the world have been claiming for a very long time. Yeah. I would also highly encourage the audience on that topic to watch your movie. I first met you. I was just a, just a mom trying to navigate my way through momhood, the movie Vaxxed, which was just life changing for me. So I would highly encourage everyone check that movie out as well. Dell, we have that for free, by the way. Anyone that goes to thehighwire.com, we have the film Vaxxed, the documentary about a whistleblower inside the CDC. Still is there, by the way, named Dr. William Thompson, who came forward saying they committed scientific fraud on the MMR autism studies back in early 2000s. The last study ever funded by the government ended in 2004 that ever looked at the connection between vaccines and autism. And when they tell you, this has been studied like crazy. It's totally studied. Absolutely not true. The last study we ever funded was all the way back in 2004. And it's a fraud. And the film Vaxxed shows you how that fraud took place. Yeah. Well, Dell, I so appreciate all of your work and I appreciate you being here. Everyone can find you at thehighwire.com. That's the best place to find me. And then you can get into all of our legal work. We want more lawsuits in this health space. We just want back the religious exemption from vaccination from Mississippi with our incredible law team. I think it's the biggest win we've got yet. We've won lawsuits against the FDA, CDC, Health and Human Services, the NIH. All of that is a part of the work that we do. But start at thehighwire.com to check it all out. Thank you so much, doll. We'll talk to you soon. Thank you, Sarah. All right. Well, I don't know. I hope we're not. It's not. Don't be pessimistic. All right. Because you do have people like Dell Big Tree actually taking action and informing the world. And I think America is waking up and we'll be back with more. But we want to thank our sponsor before we go to break here, Birch Gold. So look, as central banks in countries like China, India, Australia, there are starting to transition to a digital currency. The Federal Reserve has been like, you know what? We might want to do the same for the United States. But with a digital currency, the government could track like, I don't know, every single purchase you make. Officials could even prohibit you from purchasing certain products or, I don't know, just freeze or seize part or all of your money. Does that sound like fun to you? Yeah. No, these are just some of the reasons concerned Americans are reaching out to Birch Gold group. They want to have a physical asset that is independent from the United States dollar, which is gold that would be held in a tax, a tax sheltered in a retirement account. So learn if gold is right for you too. It's been right for our family. We are heavily diversified into gold. And we just did it again a couple months ago with Birch Gold group. They made it very, very easy. And if you're not sure, you're like, I want to learn more. Just text the word why to 9898. They're going to send you a free information kit on gold. It's no obligation. It's just explaining what they can do for you, how they can get you all of this in a tax sheltered retirement account. And historically, gold and silver have been the best hedge against inflation, which is what we're experiencing right now. So text the word why to 9898. I don't want to bring in here Jason Buttril, Chief Researcher of the Glenn Beck program and Rob Eno, Blaze Media, Blaze TV Media Critic. I guess it would sound weird if it was Blaze Media Media Critic. I get it. I get it. Five times fast. As I was introing you, I was like, oh, I see why they didn't do that. So I want to play for you guys, Senator Mitch McConnell, who did the thing again where he just completely froze up during a press conference. And honestly, this was this afternoon in Kentucky. And honestly, this could not have come at a worse time because he was literally being asked about running again in 2026. And he just like he needed a reboot, I guess, watch. This is what I thought about what running for reelection in 2006. That's right. Did you hear the question, Senator running for reelection in 2026? Oh, all right. I'm sorry. Are you all working? I mean, that's, that is not, that is not right. That is the Microsoft Blue screen of death. That is it is very sad. So I don't have a question. Please speak up. So I agree with you, Jason. It is sad. However, it is also in raging to me for multiple different reasons. Number one, as we saw there, and as we saw the last time he did it back in July, which I want to play for a second here in a second, nobody gives him medical attention. They instead prop him up there, finish the press conference. And I don't even know if they go to the hospital at that point, again, which, I mean, you know, if you see someone who's in the middle of a medical event, I don't know if it's a stroke. I don't know, I clearly something is going on. You need to get them to a doctor as soon as possible. And sometimes they can even reverse potential damage, if it were a stroke or something like that. These people are so invested in power that they parade him around at the expense of his own health because they just don't want to relinquish control. I want to play here just in case I don't think anyone missed it, but in case he missed it the first time around in July, here was the first time we saw Mitch McConnell just completely freeze up in the middle of a press conference. A parks and cooperation and a string of... Mid-sentence. Same thing happens. The staffer comes up. I mean, this is... There's something seriously wrong with this man. All right, that's enough. Like, it is... it's sad, but that is why you retire. Live out the remaining time that you have with your family and let go of the power. I'm sick of it. I don't care whose side it is. I don't care if it's Diane Feinstein or John Fetterman who isn't that old, but clearly does not with it. If it's Joe Biden, whoever it is, Mitch McConnell, I don't care what letter you have at the end of your name in politics. If you are not fit for the job, you need to leave. Yeah, it looks like... I mean, I'm not a doctor, obviously, but it looks like a little microstroke. Like a mini stroke. That's what it looks like. Yeah, I mean, it gets clear from... especially on this one, from the aid that comes in, it's clear that they're not surprised. No, she knows. This is not a new thing, so you know if he's doing this on camera, how many times is he doing this in private meetings, all that stuff? She says, we're going to need a minute. They all know there's a procedure for it. I mean, I don't even really know who to blame here. I know a lot of people share blame. I agree. But I mean, his family needs to be telling him, look, enough is enough. You're done. They need to put their foot down for one. But you're absolutely right. I mean, think about all the other... the echelons of power within the GOP that are involved here. You've got the RNC. You've got all the heavy hitters within the Republican Party who do not want to relinquish the money. They don't want to relinquish that amount of experience in the Senate. They don't want to give it up. You bring in a new person, they've got to start all over for committees and all that stuff. This system is just so jacked. I've said this before, but I think it's one of the founders, I think, were divinely inspired in a lot of the creation of this government. But this clearly just missed them. They missed it. They missed it. They missed it with bureaucracy and how that works. This is how the Deep State is formed. It's how it flourishes and it's how it runs a country, which, yes, it's running the country right now. Not Joe Biden. I would disagree a little bit. Not on just on the way that you're looking at the power. If what you're saying is true and I think that it is, that these people don't want to relinquish power, they'll just go and work for the next establishment majority leader. And you said his family. His family is Elaine Chao who derives her power from being married in a lot of ways to the majority leader of the United States Senate. So she's not going to tell Chinese companies. But I mean, she's been a lot of things. But I mean, the reason she was probably in the Trump administration is to make Mitch happy, right? I mean, that's why she's been in different government things. But I think that it's that whole ancestral thing. And what's amazing is, is Mitch had them change the law in Kentucky. If you remember, Kentucky has a Democratic governor because the libertarian-leaning governor went corrupt and people didn't like him and they voted him out. So they've got a John Bell Edwards. I think, I forget if it's John Bell Edwards, but whatever his name is, Bashir is the governor. He's a Democrat. They changed with their supermajority legislature so that it's not the governor that appoints anymore. It's the Republican Central Committee controlled by Mitch McConnell-Acolytes that would give three people for them to replace Mitch with. So like these people have an avenue to keep power. It's, and like you said, it is absolutely clear that they are 100% knowing what's going on. And you said they didn't take him to the doctor. I bet the doctor said, no, this is from the, you know, from when he got smacked on the head, he fell down. This is probably just some sort of, you know, maybe it's just some sort of wiring-this-loose thing in his head. But it's not good. And if he doesn't have the mental faculties to be the majority leader, he shouldn't be the majority leader. Even without him resetting like that, you can tell he can barely stand up there to deliver comments. Which, to be fair, he's always had a problem with that because of, I believe, is like an old polio, he had polio when he was younger. I mean, I think he's always had trouble walking. But beyond that, I mean- I totally agree with you. I just didn't want people in the comments to be like, yeah, but, I mean, I agree with that. But it clearly is something bigger than just that that he's having problems with. Well, I have some bad news for you guys before we go to break here. Are you ready? Mm-hmm. We lost one. We lost a presidential candidate in the 2024 race. We lost him. Miami Mayor Francis Suarez has dropped out of the 2024 president. I didn't even know he was running. Well, he was getting 0.2% in the polls. Oh, sorry. And he decided, you know what, this is not for me. He posted earlier today on X, running for president of the United States has been one of the greatest honors of my life. This country has given so much to my family and me. Blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. I actually personally love that he said one of the greatest honors of his life as if anyone asked him to do it. Like, literally anyone can run for president. How is that the greatest honor of your life? I feel like all of these guys know that they have no shot at all. I think it almost seems like DeSantis is really the only one that's really kind of running, thinking that he might possibly could win. Yeah. But everybody else, I feel like they're just running for a cabinet position or something like that. They just want their name out there so that whether it's Trump, DeSence, whoever, they're like, oh, I remember you at one point you were running as well. Right. Here's a consolation prize. I have friends and acquaintances that routinely put their name on the New Hampshire primary ballot because it's like 200 bucks. I have thought of doing that and just be like, hey, I wonder how many votes I'll get. Yeah. It's insane. And that was my first thought was that, and then I'm like, I think I remember him running. He's the guy that DeSantis brought over the thing, but he doesn't like DeSantis. And it's just, it's craziness. He's a Republican, but he was celebrating pride. Yeah. And he posted, I think he was wearing like a pride sash at one point. And then I questioned his sexuality, but apparently he's married. So then I was very confused. It's like Miami. Right. Right. There's a reason. Sorry, married to a woman. I should have discussed that. I don't know anything about his politics whatsoever, but a lot of these politicians that run as GOP and some of these, you know, blue cities or even states, like Arnold Schwarzenegger as a Republican. I mean, no conservative at all. I mean, at all, but he still is. Right. If you look on IMDB, I was just doing this today, actually. If you look on IMDB, I was looking at the list of conservative actors. And some of the, I completely forgot the person I was talking about, right? Arnold Schwarzenegger? Arnold Schwarzenegger. Sorry. I just reset. I need to lose faith. Yeah. Okay. Time for you to resign. Yeah, it's time. Even Arnold Schwarzenegger was listed as a conservative on there. And I was cracking up because I was like, I guess, well, we have no actors. I'll take it. Right. No, he's not a conservative. All right. Let's, when we come back, I want to talk about Portland public schools. Who will no longer be allowed to give students zeros for cheating. Yeah. We'll be right back. This is your taxpayer dollars at work here. Portland public schools will no longer be allowed to give students zeros for cheating or missing work due to their new equitable grading policy. From the grading practices summary here, historical data shows that there are racial disparities in our pass fail rate in multiple subjects in both middle grades and high school. During the pandemic, we adjusted our grading to accommodate for some of the inequities in access to curriculum and instruction. This caused many teachers to begin the journey towards equitable grading but confusing to students and families. We need to organize and consolidate our efforts toward common policies to more consistently and better support students and families with equitable grading. Yes. So they're not going to penalize grades for student behavior, for late work, for attendance, for cheating. Here's the 15 fixes for broken grades. Do not reduce grades for cheating. Provide alternative consequences. Do not include group scores in grades, organize grades by learning objective. I mean, you basically are babying someone because of, I guess, the color of their skin. And I question if there is some sort of equitable issue that maybe we should look at culturally what the issues are that are causing the problem for particular students to not care about school. Right. Call me crazy. But maybe we should look bigger picture rather than just, oh no, we need to make sure that there's a subset of kids that are just not doing well and not caring and getting horrible grades. You know what? Let's make sure we don't give them consequences for that. Yes. Speaking of bigger picture, imagine, and we've talked about what the left is doing to an entire generation of people, of kids right now, completely destroying lives. You think about a grade, like a numerical grade or an alphabetical grade on a paper like this in school is not really the true measure of what that kid learned. The true measure of what that kid learned is what he retained. So when they get out of school, they go out into the workplace, they try to go to college. It doesn't matter how much you try to hide the fact, they're not going to know the information. Right. They're not going to know. So what good are you doing to these kids? Right. You're not, just because you kind of made it disappear that they didn't do as well, does not change the fact that they're not going to know anything once they try to go out and get a job. This is what they're doing to the youth of our country right now. I mean, this is just one of the many things that they're doing to the youth of our country right now. But compare that to places that we now consider our adversarial to us. They're not doing this. China is not doing this. This is like Japan, which, I mean, they still have what, the number three economy in the world, something like that. I mean, they are definitely not going to be doing that. I mean, that's culturally against everything that they're about. Where are we going to stack up when these kids become 25, 30? Yep. It's unreal. It's the return of the South bigotry of low expectations. That was, you know, as much as we don't like what no child left behind became common core and all of those sorts of things. George W. Bush was absolutely 100% right when he called up the South bigotry of low expectations. It's why charter schools are good. It's why, you know, vouchers are good to get people out of these failing schools and out of places like the Portland public school system that doesn't believe that kids can learn. Like me personally, I hated homework and I would get Ason tests and get seasoned classes because I wouldn't have the homework. I would have loved this, right? It would have been great. Yeah, and you would have had no incentive to change and get better. Yeah. Well, I don't think I ever did that. You could talk to my teachers. Oh. I hate the same teacher. She pretty much for three grades. She gave up by the time we were in a safe. But no, it's, it's insane to me that the school district in was it Virginia or Florida where they had the assembly with only black children to talk about low grades and failing grades and got destroyed by the left. But then they're doing the same exact thing. It says right in there, it says racial disparities. Yes. It has racist language from no other words. But because they're not holding people accountable, it's great. It does no service to any of these kids. If no, if anybody in the audience, somebody watching right now are listening, has never heard Thomas soul talk about this. You have got to Google it right now on like YouTube. It is absolutely amazing. He talks about his hard time growing up. He talks about the schools and how they were awful. He was a big, big advocate for school choice and being able to go to where there are good schools. He says, that is how you take people out of poverty. Education is how you do it. And I'm sure he never could have imagined we'd get into a situation like now where even if you did have school choice, it doesn't matter because they're just dumbing down all the schools. Right. Yeah, again, you can't have the illusion of the fact that, oh, this is a better school because look at other grades, they're so much better. Oh, yeah, we didn't give out zeros or anything. Right. That's what you're doing. You're creating a poverty dependent society with the lack of education. You're not doing any minority group, any favors by doing this at all. And this should be obvious, right? Yeah. It should be obvious. Well, speaking of the state of public schools, if you are over in California, the attorney general filed a civil rights lawsuit against the Chino Valley Unified School District earlier this week because the district, you're not going to believe this, they adopted a policy that would require schools to inform parents about student gender transitions. And that was just, that was a bridge too far for the California Attorney General. He said, Rob Bonta, A.G. Rob Bonta, he said, nope, we're launching an investigation. You cannot inform parents about their own freaking children. We must hide it from the parents. And then when the child becomes confused and withdrawn and isolated and depressed and ends up killing themselves, I don't know. I guess it'll be the parents' fault, even though they didn't know. I mean, this is disgusting stuff happening. I want to, I want to read an ex post from a California Senator Scott Wiener, who is so appropriately named. I can't think of a better name than Scott Wiener for this little Wiener. He says, forcing a teacher to out a trans kid to their parents, even if the kid isn't ready. I believe it puts them at risk of harm is dangerous and frankly despicable. Each of us decides when we come out. It's no one else's damn business. Thanks, A.G. Rob Bonta, for having these kids back. I don't think parents know how, so this does, this is absolutely insane. I don't think parents even know how deep this goes. This is so infested in public schools. What you have to do is, I don't have enough time in this show to talk about every single layer that this is in. But take a look at who your school psychologist is. Take a look at who your school psychologist is, the counselors, all of them. Even if your school does, let's say they do something like this and they say, oh, you have to, you know, if this is brought up in class, you know, you hear about this, you have to inform the parents. Even if they say you can't do that, well, there's, there's a thing called the, it was the American Society of School Psychologists that they have their own standards. So let's say something like this is brought up. Don't talk about it. Go see the psychologist. Psychologist by their own standards also cannot do that. So, but they can counsel this, this kid on gender affirming care and all this stuff. You will never know about it. It is so deep in every layer. Yeah, it's like, well, the parents don't get to know, but we as the teachers who have no familial connection to your child have the right to guide them into it and indoctrinate them into it, prime their brains for it, but you don't have the right to know about it. Right. So, excuse me, I forget the gentleman that we had on one of the last times that I was on the show who was in the custody battle. Harrison, Tennessee. Harrison. In California, they've proposed laws and I don't know if it's passed that you can get your kids taken away from you if you don't affirm the care, which comes back to this whole thing, right? So, so they tell the parents and then they take the kid away, right? That's the other thing that could happen here. And then what's absolutely just infuriatingly insane to me is that if they, to your point with the psychologist, if the kid comes in and says, well, my parents found out and they don't support me, that same psychologist would have a mandatory reporting to child protective services to get the kid taken out of the home. That's what people don't understand. This is a social contagion. Yeah. Yeah. And it's just, it's insane. Get your kids the hell out of public schools. We'll be right back. MSMBC contributor, Trimaine Lee, is very upset at Florida Governor Ron DeSantis because he called the man who murdered three black people at a dollar general store in Jacksonville, Florida a scumbag. And apparently you're not supposed to blame the person who actually freaking did it. Watch. And yesterday Governor DeSantis in Florida facing audible booze at a Jacksonville vigil for the three victims. At the vigil DeSantis called the gunman a scumbag. And Jeffrey Rumblin, a Jacksonville pastor who spoke after DeSantis was very directed in his response. And at the end of the day, respectfully Governor, he was not a scumbag. He was a racist. What's your response to that? You know, for so many folks, the issue with that kind of language is that it places the onus on one individual and the actions of one individual as opposed to a nationwide sickness of white supremacy in this country and the violence that it fuels. And so as long as it's, he's a scumbag or as long as there's a mental health issue, you don't have to engage with the idea that there are, you know, co-conspirators online. There are co-conspirators who can't let you sleep in that divide and other people. There are all these other forces that are contributing to this kind of violence. But as long as the act of one individual is just a scumbag, then you don't have to take the true issue head on. Like I'm sorry can racist not be scumbags? I think it was clear. He's, Rumblin's hand has been very clear that this guy, this was racially motivated. Very clear there. But isn't it good that he's calling this guy out. This guy just murdered three of your people, Trimaine. And now you got to find fault because he's blaming the guy that just murdered three black people. I'm so confused. I was just about to say, I think in the dictionary under racist, it actually says a scumbag, semicolon, someone that thinks their racist went better than others. It's like, wait, so we don't want to blame the guy that just racially engaged in a racially motivated attack that killed three black people. We're supposed to not make him responsible. I'm none of the things. Unless of course, it was interesting that this was on MSNBC. Unless of course it's a leftist that drives to a baseball field during a practice to shoot it up. Because then the person was just mentally ill and wasn't of course radicalized by Rachel Maddow. Right. And the folks at MSNBC. Right. So I'm a white shooter against a bunch of white people. So then it was the guns fault. Well, that brings up the things that bring up. It's not the person. Now it's the person and the systemic white supremacy. Yeah. Or I thought it was the gun. Right. How many African American black shootings happen with black victims in Jacksonville every week that don't get the national attention that this does. Because that motivation's not there. Right. But it's society's fault that a crazy white scumbag. I also write. I also, I mean, I have some questions on the fact that he says, well, you can't blame just this one person because clearly it's a nationwide problem of white supremacy. I mean, that's weird because it was just the single act that you guys brought up. So I would imagine if it was some big nationwide problem, then it would be leading the headlines every single day and they'd have just another white person who went and murdered three black people in a racially motivated attack all the time. It's almost like, hmm, it was just this one case every once in a while. It happens because it turns out there are in every society and they're like, no, but what we need to blame is the nationwide problem. I don't see it. I see one person who killed three people, which is horrible. Horristically tragic shouldn't have happened. Horrible person, evil. But if you had a nationwide problem, we'd probably see the statistics on that. I too. I trace a lot of our downfall on the decline of local news and the rise of cable news. That's a great point. A lot of these stories, this is a tragic story. A lot of these stories should not be national stories. They should be local stories, but cable news takes these. They spin the narrative. Again, at one point it would be the gun's fault. The other part, it's a systemic white supremacy problem within the entire nation. Come on, man. And there's never individual responsibility. There's never individual responsibility. But I mean, without the rise of cable news and very, very biased news, there wouldn't be counter news to counter the narratives, places like Blaze TV. So I mean, I guess they gave us a job. I guess they gave us a reason to be here. But I mean, that along with social media, I don't know where the discourse in this country is going to be. I mean, think about, since I could go on and on about this. Well, don't. It was like the mid-90s when MSNBC and then CNN started to compete, then Fox News had to come in and be the counter. Since then, how vastly far we've drifted apart since then. Yeah, astonishing. It really is. We've got to take a break and then when we come back, we have an update on the based Gadsden flag patch boy. Yeah. The little boy who had the Gadsden flag patch on his backpack who had been told by his very informed, stupid teachers that he could not wear it because it had origins based in pro slavery was actually told that he will now be able to display the flag on his backpack message from the Vanguard School administrative staff said yesterday the student returned with the patch still visible on his backpack following the district's direction. Vanguard administrators pulled the student aside so that they could speak with his parents and the district Vanguard School Board of Directors called an emergency meeting. They spoke very strongly. They said we have proudly supported our Constitution, the Bill of Rights and the Order of Liberty that all Americans have enjoyed for almost 250 years and the school recognizes the historical significance of the Gadsden flag and its place in history. At this time, the Vanguard School Board and the district have informed the student's family he may attend the school with the patch visible on his backpack. Pushback works. Yeah. You should be recording every interaction that you have with these schools so that it can go viral to your point, Jason, earlier about the downfalls of social media. That has been one of the upsides is that we can draw attention to these things really happening because no one would believe you if you told them without this evidence that these types of things were happening in public schools. Now we see it and we can do something about it. So thanks to all of you who shared the story and put the pressure on Vanguard School. Thanks to you, Jason and Rob for being here today and we will see you guys tomorrow. Stream and subscribe to more Blaze Media content at theblaze.com. Slash podcasts."
