    "text": " Welcome. Welcome to Fairless with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host. Happy Saturday to you and yours. You're well into your weekend. Hope you're enjoying it. We got a little special edition, weekend edition of Fairless. Joining me today will be our main man, Morpheus Royce White, the deepest man on the show. Royce has started his own podcast called Please Call Me Crazy. And so I wanted to bring Royce on. One, there's an issue that I want to talk about that I think is related to the importance of Royce's show. And so I want to combine talking about that issue with telling you and promoting Royce's show and telling you guys how to access it. Royce, thanks for joining me on this Saturday. Appreciate it. And let me just explain to Royce why I want to talk about the Vogue magazine cover that shows Rihanna on the cover basically leading her baby daddy, ASAP Rocky, and their baby. It's to me, and they use the word reborn, Rihanna, everything changes. And so I think the religious symbolism is important and is intentional. And as Christians, we believe as we talk about being reborn in Christ. And I feel like they're trying to send a message about being reborn in this divine feminine energy. But the reason why I think this is important and Royce, you can, I want to talk about the cover, but I also want to talk about your show. You can tell me if I have the wrong take on your show. But what I see in you, Royce, and this is not a vision where I see Royce as the perfect person because you're not your fallen man, just like me and everybody else listening to this. But I think you have a chance to tell a story through your own life and the mistakes you've made and the issues you've dealt with that you can be an example to young men about the natural order, about healthy male talks masculinity, about being a leader as a man. That's what I'm hoping your show is going to represent. That's what I think you have an opportunity to represent. I've told you all fair and I may have even said it on airs. Like I see Royce as the next Kevin Samuels, the next iteration of our America's version of a better version of Andrew Tate, someone who can reach young men and provide them an example and advice that can lead them down a direction. You won't make some of the mistakes Royce has made, some of the mistakes I've made. That's where I'm hoping when you figure this show completely out, that's where I'm hoping the lane is and how you're seeing. Well, I hope so. Those are two very powerful names in Kevin Samuels and Andrew Tate and some of the other people who have been able to get a younger audience and be able to reach younger people. Our younger people in this country and around the world are the future and the destiny of our nation and of our society is in young people's hands. And then we're at a pivotal moment. So I would really love to be able to reach young people. I think my show is definitely to try and convey through my own personal experience the things that I've been through, the pitfalls and things that I've seen, the curtains that I've seen behind, and this sort of impulse for mainstream media to call people crazy who have ideas that are completely rational and logical and then trying to reconnect young people hopefully but all people to a more rational and logical conversation about any number of issues. And I appreciate all my time here on Fearless Doing That and I hope I can continue that in an even longer format over on my show. And then we're off to a good start so far. Your show, do you plan on doing interviews or will it mostly be you? What should viewers, listeners expect? Well the format right now as it stands is Monday, Wednesday, Friday at 9 p.m. It'll premiere on YouTube. We also are set for the episodes to premiere on Rumble although Rumble has some trouble handling such big files. I mean that's just technical stuff behind the scenes but the episodes should make their way to Rumble on the same day in or around the same time as they premiere on YouTube but I'm following in the leaders footsteps here and premiering on YouTube. I like the funky music they play in the countdown. I'm a child like that still. But Monday, Wednesday, Friday and Mondays will be more of a deep dive on a given topic. This week I did Globalism versus Nationalism. Wednesday will be more of a current events and news episode and Fridays will be our family in French Friday and we'll try and have a guest or feature a guest every Friday. Today we're actually doing our first guest or I'm sorry on Friday we're doing our first guest Chris Martenson who is a good friend of mine and a true truth or not and a fighter himself against the mainstream narrative so that's kind of the format and the game plan for now. Monday, Wednesday, Friday, 9 p.m. Monday's deep dive, Wednesday's current events and news and Fridays are our guest show. So is this this is the end of the second week I believe. Easier, harder, what have you learned about doing a podcast and perhaps yourself just two weeks in? Well, I mean I've learned there's so many different ways you could do a podcast. The way we've chosen to do it has has all kinds of hidden obstacles that we didn't foresee but we've been fortunate that in every day that we've we've premiered the episode that it's made it up on YouTube on time. YouTube hasn't censored it. It hasn't hasn't brought the episode down. We haven't had any hiccups or anything like that with with tech so we've been fortunate so far I would say and I hope that we continue to have that success. I'm sure our guest episodes will give us some trouble as you know with Skype but but we're doing our best to pre-check or you know pre-flight check all of those things so so we make the deadlines we need to make. Other than that you know it's just it's it's a whole different format to just monologue for an hour and a half and that's what I've mostly been doing this first couple of weeks is just going off on rants for an hour and a half about any given issue. You know that doesn't trouble me doesn't trouble me as I look out into the future I see a time and I can I can see where any type of on-air personality or broadcaster would find themselves venturing into dangerous territory and trying to provide content that entertains instead of that informs because at a point when you touch on an issue so much and you get right down to the the bone of an issue I mean it's hard to say it again right in your own head as a as a commentator you start to think like man I said this before so in the first week I found myself a couple of times listening back to the interviews and trying to figure out what I want to tell the audience next and going I feel like I'm repeating myself but some some of this stuff needs to be repeated because the mainstream media has no problem repeating lies. Royce I'm going to keep it real with you we had a discussion this morning amongst my team we were all wondering why I hadn't been a guest on your show we thought that perhaps you know by week two then I've checked my phone I've been like did I accidentally blocked Royce's number I mean let's go I've checked email I've checked my spam folder but no invitation to be on Royce's show you know come on you're the busy one man I told I told we want you to be one of the first guests so look I got you booked in for next Friday we'll get you as the second guest of the family of friends edition no no problem oh I'm not hiding from you you know what's funny is when I thought about you being one of the first guests I started asking myself man we've had so many conversations and and I've been on the other end as as an interviewee I don't know what to ask Jason like I don't know where to begin and and so what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna go all the way back to the beginning I want to have the interview of Jason from from the young kid hour and a half all the way up to where you are now so I'm charting that out in my mind I'm putting together I'm trying to put together an epic interview for you to for you to for the shoes to be reversed for what we usually do yeah ask me all the questions that other people are afraid to I would enjoy that you're a guy that I would go there with so let let's I want to talk about Rihanna and ASAP Rocky and the cover of magazine it it it to me it gets at where we're at in this culture at every opportunity popular culture popular influencers seem to be sending out the message the black man takes a back seat to the black woman am I just being overly paranoid or is the fact Rihanna's worth all this money she's worth more than ASAP Rocky he's playing the position he should be playing well there's there's a problem with it I mean look the overall culture of black america is and I've said this before and this is much of what your show has tried to highlight and I think it's one of the most important things that we need to discuss in american culture and politics because the the circumstance of black america is much greater than your your average black community or what's going on between a sat Rocky and Rihanna this cultural narrative about black people about black america is is the the real head is the cornerstone of a of a global agenda and we've said it before but it it's worth being reiterated there is a global narrative that came after World War II and the jewish identity and the black identity are central to it and within the black identity or within the black cultural narrative women women being the head is as advantageous for authoritarianism for totalitarianism or for state surveillance for a sort of authoritarian dictatorship a new a neo authoritarian dictatorship and how well yeah Rihanna may have enough money to support you know a sat Rocky or her family or whatever crew she has around her and money may not be an issue to them but the idea that women should lead ultimately is is the the gateway or the black identity and freedom to be uh inextricably linked to the expansion of government and i i know that sounds like a mouthful but but in short what we're saying is that you know or what i'm saying and what many people in this nationalist populist movement are saying is that if if women are going to be tied to the expansion of government then by way of all men are going to be held hostage to a sort of feminine or a feminized version of culture and society and not just black women but black women first and foremost because the welfare project and the welfare state rest rest upon their their cultural identity so yeah i mean this this whole narrative that's being driven on every ad and every new blockbuster movie that comes out on the cover of og magazine will be pick pick a place it doesn't matter pick a place and the narrative is is is very succinct it's very consistent it's that mention moved to the background and let women lead and and that will all be safer or we'll all have more peace if if women are allowed to lead but we see everything but i gotta be careful how i express this because i'm referencing two women i absolutely love and adore and so i i don't want to out them but i'm just so i'm just going to frame it that way two women that i've one i've known virtually my entire life and the other one i've known last 20 25 years very successful very educated very accomplished one both of them in marriages and i know both husbands well one of the husbands is like a brother to me and and so and the other is well i got it i don't want to out anybody i was about to say something that it would out but i had one woman tell me that i'm over there for dinner and her husband's there and she basically just said if if man if he if he would and because they there's some tension in their relationship obvious tension issues and she says it out in front of him if he would just be a stedman i could carry us blah blah blah and and and i told her i i was like hey that's the equipment i said it out in front of everybody him or else like you you said that you know how he hears that he hears that like if he'd just been over and let me shove this broomstick up his rear end things would be better i go that's how that sounds to him this is crazy and then another woman you know her and her husband were here in Nashville we were out to dinner and we were talking about this whole leadership dynamic and she just told me like uh look right now we black women we got this y'all got to just kick back and let us handle this we got this and so there's a real mindset among educated black women who've had career success they have convinced themselves they're all Oprah Winfrey and if if we would just fall back they got this and it's almost like y'all blew it we got this and and there's almost no reasoning with them no it's this is absolutely absurd this this part of the narrative you know there's a dynamic between black men and black women and there's the family dynamic but there's also there's also the individual circumstance the black woman that we can't continue to dance around and it has historical precedence and i got a call a little bit of history here and and you know it wouldn't be a segment of mine if i didn't do so and i take us back to world war two often because of world war two was the turning point of so many things culturally here in america and and i've said it before but i'll say it again we tell the story of world war two as though we the the um the allied forces right the the progenitors of democracy and fairness and peace went there to fight the access powers and we beat the access powers and and they were fascist nationalist globalist racist and new genesis so on and so forth but that's that's not the way that's a gross misrepresentation of history it's a gross misrepresentation of world war two and it's a gross misrepresentation of the three leaders that have come to be the the juxtaposition of american uh democratic liberal order and that was eight off hitler told joe mousalini and and why i say that is churchill you know Winston churchill had to come to america and sign away the the colonial empire in order to fight off the german war machine you know hiller i mean the churchill was on the ropes great britain was on the ropes and they he went to rosaville and he said listen we need you we need you or we're not going to win we're going to fall and and and out of um a sort of commonwealth english commonwealth sympathy uh rosaville obliged and but but in doing so rosaville made Winston churchill sign over uh the claim of their colonial empire now here's what happened they signed over the claim to their colonial empire but in effect what they what they did was they sent all of their european monarchy philosophers and academics into our universities people got to understand this the war war two was fought between two globalist groups the allied forces were globalist and the access powers were globalist one group of globalists came out on top that group within that group of globalists the former the former authority around the world from the colonial the crown the colonial empire lost some of their stake at in the driver's seat they had to sub they had to um they had to you know bow down to the united states they needed that help but in doing so that you know the the Brits and the crown they're not idiots what they did was they sent their european monarch philosophers into our universities to run cover for the rebranding of the crown's business model and i've said it before but i'll continue to say it and i'm going to get to black women in a moment but this goes all the way back to that war and that history to the prevailing ideology from universities today they sent their marxis philosophers german austrian the list goes a french into our universities and they ran cover for the globalist the crown to rebrand its business model of drug slavery and piracy and the three ways they're covering our social justice democracy and environmentalism and the black woman is the pillar because social justice is the pillar it's not democracy it's not environmentalism though they're an apathy social justice is the the central pillar of the three-pillar social justice democracy environmentalism that's running cover for the crown why do i say they're running cover because the business model still exists all of it's just been modified to meet the narrative of the black woman that's the reality that's what's happened there's still slavery wage slavery for sure but there's still actual slavery in some places around the world really we're slaves to the fed and the monetary policy and the monetary governing bodies like the IMF that are going to bring us essential digital currency and in congla in collaboration with environmentalism and democracy they're going to tell you at home every woman that's on welfare either you're going to get your child vaccinated or you're not going to get your universal basic income so there's the slavery the drugs oh it's not cocaine it's it's not heroin it's it's not sugar like it was in the beginning it's still some of those things but now it's it's more it's it's it's grown progressed into pure dopamine social media here's the dopamine and democracy has become a corrupt corporate corporate oligarch run process so all three all three have become a bastion of the crowns original business model and when i say democracy what i'm saying is we elect officials who create the perception of a consensus a rational logical bear democratic consensus but they use it to wage piracy all around the world that's what they're doing slavery drugs piracy we'll go where we want we'll take what we want if it's the Ukraine we'll take the Ukraine and the black woman has become so disconnected from those historical roots and and and how that's taken places they take the black woman into the university and they prop her up and they tell her her hair is pretty and out of that self-doubt and and that that insecurity uh and that that history of of genuine oppression that fear of the black man dying from revolting against the slave master which is a prevalent uh psychology in the black woman she she stands there and she plays puppet she plays symbol for these for these marxist universities and all these agendas and the black man at many turns is trying to fight to stand up and say enough is enough and the entire idea of citizenship from from Los Angeles to Beijing is being compromised and undermined under the rubric and fight and dynamic between the black woman and the black man i know that was long-winded but that that's the reality no no no no long winded is not what anybody's thinking here what they're thinking was like wow that's a lot that's tremendous it's it's opening up my mind to a because again you've talked about these things and bits and pieces and so you know that's not long-winded it takes that long to unpack something that provocative and that profound and and i almost don't want to ask you a follow-up question i just kind of want you to be like you got any more you want to add to that that'll help us grasp it as we think about it this weekend yeah well we'll think about it like this many we we have to get get away from blame um and and when i say blame i don't mean that that nobody on the table has culpability we all have culpability in this project that's been run on us and at bottom the black woman is a convenient target psychologically culturally politically economically and a history that we all sort of contributed to and so you know the black man at at some point in this whole willy lynch style psychological experiment should have said you know what uh honey i love you and i love these kids and and but we're not going to live and change and and and i would rather all of us die than to live and change right the price of freedom is death maul mex said at times jeberson said it two different two different people in two different times from two different points of view but came out with the same with the same answer the same end result and and and our american citizenship our american identity is built upon an idea like this um and in a long the way our fear um our lack of faith uh our lack of of um of of understanding uh it led to this sort of uh neo neo neo subjugation that we all live under and the black woman was just uh you know she was just a uh a great tool she was just the one who was standing so stuck out of the bunch right she stuck out like a sore thumb and we propped her up we all did this and black men did it too remember it's not just a crisis of femininity it's a failure of masculinity as well and first and foremost it's a failure of masculinity and then secondarily it's a crisis of femininity and much of it has to do with very very um fundamental fundamental biological mechanisms that god did give us and one of them to reproduce one of them to have that that sort of sexual lust right that that appetite for for sexual uh for sexual contact and intimacy and and uh companionship um that's a very very old biological program and it's being run on us now and it's not just black men in effect this entire feminization of society of the western world of modern society writ large is to um to tamper the threat of revolution because women are slow to revolt they're slow to violence they're slow to they're slow to pick up arms they're they're much more agreeable they're much more amenable it's easier to convince them to take a deal that they otherwise maybe shouldn't take the rational and logical thought and that's what women have done and nobody better than black women i mean think about it in brazil they're bringing another uh global example in brazil the president lula president lula just announced that in order to get your universal basic income your your uh brazil government aid you got to get your kids vaccinated right i mean that's a deal that no no man woman or child with any concept of citizenship should take but but you have to start from saying that we shouldn't take the welfare state as a concept to begin with um so we've been kind of crowd into the shooting gallery and and the black woman is is is the person who's leading the shepherding she's saying oh no we we have to go in here we have to get in this shooting gallery we have to stand over the target yeah x marks the spot but we need to be here in order to be safe uh in in order to survive i want to end this by bringing it back to riana and okay and i think this is a profound point in terms of watch the super bowl halftime performance and you know a lot of the music took me back to when i was younger and and you know took me back to when i used to hang out in clubs and listen all that music and so it had a nostalgic feel to it that on some levels i enjoyed just listening to the music but i also you know clearly she's lip-syncing and clearly she's not that talented of a singer she's more of a brand and an image than a super talented singer she's not Whitney Houston she's not a wreath of franklin she's not a dale and and you know riana's a knockoff of bianc\u00e9 who's not super talented who's you know a knockoff of madonna and so what i think about when i think about what you're saying in terms of how this is all orchestrated and they've done it with a lot of it with the music industry and building up influencers and stars they've eliminated the need for talent and they just need people that will go along with the program because they can put the beats they can get someone else to sing for you and they they've just eliminated the need you don't in order to be a musical star you don't have to have real talent just look at most of the rappers like carty b i mean this is not a talented even rapper and so they dumb down the music enough that they can install useful idiots and dummies who will put because again when you have real talent when you have something off you're far less controllable and when you don't have real talent you're far easier to control and that's what you know everything you're saying it's like and why they're using the woman and her insecurities you know and and makes her even more easily easier to manipulate it it just all makes sense to me that virtually all of these influences talentless insecure totally beholden to the machine that made them because take i got a buddy tech nine from kansas city he's to me clearly the most talented rapper of the last in my view the last 40 years it's just an amazing his ability to rap is on such a higher level than 99.9 percent of the guys that have made it huge in the rap business but that's intentional that the talented actually don't get put on these petal stools and platforms and the idiots do well i mean first let me let me address the first part you make a profound with the music music is a universal language and and in the choirs you know the the catholics we get a bad rap but but what i like about Catholicism is that it's the one one variation of christianni that that goes into depth about the choirs of angels and and the the principalities and and all of the the angelology that exists and and in that or in that history we we remember that satan was in charge of the music that that satan was um was a being that that was was very in that in that musically he reran the choirs the the musical choirs in heaven before his fall and and we see that music has that sort of universal power to it both positively and negatively and so our music being dumbed down is is not a casual thing by any means and and i think you make a great point about the the the lack of need for real genuine talent and and what it signals is this sort of digital digitalization of of our society right music is is a canary in the coal mine no pun intended it's a canary in the coal mine for a digitalized culture and and it does take away the need for real genuine talent and it does obscure the value of real genuine talent and but it's it's it's part of a bigger program to to socialize sin and that's what they use music for the most is the socialization of sin you know it used to be if you walk down the street or you hung out at the local bar or you know did cocaine or or whatever the case may be you had to deal with the consequences of that of that sin and in those consequences those real world consequences you had the potential to to learn from that and come out of the other side many people in the bible went through many trials and tribulations and were victims of their own sins and then learned from that which god put in front of them to learn and came out to be great people even came out to be saints and whatnot we've taken that part away the digitalization of music has taken is a part of that socialization of sin and social media is the same way right now you can jack you can you can jerk off you don't you don't have to go down and actually buy a prostitute and have sex with her and run all of the risks that comes from hanging out in places where you pick up prostitutes or what happens when you have sex with a prostitute there used to be something that you can learn from that there used to be something that you could learn from going down and and and becoming an alcoholic or so on and so forth now you got you got Pornhub you got Tinder you got the dopamine of getting red lights on your phone from your social media app um you got you got musicians and and people who have become watered down versions of of the idols that we never should have worshiped in the first place if that makes sense right we never should have worshiped Marvin Gaye the way we did in the first place but at least he actually had talent at least he actually could sing at least he actually could play the instruments he understood the music we never should have worshiped him the way we did now we've started to worship people who can't do one tenth of what he's done and in that way you can see that we're in a a dark pit um morally ethically culturally Royce uh once again we'll end with you telling everybody the details on your
