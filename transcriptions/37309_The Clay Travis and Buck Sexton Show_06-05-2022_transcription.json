    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome in everybody to the Thursday edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show We are racked and stacked just to give you sense of where this Where this is going today we have senator Ron Johnson of Wisconsin joining us on the program Dana Perino a Fox News. It's fantastic everybody likes Dana Perino. She is fantastic everyone loves Dana Priya Cash Patel friend of mine former senior Trump administration national security official With an exclusive for us that has to do with whether we'll actually ever get to the truth of the Russia collusion lies Cash was the acting chief of staff for the secretary of defense in the Trump administration Hope we join us later on the program to And also got also got more on the economy rough day in the stock market clay. How you doing over there buddy? You all right? We gonna have to do six hours a radio a day. I'm getting roughed up in the market right now It's not good. Yeah, not not well as we speak by the way The Dow is down over a thousand points Which is not a good day and by the way, but the one thing you could point to if you are a Biden supporter is That the stock market has not been a disaster If you're but So much for that one. I knew smug Democrats a year ago right around now we're saying oh Biden economy is not gonna be good because the stalker You know and they were making jokes because the stock market was actually doing pretty well so much for that one Oh, and also inflation of the highest it's been in 40 years. So we'll talk about the economy more on the border crisis the the climate advisor to clay will discuss that just to give you a sense of Some people know there are things that really set me off people who speak on their phones in public places on speakerphone Like there's no one else there like I'm in a crowded restaurant. I'm just gonna speak up. I lose my mind like I I definitely Don't handle that well, but people who in government think that endless regulations and harassment In this case around Appliances is a good idea. You know your refrigerator has to be compliant with 50 new rules or else Yeah, we'll talk about that But I want to start with with a basic premise here And it is one that I think is gonna have a major effect and clay and I've been discussing this on air with you and and off Aralon a major effect on the midterm election, but we got to make sure everyone's clear on it the Democrats have betrayed kids They've made decisions that have really hurt Kids all across the country now we can and and we will continue to talk about the issue Abortion Roe versus Wade and the the decades-long moral stain on our country from that I'm actually not even speaking about that specifically right now. Well that certainly comes into the equation But they've betrayed kids with the indoctrination of them from CRT as we know and trans identity agenda for very Young kids and now clay the one that I think is the most because people are gonna argue on those a whole lot Right, so that's what I mean by we'll continue to talk about those issues We'll can you talk about abortion? We'll continue to talk about you know the fight for life and also the fight for Non indoctrination of kids in school this piece in the New York Times you and I are both reading this this morning on school closures is Absolutely Devastating because this is no longer in the realm of oh, we're gonna make an argument. They're gonna make an argument This is now we have the data. We have studies. We have test scores We have results and the and the quick summary of this is Democrats Overwhelmingly push for and put aside I might even talk about the second semester. You could call it of 2020 I'll give that one a pass for people were scared. It was early. We didn't know as much Starting in the fall of 2020 when Florida was open fall of 2020 going into that election and then Certainly in 2021 We had more than enough data to know the following things were true children were at no real risk from COVID Children were not a major source of spread of COVID Children were going to be dramatically harmed socially developmentally by this by the school closures Democrat on claves Democrat blue cities and states were much worse off with this than ever wear everywhere else clay top to bottom School closures were wrong and disastrous and the Democrats need to be made to own this Yeah, if I could go back in time buck and get Trump to focus on one thing that I think was Wildly underplayed in the 2020 presidential election he should have gone all in on every school needs to be back open and Unfortunately because I live in a red state in a red county in a red state My kids went back to school in early August of 2020 with no issues But the New York Times finally getting around to covering this after two years reading it this morning We talked about this buck and I've known and been talking about it really since the summer of 2020 because I I talked to a bunch of different teachers who were in disadvantaged schools, however, you want to quantify it and they were talking about they had kids who were studying for AP exams and They said well, we'll just go remote in the in the summer We'll be able to talk to everybody that way and I was talking to an AP history teacher at actually a wedding and He was discussing the fact that his kids were having to drive to McDonald's parking lots and Sit in the McDonald's parking lot to be able to get on Wi-Fi and that was if they had access to being able to get to the McDonald's and What rapidly should have become? Crystal clear to anyone out there was one remote learning is an oxymoron. It doesn't actually work and to Even for remote learning it is a privileged Process to have a laptop and a workable Wi-Fi and an adult Supervisory figure who can get you on the computer and so the party of equity. I mean it's it's a astounding irony the party that claimed that it was so focused on equity in the wake of George Floyd and Abandoned equality ended up with the least equitable policy in the 21st century and in most of our lives and young minority underprivileged kids Overwhelmingly bore the brunt of schools not being open and this is a quote from Thomas Cain who wrote and a Massive Harvard study on the futility of remote learning. He said First of all the data showed that low-income students in particular black and Latino students fell farther behind over the past two years Relative to students who are high-income white or Asian and here's a direct quote from Thomas Cain This will probably be the largest increase in educational educational inequity in a generation Democrats caused that and their teachers unions and their politicians and Everybody who helped to make this policy happen buck. This is why this election has to be a reckoning There have to be consequences for the biggest public policy failure of our lives most of us or What's the point of an election at all? There has to be a red wave to punish these people. There are two areas that I want to make sure that we we don't Forget either in all of this because sure you and I sat here together for many months talking about how as soon as they look at the numbers You're gonna find out. I mean high poverty schools They said this and this is in the Harvard University study I think that you were referencing clay from that New York Times piece almost 14 weeks of learning loss Yeah, from remote. It's meeting like it's almost like kids just weren't in school for you know a third of the school year let's call it right I mean roughly and Beyond that or whatever the actual weeks add up to Beyond that the the whole premise of this was that there would be a Tendant benefit right that there was so it was weird because everyone knew this was gonna be bad for kids at some level It was worse than the lib said it would be it was worse than the Democrats said it would be but they also Said well, this is a necessary thing for safety We're the serious people we need better filters in school. They had they've had huge sums of money have gone toward COVID You know COVID proofing and COVID assistance in the school system I'd be very curious to know what that money was actually spent on but the part of this that so that's so harprying We have the data on learning loss, which is catastrophic for particularly low-income Black and Latino students young students who from the school system is so essential so the learning loss was already behind buck Let's be clear about that They were already behind and then we just made it so much worse as a country So it was worse than anticipated by the Democrats and then on top of this the benefit of doing this Was zero. Yeah, that's the part that everyone has to the school closures did not save any lives The school closures did not stop COVID did not flatten the curve did not protect children from getting COVID This was all a self-inflicted wound and some of us saw it and the Democrats Shouted us down and stomped their feet and the teachers union thugs Mobilized and the commissar Randy wine garden push for this they were as wrong as can be on all counts clay Yeah, and this is where we need you moms We talk about the suburban moms and how many of you are swing voters as a group This is where we need you to mobilize I Mean this there need to be severe consequences These teachers unions and these democratic politicians They made you in addition to the fact that a lot of you have jobs and have Responsibilities that you rely on school to help you They made you wear all of these hats and they told you you were doing it to protect the safety of kids And they were a hundred percent wrong What should happen when somebody gives you advice and is one hundred percent wrong and Your children suffer as a result from it. There have to be consequences And that's why moms out there the suburban mom community in particular You guys need to be talking you need to be grabbing some of these clips from this show You need to be sharing some of these articles you were lied to and the people who lied to you are now saying things buck Like oh, how could we have ever known that this was going to happen? Well, we didn't know it was going to be this bad That those are lies by the summer of 2020 But you and I know because we were arguing this the data was abundantly clear Kids needed to be back in school. Look at what Ron DeSantis did look at what a lot of red state governors did in terms of getting their kids back in school in August and September of 2020 and If your kids were not back in school, it's because Democrat politicians failed you They didn't look at the data and there have to be consequences this is the entire purpose of a democracy we reward or punish politicians based on the judgment and the decisions that they make and Overwhelmingly blue city blue states Democrat politicians and the teacher union cronies that they worked with Failed all of America's kids. So can I just say it because you're pointing about this clay? I I one thing I do like about Twitter for us is that we get to create We have created an archive of what we thought at different times people don't have to take You know take our word for they can go back and look it's on the end You can just google it. You don't have to be on Twitter So I just need to check to see on August 14th of 2020 ABC News, right big important news organization Tweeted this the US attempt to reopen schools has turned into a slow-motion train wreck With at least 2,400 students and staff infected with COVID-19 2,400 people got COVID who cares right it was crazy. I responded to this I'm not an epi-bbiologist. I'm not a doctor Put this out. This is less than one in 20,000 public school students in America for everybody out there who isn't a lockdown hysteric 99.99% of infected students will barely have symptoms if any ABC News is a joke you knew this I knew this we were saying this summer 2020 why didn't the Democrats know this? They did they did and they should have if they didn't and buck to your point on the tweets that you were sending out then I Don't know how I could have been any more clear I was intentionally taking pictures people can go back and look in the early August of 2020 of my kids going to school and Look every parent knows that kids matter more than anything So the way that I would say not only am I telling you that all kids need to be back in school I'm taking my own kids to school I'm walking them to school this morning in early August in 2020 Because it's important for kids to be back in school. I'm not just telling you this I'm living it with my own life and There need to be in last year buck right after we started we're coming up on the one-year anniversary of of Clay and Buck We appreciate everybody listening But I went and spoke over the mask mandate which was a further failure of the of Democrat politicians mask made no difference When they finally open back up schools and let your kids go to school Do you know what they made them do for over a year and still in some cities in America right now kids are being forced to wear masks? You know what the data overwhelmingly shows about kids wearing masks doesn't protect anyone and it leads to worse educational outcomes Because kids can't communicate or understand particularly young kids And so I get I get still so fired up about this because I am still so furious That our politicians did this to our kids I don't know when I'm ever gonna get over it But the only way I think you get over a failure like this is a reckoning of an election which is almost exactly Six months from now suburban moms listen to us grab this clip share all this data Talk to your friends and make a reality of the red wave of holding Democrats responsible for the consequences of their actions Speaking of consequences of actions by the way buck Inflation continues to soar overall interest rates are going up people are getting Complicated ideas about what they should be doing and shouldn't be doing as it comes to the biggest investments of most of our lives Which is our homes?

Republican turnout increased by 13% since the 2018 midterms in Ohio They had Republicans did Nearly 700,000 more Primary voters than Democrats. Why is that significant? It's about enthusiasm and I know it was a real battle on the Republican side in the Senate But Democrats only got 32% of the overall vote in Ohio I mean I just think about this if if someone told me hey you have to go stand in voting and a voting line for six hours But if you vote you don't ever have to wear a mask again anywhere Clay I would get out a little camping chair. I might marsh roast some marshmallows whatever I'd be out there all six hours, man. I'm motivated a hundred percent If your cell phone service is with T mobile AT&T of Verizon You're paying too much every month for the same quality of service that pure talk and provide you with much better customer service and Pure talk uses the same towers and network as one of those three companies look I wish I was allowed to tell you which one but I can't but trust me on this you can switch to pure talk clay son is on pure talk He absolutely loves it and you can save 50% or more every month pure talk provides great quality service and Excellent customer service across the board keep your phone keep yourself a number if you want when you switch over to pure talk You'll be difference the money you're saving it takes all the ten minutes to switch over from your cell phone right now dial pound 250 and say clay and buck you'll save an additional 50% off your first month You can literally be switched over to pure talk service in less than ten minutes from your phone right now dial pound 250 say clay and buck pure talk is simply smarter wireless Welcome back into the clay Travis and Buck Sexton show Biden had kind of a kind of a doozy of a moment yesterday it's I Don't know at some point you feel like you're caught between is it more that what is the bigger fraud? And I think you could argue this in a lot of directions That Joe Biden is of sound mind as a function of age and cognitive Atteration to be the president is that the bigger fraud that Joe Biden is an honest just you know lives down the street good guy Amtrak Joe he's actually kind of a jerk or that Joe Biden is Smart enough particularly on legal issues as somebody who was a lawyer and that a senator for 40 years To actually have something worthwhile to say on important matters of law Constitutionality jurisprudence you name it. I don't know which is the bigger fraud You can argue that in any of those realms. I think there's a there's been a constant Media campaign of dare I say disinformation clay to try to convince people that things are true about Joe Biden that are just not and This is one of those moments where he put a whole bunch of things in together and maybe maybe clay can give us a little bit of your legal analysis of Joe's legal analysis because I Don't even think Joe knows what he was trying to say on this one Here's the president on that a rovey wait leak. Oh and by the way what he calls the MAGA crowds the idea that somehow That there is no right of privacy what happens if you have state changes the law saying that children who are LGBTQ campaign classrooms with other children is that legit under the way the decisions written? What are the next things that are going to be attacked because this MAGA crowd is really the most extreme political organization That's existed in American history. Can I just say I mean? I know that he went back said in recent history. I think after that, but the MAGA crowd I guess by that he means the Republican Party He's trying to tell us this is the most extreme Republican Party because finally the Supreme Court has weighed in on what is obviously the correct Constitutional and they haven't even made the decision official the pro-life movement and then that Conservative platform has been the pro-life movement for decades and decades now. So there's nothing so should be surprising with this But kite can you explain to me? What does he even talk keeping? LGBTQ kids out of school like what does he even what does he think he's saying? I don't even know and This goes again to why I question his mental faculties to such a degree If he wants to fear monger based on this opinion that is hard because as we said Alito in his opinion specifically Says that he's not going to go after other things for instance If you really wanted to fear monger here and maybe Joe Biden will eventually fear monger better than he did there You wouldn't say gay kids are gonna get pulled out of the classroom You would say something like oh next they're going to take away your birth control something like 90% of Americans believe that birth control is fine for people to use I am one of them chances are that many of you also agree with that What is? Clear here from Joe Biden's arguments is he hasn't read the opinion himself Which is an indictment because if you're going to be commenting on this certainly as the president of the United States you should read the draft opinion and His argument doesn't make any sense there and then to go on and say that The Maga crowd is the most extreme in American history. Let's think for a minute about some of the things that have existed political party wise in American history and Also think about what the Maga crowd believes in secure borders respect for police officers putting America first Finding people with good secure safe jobs Including people in manufacturing industries that have lost their jobs overseas giving people The ability to put America first raising wages black white Asian Hispanic two levels that we haven't seen in modern history Trying to call that and I saw where he's trying to label it the ultra Magas or something. They're trying to label The clear attempt here is a desperate ploy to make Donald Trump a figure in the midterm elections To drive up Democrat turnout, but here's the problem Buck. That's the exact same campaign that Terry McAuliffe ran in Virginia And Glenn young can soundly defeated Terry McAuliffe. Do you remember that buck? We talked about this last fall when They were bringing in all the heavy hitters Barack Obama Kamala Harris if I remember coming across the Potomac River showing up for those rallies with Terry McAuliffe saying how bad things would be if Republicans took back control of the old dominion there and They tried to make Donald Trump a figure in that election and you know what happened? It didn't remotely work because he wasn't on the ballot That's now a sign of desperation six months out. I believe that's ultimately what Joe Biden is trying to do But he's doing it in a ham-handed fashion because let's be honest. He's got dementia I was reading in that political article you and I were talking about earlier the fact that he may run in 2024 Buck they said many of the rooms They can't use at the White House to do public events because they can't fit his teleprompter in it They can't have this man in that or I mean in that political article I'm a guy who likes a big TV I got to say and in New York sometimes you get that flat screen It can be tough to get it up the stairs in your walk up or whatever But when the teleprompters too big for the president, that's not good I'm gonna read that quote from Politico at some point in the show But it's talking about the fact that we may have a Trump Biden rematch and To me what Biden is trying to do is draw Trump in as a figure in this election the problem is Trump's not on the ballot That might work in 2024 and it's certainly something It'll be much debated over the next couple of years who the Republican nominee should be and whether 82 year old Joe Biden can run but I mean he is reading these attacks off of a teleprompter buck and they're still nonsensical He can't even deliver them and more important. They're just lies and let's also remember not only you you have you have two things That I think are a huge challenge for the Democrat brand right now because I know we're talking about Biden a lot And it's the midterms that are gonna determine the House the Senate and different state races Biden's not on the ballot But he's the leader of the Democrat Party right now. He is the president is the Biden regime and you look at two things that are huge Problem we talk a lot about the results, which is the most important thing same way results are the most important Single part of the discussion I think about school shutdowns right because we don't have to get into the oh, but philosophically No, no, you guys shut down the schools you hurt kids and the COVID issue was irrelevant for the kids because they either got COVID Elsewhere it didn't matter The Biden administration we look at the results, but also look at the promises for a moment You remember this clay in New York City. I mean it was embarrassing. I'll be honest It was embarrassing people were driving around and it was like World War when they finally announced for Biden It was like World War two had just ended the the abolience the joy the happiness in the streets It was oh my gosh, you know as though it was the end of dogs and cats living together mass hysteria all of a sudden We were coming together in a way. This is the Democrats obviously voted for Biden that was good a United Sissic country and normalcy return Clay they pushed to fire Huge numbers of people from their jobs for not getting a shot that most of those people didn't even need yes Thousands of people tens of thousands of people military teachers Workers in all different sorts of of government jobs. Yeah lost their employment for a shot that they didn't need it I'm just saying that they they promised to unite the country steady hand adults in the room Competency and so when you look at the promise and now the the results. I mean the gap is enormous right I mean, you know they promised me filet mignon and as and as side of bernes sauce with some asparagus I haven't even launched him obviously hungry by the way That's what I'm having when hunter gets indicted. Oh, yeah, you're gonna go with the wagyu there fancy man We'll see how it goes. I think whatever the most expensive steak Version we can find anywhere, but I like the I'll even let you get to the blue the blue cheese crust on top Or rather I'll get it because hunters not getting indicted But my point here is they shut up with a bunch of rotten eggs.

I hate to even have to save it but Even after we just teed off on how bad remote schooling was in the failures of blue state governors and blue state Democrat politicians and certainly their allies in the teachers unions I got a text during the last commercial break that one of my friends from law school who lives in the San Francisco area Her kids have to wear masks again. They brought masks back in California I know we got people listening all over the country whose kids are still having to go to school in masks and to me it just Further epitomizes. I thought your point was a go and buck. I flew this past week I was down in Orlando with my kids and I can't tell you how much better it felt in the airport to have no one wearing a mask Now I can't speak for what every other airport is like but in Nashville and in Orlando Which were the airports that I traveled in nobody had masks on? I mean virtually no a 98 99 percent no mask wearing and to your point buck if you had to go stand in line for six hours But you knew that your kids would never have to wear a mask in school again, and they currently are having to do so That's a small price to pay. I would sign up to do that in a heartbeat I would go stand in line for hours right now if you just told me I would never have to wear a mask again The people who can make this happen buck are the suburban moms because a lot of you out there Yes, we want you to vote But the people who are swing voters turn an election from a 50 50 proposition Which many of our elections these days are to make it a run at 60 40 and those suburban women are the ones that can drive the bus here And I think we got a couple of women calling in who want to talk about this right do we've got Kate in Cleveland, Ohio Kate what's on your mind Oh, hi Hi, hello. Yes, you're on air. I was I was one of those swing voters. You're talking about I am a mom of three kids Thanks. Thankfully we live in a conservative suburb of Cleveland Um that was made evident on our recent school board elections, which you guys have a lot to and um our School board and superintendent got our kids back to school as soon as possible But make no mistake march 2020 till the end of that school year was miserable for our children and for my husband and me Um in march of 2020 our director of the Ohio department of health doctor Amy actin and unelected official was given the power to close schools stores. Yep, and even our may elections Um one of her quotes was something along the lines of we suspect there at least a hundred thousand people in Ohio walking around with this virus And they don't even remember that so all I all I could think was well, then who cares who on earth cares? I can't I still I'm I'm so angry and I am still Not recovering over this these liberal um politicians they they damaged my kids and I will not forget how old are your kids So, um at that time I had an eighth grader Uh, sixth grader and eighth or greater. So now okay So you're you're similar to the ages of my kids and i'm curious when I finish the show today I'll go pick up my first grader at school Uh and there'll be tons of it's me and a lot of moms oftentimes Uh because I have a little bit of a different schedule So and a lot of the moms listen to the show where they talk and they're obviously my neighborhood super fired up I'm curious you say you live in suburban cleveland What are the conversations like in your experience kate with you and other moms? How many other swing voters are still angry about this? What sort of vibe do you get in Ohio? I'm getting i'm well As evidenced by jd van uh winning here in the yeah, I'm getting the the idea that people are pretty darn angry Yeah, I just like you know, I still try to wrap my head around it and I think how How could this have happened? How could you have kept children out of school? Yeah, I mean, I think just to give you a sense kate. I don't I don't have kids working on it. I don't have kids um And if somebody if I had children though at this point and somebody was saying that they were gonna mask my kid up And make them eat their lunch outside I would react to that the same way that someone's saying in a school system Sorry, we had to just like take the paddle to your kid because he was late today. You know what I mean? I've you does it. Yes I I think kate thanks for the call and I would just say there are millions of kates out there And if you think your voice doesn't matter You're oftentimes a hundred billion percent wrong and what other thing i've seen with a lot of people buck and even the saturday At live skit that we've played on here Uh, remember initially people were nervous to say hey, I don't know about masking I don't know about the covid shots As moms are talking more and more you're finding out that your voice is actually the majority And you need to drive this election bus you guys are the difference makers Suburban we Suburban women based on the 2020 election state-by-state if you look at it There are enough people listening to this show right now in states like arizona Nevada Pennsylvania Wisconsin That if just the people listening right now went out there and got one more person that they know To vote against these lunatic democrats That red wave is going to be glorious. We'll be surfing on it together hang 10 Amen and and again, I want everybody to vote but the suburban moms you guys that we're talking to right now You are the difference makers your social networks talk loudly Talk angrily and hold these awful politicians who failed you and your kids accountable Clay Travis and bucks extant on the front lines of truth"
