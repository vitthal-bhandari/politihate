    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast welcome everybody Thursday Edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show starts right now a lot to talk to you about today first off the the update from the Nashville school shooter Which we'll get into in a moment it seems that there is now a report at least Daily mail with this headline that the shooter was Targeting the school's head pastor. We'll discuss that in a few moments here still have not seen The manifesto still has not been released which I I disagree with I think people should be able to see what the motivations and what the Psychological derangement was based in for this this mass shooter Yeah, I was just gonna say buck I Was told it's going to be released by people who would know I Also would just say I think there may be some crazy accusations in there And so that might be one of the challenges associated with Releasing it and let me just kind of explain what I mean by that if you are a crazy person writing a manifesto And you are personally attacking other people by names I think there's some challenges in editing this thing so that you know, I think when we think a lot of times of manifesto It's like you're taking targets at you know The world has decided that it's gonna turn its back on us and we have to do this And but also there's parts in there where if there are direct personal attacks on individuals You have to figure out how to parse and parcel that out if that makes sense So I do think there's a little bit of a challenge as it would likely be the case with any mentally ill individual Trying to figure out how exactly to put that thing out there without Increasing the pain that might be involved in some of the people who are already victims if that makes sense It's an interesting idea If it's going to be released eventually, I'm not really sure what and I don't know that law enforcement is going to be in a position It's not national security sensitive information. Correct. So so redacting things isn't really in their purview And I am just I will recall that at the Pulse nightclub shooting if you remember this was the most egregious This is what a lot of us think may be happening right now to your point by the way Maybe that is what's going on. Yeah, but for a lot of us who have covered Terrorist acts mass shooting hate crimes for for many years you go back and think about Pulse nightclub they Exstowed or blacked out things, you know, they they remove things from the transcript the FBI under the Obama administration Where the guy was like I pledge my loyalty to they blanket. Well, yeah, I'm a state And then he says and I'm murdering all these people in the name of Allah like we know what the blacked out lines were but they did it anyway and Everybody remembers how both were well in and condescending and absurd that was so I just feel like there's not a lot of good faith that There need to be redactions done to a manifesto that what you're saying may be true I mean we don't know but if that were the case clay law enforcement should say there are security issues There are you know, there are people's home addresses phone numbers like we can't just put stuff in there Yeah, that's out for everybody But it's very hard for people to parse that and then think well this has nothing to do with this shooter telling everybody Why she was going to do this which is what the part of motive is that you know right now they're saying oh We don't know the motive. That's what law enforcement is stating well, and I understand a hundred billion percent buck We still don't know just to pull one out of the out of a hat here. They never told us why that Las Vegas shooter acted Right, I mean the store. I mean the guy open fire from the hotel in Vegas I don't think it concert. I don't think that's an apples to apples comparison though because he didn't leave behind A manifesto that's like this is why I did it right that we know of right? I mean that we know that to be fair that we know of yes true But we know there was a manifest this person left behind a here's why I did it manual Specifically said in a message to one of her friends that we read on this program You'll know why I did this when you read my manifesto basically wedding her friend No, right before she opened fire I mean we'll see because if it's if it is Politically highly sensitive material That's okay, and we can just by the way I don't know what's in there obviously clay doesn't know what's in there But just if we're looking at the possibilities here clay has laid out something interesting that I hadn't heard anyone really raised yet And I do think that if it's it law enforcement should say guys look there's some things in there because right now We're just being told almost like we're not able to handle as a society being able to read this correct No, there are plenty of crazy people's manifest. She is a crazy trans shooter and that her act was motivated by her Trans ideology and that because this is an inconvenient narrative for the left in this country that they will not allow that story to be told That is the fear right and but going back to Monday off air I said hey based on these details that are coming out it feels to me like this maybe a trans shooter and Ended up being true. So I would just kind of To I certainly understand why people are upset that this hasn't been released and also the more days that pass where it's not released The less attention it's going to get right. That's why they have to focus on gun control Which is the narrative right now that is predominating. That's why there's no trust here in the delay because if there is politically Politically look let's be honest politically damaging stuff in there to the left The longer they wait the sense is the less attention it will get and the less political damage it will do There should be no political cover up allowed in a situation like this whatsoever The people have a right to know to your point if it comes out and there's you know home addresses blacked out And there's an explanation of this and there's now some people won't even by the way except that they'll say I don't trust what's blacked out. They've doctored this they've removed things and I got to say I don't know That could be true as well remember the Pulse nightclub shooting showed the FBI will act like utter morons under a Democrat Administration because they were told to because of politics no question about it when they were docked at all the information from that transcript Because we all knew it wasn't even like they hit anything effectively So now there's no faith and now I think we have to see Why why the delay of so many days? Who is the authority that can come along and say all right? It's okay now for people to see this Here's a question that I think a lot of you out there would not along with if the shooter had been motivated by January 6th And a stolen election and he had written a manifesto or she had written a manifesto on that would it be out yet? It would have been the lead news story as we know every day all day since the incident without exception And if anybody told any other if anyone gave a stock update for 30 seconds before they went back to the story MSNBC would be saying they're minimizing this horrific Atrocity and it would have been leaked instantaneously to the New York Times or the Washington Post It would have been out there. Yeah, so this is why I have I honestly I have no faith in that I have no faith that there's good faith in the delay here. I have no faith in that whatsoever I if I'm proven wrong, I'll say okay. It looks like law enforcement here because we were look we praise what is good We criticize what is bad obviously beyond question those law enforcement officers You know the two with the body camps, but there were others there I feel like those guys also deserve a lot of credit did exactly the right thing moved well I had various friends from the special ops community reach out and say that they were pre one of the guys was a marine by the way One of the officers, um, they're you know, they're proud of how those guys move proud of how they how they got on target right away Went after the the threat Um, and and there was a lot of transparency in the first 24 hours from the chief of police But then it just stopped on this one issue. Yep And and that it's a lot of people. I think clay feels highly Suspicious and it does feel like there's some political fix that's in and now I guess We're I was gonna talk about the we'll talk about the gun control push got Joe Scarborough yelling about it I will actually Congressman bowman is really yelling about it yelling at uh at uh, thomas massy remember another member congress who is a Really, um, both erudite and amusing guide. I mean thomas massy is really funny and really smart Um, but we'll talk about the gun control push part of this in a second I I mentioned this at the top and we have other stories you want to talk about today as well by the way World health organization looking at shot weather Teenagers healthy teenagers and children should actually get the covid shot, but we'll lay some of this out Um coming up here after the break The nashville shooter recorded the daily mail was having private counseling sessions with the school's head pastor Before the massacre He did kill the pastor's nine-year-old daughter. We know that so it does seem that there was a personal grudge, um Effectively, you know personal uh assassination motive tied into this whole thing Um, but it could be much broader. We in terms of the ideology. We don't know what other targets There's already been discussion that there were other targets that came out the first day from the chief of police in nashville um, we don't know Uh, what they the this dispute. I mean this you would think this pastor was giving Counseling sessions to a former student of the school What could have possibly happened in her mind, right? That would then make her think that that this I mean There's nothing more monstrous than what this woman did. Nothing. Yes monstrousness So I think we have a right to know How did this person become a monster because this was truly evil and depraved in the worst way And I think that anybody who's trying to hide this from the public for reasons of of anything other than as you said individual safety Redacting information Um is really acting in a way that's uh, that's awful Maybe personal attacks just something to think about too. Um like crazy lies there could be crazy lies the manifesto for sure Yes, but I don't know how you You know, everyone knows this person is crazy and this person is dead right? So are is the idea that the police will cover up some ask you know, I mean, let's say the manifesto had some You know crazy truly crazy allegations against named individuals. I don't think anybody would Believe you know believe the allegations or you know, I just wonder Is the idea then that law enforcement keeps this stuff silent or keeps this hidden forever? It will get out eventually. I mean I was in the ci I can tell you secrets that people want to know Don't stay don't stay secret for it. Hey, look the steel dossier was all Completely made up and it was one of the most widely distributed Uh, you know investigatory Investigation investigatory materials of all time, right? So but you're you heard from good sources in the area and ever knows obviously clayl is born and raised in ashville lives in ashville So you know spokes in the area very well, you think that the manifesto will Will come out I was told that it will come out. Um and I what I have been told is that there is uh Like we know the manifesto is going to be crazy, right? This is a crazy person that there are Challenging parts of the manifesto that are crazy in ways different than you know, like the sun is not going to come up tomorrow because you know Like all the crazy things that you would expect personal things that are crazy as well. So that's what I've been told Obviously I haven't seen it. Uh, I I believe I'm always in favor of transparency I've tweeted and said on the show I want it out publicly for everybody to be able to see because I think the motivations do matter But I am told that eventually it is going to be out. I would I would just say this again clay Law enforcement should just be transparent about why they can't be transparent in this moment Yeah, and then we can judge for ourselves whether they're telling the truth at the end of this right if they are telling the truth Well, then it makes sense. Anyway Uh, look treat your feet to a pair of my slippers take advantage of the massive closeout sale going on right now My wife loves these so much She got them for all of her running buddies in different colors four layers of cushioning and reinforcement making them comfortable and durable My slippers all season two worn inside and out regularly priced at 150 bucks a pair But listen to this right now Just 25 bucks a pair right now 80 percent off These shoes these slippers are phenomenal You can go online to my pillow.com click on the radio listener square button $25 per pair my slippers while they're in stock use our names clay and buck as the promo code to get that $25 price They're so popular you can only buy 10 pairs at a time You should move quick on this deal clay and buck is the code $25 my slippers at my pillow.com you can also call 800 792 32 69 for this incredible offer Clay Travis and bucks sexton Shock up a win for team reality Look, I want to mention this uh also Going into the trans crazy mindset. I think it's important sometimes to understand The language and what is going on in the country right now So in my home state of tennessee They have passed a bill that bans so-called gender affirming care for anyone under the age of 18 Uh, and they've also said hey, you're gonna have to play on you know The teams if you're in high school, you're gonna play on the athletic teams of your birth certificate I believe kentucky Literally yesterday just passed basically the same bill west virginia just passed the bill Reta Utah. I know recently did red states all over the country are saying hey, you cannot get gender Transition surgery or treatment If you are under the age of 18, I think that's imminently rational most of these states also for instance buck Wouldn't allow you to get a tattoo You can't vote you can't even get a beer till you're 21 It doesn't seem crazy to me to say hey We're not going to allow your breast to be removed when you're 14 or 15 years old right you have to be an adult um the trans community Some parts of the trans community have decided that these laws are trans genocide And uh some of you out there. I know you're like this is all so crazy like how do we follow along? What's the logic? I think it's important to lay out the thought process here The trans community believes that if you some people in the trans community if you are not allowing them to become trans switch from man to woman woman to man whatever it is You are attempting to erase the trans community and that is in some of their minds akin to genocide If that is the belief If they are being Radicalized into the idea that you have to defend the trans world view by any means necessary because There is a cultural genocide being perpetrated against the trans community That's how some members of the trans community are describing these bans on treatments for people under 18 years old I just think it's important buck for our audience to kind of because I don't think a lot of people even understand this I'm trying to take you into their world view And why it might lead to violence if you are willing to believe that and you may already be somewhat mentally ill This is why you know there have been people suspended on twitter that that claine. I both know Um, i'm john davis for example the federalist a friend of ours does who's on tucker? I think last night of the night before talking about this Just for pointing out that there is a trans day of vengeance That is what they are calling it by the way. Yes this weekend And on the flyer. I believe there's some mention of stopping the trans genocide. Yes This is a total fabrication. This is look Scared is almost like a collective mental illness. I mean this notion that there's a trans genocide is completely insane Truly clinically insane. It is based on no factual data whatsoever Unless you start to understand what the narrative is which is that if you have a a woman who believes that she's a man And you refuse to just go along with that in every every sense Everything sports life work everything you are erasing that is the terminology that they use that person And therefore that erasure constitutes an act of genocide the mass Elimination and slaughter of a people based upon an immutable characteristic That is the left rhetoric. That's there. That's their idea buck And if you are already maybe a little bit mentally unstable And you buy into that rhetoric of genocide It may not be shocking that you would be willing to engage in acts of violence if you believe that your people The trans community is effectively being erased. I think that's a toxic idea, but it's one that Maybe unfortunately quite a few trans people are willing to buy into Every hour of every business day matters to the small business owner time is money, right? Get refunds dot com gets that that's why they've made it easier than ever to apply for the employee retention credit or erc This is the tax refund program from the irs for qualifying businesses Go to get refunds dot com to get started and in less than eight minutes See if your business qualifies for erc assistance Your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund about the $26,000 per employee Kept on payroll during covid 19 get refunds dot com has already helped clients claim over $3 billion in payroll tax refunds through the erc They may well be able to help your business too.

What is the national conversation about or around gun violence focusing on As you know Every time uh, there's an incident. There's a a mass uh mass casually mass murder incident involving a firearm the immediate response of the democrats is a version of Gun control what I think is interesting is it changes based upon Whatever they've been told for the most recently is the thing that has to be addressed so it may be it'll be universal background checks and then you'll wait another you know another year And then it will actually be an assault rifle ban and then you'll wait another year and then it'll be You know, I don't know any any number of things Bumpstock ban pistol brace ban uh magazine limitations All kinds of things and sometimes repar- I mentioned bump stock ban sometimes republicans go along with some of this stuff too So there was an exchange in congress That's uh getting a lot of attention And actually before we go to that joe scarborough former republican member of congress I we should probably find i'm sure if you went back into the early 2000s There are videos of joe scarborough and msmbc like You know mola and la bei I love my I love my rifles and shotguns, you know, whatever it's it's it's as no No principles the panhandle buck. I just I can't get over this for anybody who's ever been to the panhandle of florida it is One of the greatest places in the south, but it's basically alabama on the beach Right it could not be more of a red state bastion. This is not tampa This is not jaxonville Right like he could have repped parts of florida that are kind of middle of the road Locations, although the whole state of florida. Thankfully he's basically red now But this is the reddest of the red right if you ever watched the election results come in We're still on central time in the panhandle and I say we because i've got a place down there and absolutely love it Uh, we're still on central time and all of the votes come rolling in for republicans in that final hour of the the votes being in there So he reps the reddest place in america. It's not just he was a congressman buck He repped the heart and soul of the scc country, right? This is basically south alabama Look at this from the floridaian perspective play. What do you call one who? Comes from the panhandle. Hey panhandle I don't think you'd want to call him panhandlers because that's not necessarily a Yeah, i'm just putting out there necessarily a uh, uh, positive That's a different thing. So there must be some term that we have well we some people call it l.a For lower alabama even though it's technically like again if you're if you're a little bit of a Knock nerd there's a great story. It's probably the worst decision ever made by the state of alabama Buck they had the chance to buy florida tried to sell them the panhandle right and for those of you out there like what does panhandle mean? It looks like the handle of a pan because the state of florida Like dips down but there's this little part of the handle that is right there directly beneath alabama by and large And alabama ended up not being able to get the bill passed in their state legislature to buy this area And as a result florida keeps all this gorgeous Golf coast beach that wraps right around underneath now There's a little bit of alabama if you ever been to orange beach or gulf shores Uh, it's beautiful same beaches, but it's at the tail end of alabama But most of it is now in florida and so uh, and so we're panhandle it's a good point It's it's god's country but la is sometimes what it's called for lower alabama because that's basically what it is So we got on this rant because of joe scarborough who's on his own rant Over how gun control is so important that we should get rid of the philabuster over this one play for You look at voting rights You look at guns You look at abortion you look at all of these things and i must say i've always been a strong believer And uh the philabuster who always loved the idea that the house is hot The senate cools things down no more it doesn't work When when six percent of americans Can allow the continued proliferation of guns without background checks and the killing of children It's time to get rid of the philabuster The radical minority can hide behind the philabuster and do it enough is enough Get rid of the philabuster so we could have universal background checks also pretend that the Conservative base is not opposed to the killing of children. This is the worst Kind of demagoguery you will ever come across in american politics It is the ugliest the most dishonest and the stupidest but joe scarborough He is a firm believer in whatever puts more money in joe scarborough's bank account and whatever gets more democrats to clap for him As he pretends to be a centrist or whatever this this really might be the most frustrating issue to me Now that we've kind of come through covid and everybody's acknowledged In default status that all the people who wanted lockdowns and masks and everything else that they were basically wrong including covid shot Vaccination they won't say it publicly, but they're just now This is how it ends right they just pretend that they never argued it and just kind of vanish It's kind of like how defund the police vanished buck there wasn't some massive Recognition and acknowledgement in the democrat party that they anybody who'd ever argued for defund the police was an imbecile It was just they tried to start saying oh, we never really said that and it just kind of vanishes from the public discourse the media helps them I have not heard Any Thing that is that has been said that would stop What happened in my hometown of national from happening? Right, and this is why it's a frustrating political argument Because people just scream like this Jamal Bowman in the capital There is no tangible act that can be pointed to that would change this now I actually give never done this on the show. I don't think randy wine garden credit Because she said I don't basically don't want there to be guns anywhere in a country We have to seize them all they shouldn't exist anymore. I don't agree with that But randy in her heart honest. She's full communist and so she'll say it. She'll say she'll go full commie and say it Loud take all the guns all the guns for all the argument Yeah, take everybody's guns confiscate them the government should melt them all down. They shouldn't exist If that's your argument, I don't agree with it But I respect that you're willing to make that argument But most democrats are pretending that they aren't in favor of that And they're meanwhile arguing something that would have no impact whatsoever on the shootings and really buck the real conversation we should be having is What kind of medication was this trans person on? And how much did that create Uh a a sort of fertile opportunity for her to go crazy did it at all I'd be nervous about that given how many millions of people are on different transgender drugs all over this country And how do those interact potentially with other mental illness drugs and buck How many trans people are being radicalized over this idea that there is a genocide being perpetrated against them because A lot of decent humans all over this country have risen up and said hey We shouldn't be mutilating 14 year old bodies We should at least wait till they become adults to have these gender changing surgeries Which is not a radical proposition at all. It's actually common sense only the right is ever held responsible for the horrific and maniacal acts of one individual in a country 330 million people even if the connection is very tenuous And even if it's a stretch. I mean, but this is what they do all the time, right? This is This is democrats. This is the the unfortunate political game. They they've always played, you know, it's Um, you know, they they blamed remember they blamed sarah palin for gatty giffords, right? I mean, this is this is who they this is who they are Politically, they'll find some way to make it your fault you who vote republican You who are conservative are responsible for the acts of any individual that is even right of center But on the left You know the the BLM activist who murdered five dallas police officers after years of democrats walking around saying that young black men were being murdered Relentlessly and without consequence by police Oh, that wasn't the result of any democrat rhetoric. No, that had nothing to do with it It's even worse than that with this case buck because not only is it clear that this crazy trans person was responsible They're now arguing Republican some are Republicans are responsible also for the actions of a crazy trans person who clearly was not even remotely conservative or right of center for motivating her To even be able or willing to consider this and allowing her to be able to go out and buy a gun with which this Murders world were used and occurred right so because of the arguing even for the left Genesize responsible. Yeah, right the fake genocide that they're talking about Is the basis for the belief that led to this person and do it and the problem then is the people who have created the pretense of the fake genocide Or rather the the belief in some that there's a fake genocide going on. Yeah That's what msnbc and cnn are trying to argue right now Which is again while we started the show by saying the release of the manifesto is important Let's uh, maybe top of the next hour. We should get into this the gun control argument by jamaal bowman member of congress with tom It's a really interesting exchange that everybody should hear. Sorry Yeah asset managers names you know they're using your retirement funds to further their esg agenda last year state Treasures across the nations in a message to stop playing politics with our pensions by divesting five billion dollars from these companies 25 states are now suing to block esg nonsense from endangering your retirement Republicans on capital hill recently passed a bill blocking the biden administration from allowing huge asset managers From using your hard-earned money to further their esg agenda But while conservatives in the house and senate have your back last week President biden used his veto pin to kill the bill senator joe manchin and democrat who voted to block esg investing Blasted biden's veto is infuriating charged. It is putting a quote radical and progressive agenda ahead of the country's needs Uh, these firms have a fiduciary due to to maximize returns They should be held to account for playing politics with our pensions and doing it without our consent So learn how consumers research is protecting all of us from these woke investment firms go to consumers research.org That's consumers research dot org paid for by consumers research Download and use the new clay and buck ass listen to the program live catch up on any part of the show you might have missed Find every podcast as they're released and listen find the clay and buck app in your app store and make it part of your day Block did you see this? I think we got to talk about it The w ho are good friends at the world health organization They have now issued recommendation and I know many of you out there are going to be furious about this Saying healthy kids and teenagers Don't need to get the kovat shot so after years of Of you know, for instance every college in america Not only requiring you to get the kovat shot to be able to go to school But also requiring many of them you to get the kovat booster shot And after many of those good mask wearing left-wing lunatics out there dragged to their two and three and four-year-old kids To go get the kovat shot as soon as it was available the world health organization now says actually kovat shots not really necessary at all for young healthy people you know who that sounds like Clay travison buck sexton show where we are of course flagged for misinformation for pointing all this out based on the data and the analytics what I wonder buck is Will the cdc under joe biden ever acknowledge this recommendation or even be willing to admit that it exists and Will there even be any media out there that are willing to press the biden administration on this at all Because they have been screaming that kids need to get the kovat shot for years now I I can't just remind me of arguments that I was making before we even teamed up clay where um I would I would say that if you really thought Um, you know the way that these people do About a whole range of things like their kids getting kovat and and yeah the chance of them dying from kovat For example, if you believe that it was too much of a risk then you should not let your kids go outside ever ever Period right sure. It certainly shouldn't let him ever swim Yeah, swimming is like the most dangerous thing kids do can't go in a pool not allowed to use the bathtub I mean a whole range of things can't ever do it. Sorry. Sorry You have a one in a million chance of dying from something if you're going to worry about one in a million chances You should never and honestly even your home is kind of dangerous. Yep your stairs You slip electrocution, you know, it gets really scary out there Instead of being A person of integrity and honesty and decency Anthony fauci and debra bergs and the rest of them Decided to just exploit those fears to give because when people are terrified You know that they want to believe that their fears are reasonable and they want someone to allay their fears And instead of being honest with them and saying your fears are irrational stop being crazy Bergs and essence. Oh, yes, you should be so scared. You this is where it took on a religious element You should be terrified of kovat. You must mask all the time We will protect you listen to us. The honest answer would have been you're gonna get kovat We're all gonna get kovat and unless you're really old and your immune system is such that you're at risk from anything anyway You'll be okay probably I just think it's wild buck because three years ago If you argued your kids didn't need to wear a mask You were trying to kill everyone Right. I mean, that's what I argued at my school board biden administration department of justice investigates everybody who's speaking at the school board Remember that was what they were doing in the national area Uh, and now we've moved from certainly the idea that kids need to wear masks is laughably ridiculous Even for many left wingers out there. They now are not making their kids wear masks They want to admit that they were imbeciles, but we've taken the next step of not only The kids not need to wear masks But also they don't even need to get the kovat shot at all because kovat is of such low risk to them But you were more likely To die in a car accident Driving your kids to school your kids were by far Then they ever were to have any negative impact from kovat think about how crazy that is And i've been saying it for years and I think a lot of people now have started recognize it to your point on one in a million Chances If you drive your kids to school your kids are more likely to die In the car ride to school than they are Ever from kovat. I think it's I think kovat has a a very important political lesson and it's We could we with a virus that was effectively a 0.02 fatality rate something like that Spanish flu Just just by way of comparison is estimated to be more like 5 Fatality rate. Yeah, and people were dying. Yes, I was going to say there were and it was mostly people 20 to 40 who were dying Actually older people were doing okay with it very young people were doing better with it by the numbers They could kill anybody But 5 fatality rate, okay, and and we remember they're all there were the masks societies and all this stuff that And what they figured out was it actually didn't do anything but people insisted Um We got a taste of how quickly america could actually turn into a totalitarian society And I know that sounds That sounds a little extreme But we did all the things we did with a 0.02 fatality rate virus that we all ended up getting anyway Imagine if the fatality rate was 5 percent Yeah, 10 percent or more That I mean fauci would be would be king of the earth threatening to nuke anybody who said a word You know of criticism against him. That's where we would have been if things had gotten much much worse. So freedom ain't free clay No doubt by the way, one of our vip e-mailers wrote in you were asking what are the pan handlers call themselves and kendra here is right Um, we affectionately call ourselves on the panhandle of florida. We say it's the redneck riviera So For people out there and a lot of rednecks from the south east made this their beach of choice So it's the red is the noun for those from the panhandle You don't understand like that's it is fine. You can call the redneck riviera, but people from there are called what? I think you'd have to say panhandle even though it's not necessarily a great way to do it and i love it up there i think it's right Clay Travis and buck sexton on the front lines of truth You"
