    "text": " The testosterone kind of had this effect on me where with every step that I took it would feel good for a short amount of time. But then eventually it's like those same feelings come back up. There's the initial euphoria that you go through. I change my gender and everything's going to be wonderful. It was euphoric. I was like, the feeling I had when I started living as a man was I was free. I was finally who I should have been all along. But that euphoria was short-lived. My mental health just got worse. My ability to socialize just got worse. I felt so disconnected from myself. I started using drugs and alcohol as a crutch and I was just a total disaster. And the effects of the testosterone on my mental health specifically just made everything ten million times worse. I lost my job. I was homeless. I was laying in a park in Long Beach, California in a pile of on it trying to get my life back. I went down the street to a friend's house and attempted to overdose on cocaine because I was just done. I had blood into the lie. And it almost took my life. No research has ever shown that gender affirmative care hormone therapy or cross-sex surgery reduces the risk of suicide where indeed improves mental health outcomes of any kind over the long term. However, there is some evidence to suggest the opposite. Children who receive trans treatment are more likely to kill themselves. One comprehensive 30-year study in Sweden that captured almost the entire population of surgically reassigned transgender individuals in 1973 to 2003 showed that post-operative transgenders were over 19 times more likely to kill themselves than the general population. But that hasn't stopped physicians from pushing for more. Okay, welcome. It's Friday, 9 September the year of our 2022. We got a packed show. We've got MTG is going to join us a little later. Of course, we're going to have Naomi Wolf. Also, we're going to go to London Live and Sweden Live, the big good vote on Sunday for the Swedish Democrats. Greta Thunberg has thrown in hard. We're going to have Dave Walsh, Dave Bratt, White House put out a new economic policy plan today that they're going to pitch between now and November 8th or 8 November. We're going to cover it all, but we're going to start with something. The Great Tucker Carlson is doing a several hour special on the Fox Nation. I think they're online apparatus. One of the people that's going to profile, I think, is Brandon Showwauler from the Christian Post. We've been honored to have on here about the Boston Showmen Hospital and many other things. Also, Terry Schilling from American Principles Project. The reason is that this is becoming not just a major issue for this nation, but it's obviously going to have a big impact on 8 November. This is our focus every day here is about a massive victory. So Brandon, I want to bring you first. First, tell us about this special. When Tucker puts his focus on something and now he's got that online platformer with Fox, these specials he does, these documentaries he does are really amazing. So walk us through, when is this going to play? What's it going to be about and what's your role in it? Yes, he's got a great documentary out now on Fox Nation called Transgressive the Cult of Confusion. And it's a deep dive into the horror of transing children, specifically the indoctrination that happens in the schools and that how it sort of is the pipeline to this medical experimentation that's going on with the hormone blockers, cross sex hormones, and then these disfiguring surgeries. It's pretty shocking and it's a gut punch. It's very visceral. But he sort of walks through the stages of how this all happens. The subtitle of the film is the cult of confusion. So it's cult indoctrination, which is what happens and our institutions have been gripped with this feverish cult under the cult of gender. And it's not overstating it. It's not hyperbole to say that because of how many families that I've profiled in my reporting at the Christian Post. I also commentate a little bit on the complete death of medical ethics and how they've normalized removing physically healthy body parts from vulnerable people. And under what standard is that saying? I mean, it doesn't magically become medically ethical to sterilize a child just because you wrap it in a rainbow flag or cutting off people's body parts. I mean, I really recommend people go and subscribe to Fox Nation and see it. It's pretty shocking. I'm getting messages today from grateful parents who are just weeping with gratitude that they feel seen and heard because of this crime, this medical scandal that's being perpetrated on so many young people. Here's what I understand. Given this, if you couple this, particularly the institutions we're talking about it and you're reporting, you're talking Boston Children's Hospital, one of the most revered institutions in the world. You know, we also have- Where does this start at? Yeah, Yale University. You have the MIT Technology Review. These are the major institutions kind of in the country. You couple that with what people saw on the COVID, the masking, the vaccinations for children, all of a sudden you have an institutional crisis, at least with kind of common sense Americans that have always just trusted this. When did this cult, when did it actually start? What were the seeds? Because to be honest, most people that haven't followed this closely, it's kind of hit you like in the last year, the last six or eight months that like, what is going on here? Well, it's so pervasive at these major institutions. This is different than whatever these lap dances do with these at these libraries, which is bad enough and trust me, very institutional, but here you're talking about the major medical institutions in the country, sir. Well, as far as I can tell, there are people that have had these surgeries done even many years ago, but it was very sparse and kind of underground. This was not a widely accepted practice in medical institutions. But the first documented case report that I'm aware of, and I was made aware of this by Dr. Michael Laidlaw, who's an endocrinologist that is featured in Tucker's film. He showed me the case report. I think back, it was 1998, I believe, where it was a Dutch psychologist or a psychiatrist working together with an endocrinologist decided to use a puberty blocker drug. I think it was Triptorellum on a patient that was a minor in order to prevent puberty because the idea was that this puberty process was going to be too traumatic for the patient to endure. That's become known as the Dutch protocol. Well, in Boston, the first pediatric gender clinic opened in 2006 or seven, I believe, and it just sort of grew from a wildfire. It's spread ever since that time. So in the last 15 years, but especially in the last five to 10, it's just exploded. And every children's hospital is clamoring to have a gender clinic. And if you count Planned Parenthood locations, we've got hundreds of gender clinics now dotting the American landscape because they're passing testosterone out like candy. It's just absolutely insane how this experimental medicalization has been normalized within the medical system, within the American Academy of Health. Within the American Academy of Pediatrics, within the Endocrine Society, the activists have captured all of the professional organizations with brutal speed. Meanwhile, the nations of the world, Europe and Europe, like Sweden and Finland and the UK, they're starting to move away from this treatment protocol. Australia, it's bad. Canada's the worst, I think. But when you infuse this with big pharma money and the medical industrial complex wealth and the activist fervor that is gestated within all those institutions, you've got a recipe for disaster. And we don't really know how many young people are being permanently maimed into disfigures, but we're looking at very high numbers. According to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons, the number of biological females who underwent gender surgeries from 2016 to 2017 quadrupled. And the numbers have only risen ever since. It's one of the worst medical scandals of all time in my estimation. And I think we're only now starting to see some of the carnage from it. Terry, I want to bring Terry Schilling in from American principal Friday. We have Terry, the amazing new ad on abortion and the movement there and how that's going to be a big factor in November 8. But I got to ask you about this, Terry. You're one of the first guys where we talked about this. How did this, he just said that with rapid fire, these radicals took over the institutions. But how did these institutions that are supposed to know medicine and psychology, how are they taken over so quickly? Because this is now, this is not marginal. This is now a central issue in American cultural and societal life, and it's going to have to be addressed politically. How did this happen so quickly, sir? Well, Steve, frankly, I realize it seems like it was taken over so quickly, but this has been something that progressives have been trying to do since the 60s and 50s and 70s. Right. I mean, they infiltrated the American Psychological Association. They changed the DSM to reclassify homosexuality and then they reclassified gender identity disorder to be gender dysphoria. But this has been a slow march over the last 50, 60 years. So it seems rapid because the rise in transgender children and all this crazy treatment has really exploded, but it was a long time coming. And basically, our colleges and doctorate and children, our kids, into a progressive worldview. Right? This is what I mean by a progressive worldview is not an administrative state worldview. It's more you can become your own God. We need to break through all institutions, all barriers to your freedom. Otherwise, you won't be able to truly flourish and gender is one of those. Right? And so that's how this all came to be is our colleges change the way Americans think. And those are elites. Those are the people that went into these medical fields and then went into these psychiatric fields. And they took over these associations. So it was a long march. And but once once you build up critical mass, things happen very quickly. Brandon, I want to go back to your reporting on the on the Boston Children's Hospital, which has just been extraordinary. Now they're out once again. And I think so with others, I think that rewards up to 50,000 bucks. Nothing's come forward, but they continue to go to the mainstream media and saying they were getting phone calls. They're getting threats. They're getting all this. And it's this terrible right wing Christians at the Christian Post. All these other people that are smearing us and lying about us. Has anybody come back on any media, sir, with all the footnotes you had and all the documentation head, has anybody at all come back and been able to question something that you would either have to correct or pull down on your reporting? Brandon show Walter. No, because the links are right there. They can read it for themselves. Boston Children's Hospital. They did 65 double mastectomies on minor girls from 2017 and 2020. Don't take the Christian Post's word for it. Just read the Journal of Clinical Medicine on page three. Just look at the data table. They can't dispute the cold hard facts. These are the gender clinicians and the doctors talking amongst themselves. And with respect to the bomb threat and all of the other supposed threats that these Children's Hospitals are saying they're getting. Look, I'll be the first to condemn any violent threat that anyone makes, but my default assumption is they're making up a narrative. Look, if it's really happening, I condemn it. But it's just the mass media, the corporate press is the protection racket around these institutions that are doing these awful things to Children permanently maiming and disfiguring their bodies. I justice can't come soon enough in my opinion. I, it's just I just stumbled around for words sometimes and I'm usually full of full of opinions. You'll have full of things to say, but no, no one has disputed my reporting because they can't argue with the citations. They're all there. Brandon, what would your recommendation be? We've got about a minute. What's your recommendation about how this audience? How do we combat this cult of confusion? What's the first steps we should take? I think the most important step is to not lend credence to any of this ideology with your words. Understand this gender ideology rests upon the twisting of our very means of communication. And as a Christian, I am not a fan of the French revolutionaries, but it was Voltaire who said, those who can make you believe absurdities can make you committed atrocities. And to that, I would just add, and there's no better way to make someone believe in an absurdity than by twisting our very means of communication into something utterly unrecognizable. Don't play FTSU with this. Don't say transgender woman. Say trans identified if you must because it's an identity construct, not a biological sex. This is a movement that is aimed at abolishing the material reality of sex itself. It's an outrageous and an impossible goal, but don't lend credence to it with your words. Don't give into the lingo because if you do, they've got you by the throat. Brandon, how do people get to you on social media and how they get to you about all your great reporting at the Christian Post? You can follow my byline at Christianpost.com and my Twitter handle is at BrandonMShow. Brandon, thank you very much. Okay, we're going to check out the Tucker movie. Yeah, yes. Everybody's going to go. We're going to play the links also later in the show. It's unbelievable. The cult of confusion, unbelievable. Tucker does great work over there at Fox Nation. Here's what we're going to do. We're going to come back with Shailene. We got a new spy of that. We're going to talk about abortion because the suppression polls are saying it's a loser. Also, MTG. She's on fire. She's going to join us. We didn't have enough problems financially, politically, geopolitically. We've got to add this. But this is where they're coming to the heart of how to destroy our civilization and our culture. Sure commercial break. Be back in the war in just a moment. What's never good? When your nation's supposed authority on economic policy completely misses the flashing red lights of impending inflation. Now, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has finally admitted, quote, there's been an unanticipated and large shocks to the economy that have boosted energy and food prices.

Why does the governor want your kids exposed to this? Welcome back to the War Room. I have Terry Schilling, an American principles project. Terry, the last segment with Schollwalder talking about the new Tucker. It's over at the Fox Nation under the Tucker's documentary series. Everybody's got to see this. It's quite frankly mind-boggling to people who spend most of their time in finance and business and politics and geopolitics. It's not my line of country, is what you say. But there's something deeply, deeply, deeply wrong. You've gotten more into these parents and the fights on CRT as bad as that is. That's nothing compared. This is so outrageous. What you just played right there, I mean, I'm thinking at Real America's voice, we're kind of in the happy hour before dinner hour. It's still children around. You can't even almost play it in front of children. You understand why they cut people's mics off at these school boards. They start reading from these books. Immediately you say, hey, this is pornographic. What's going on? Well, what's going on is the progressives have taken over almost every single school district in the country. I mean, this book, we have been doing insane amounts of research into this. This book is everywhere. It's in Texas, Steve. They want to corrupt our kids sexually, right? And ultimately, this is all part of their progressive agenda to literally abolish the family, right? You can subvert the parents, sexualize the children early. You're going to create very dysfunctional human beings who don't really have a desire to have their own family in the future. When we say abolish the family, it's usually too esoteric. But this is how it plays out. As you break children sexually, you destroy them on gender. You encourage them to be sexually active at very young ages. And these books are being given to kids at very young ages in schools right now in Michigan, in Wisconsin, in Pennsylvania, all across the country. But this is all a part of their plan to take over this country, replace self-government with rule by experts, right? This expert class, these elites that want to run our lives. And that's what this is all about. People used to think of the librarian as somebody that got all the books, the right books for you and helped you with your interest in reading. But the librarians are also a big problem, part of this, aren't they? They're kind of the vanguard of that they've been completely radicalized. And people haven't spent, they've been the teachers, the teachers, but, and a lot of, when you go through and look at the details on a case-by-case basis, what you find is not, these are not people that are woke. That's too nice a term. There's something deeply wrong here, and they've been radicalized, I mean, to a way that the French Revolution was never radicalized. I mean, this is the most radical social revolution. This is much more radical than the Cultural Revolution in China, what the Red Guards came up with. This is much more radical than the Bolsheviks or the Nazis. This is more radical than the French Revolution, which up today has been the most radical. How did this happen in the librarians? How did they become the tip of the spear in this? What a lot of people don't realize is that in the late 80s and early 90s, there was a push across the country, especially in Colorado, to protect parental rights, namely by passing parental rights amendments all across the country. And Steve, do you know who the number one opponent of parental rights amendments were? It was the American Library Association, and it was because they were woke and radical even in the 80s and 90s, right? And this is all, so in the 1960s, the sexual revolutionaries talked a lot about sexual liberation, right? But they didn't complete what they really wanted, which was full sexual liberation, and that includes for children, right? You're seeing them reframe pedophiles, right? They don't call them pedophiles, they want to call them minor, attractive persons, maps. Well, it's not going to come, pedophilia is not going to be normalized or legalized in this country by talking about the rights of adults to have sexual children. It's going to be normalized and legalized by them, mainstreaming the sexual liberation of children. It's going to be about children's rights and allowing children to flourish sexually. These are sick and depraved people, Steve. I don't support this stuff, obviously. This is their agenda, and I'm just restating what they want to achieve. That's why these books are in school. And see, that's one book. There are thousands of these books all across the country. I haven't talked about Lawn Boy or this other book, Flamer. These are graphic books that are sexual and pornographic in their nature, and it's absolutely devastating. To the fact, if you try to re-emit a school board meeting in Toronto Library, they cut your mic off because it's so pornographic, so disgusting to be said. And it's your tax dollars. Remember, it's your tax dollars. This is why, even if you have kids in these schools, you need to stand up for this. Real quickly, Charlie Kirk, I was on the Charlie Kirk Show earlier today, and right before him, he had the great team over at Trafalgar. And they were talking about numbers because right now the suppression polls, all the polls are coming out saying, hey, if you talk about abortion, if you don't take it off your website as a politician, you're going to be a loser because the Karens in the suburbs are not going to vote for you like they ever would anyway. And he was sitting there going totally disputing. It says his math, which is still the best math about MAGA, and he's called so many right shots. He's saying, that does not correlate with anything they're seeing out there at all. Terry Schilling, give us your assessment. So the number one thing we have to realize about the abortion fight is you have to fight. You have to engage. The RNC, the GOP consulting class, what they tell candidates is the absolute loser mentality, which is when you get to the right side, you have to engage. Which is when you get attacked about abortion, ignore it and deflect and move on to something else. So your opponent says you want to put women in jail over abortion, ignore it and talk about inflation, ignore it and talk about Ukraine, ignore it and talk about all these other things. The problem is Steve, these claims are very serious. And if they go on a dress, you're going to get branded as someone that wants to attack women. The polling on this is very boring because of how predictable it is. We did a Senate battleground survey just a few months ago, and we asked voters, if you had to choose between a Democrat who supports unrestricted abortion up until the moment of birth paid for by tax-packed dollars, or a Republican who wanted to restrict abortion at 15 weeks. It was 51 to 33% to the Republican. When you finally these issues, and when you actually make the case to voters, we win. But when you follow the RNC's playbook, when you follow the GOP consulting class playbook that tells you to ignore it, you're going to lose. And see, just to give you an example of how this plays out in a normal conversation, let's say you come home from work and your wife accuses you of kicking your dog, right? And you say, I'm hungry. I'm what's for dinner? She's going to think you kick the dog, right? She's going to think you kick the dog because you didn't deny kicking the dog. You've got to go on offense. You've got to attack them. You've got to tell the American people who the real extremists are. And it's not the people that want to protect the unborn. It's the people that want to kill them even after they're out of the womb. Those are the extreme. Terry, how do people get to you in American principles project? How do they find these great ads you're putting up? Particularly in one of the Michigan, this one in Michigan could be the one that tilts it to Tudor Dixon. Well, they're going to be up in a lot of different states, but it's just Americanprinciblesproject.org. We've got a super PAC on there, and we've got a C4. We're going to be running millions of dollars with ads this year, making sure that voters know who the bad guys are. Terry, we're going to record how people get to you on social media. It's a shilling 1776 across all the platforms, getter, true social, Twitter, everything, Instagram, all that. Shilling 1776. Thank you, brother. Appreciate it. Let's bring in now Congressman Marjorie Taylor Greene. Congressman, you've been at the forefront. I mean, we started the show with just two shocking segments, part of it coming off of Tucker Carlson's great documentary over at Fox Nation, the Cult of Confusion. You've been at the forefront of actually stepping up. And I don't know why the Republican Party is saying this is insane. We cannot let this go on with our children. You've actually put forward bills. Give us your position on this. It's almost hard to describe this, not just books in the schools, but this radical, what they're trying to do in surges with children, all of the stuff they're trying to do on the, on the transsexual side. You've actually stepped to the forefront. What are you doing in Congress? And why are more people in the Republican side not backing you and co-sponsoring the bills and coming to the mites like you do? Well, Steve, thank you so much. I was just listening to the previous segment and Terry is absolutely right. I'm so happy that they're fighting on this issue and getting information out. But I have introduced a bill called the Protect Children's Innocent Act. And this bill will make it a felony for anyone to engage in gender reassignment surgery on anyone under the age of 18. That includes me, redirecting me, castration, hormone, pretty blockers. This is basically a scientific experimentation on children. It should never be happening. Currently right now, I have 24 co-sponsors from my Republican colleagues that I should have over 100. I can't comprehend why they all haven't co-sponsored my bill because we are sending it out to every single office, making sure that they all have it. And I know people are calling their off and asking them to co-sponsor this. You see, this is not a far right idea. It's a mainstream idea that children should not be making these decisions. Children that cannot vote, cannot buy a backhoe, cannot get attacked too, can't own a gun, can't join the military, should not be making permanent decisions for genital mutilation where they're having your breast cut off. They're having hysterectomies and they can never have children where they can receive puberty blockers that is the same as chemical castration. So Steve, this is such an important bill. And we have got to push very hard in my conference so that when we're in the majority, we can pass this bill and keep pressuring everyone to get it into a law. Congressman Green, 30 seconds before we go to break, we're going to hold you over. How can this be controversial? You don't have every member of the Republican Party in Congress right in the house right now sign up as a co-sponsor. How does, how does, how that works? I can comment, Steve, you see, that's the problem with Washington and the messaging that comes out of G of B, they think they're going to win elections based on inflation and talking about crime in the city where all of America is really concerned and terrified on such things like Biden, Trump, OSPI, Trump, Trump, Trump, sexual identity, Trump, sexualized at all. But the Republican Party needs to get covered. Congressman Green, just hang on, return in one moment with MTG in the war room. We will play through the rock on. We rejoice when there's no more. Let's take down the CCP. Americans are discovering that if we want to change this nation, we have to change the way the marketplace works. Look, what corporations are seeking to divide us, big banks are freezing the accounts of people who disagree with their political views, and our supply chain is dependent upon countries that actively work against our values like the Chinese Communist Party.

You're going to understand how much Mike supports the values of not just MAGA, but the American people. MikePillow.com promo code WARRUM. Support the armor piercing shell that is Michael Endell. And of course, your humble servants here in the war room. So Congressman Green, here's the thing. And when you go around, your district is kind of one of these great emblematic of kind of the heart of America. When you go around your district, and even talking independently, how controversial is your bill that you've put forward? I mean, how controversial is this about children making these decisions that mutilate them and they would never be able to come back to their normal state? And you can say, hey, if they're going to do that, we're going to make it a felony. And we're going to get the big drug companies out of here and big pharma out of here and the big medical institutions out of here that are making all this money because it's a high margin business. How controversial is this in the 99 to one in your district as far as people support it? I've never met a person that supports genital mutilation for children, not one person. And this isn't just my district fee. This is all over the people you talk to in every walk of life. Independent, Democrat, Brit, poor. You know what's controversial? Is this genital mutilation industry that's booming on children? And it's absolutely shocked. This is a new industry where they're going to make billions and billions of dollars and it's outraged that it's considered controversial among my colleagues or in Washington, DC to outlaw this. This is something that we have to stand up and stop immediately because if you talk to any person from the D trans community, these are young people that went through these awful surgeries and these treatments when they were young teenagers, or maybe even as early as middle school. Or elementary school. These people are coming out of the woodwork devastated about what they have done to themselves. And they're suicidal. They don't know how to go back. They know that it's permanent damage and they don't know how to carry on with their lives. So this has to my bill protect children's innocent. In fact, it is a no brainer. This is something that we should be campaigning on going into November. We also remember the reason why Virginia flipped red is because a teenage boy was in the girls bathroom race other girls while calling himself a woman, calling himself a female. This is something that parents are completely outraged over and Americans in general. And if we can't stand up and stop this scientific experiment and didn't know mutilation of kids, then what are we possibly work? What can we do? No, I mean, it doesn't make it doesn't the battle to fight inflation. If it's if you lose your society and your culture and your civilization, what's the rest of it all worth? I get an issue. Of course, people come to me all the time and say, you know, why is it MTG? You know, why is it why is she always at the why she always putting up these bills that sound so logical, but only get a handful of people cosponsing. Why is it she always at the mic talking about the issues of the day and what's really important? And a couple of people said, Hey, and the House of Representatives over 200 Republicans, people can name a handful at most. Why if we're going to take this over if this if the lemon is going to be worth the squeeze, right? If everybody's working and go to precinct strategy and all the things we're doing to make sure that we went on the eighth, how do we know it's going to be worth it? How do we know that we're actually going to govern like we mean it? We're actually going to stop the madness going and not just the madness of spending the madness of burning money over in the Ukraine. The madness of the invasion or southern border. The madness of allowing what happened to 100 Biden's laptop. Just go away. The madness of all these FBI raids and kicking down the doors in Mar-a-Lago and ransacking that. Is the Republican Party got the stones? Do you believe to really be worthy of people's support on November 8th of this historic election? Well, Steve, that's the question that everyone keeps asking me and Steve, you and I are cut from the same cloth. We are not beholden to Washington, DC and we believe in fighting for this country. Freedom, faith and the American people. But I am asking that same question myself because if my Republican colleagues can't even co-sponsor a bill to protect children from something horrific and the biggest mistake they would make their entire lives, then how are we going to fund the 87,000 armed IRS army? How are we going to protect people's wealth and bring this economy back? How are we going to make the big decisions that need to be made to protect people's wealth and stop inflation? How will we stop the border crisis and the invasion that's happening there? How will we stop sending billions of dollars to Ukraine for money laundering and corruption when we aren't willing to protect America's own children? Those are the same questions I'm asking myself that Republicans have a big job to do and Steve, I'll tell you right now, not only do will I talk with my republics, colleagues and urge them and yell at them and beg them and plead with them and meet with them about these issues, I'll never stop fighting for them because I want Republicans to be the ones that win on these issues. That's what I want more than anything. I'm constantly urging my republic and colleagues to do the right thing. These might seem like hard decisions and you might get beat up in the radical communist media, but who cares? It's just matter. We have to do the right thing and it takes courage to do it and I'm really hoping Republicans can do that because I know one thing for sure, Steve, when we finally start being the Republican Party, we need to be our voters board us and back us and we'll bring in more voters like never before, just like President Trump did. We'll build the Republican voting base and it'll be bigger and better and it'll never stop voter press. We'll finally have the courage to lead this country. Look, one thing I've seen now at all the conferences and I've seen you in front of so many people, you know, you really are one of the voices, major voices of MAGA. What is it going to take? That's what people ask me. What is it going to take for Marjorie Taylor-Green to be part of leadership, part of leadership when this new Congress takes place? What has to happen and how can this war room posse assist you? Well, I think that would take a change within our conference itself. Right now the conference doesn't operate in a way where it accepts my voice and leadership. They tend to push my voice and my ideas to the side, but I think if the people support me and the people support the legislation that I'm bringing forward, eventually we can make something like that happen. But you see, I believe in the people, Steve, I believe in representing the people of the United States of America, especially from my district. And that's the way I lead. I don't take money from lobbyists or corporate PACs or special interests because I simply could care less. And I think that people know that about me, but I really want my republic colleagues to see this as the way forward because I think when we all come together as one big team and are able to buy into these ideas, no matter what the pressure is against it, Steve, we can save this country because you and I both know what the department of justice and the FBI has, they're tyrannical and they're going to stop at nothing told us earlier that there's been 35 people from from President Trump, Maga circle, the inner circle, his biggest style allies were rated by the FBI and I've been talked to some of them myself today. And it's terrifying, but you know they're going to build a scene. They're building a conspiracy, a spider web. They're trying to lie about all of us say that we were doing something on January 6 that we absolutely were not everything we did with legal. And people fighting for election integrity is absolutely what they should do. There's nothing wrong with wanting to know what happened in election. What is wrong is a government that's trying to stop us from knowing and a government that's trying to create a conspiracy that we were waging an insurrection and we absolutely were not. Here's why the FBI and the DOJ have gotten totally tyrannical and like the gazapo and this is because now federal judges said I don't trust the FBI and the DOJ to actually do this whatever they did Marlago fairly. I want this to be supervised by a federal judge. Also, these people that get rated, here's the most outrageous thing. Virtually all of them have lawyers that have been in, I mean they know how to serve a subpoena and do this and make these requests for electronics through a lawyer. The lawyer will accept service. You don't need to go to people. This is all intimidation tactics. They think they're going to scare people. They're not scaring people. They're only making our resolve. We've got steely resolve now. You are not going to scare anybody. You're not going to intimidate anybody. We're going to break you. We're going to break you. The FBI, we're going to break. We're going to win a sweeping victory on November 8th and then we're going to cut off your money. All these guys on MSNBC, all these former FBI agents up there, trash talking MAGA and trash talking our movement, we're going to take your pensions away and we're going to take your security clearances. Then you can go in the food line. You think you're going to get a free shot on MAGA those days are over. We're not going to be intimidated by you. We're going to strip your pensions. We're going to strip your security clearances. You're not going to be able to feed yourself and you're going to have to go figure it out. But you're just going to get a free shot on all these networks lying about the people, the people who have had a belly full of it. And the people are going to do something about it. What we're going to do is blow you out of the water on November 8th and destroy the Democratic Party as a national political institution. I know you don't like hearing that. I know you're trying to do everything in the world to stop that, but you're not going to stop it. It's going to happen. Because we're going to make it happen. MTG had a people, by the way, when MTG's legislation, if you look a lot of what she's put up, there were Republican colleagues. They have not really jumped in and supported. Those colleagues are the first guys saying, Rhonda Santas, what a great job. And Governor Santas is doing a great job. But if you look at much of what he's put forward, it's kind of at the state level what MTG's been saying, hey, this needs to be done at the federal level. So don't give me the fan, don't fanboy on Rhonda Santas and not look at her legislation because so much of it is very similar. And quite frankly, you've been ahead of the curve. Congressman Green, how do people get to your PAC? How do they get to you? How do they find out more about you? Because every time I go anywhere, you know what they want to talk about? They want to talk about MTG. So tell us how they get to you. Thank you so much, Steve. My website is mpg4america.com. You can find me on every social media platform. Just look for the verified account. But Steve, I want to echo what you just said. You are absolutely right. We are coming for those that have gone tyrannical. We will not allow it. We will take away their pension. We will defund their salaries and we will send them to the private sector among the very people that they have attacked, see if they can survive and get a real job and earn money the same way the American people did. But hold it, they're going to get a real job without security clearance. How many of these guys, that's your security clearance and no pension. How are you going to live? We're coming for you. Don't think we're not coming for you. We're taking all the names your MSNBC and CNN comment. I've been sitting there trash talking Trump and MAGA for a couple of years. There's no free shots on gold anymore. That's right. So just remember, when we take power, you're going to have your security clearance stripped and you're going to have your pensions stripped. So see how talented you are and what you're doing. You'll be a mall cop. You're going to be a bunch of mall cops. MTG, thank you very much. How do they get the SaaS pack? I want to make sure that they know how to support the candidates throughout the country. Thank you. SaaS.com. S-A-S-S-C-A-C.com. Thank you, Steve. We look forward to doing it. We need everybody to storm the polls in November so we can get this job done. Thank you, man. Appreciate it. Let's go to Tina Peters. Tina, do we have Tina? Tina, give us an update on your travails out in Colorado, ma'am. I love it, Steve. I'll tell you something. We have got to make these people pay. Where do I even start? Okay.

Well, there was, so at 1.53 in the morning, Steve. I tell you what, Tina, hang on for one second. We'll take a short break. Let's come back. Tina's going to walk us all through it.

So Tina, where does this stand with the recount and everything about the primary? We're hurtling towards November 8th. How do we get your situation sorted and what do we need to do? That's right. Tina Peters for Colorado.com. What they did, if we can get the judges to roll righteously, we have the law on our side. The law says that they have to compare a sample hint account of voter verified ballots with what the machine said during the primary election for my race. It will not agree. We have to get that done. They're trying to screw around that and not do it properly. We paid $256,000 for this recount. It needs to be done properly. Once this stuff, this is done, it will show that the ballots, the voter verified paper ballots and the machines do not agree. My arraignment was Wednesday. They're trying to show Frobe and Frig them. They've thrown everything they can at me. I even was served a subpoena in the case with Eric Coomer versus our beloved Michael Endel on Wednesday to testify for Eric Coomer in his suit, which, you know, I'm going to look forward to that. We've got to get this recount done, Steve. And right now, like I said, we filed today in the Colorado Supreme Court. If they turn us down, then we're going to the U.S. Supreme Court. Colorado can bring this whole thing down for the whole U.S. Why would you think you would lose the Colorado Supreme Court? What do you think they're going to say? You believe you're going to win? They've all been selected. I mean, okay, give you an example. On Wednesday, we were taking the deposition of the DA, which we got done, the judge at noon and the investigator on this crazy iPad accusation. At 1130. Well, one 30 in the morning, the judge contacted the Colorado Supreme Court. The Supreme Court at 30 minutes before we were supposed to deposed him, put a stay on it. Now, if you get a Supreme Court of Colorado to do this for a judge in just a few hours, again, because they know that he was appointed by Jared Polis. I don't have a lot of hope, but the law is on our side, Steve. They broke the law. They did not conduct the recount in a law called the way the law reads in 102 3A.

We'll do Okay, I want to show some videos coming out a very special guy Kenneth Woodard Let's go. Can we go ahead and play let's play the v i want to play the video doesn't have for our podcast audience It does not have audio, but it's quite shocking. Let's play it Okay, let me go ahead and play it out what you saw as somebody come from behind a guy waiting in an elevator For an elevator gets hit from behind viciously I mean really viciously one of these cold cocks you're seeing all the time right and what he does and then he sprints out And he turns around and he looks at the guy shot him and he did punch him And he just guns him down and cold but boom right there. It just takes him right out Kenneth what is happening in Chicago Chicago is a beloved city of the Midwest. It's one of the greatest cities in this country He used to be called the second city right to New York And we got about a minute and then we're going to break and want to hold you over Uh into the next hour, but what is going on in Chicago sir? Well, the spiritual war Steve has hit the streets and um Unfortunately as a resident of Chicago And i've been here i've been in a little more of my life and most of that in in Chicago And this is I mean you see a video like this and it's almost desensitizing because we see so many of these and sometimes it's not too full grown adults Sometimes Steve is children. And so that's why it's so important. Um, one of the main things i talked about Yes, i'm a law student. I'm a dad of six children Um, I grew up here, but a lot of times what I talk about Steve is we need to vote in Light and people who are going to take care of this darkness on the streets But we also need to uh, we need to vote out and pray out darkness That's our that's really our our call to arms here And because what you see in Chicago and in Illinois, we have this bill that's being passed the safety act It's a total disaster where more criminals are going to be able to go without cash bail They're going to be able to get back out and it's like we're going in the opposite direction You have a mayor here who when there's murder downtown What is the response is like we're going to add more curfew hours because that's going to stop criminals the curfew How how about we put them in jail and make them pay bail and lock them up? So Steve this is we're going totally backwards, but that's why I think it's more than just a political battle. It's a spiritual battle Go ahead can't hang hang on one second. We're we're gonna go over take a couple of minute break We're gonna continue with war room battleground Illinois the great city of chicago under assault another source back these das these mayors out of control Kenneth woodard matthew tiermont dave wall shadave brat neomie wolf all next hour in the war room Folks, let me tell you about salty.
