We thank Original Grain for sponsoring this podcast. Hi, I'm Anna Marie Cox and welcome to Conspiracy Month on With Friends Like These. There is an obvious reason why a political podcast might want to be talking about conspiracies for a month. And that's because we have a conspiracist in chief in the White House. We have a hospital foreign power that weaponized conspiracy theories and a presidential election. We have conspiracy theories breaking through into real life with people taking weapons into a piece of parlor to try and save the children they think are being enslaved there. Those are all really good reasons to be talking about conspiracy theories in this day and age. There's another good reason that might be less obvious. And that's that conspiracy theories are actually kind of normal. The more you learn about them as a phenomenon, the more you realize that, well, everyone believes in a conspiracy of some kind, although they may not think of it as a conspiracy theory. And also, you begin to realize that some of the conspiracies are true. One person's like fantastic idea is another person's history lesson. You may scoff at a Tea Party Patriots idea that the government is going to put dissenters into FEMA camps, but the American government has put plenty of people into camps. They're putting some people in camps right now. And how different is the idea that they're putting something in the water from the decades of experimentation on people of color that basically created modern medicine? A conspiracy theory can be the expression of anxiety by a person afraid of losing power, and they can be a description of how the powerful protect themselves. So our goal this month is not to point and laugh, though there will be some pointing and probably some laughing. It is to understand conspiracy theories. What are the conditions that prime people to believe in conspiracies? Why do certain kinds of conspiracy theories flourish? What can we learn about the truth from lies? So that is all this month, and it starts this week with two guests. Jesse Walker is the books editor at Reason Magazine, and he's also the author of The United States of paranoia, which is about the history of conspiracy theories in the US. And also this week, friend of the pod Parker Malloy, editor at large for Media Matters for America, and an expert on, well, the real conspiracy against trans people. Coming right up, Jesse and Parker. Jesse, welcome to the show. Oh, thanks for having me. I am excited to talk to you. I followed your work for a long time on Reason and in general, also about conspiracies. I consider you something of an expert on the subject. And my first question is something. Maybe I should say an expert. You are an expert. And I guess my first question is just an overarching one, which is how did you get started reporting on conspiracy theories? Like, what is there something that happened? Is there a particular thing that sparked your interest? Well, I was interested in them before I was any kind of reporter. So it was always something I was just kind of paying attention to in one way or another. I mean, it goes back to high school. And I don't know if you want me to get into biographical details of me discovering conspiracy books on the shelves of the local libraries and all. But it was already something I sort of had my eye on. And I guess I first wrote about it in the mid 90s. I mean, the around the time of the Oklahoma City bombing and there was a lot of media interest in the topic. And I say the first time, I'm sure I wrote some articles that touched on it previous to that in a book review or something. But I mean, certainly the earliest quotes in the United States of paranoia that come from my own interviews are from like magazine writing. I was doing back around 1995, 96, and was still drawing on more than almost two decades later when I was writing the book. So I gave you a chronological answer. I guess I didn't really answer the underlying question though. Like, how did I find this interesting? Yeah, you know, I mean, American culture, I mean, both in the present and American history, I mean, it's not just the events that happen. It's all the things that people are imagining happening, you know, and you can give fair, I mean, obviously there's trouble giving even an objective account of who did what when. But you know, it's at least possible to conceive of doing that with something like, you know, World War II, the Great Depression, and so on. But part of the story has to be what all these different groups of people thought were going on. And all these sort of dueling, you know, I don't want to just say mythologies because that makes it sound like it's all fictional. And in a lot of what people think are going on, I'm not just saying about conspiracies here, is just, you know, the perceptions of the world and their expectations. And also, you know, what it enforces, they see work whether they're political or spiritual or a number of options. So, I think that's just part of the story and often gets, you know, felt, you know, and so part of what I was trying to do with this book was to look at American history through the prism of all these, not just what was happening, but all these imagined extra activities are happening in people's mind, especially people's fears, although I do have a chapter here on the Neverland Conspiracies too. So it's not just fear. We have to, we have to cover that because I think that would, I think some people might be surprised that the idea of a benevolent conspiracy, except maybe Santa Claus, I guess that's good, benevolent conspiracy. But let's go back to this idea that there is like an American story about conspiracy theories. I know a little bit about what you've written and it is true that basically conspiracies have been a part of American culture, like since before there was an America. Right, since before it was an independent country. I start, and I should just say at the beginning, I'm not claiming that America is more prone to conspiracy theories than other countries. I don't even know how you would measure that if you wanted to, you know, put it on a scale, but we know about all kinds of conspiracy theories in the Middle East, in Russia, in Africa. So, but what I can say is that there is a distinctly American style of conspiracy theories or set of styles, I should say, a specific American history of things that we've been afraid of that overlaps with other people, other cultures, you know, and we're influenced by stories that come from abroad, but really reflects the circumstances that, you know, our ancestors and now us, you know, have lived through. So, and that begins the moment people start, you know, landing on these shores. I mean, I'm sure it begins before then. We don't have the written records to talk about what the American Indians conspiracy theories were like, but I'm certain they had some. Yes, but once Europeans started showing up here, immediately they started imagining conspiracy theories among the Indians and among each other. But I mean, one of the earliest stories I talk about in the book was this idea that the Satan had come to America first, to the New World first, as Christianity spread in Europe and he figured he was losing ground. He allegedly came out here and he brought a bunch of pagans with them and set them up as the Indians and was manipulating their attacks on the settlers and so forth. And there was a sort of a grand, apocalyptic, satanic narrative behind these, you know, these people working in the wilderness that the Puritans were looking at and seeing. And you have that and you also have these sort of smaller scale conspiracies, just, you know, fearing that Indians are about to attack, fearing that Indians are allying themselves with another tribe or another set of colonists. And so you have like, then as now you have both the big grand apocalyptic conspiracy theories, you know, where, you know, a one dark force is striding across the world, you know, throwing its thunderbolts at everything and these sort of smaller scales, sometimes plausible ones, just about plots that other human beings might be conducting and then these interplay in different ways. So for example, during the Salem witch trials, which of course is famous as a conspiracy theory in itself, you know, the sort of fear that these your neighbors and even family members might be secretly committing themselves to the devil and worshipping him in secret covens and trying to work against the body politic, you also had the idea that the witches were working in league with the Indians and French Canadians. And that had to do with very specific, you know, geopolitical relations between the British colonists in New England and the French colonists not far away and all these different Indian nations. So I mean, it's there at the very beginning and it is in absolutely no sense something that started with, you know, Q and nine and the deep state and Russia and all that. First of all, I want to acknowledge I have great and important, I think it is to say that there was somebody else here before the country was colonized and maybe probably, you know, Native American culture has its own set of beliefs, conspiratorial or not. But it's also really important, I think, to point out this, that how, how largely these Native Americans figured, like you're saying, into these early conspiracy theories, because to me that illuminates something that I feel like I've learned as we've dived into this, which is that I used to think that conspiracy theories were like the refuge of the powerless, like that it was something that you, you believed in if you were fearful, you know, like if you if you didn't understand the larger forces around you, then you would maybe impose a force you would say it must be this thing that I can't that is intelligible to me that's making these things happen. But from hearing you talk about these early conspiracies, it seems less like it, these are powerless people or people being, you know, taken advantage of that come up with the conspiracy theories, but rather people that just aren't doing as well as they want to be doing. You have a long history of very powerful people believing in conspiracy theories. And in part, of course, that reflects the fact that nobody is as powerful as they want to be and people see threats everywhere. Sometimes real threats and often imagined ones, but you know, these are not always, you know, the people who are at the bottom of the, the social pecking order. And I think that the theory that conspiracy theories are something that just sort of comes from the most powerless people, like almost every thesis about conspiracy theories, that's true of some of them. But you have to really not follow them. So and I, and I, one thing I do in the book is I set up sort of five sort of recurring conspiracy narratives to come up in different forms or sort of structures for different conspiracy stories. And they're the enemy outside, the enemy below, the enemy above the enemy within and the benevolent conspiracy. And you might notice from this test, I mean, the enemy above that is people who are either powerless or relatively powerless. They might be sort of in the middle of society, but casting their eyes upwards, being nervous about elites and would be elites. But those enemy below stories, that's the constant fear of people in power of threats to their rule. I mean, whether it's the constant rumors of insurrectionary slave conspiracies that were going throughout the Antebellum South. And actually, for that matter, before slavery was abolished in the North and the North, I mean, I talk about in some detail about some incidents in New York in the 18th century. And then continuing forward from there, fears about, actually, I looked at some stories about the urban riots of the 1960s and showed some direct parallels between those and some stories that have been told more than a century or earlier about alleged slave conspiracies. And it's not a coincidence. I mean, these stories keep recurring and they get passed down and they mutate and they evolve, but they have deep roots. So, yeah, it's not just powerless people. And even beyond that, let me say, it's not just one group of people. One sort of set of writing about conspiracy theories that I don't care for is some people in the psychological literature try to come up with this idea of conspiracy ideation, a particular conspiracist way of thinking. And then they will try to draw conclusions about the people who show this form of thinking. And I think it's just much more widespread than that implies. Almost anyone who's not comatose is capable of believing in conspiracies and probably does so. You'll see studies that say more than half of Americans believe in at least one conspiracy theory. And those always understate it because what they really mean is more than half of Americans believe in one of the four or six conspiracy theories that we asked about in this poll. And if you copy up and say what conspiracy theories do you believe in, you're still not going to get a full count because lots of people don't think of what their conspiracies as conspiracy theories. This is especially true if it's a mainstream conspiracy theory. If it were 1986 and you and somebody believed wholeheartedly in the satanic panic that was going on then this idea that there are these devil worshiping kabals that were infiltrating daycare centers and molesting children in rituals and even in some versions of the story sacrificing children and disposing of their bodies. That person would probably not call that a conspiracy theory. They would say it's something they saw on 2020 because this was something that was embraced by the mainstream media and embraced by prosecutors and an awful lot of juries. People went to jail sometimes for very long periods of time for crimes that they not only did not do but that never happened because of this moral panic that sees the country at that time. So yeah, conspiracy thinking is everywhere not just among the fringy outskirts of society. It is interesting to me how often it seems like in just the conspiracy theories we're talking about right now how often the scapegoats of a conspiracy theory are the less powerful, like are the minorities? Is that a shape of conspiracy theories that is continuous or is that are there conspiracy theories in which those, I guess it would be impossible for conspiracy theory to exist in which those in power are the ones in power? Does that make sense? You can certainly believe that people who are in power are trying to seize more power or trying to abuse the power in ways that are hidden and that's sort of the classic form of an enemy above conspiracy theory. I mean everybody knows that the CIA has power. The question is did the CIA use its power in this way? Or if you go back to, I mean, again, deep into history, like the lead up to the American Revolution, everybody knew the British Crown had power over the colonies. And that's why they were the colonies and not the independent states, but the stories that were circulating, and I mean among people like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Alexander Hamilton, about the crown plotting to take away liberties that the colonists enjoy and to impose what's the phrase in the Declaration of Independence, like absolute despotism or something like that. I mean that is, that becomes conspiratorial speculation. And then you enter the question of is it true or not? But sure, absolutely you can have these. But it's also true as you said that you can have conspiracy theories about the powerless. I mentioned the enemy below ones, but I also the enemy outside conspiracy theories, which is about people not at the lower end of the social ladder, but outside the community's gates. That's the form that the American Indian conspiracy theories took. That's the form that conspiracy theories about immigrants today are about the fear of immigrants rushing in from the outside today will take and all sorts of different things in between, whether it's yellow peril theories at the end of the 19th century, about Asians, conspiracy theories about Germans' habitures during World War I, and Germans' habitures existed, but they were all sorts of very far out theories that went well beyond what anyone could prove. Not only can anyone believe in a conspiracy theory, but anyone can be the star of a conspiracy theory. It's less likely, obviously, if you're not famous, but on a micro level. The sorts of, I mean, we were just talking about those fears of immigrants and so on that you don't have to be a well-known member of an immigrant group for someone to see on the street and think, yeah, something's good. So I hope I circled around and finally answered your question. I think you did. I guess I want to point out that I do think this enemy above thing, it can still incorporate racism and bigotry because it sounds like a lot of the conspiracy theories like we've talked about so far, it may be the enemy above, but they're co-opting the Indians, right, or they're co-opting African Americans to do their dirty work, right? Yeah, I mean, these sort of five types or ideal types, but as I say, people constantly combine them. You have theories that the elites are turning the underclass against the hard-working people in the middle. You have theories of elites collaborating on being traitors, collaborating with outside enemies, and again, that goes back to the Indian days as well. I mean, in Maryland, I'm sitting here in Baltimore County speaking to you. I mean, right around the time of the glorious revolution, there was a big rumor went around that the Catholic rulers of the state had secretly assembled an army of thousands of Seneca Indians to kill the Protestants in a bit of a panic, which dissipated when the mobs of Indians did not emerge, but then there was another version of it that happened a little later. And eventually, the colonial government was overthrown, and Maryland stopped being a Catholic-ruled country. So, I mean, colony. So it's a, you absolutely have these combinations. And that's part of it. And not only that, but a conspiracy can suddenly change shape or gradually change shape over time through this evolutionary process. One example I give in the book is how the John Birch Society at the beginning of the urbanism organization, when we were founded in the 50s, imagined a conspiracy, a communist conspiracy, had quartered in Moscow, and a lot of Americans were secretly being manipulated by it, or if not manipulated, actively collaborating with it. A bit more than a decade later, the shape of that story had reversed, and the communists were themselves being controlled by capitalist forces in New York. So, none of this is stable. All of it can change. That's the way culture goes. I also know that you're of a libertarian bent, and maybe this is the libertarian in me speaking. But part of me feels like if it's a conspiracy above, then it might be true. People in power want to have more power, right? And there is a history of conspiracy, so-called, there are, I guess, there is such a thing as a real conspiracy, right? Like, a cabal of powerful people who do something that they don't want other people to know about in order to increase their own power or subjugate others. And I think about the Tuskegee Institute experiments, like that, and or experiments that doctors did on African American people, like all throughout the early time of medicine in America. And I discuss both of those in the book, in fact. And then one thing I say going beyond that is that the experience of those real conspiracies makes people more willing to imagine further conspiracies. So, I mean, in those cases, I mean, there's a whole bunch of conspiracy rumors in African American conspiracy, in African American communities relating to secret medical abuses, some of the rumors that went around during the Atlanta child murders at the end of the 70s and the beginning of the 80s, for example, which if you don't know that history, you would say that is absurd. Where would that even come from? But if you do know that history, you can say, well, some of these stories go over the top, but we understand, you know, the context that led people to believe such things. I have a chapter in the book on the revelations of the 1970s when you had not just Watergate, but the church committee and the Pike committee, you know, in the Senate and the House investigating the crimes of the national security state, things that the CIA, FBI, IRS, NSA, and so on had done. And in that case, again, not only did you have people willing then to imagine further CIA misbehavior that's not supported by the evidence, but they feel more willing to believe it because they've just learned about some terrible things, the CIA. Actually, I mean, once you've learned that the CIA has been, was secretly dosing people with LSD in order to, you know, see their reactions and figure out if this could be used, you know, in resisting brainwashing and so on, which was a real thing that happened and has been discussed on, you know, the floor of the US Congress, it becomes a lot easier to believe, you know, the CIA getting up to, you know, other misbehavior. But it's not only did that then affect people's conspiracy theories, but it affected pop culture. You had that whole wave of conspiracy thrillers in the 1970s, which were directly influenced by stuff that came out at that, you know, in the newspapers at that time, and which then shaped the way, you know, people's imagination. So I'm once you've seen some of those movies, or, you know, thrillers influenced by those movies, it becomes easier to imagine particular stories. Just, I mean, we're constantly, you know, we live in a world haunted by popular culture, and the things that we watch and read are constantly shaping the way we expect people to behave. So it's really that sort of mixture between the stories that really happened, the stories that people imagined might be happening, and the stories that were frankly fictional, you know, created by Hollywood, the way those all influenced each other is really interesting to watch, I think. I'm glad that you think it's interesting to watch, because I would love some more discussion of that, particularly like you just described, you know, the ways that 70s, true revelations about government working, you know, in secret in the 70s, you know, created a kind of like pop culture conspiracy boom, and the pop culture conspiracy boom, you know, in turn, like created fertile ground for people to believe in even further conspiracies, and that all, that feedback loop also just worked every which way, right? I'm not, I'm describing one set of that feedback loop, one way that it goes. But I'm curious, like, do you see in American history, like the kinds of conspiracy theories, like rise and fall and popularity, like you said, there's this taxonomy that you have. Are there particular eras that seem particularly fertile ground for, you know, particular, you know, one of the, one of the five kinds? They're all going on to one degree or another, but certainly, I mean, wartime is always fertile ground for enemy outside theories. Right after 9-11, very strong time for enemy outside theories. I mean, look back at this, I mean, you say 9-11 in conspiracy theories, people first think of like, truthers and the obvious stuff, but go beyond that. Think about the mentality that, you know, the country was, that was in where someone could spill a little bit of, you know, coffee sweetener, you know, in an airport gate. And then someone noticed is it 15 minutes later and everything goes on lockdown because they think it might be anthrax. I mean, that was the, the mindset of practically the whole country at that point. And we've seen small versions of that, you know, at other times too, but I mean, that's, that's definitely a historical moment. And also particular subcultures can turn on a dime. I remember, right after Obama was elected, there was a whole lot of discussion of, wow, the, the right wing in this country has suddenly gotten into conspiracy theories. You know, during the Bush years, there are all sorts of right wing conspiracy theories. It's just that they weren't about the president. They were about Muslims and Mexicans and liberals, you know, and it's at the moment that it's just that they suddenly became, they sort of shifted from being mostly enemy outside and a bit of enemy within theories, you know, during the, the Bush years to being enemy above theories because you had a president who was from the other party and, and perceived as alien in various ways. So yeah, you definitely have shifts like that. It's, I'm just hesitant to, and I don't think you were asking me to do this, but I, I, hasn't it to say like the country as a whole was into, you know, in the 70s, they got, they got more popular in the 70s for obvious reasons. Right. And I'm just sort of asking for the shape of things. Like if there's a way to look at a particular era and, and say this is a response to this, this thing that happened, like, or we see, like you said, there is, for instance, like historically you can look at wartime and see a particular kind of conspiracy theory, you know, gain hold, right? Um, as a, as a former professional historian myself, I do appreciate whenever someone who study history smacks down the idea that our time is particularly special, um, or that, or that we've never seen this before. I feel like a lot of my time is American history. Graduate student was spent telling people like, no, like, yeah, this has happened before, like here's, here's how it happened before. But now I've been out of that field for a while and I'm wondering, do when you look at today, do you, can you say this has happened before? Because I, I, people feel like we're at some kind of, like fever pitch of conspiracies. I think there are things that are distinctive about this time. Um, and, you know, I mean, every time is sort of a remix of all previous times. That's, that's, you know what I mean? It's, it's a lot of things that people think are unusual about this time are not. I, I just reviewed a book that, you know, sort of sketched out what it called the new conspiracism and everything they said new conspiracism. It wasn't new. I could point to previous, plenty of previous examples. What is different about now? I mean, Donald Trump is an unusual president. No, and it's not unusual for a president to believe in conspiracy theories. There are plenty of examples of presidents who believe in conspiracy theories. John Quincy Adams was afraid of Freemasons. You know, Richard Nixon was afraid of all sorts of stuff. I could give you all kinds of examples of previous presidents who believe in conspiracy theories. Donald Trump has a distinct personality, a distinct background that are unusual. And so that the familiar experience of having a president believe in conspiracy theories gets processed through the unusual filter that is Donald Trump. You know, like, I mean, it's very rare to have a, I'm going to start with, before you even get into his, his, his personality, shall we say, or his beliefs. It's very unusual to have a president who is neither, who has no background is either an elected official or a military man, like an Eisenhower. So here's somebody who's sort of comes into American government with basically, I don't want to say no knowledge of how things work or what kind of behavior is expected, but it's a very, very limited compared to people who sort of rose up through the ranks. Okay. And then add on top of that, the fact that he got there by doing the opposite of what everyone thought you had to do to become president. So he sort of feels maybe empowered, you know, to ignore people's advice about what to say in public and things like that. And then on top of that, you get to his personality, he is completely shameless. There are, I mean, John Kerry believes in, believes that John of Kennedy was killed by a conspiracy, larger than Lee Harvey Oswald. And when he was asked about that as Secretary of State, he said, I don't want to discuss it, it wouldn't be appropriate. It doesn't have to do with what I am, is my own belief. It's, yeah, I mean, he would, whereas Donald Trump is someone who not only will tweet out, you know, his brain fart of the morning, and I don't even want to compare some of this stuff to, you know, Warren, Commission, skepticism. Yeah. But then, you know, on top of that, he's quite happy to, you know, point to the national inquirer as a source, you know, I mean, he will, I mean, that I think is, is probably unprecedented. I, if you want to say what is new about this moment, I think I'm willing to say that we have not previously had a president who, you know, in public for the public said the reason why I am casting aspersions on this person I'm running against for office and suggesting his dad was maybe mixed up with a Kennedy assassination is because of an article in the National Inquirer. That is unusual. And also what's unusual, and this also gets to a shamelessness, this is a willingness to just drop that as soon as Cruz is not running against him. I mean, it's pretty clear that a lot of what Donald Trump says, he doesn't believe. It's, or I can't speak to a psychology. Maybe it's a sort of situational belief people have where they convince themselves of whatever is convenient to them at that moment. So he's willing to, you know, not just make that sort of absurd allegation and cite it in an absurd way, you know, pointing to, you know, notorious newspaper tabloid that people generally don't take seriously, even if they occasionally do break a real story. In this case, they did not, you know, but he's willing to turn around and have and embrace Cruz's support once Cruz was wanting eventually to support him. Or, you know, I mean, he did the same thing in a non conspiracy way with Ben Carson. He had this cast, I mean, I say, oh, this guy could be violent and all that. And then later he points him to his cabinet. So I mean, that again is Trump's personality. So those are things that are, you know, close to unique, let's say, are at least unique on a presidential level, because there are actual other politicians that are in some ways closer to Trump's personality. And some of the things that were seem unusual about Trump, if you look at, for example, when Pappy O'Daniel was governor of Texas in the late 1930s, there's actually some really striking parallels between some stuff that Trump's done and stuff that O'Daniel did. So even, but that's, you know, it's different to be the governor's mansion versus a guy with, you know, a nuclear missile set his disposal. So, and then I actually, let me, I'm just, you probably want to ask another question, but I should throw one more thing in. You were sort of asking, like, if it feels more intense now, we actually do have a data of a sort on intensity of conspiracy belief. Two political scientists, Joe Yusansky and Joe Parent, down in, and, oh, I'm banking on which university, but it's in Florida, it's in Miami, did a mammoth study of letters to the editor of the New York Times and the Chicago Tribune from the 1890s up to, I think it was 2010. And they basically counted every, I mean, in the case of the Times, every single letter that made a conspiratorial claim and then the Tribune was more of a control group. So it wasn't every single one. And they, and you, and among other things, and they also categorized them and so forth, but they have a chart which you can go find in their book, American Conspiracy Theories, which shows how many there were year by year. And if you're interested in the results, there were two huge peaks in the 1890s, sort of around the fear of corporate trusts and so on. And in the 1950s, early Cold War, fear of the Soviet Union, there's some smaller spikes around times like Watergate. And there's a lot of the sort of random, or it looks like it's, to me, like it's random noise. And in general, with the exception of those two huge spikes, it's a pretty constant middle level, which has gradually gone down from then up to when the, when their survey ended. Again, I think it was 2010. So that, to me, suggests that anyone who says that this general period, not just the Trump era, but like the internet era, that this is like a big period for conspiracy theories compared with the past, I don't think the data show that. And I don't think that there's a sort of big trend or a greater intensity, building since we all started getting on Facebook or anything like that. But I would not be at all surprised if they were to continue that study in another decade. If you saw another sort of Watergate or even larger spike right now with the stuff that's going on in the culture, because you've got so many, both Trumpian and anti-Trump conspiracy theories right now, being the strut gust in the mainstream media by leading political and media figures, I would not at all be surprised if you had a spike and a greater amount of intensity. I've heard about that study. I have to say, I feel like the only thing it really proves is that conspiracy theory-aising is somewhat consistent among those people who write letters to the New York Times. Yeah. Well, that's part of why they have the Tribune as a candidate. Write letters to Chicago Tribune. I mean, those are pretty self-selecting groups. I grilled one of the Joes. I grilled Joe Ussensky about a bunch of my other things I was bringing up as a lot of this moved into talk radio at this point or moved online and so on. He had pretty good answers. I don't know if you're going to have him on this show and grille him about that. But there are obviously you can't capture everything there. But it is the biggest data set that anyone has done. I mean, there's nothing even comparable to that. And it is a good to have data and b, this is something that is almost impossible to quantify. And I mean, there just couldn't. Yeah. So much of it is just so much of conspiracy theorizing ordinarily is just transmitted orally anyway. Right. And this is actually one of my big beefs when people talk about like the internet era, you know, being like a big surge in conspiracy thinking. I think the internet has changed conspiracy thinking in a lot of ways and we can get into that. But I think a lot of what people are doing is they're seeing stuff that previously was done within a subculture you didn't enter. And now it's visible because it's happening online and you think it's new. But if you look back at like there's I'm blanking on the guy's name, I write about a sociologist who in the early 1940s during World War II went out. Oh, Howard Odom. That's it. And was collecting, you know, rumors in the American South and in particular rumors about race. But this, these often were conspiratorial ones. And like, for example, the idea that there were secret groups called swastika clubs of American blacks who were going to be set up in charge of the South now ruling over the white man with the help, you know, once Hitler had conquered America. Now this sounds pretty absurd. You can think of all sorts of problems with that story. But it was being spread around and it was, and we know about it, not because you know, there's, I mean, it's possible that worked its way into a letter to the editor of Southern newspaper. And I haven't seen that. But it's basically something that was mostly being spread orally. But and we know about it because this guy went out and collected those stories. Well, now it's much easier for someone like me, you know, to go online and say, Oh, what are the Q and on people saying today? And see, and that, of course, once you're observing this, that changes the behavior of the, of the people telling the conspiracy theories as well. I mean, so again, it changes it in all sorts of ways. But so I getting this back down to what you around to what you were saying. I agree, there's all sorts of stuff that doesn't get captured by the by looking at the letters to the editor of these of these two major newspapers. But you do get you do get number one, how a couple of significant, you get a measure of at least one major. You get a measure of something. You're measuring a thing. I'm looking for them. That's the word I'm looking for, forum, you know, what goes on in one particular forum. And also you're looking at how much it penetrates the mainstream, which is really important because while stuff like the swastika club rumors, you know, or I could look at it like stuff like the pamphlets that were sort of flooded the South again in the in the 1928 election, claiming that Al Smith, the Democratic candidate, he would be a tool of the pope and so on. You know, that's not necessarily going to turn up in the New York Times letters column, you know, either, you know, and it had an impact on the election that you can debate how much of an impact it had. So, but you know, you're getting the some of the most impactful stuff when you're looking at the times in the Tribune. Do you know what the worst sound in the world is? It's your alarm clock if you haven't gotten enough sleep. No matter how much you love that song on your phone or the sound of Michael Barbrough's voice or maybe Bird song, maybe you use some sort of, you know, like sounds app to wake up.

It's funny you mentioned effects on elections, but you made me think of something when you described Donald Trump's sort of place in conspiracy culture history how he is and isn't unique to our moment. What struck me was when you mentioned how easily he discards his conspiracy theories or discards his sources. You were saying once he's elected suddenly, Cruz is fine and he never mentions national choir in that context again. Once he's elected, Ben Carson is fine and never mentions that again. In part of me feels like one way of thinking about this moment that troubles me and is sort of is I think different than what people are calling a post truth crisis or whatever and the problem of what do we believe. Because I do feel like every technological revolution has had a moment like that. My study of history is like there's every time there's a new way of disseminating information. I think people have a crisis of what do we believe? Do we believe the radio? How can you believe something that's on the radio? You can't see it. But something I feel like I haven't seen in history before is a complete disregard for whether or not something is true. Are you talking about Trump in particular or the general population? Trump in particular, but I think he's modeling something that is also happening. I don't think that's unique to his personality. I worry that that's the thing that's happening that people aren't talking about. There's a lot of discussion about who are the new gatekeepers and fact checking stuff and we should we need to create some official imprintor of this is true and this is not true. And that stuff I feel I feel like I've seen before and also I personally don't know how much good it would do. What I feel like is happening behind that is that some people just like, yeah, I don't care. I don't think that's unusual. I mean, I, or I don't think that's specific to our historical, I mean, I just I've just known too many people. I'm speaking anecdotally here, but I mean, I've known too many people who are, they wouldn't necessarily say I don't care. Although actually it's funny, I was just last night watching just randomly someone linked on Twitter to Christopher Hitchens interviewing a couple guys from the White Aryan resistance in 1991. I was like, what on earth is this? I didn't know he ever interviewed people on TV and he was trying to press them on, do you believe the whole cause happened? And they were just, I don't I don't care if it happened. It was very it was just and it was kind of this cop-out answer. Like for some reason they didn't want to admit it on TV. So you know, you've got I don't think this is something unique to Trump. I'm saying like, that is something that I've seen outside of Trump and that's what's concerning to me. That when I talk to people who, you know, believe a conspiracy or have a belief about Trump and there's a point that I've experienced that sort of that sounds like what happened with Christopher Hitchens, which is, you know, what about this, what about this, what about this? And they're like, I don't care. I like him. Yeah. Well, that's certainly I mean, I mentioned Papi O'Daniel earlier. I mean, there was a great quote because one of the parallels is he had about as much trouble getting legislation through in Austin as Trump has had in Washington. He had the sort of savant skills to get himself elected in a non-traditional pop culture-centric way and then had didn't have a clue about how to govern. But he there was a quote from one of his fans. I mean, let me try to get exactly right. He said, I might have the word slightly wrong, but he said, he's a good man. It's not his fault. He hasn't done nothing. You know, it was, it was like, sort of finding a way to, you know, make allowances for this person. And I think that there's a, I mean, that came to mind because we were talking about him earlier, but there certainly have been cases where, plenty of cases where politicians were perceived as, you know, bringing home the bacon or standing up for an important cause for someone. And people just sort of, you know, they tried not to believe allegations about them. And if it became, came to a point where you couldn't deny it, then they found a reason not to care. I, that's just part of human psychology, I think in it. It pops up in politics more than I think people like to admit. Again, I wouldn't be real clear. I'm not saying this is like unique to Trump, right? In any way, I'm saying like, this is concerning to me more than what I think is a somewhat fake debate about news. So you're saying you're more sort of concerned about this as an ongoing problem, not as a, not as something that's cited for a moment. Yeah. I mean, I can certainly see that. But you know, I don't know if there's any way to get, to get rid of that. I think that one reason it keeps recurring is because, you know, people have an amazing capacity to believe what they want to believe. And you don't have to look at politics for that. I'm sure you have everybody has at least one family member when they're extended relatives, you know, that, you know, that, you know, is, is like that. So I don't know if there's a way around it. It's just, you know, the question is, how do you then deal with that? But at least we can be, at least we can rest easily enough knowing that it's something we've always managed to survive in the past. You brought up something that I did want to get to. I've always loved this saying, you know, you can't cheat an honest man. And I wonder if there's a way that that applies to conspiracy thinking as well, not I don't want to have a value judgment on people who, you know, believe in conspiracy theories, but more like, do conspiracy theories capture people who already want to believe something? I think that in general, I think that's not even specific to conspiracy. I think just interpretations of the world are obviously more appealing to, I mean, I know that I, I'm sure this is true of you too, as a journalist, I have to work hard not to just sort of jump on the interpretation that most fits the story that would be convenient for me to tell, you know, I mean, that's something that you've got to work against. And not everybody works against it. And even if you're working against it, you sometimes fall into those traps. And it's certainly something that happens a lot with, I mean, conspiracy theories catch on when they fill a need. One of the central themes of this book is that, you know, even when there is a conspiracy theory says absolutely nothing true about, you know, the subjects of the theory, if it catches on, then it says something true about the anxieties and the experiences of the people who believe and tell the story. And, you know, that's, again, this is just part of our human psychology. We will find stories that reinforce just as we, we don't just adjust, we can adjust our worldview to fit the world, but we can also, you know, try to sort of adjust the world to fit our worldview. I, that came out wrong, but I hope you know what I meant. I do. And maybe that gets us to something I definitely wanted to cover before I let you go, which is that, you know, one man's conspiracy is another man's collusion, maybe, which is to say, it's, when someone else believes that it's a conspiracy theory, right? When I believe it, it's a plot by Russia to engineer elections in the United States. And I, there's a, there's a popular critique, I think, that doesn't really come from the right, it comes from, I don't know, intellectual Twitter, that there is as much conspiracy mongering going on on the left as there is the right. And I feel like that's something maybe I want to ask you about if, if that gets covered in a way that is satisfying or useful. So a couple of different things. I mean, like, first of all, like I said earlier, everyone is capable of believing conspiracies. So absolutely, there is plenty of conspiracy mongering on both the left and the right, you know, I mean, the question that people are insisting out is, you know, who's being, who's right and who's a nut. And I got to say, there's a pretty good share of nuttiness on both sides. You know, even even when there's truth, it gets buried in a lot of nuttiness because it's not just, I mean, I said earlier, even a false story can have these grains of truth about people's experiences. The flip side of that is even a true conspiracy will then produce a whole bunch of dubious conspiracy theories built on it. I mean, everyone acknowledges that Watergate was a real conspiracy. There's still lots of conspiracy theories about Watergate. So there's a lot to cut through there. But then, oh, you said something that sparked another thought. Hopefully more than one thing. Yeah, yeah. I'm in something specific. Well, I was just asking about, I mean, in thinking of my audience, which, you know, probably skews pretty left, I am thinking about myself too. You're right. Like, I'm because I've, you know, worked in journalism for a long time. I have a kind of professional habit of trying to check my assumptions, you know, that I am aware of that very human tendency to cherry pick data and to, you know, confirmation bias and all that. And, you know, try to be aware. But we are in a time where there are, there are a lot of real conspiracies, you know, or we talk about things that could be construed as conspiracies that happen on the front page of a lot of different newspapers. And I'm wondering what kind of tools people can use to just to help guide them so to help, you know, find their way through the thicket of possible conspiracies out there. Yeah, with the understanding that, all right, yes, the usual things apply about critical thinking, checking the evidence. If there's a source that's being quoted going to the source, and then if you can yourself, because you can't, if it's just a quote from an unnamed official, you can't. But if if it's something that I know so often on Twitter, since you mentioned intellectual Twitter, something will some snippet out of context will, you know, reveal something else when you look at the, so I mean, all these obvious things about, you know, checking and rechecking and, and trying to find the hidden context and not just sleeping for the interpretation that most fits, you know, what you want to be outraged about that day. But having settled that these are things that trip up the journalists who are looking into these things, it can be really difficult for someone who's just a consumer and not sourced up and so on in these stories. And I, and I say for that matter, it's, it can be difficult for a journalist who's sourced up in one area and then is looking at another one and isn't quite sure what to believe, because that's not where the people you, you know, constantly interact with, can, you know, fill you in on the other sides of the story. So I feel like this is not a very satisfying answer for you. The service journalism portion of this, of this podcast has failed utterly basically. Yeah, sorry. Well, I, you know, I will say in general, part of what one thing I really don't like about the discussion around, you know, Russia and so on is there's this idea that, and it's not even, I'm not even necessarily a false idea, but there's this notion and this kind of gets to that. You mentioned that that word post truth earlier, which is a word I dislike because it's because it's when people say post truth era, I try to imagine when was this truth era that I apparently missed on at some point in the past. But there's this idea that is it well, what the Russians really want is for us not to know what to think for people to have this feeling of uncertainty. And there's this feeling that, you know, we can be just sort of frozen and not even try to do things if we feel like we don't know what's going on. Quite a part from whether that is actually, you know, the aim of people engaged in this information and may well be the case, set that aside. A general feeling of uncertainty and not being entirely sure what's going on, I think is a good mental habit to cultivate. I think that you obviously can't go through life like, you know, like the sort of radical skeptic who isn't sure of anything around him, you know, but it's a it's really actually a good practice to to consider the things that seem not outlandish to you, but like outside your normal realms of belief and also how do I know this thing that I think I know. And and if you've got radically different narratives and it's not obvious to you as a as a news consumer, which one to believe, it's not such a bad thing to pay attention to both of them as both of these storylines as they develop and and leave your mind open to either one or maybe neither one being true. I mean, I think, you know, this kind of radical uncertainty, it's part of the human condition. We don't know what's going on. Someone who is an expert is someone who knows more than you about one thing and is still abysmally ignorant about almost everything because that's that's just our lives. We have extremely partial knowledge and we sort of navigate through life and we do a pretty good job of navigating through life, you know, with these, you know, bits and pieces that we that we can pick up. And it's it's it doesn't have to be something that leaves people debilitated, just to sort of recognize that, you know, this is true. And earlier we were talking about how now other worldviews are more visible because you can go online and see the rumors that people are, you know, passing around that previously would have been done at, you know, some drugstore you don't walk into or barbershop or whatever, you know, maybe we're not in like this sort of maybe what's this different about this era is not that we've got all these competing realities or mental realities floating around. It's the the fact that we are so much more intensely aware of what other ones are out there. And maybe sometimes run across something that might make you question some something that you thought was a solid part of the world, but perhaps it was just part of, you know, the assumptions of your in group. I so again, I think, again, it's just not in itself a bad mental habit to cultivate that uncertainty. You may not have heard of Rothy's, but I'm guessing you've probably seen them. I mean, they're all over my Instagram feed. That is the way that I knew that they existed before they started being a sponsor. And then they started being a sponsor. And I mentioned it on Twitter at some point. And I got a direct message from the person who I can now name Shannon Watts, the head of mom's demand action. And she said it's actually an inside joke, I guess not inside joke so much, at mom's demand action that they are all Rothy's wearers, like they'll take pictures of their feet at a march. So I'm telling you, you don't need my opinion. If Rothy's are the shoes that the women trying to change gun laws in America, where for their marches, I think they've got to be good. I love my pair. I have a pair of the Lofur kind. They also have a sneaker style and a flat style. They're stylish and versatile. They go with everything from yoga pants to dresses and skirts. They have a wide range of colors and patterns. They're available. I guess it's for different silhouettes. So sneaker, Lofur, flat, and there must be one I'm missing. They are made from recycled plastic bottles so you can feel good about them in that way as well. There is zero break-in period for these shoes and another major bonus in this I really like in the summertime. They are fully machine washable. Every time you need to refresh them, just toss them in the washing machine. It is like getting a fresh pair every laundry day. So check out all the amazing styles, including that one I couldn't remember right now at rottheys.com slash W-F-L-T. Again, go to rottheys R-O-T-H-Y-S dot com slash W-F-L-T to get your new favorite flats. I should mention Shannon Watts is going to be on this show next month. Maybe I'll have her do an ad read with me for Rothy's. Stay tuned and go to rottheys.com slash W-F-L-T today. So it's funny that ad copy they send me for third love is the same every time. But since I genuinely love my third love bra, I get to sort of make it up each time because I always have something new to say about it. The only thing I will vary from the ad copy they have given me is I personally do not forget I have it on, but I think that's a good thing. I don't want to forget I have a bra. I'd be like forgetting you have clothes on. I mean, you don't think about it and that's cool. But you know, you don't want to accidentally not wear it because you've forgotten to put it on and you don't notice that you don't have it on. Anyway, what I love about third love today is that their bras are very pretty. It is now sleeveless weather in Minneapolis, tank top weather, the weather where you're probably going to have your bra straps showing whether you want to or not. So you might as well have some nice bra straps. They have a new bra that has like sort of regular straps on the front and then on the back where they're on top of your shoulders and down it's a lace triangle. So it looks very much like you're, you know, wanting to show it. It is a choice that you were showing your bra and I personally think that is always better than making it look like your bra straps slipped. They do fit great. I discovered through love that I am a half size bra person. I already knew that the my girls were two different sizes, but now I have a split the difference kind of size. And honestly, the two third love bras that I have that are in that half size, I wear a lot more often than I wear my other bras.

And Parker, unfortunately, will bring us news of, like I said, an actual conspiracy, whether or not you think of it as one, that the Trump administration is perpetuating against trans people. Parker Malloy, editor at large, for Media Matters for America. Parker, welcome back to the show. Hey, thanks so much for having me. So the main reason I thought of you for this week, besides always thinking of you, is that, you know, two years ago, you were warning us about how bad the Trump administration was going to be for trans people. And you were told that you were being alarmist, right? Like, you've said this, and I sort of remember, I remember getting called alarmist about the stuff I was worried about. And well, it's never fun to be Cassandra. But I'm wondering what your perspective is from that time two years ago to now, like, sure, you didn't want to be right. I know. Yeah, sure. So, so basically, you know, as you were saying, I was kind of predicting that the Trump administration would be more or less a total nightmare for transgender people and people responded, as you were saying, by saying, oh, you're, you're being ridiculous. Like they were, there were people comparing this to, you know, how people will care, kind of like clearly not being serious. They'll be like, oh, I'm going to Canada. It's like, no, you're not. But they kind of lumped me in there. They were like, Oh, what do you think this is going to turn into Handmaid's Tale? Oh, you think this is going to, you know, what's the worst that can happen? Can't you see that Trump, Trump respects LGBT people? He said it during his, during his speech, and he held a flag. And what more do you want? And, you know, and I kept trying to make the point to people that that when he was, whenever he would, he would cite, you know, when he, he sputtered out the LGBTQ community during his, during the RNC speech, that was in the context of talking about the pulse, the attack, the pulse nightclub attack. And so basically, it was him saying that he, he would protect the LGBTQ community from a hostile foreign ideology. Basically, he was, he was using that to, to say that, you know, to spread his anti Muslim kind of views. So, he was really just using us as a prop to attack someone else. And I kept trying to point that out, but people kept coming back to this. Hey, he said it. Isn't that good? And the same thing I saw this week when, you know, after he tweeted something about as we celebrate LGBT Pride Month or something like that, there were, there were people who were like, Hey, that's pretty cool, right? And I'm like, no, I don't care. Honestly, I really don't care if if he tweets about these things, or if he, or if he puts out a, a White House official note about Pride Month, that doesn't, that doesn't matter to trans people. That doesn't, that probably doesn't matter to most, most LGBT people, you know, it's, it's, it's kind of meaningless. And I get that it can be a nice gesture if the actions that, you know, underlie that are hostile, it doesn't mean anything. And in fact, it's, it's insulting. And I think that my, my response was, was kind of when I saw that tweet was, was filled with at least two expletives, I think. So, you know, it was, it was like, I can't believe this guy. But that's, that's kind of been, been the case in the past couple weeks have been really, really bad for, for trans people, especially, because you had, you had back on May 24th, the Department of Health and Human Services released a, a rule to essentially amend the Affordable Care Act, the non-discrimination portion to say that it does not cover transgender people. And that doctors can turn people, so basically giving doctors the green light to deny coverage to trans people, to turn trans people away to basically not treat us like human beings. And the way that they wrote this out was explaining this like, hey, doctors shouldn't have to perform transgender specific surgeries if they don't want to. And that's not, that's not something that's happening. It's not, it's not a real problem. They're, they're rolling this out saying that that's the problem. But the thing is that these surgeries are so specialized that the only people you would ever ask to perform them are specialists who, who decided they want to do this for trans people. So this is really just about giving your average doctor the go ahead to, to go, ew, I don't want to deal with you. And there are all these stories out there from, from years past about trans people who've, who've been denied very, very basic care. And it's really scary. And you see that you see these stories out there about something like 30, 20 or 30% of trans people in the past year have either had a bad experience at a doctor or have put off going to the doctor because they're afraid of having another bad experience. So it's, it's something that is, is really scary. And while I think I will personally be okay with, in with all of these sorts of rules that get rolled out that are, that are harmful. Another one is a, a about housing discrimination and public housing. That probably won't directly affect me. And the, the healthcare one might not directly affect me either. As I'm, I work for a place that, that pays me and is fine with me being trans. I live in Chicago of all places. I am white. I am middle class. You know, you, there are all these things that I have that are that really are privileges. And that, that insulates me a little bit from some of what's to come for, for other, other groups of trans people, especially trans women of color who are at risk, most at risk for new HIV infections, poverty, homelessness, all of these sorts of things. You've got the, the military, the housing, healthcare, and then just today, there was an announcement that the Trump, Trump administration was cutting AIDS funding or HIV funding. So you've, you've got this, this situation where everything that can go wrong for, for trans people kind of is, this is really a worst case scenario. Yeah. And I also want to just pin something for people where you said this, this rule that doctors don't have to provide services to trans people and make very clear, you know, this isn't about getting like, you know, Doc Wilson down the street from doing gender reassignment surgery. Right. Like that's not, oh, yeah. That wasn't happening before. You weren't going to Doc Wilson for gender reassignment surgery. This is about allowing doctors who feel icky about trans people to just not treat them at all. And I want to just say point out something because you've said it before, and I think it's really, I don't know if people realize the depth of importance of this, that for trans people going to the doctor in the first place, even if it's a completely like non, you know, even if there weren't legal issues, like it's kind of fraught to begin with, right? Like you've spoken about that before. Like it's a very vulnerable thing to do. My primary care doctor is at the local LGBT clinic, and I still feel awkward and sometimes not super comfortable there. You know, that's, that's the best possible scenario. But there is a, there's a situation there was a few years ago, what was this was in 2015. It wasn't until 2016 that the Obama administration clarified, you can't discriminate against trans people. It took that long to kind of get that through. So there was this transgender man. So someone who was a signed female at birth, who went to the doctor because he had a lump, you know, lump on his chest and went in and they did a mammogram and a biopsy. And he, he didn't receive any test results. So he assumed everything was fine, because generally no news is good news when it comes to doctors. And so we finally get to call a couple weeks later saying, hi, I was just curious how you were doing with your diagnosis. And so he says, what diagnosis? And then it turns out that his doctor didn't call him. And it turned out that he had very aggressive breast cancer. And his doctor said, let's see, his doctor ended up saying that, you know, the, I have a real, real problem with your transgender status. And then when I found out you were transgender, the first thing I wanted to do, my first impulse was to send you to psychiatry. So this was someone, and this was in New York, this was in Manhattan. This was not not in the middle of nowhere. So this was, this was a situation where a man had cancer and wasn't being told because the doctor was grossed out by him being trans. And that's just horrible. And that shouldn't happen. And that has happened so many times to so many people in the past. And you'd like to think that these things are things of the past, but they can come back because discrimination comes in all sorts of forms. And sometimes it's not super obvious either. It's making someone wait an extra hour in the emergency room waiting room. It's not calling them and telling them about a diagnosis. It's not getting them a quick treatment when they're in a car accident on the street. These sorts of things, they matter. And if you are in are the administration, and you keep signaling that trans people don't have rights, that we don't have legal protections that there are no repercussions for treating us poorly, then people are going to take notice. And you saw that with the with the trans student memo that got kind of walked back where you where you saw that that happened. And then trans kids started getting bullied more. And because they are getting this message from the government saying, hey, it's okay to bully trans kids. Hey, schools, it's okay to not protect trans kids. So you have teachers treating them differently. You have schools, you have students teaching, treating all of all of these kids who just want to live differently. And it's so exhausting. And now you have there's a case in front of the that's going to be heard by the Supreme Court about a trans woman who was fired by a funeral home for coming out as trans. And the whichever way the Supreme Court rules on that, which is likely to say that trans people aren't covered under existing laws, even though other courts have been finding that the Supreme Court's getting very Trumpified. That's going to have a big effect. That's going to send a very clear message to trans people don't have rights when it comes to employment once and for all. So all of these stories are out there and they're very, very scary. And the downside, the scary thing, just just like really quick is this is that it's not being covered in in the news very much at all. Yeah, I feel like some of it gets like flashpoint coverage. Like the bullshit Trump said today about how trans people shouldn't be allowed in the military because they take prescription drugs. Like because we're all like fascinated by the oath in the Oval Office, I think like his particular misstatements get covered as though like look Donald Trump did another stupid thing. But the systemic part of of what the Trump administration is doing, I think this is true overall, by the way, of like how the Trump administration gets covered. It's like the daily tweet fart is headlines. The systemic rolling back of protections of trans people of people of color of disabled people of women, whatever, like that doesn't get the same kind of attention. You know, like it's all just like, we cover the pratfalls. We don't cover the totalitarianism. Sure. And there was a there was a story. It came out last week about about what's going on at HHS right now. And basically in the headline, it's from Reuters. It's as Trump rewrites health rules, Penn sees conservative agenda born again. And they talk about how everything is is is every Trump's Twitter provides perfect cover. So here's a quote from the article. It's one of the benefits of Trump's Twitter approach is it creates headlines. And that's what it's intended to do. And underneath those headlines, everyone else in the administration can go about peacefully doing their jobs. David McIntosh, president of the conservative club for growth and long time Pence friend, HHS, and then his quote continues released very released several very important significant regulations that change the nature of Obamacare of health care with very little coverage in the press. So right there you have you have someone who's who's very close and very involved in all of this saying flat out that that part of their their goal of getting these radical prop policies through is that they're hoping that people won't really pay attention that they'll pay attention to the tweet fart, you know, they'll pay attention to that. And so at media matters, we did a we did a little study or LGBT team did a study on the coverage of the the HUD rule that would allow federally funded homeless shelters to deny admission to trans women, the HHS rule about health care, and then also the rule put out by or that's Axios reported that will affect federally funded adoption agencies, giving them the ability to deny adoption to LGBT people. And so those three policies, they're all very, very, uh, you know, important. And so between May 22nd and May 31st, we monitored the broadcast networks and the cable news networks. And in total, there was 11 minutes of coverage, total. There was there were zero minutes of ABC zero minutes of CBS zero of MSNBC and zero of NBC. CNN covered these three policies for seven minutes and 32 seconds. And Fox news covered them for three minutes and 26 seconds, which was mostly an interview with Ben Carson, where he just lied and said that this was about protecting everyone or being fair to everybody was as quote. So the we have data that shows that these these stories aren't being covered. Uh, we know what happens when, when these policies get implemented. And we know that not covering these stories is part of their, of the Trump agenda. That's important to making it work. And yet we're talking about the, the tweet controversy of the week or something that is petty and bad, but doesn't necessarily known, known will die because of it. Um, you know, like the, the, the ordeal with the ship named after John McCain, that's, that's terrible. And it's petty and all of that, but did it need to be like a three day story, uh, at the expense of these other stories that, that affect people's everyday lives, probably not where the administration admits it and then they don't back and forth. And what, and what, what's really, um, frustrating about all of this so much of this is that, uh, you don't see this talked about on the Sunday morning talk shows and, or when you do, it'll be someone there from something like focus on the family or the family research council. You'll, you'll have this both sides kind of approach to it where on one hand there's all this propaganda. And then they're on the other, they treat someone saying exactly what these rules will really do as just another both sides. He said she said kind of situation. I think another reason why the posity of coverage here is alarming is that people don't make a connection between these rules and A, the everyday lives of trans people, right? And B, another systemic thing, like the systemic rollback of everyone's rights. You know, like it's, may start with trans people or be, they may be at the tip of the spear as far as like, I don't know what the right metaphor is, but this is the thing that the administration is doing to all kinds of vulnerable groups and all the coverage never is about what's happening to the vulnerable groups. This is something we've talked about in the show before, but like it's also parallel to the coverage of white supremacy in the mainstream media, which is to say white supremacy gets covered as a thing that white people are doing, you know, and sometimes it's covered critically, sure, but it's not covered as a thing that's happening to people of color. Do you know what I mean? Like it's just, right, look at these terrible Nazis and you know what they are, they're terrible and we should know about them and they should be covered. But look at these people who are the subject of this, not just this terrible Nazi person, but the systemic, you know, oppression that's happening, right? Like this isn't just a case. I think that when we focus on white supremacy and white supremacist, again, they need to be covered. But when the focus is on them, it allows people to think, well, those are the people who are the problem, right? Like it's just the Nazis that we have to worry about. And no, like, no, I mean, the thing about the trans issue, you've said this before, like you're enabling bullying in general, I would say, you know, like you're sending a message that not only, you know, not just trans people are okay to bully, but people who are anyone you think of as weaker, smaller, different, like they don't that we our society isn't set up to protect them. And this is a, you know, this is your discomfort is reason enough to be oppressive. Yeah, well, and so I was talking with someone the other day about, yeah, I won't say who, but anyway, I was talking to someone who works in media, what they thought the overall kind of plan of this was of all the LDBC rules that were being introduced. And they said, oh, I think I think it's just Trump wants to roll back everything Obama did. And I said, no, that's not it. It's way, way more than that. It's a, it's, it's about implementing these sort of policies that, you know, when you when you look at the bigger picture, these aren't isolated incidents, as you, as you were saying, these, this is part of a larger plan, a larger movement as these rulings that will come in, because every, everything that's going to happen is going to be challenged in the courts. And sadly, the courts are increasingly being being run by, by activists, you know, right wing activists. So, so you've, you've got that. But when you combine this with when you look at what's happening right now with abortion, and what's happening with enforcement of, you know, it's rolling back the title, the title nine school rule that had to do with not, you know, not having disproportionate punishments on the basis of race. So you've got that you've got, you know, what's happening with abortion, you've got what's happening with trans people, you've got the, the religious exceptions for discriminating against against gay people, that's all happening. And if you, if you want to know how we, how we get to, you know, to go back to the handmaids, if you want to know how we get to Gilead, it's, it's not just the abortion stuff. It's, it's this broader picture. It's about creating, creating a world where there are very, very clear hierarchies. And you will have trans people essentially made to feel as though we can't exist in public. If you, if you make it, if you make it illegal for a trans person to use, to use the bathroom, they can only leave their home for as long as their bladder will hold. If you, you know, if you make abortion illegal and punishable by, you know, and punishable by 20 years in prison or whatever it is, then you're going to have doctors afraid to treat pregnant women. So you've got all of these things are happening right now. And I think a lot of people are seeing them as totally disconnected from one another. And I think that that's why, that's why right now it's, it's more important than than ever that journalists, especially connect these dots. This isn't, I get that it kind of sounds, you know, as I, as I say, all of what's happening out loud, it all sounds very hyperbolic, but at the same time, it's not. It's, yeah, this is, this is all these are all things that are actually happening. The, the administration in the HHS role, for instance, included a line that said it made a reference to Title 9, having a, it was the administration's position that Title 9 does not protect trans trans students, but it protects other students from trans students. So basically, it was the argument that, that trans students are inherently a threat to other students and other students are protected under nondiscrimination law from having to even possibly share a restroom facility with a trans person, even unknowingly. To the extent we can, I would like to turn to maybe slightly less dire outlook or, or subject, which is the democratic candidates. What do you want to hear from them that, that would give you a sense that they understand the scope of the problem and that things have at least a chance of getting better? What are the kinds of things you want to hear from the possible nominees? Yeah, I, I want, I really want to hear, because the courts are going to be so extremely important in coming years, I want to hear about plans for what's going to happen with the Supreme Court or what, what they will look for in judges. The one thing that Trump did that was actually, I think, pretty smart on his part was he put out a list of judges that he, that he liked and conservatives looked at that and they were able to say, see, like, oh, these are the people who'll put on there, which was put out there to calm people who were afraid he was going to put Judge Judy on the bench or something like that. So I think that something like that would honestly be somewhat helpful, or at least put out some parameters. I want to hear that, that these candidates know that these problems exist in that they matter and even if there's, whether there's one trans person in the country or 100 million of us, there's, we should all have the same rights and the same goes for any other group and that they, that they care about all Americans, all people in the country. And I think that that's, that's going to be important and to not downplay the problem. After the 2016 election, there were a lot of, there was a lot of hand-ringing about whether identity politics costs Clinton the election, which obviously they didn't. If it was just, it was a way to offload everything onto marginalized groups. And I think that a lot of, there's been a lot of reluctance to kind of dive into that, but there's an act of attack happening on, on the rights of some of the most vulnerable people in the country right now. And I think that it can't be, it can't be under, understated. And so I, I really appreciate it when I do see a candidate who will say that it's, that a specific administration policy is not, not right or not fair. And to call that out, even if it's obvious that you know that they would, they would oppose said policy. Are any of the candidates talking about trans rights in a way that you appreciate? Because I feel like it hasn't been, like you said, like coverage of this issue just doesn't really break, break into the mainstream very much. So who's, who's talking about it in a way that that, again, like we could be a little bit, at least find a model for if not actually be hopeful. Sure. I think, I think that Pete Buttigieg had a, he had a really good, good answer during a CNN town hall a couple, couple months back, I think, about talking about trans people and employment discrimination. He had a great answer on that. You had Kamala Harris kind of step forward and talk about her ever evolving position on sex work and trans rights together. You have, you know, and she doesn't have that. Yeah, she does, she doesn't have the, the, the best track record on either of those issues. And whether people want to trust that, that's up to them. Elizabeth Warren is very out, out front with that. Joe Biden kind of fumbles that a little bit. He, he suggested recently that, um, that if trans people, it's something like we need to get Trump out of there. So trans women of color, which is great that he, he notices this or he's told about this. Um, so they stopped getting murdered. It's, but at the same time, while he was vice president, this was still an issue that was going on. Getting Trump out of there isn't some magic, magic bullet, you know, but at the same time, Biden wrote a really thoughtful introduction to this trans woman, Sarah McBride. She used to work for his son, Bo. Joe Biden wrote the introduction to her novel or not novel at her memoir. And, and it was very, very thoughtful. And it was, it was exactly the kind of thing that I would want to hear from candidates. And that was when I was still working at Upworthy and I wrote a piece about that. So, um, someone you can, you can search and you can find this passage that I thought was very thoughtful at the time, but it seems like he's kind of, uh, I have no clue what he's running on. Yeah, I don't, I don't know if he knows, he's running on being Joe Biden, basically. He's Joe Biden. He's, he's, he's the onion character. Yeah, he's running on being Joe Biden, the meme, I think. Yeah, exactly. Um, you know, this is, this is actually conspiracy month here at with friends like these. Okay. And I've made a point of highlighting how I think we should be, um, not so quick to brush off all everything we hear, um, that's going to be maybe sounds crazy as a conspiracy theory. Like, I'm in favor of actually considering it for a minute. You know, like, let's think through it. Because as, as deeply as American, as American history is, is woven through with conspiracy theories, it's woven through with conspiracies, like active conspiracies to harm people who are marginalized, already marginalized, um, the Tuskegee experiments, um, Japanese internment camps, those are my two top examples, but you know what, this seems like a conspiracy. I mean, like, I, I'm not, I hope you realize I am not belittling or marginalizing this by seeing its conspiracy to, to, uh, you know, eliminate trans people. I think that is actually what it is. Yeah. I mean, it's on, it's on the Family Research Council's website. Um, they, they have like a five, a five point, uh, plan to, to essentially wipe trans people off the, uh, off, out of public life. And that, and in, in the case that I've mentioned earlier about the woman at the, um, funeral home, the lawyer representing or from Alliance Defending Freedom, which is the right wing religious lawyer group, um, said that it was that discriminating against trans people is, is, is, uh, something that's done out of love to try to discourage us from being trans, which is not how any of this works. So I mean, it's, it's, it's a conspiracy, but they're very, they're pretty open about it. They just know that not a lot of people care. And on the topic of conspiracies, I, um, if you haven't read, uh, have you read, uh, Republic of Lies by Anna Marlin? That just recently, oh, that book is so good. I, like that, that was one I went through in like a day. So, um, I recommend that. Um, so thank you so much, uh, for being with us. I actually, before we wrap up, I have another question. How are you holding up? Uh, up and down. Um, I recently started with a new therapist, which is, um, Kaela and I recently moved, uh, to, to a nice, nice place that I, that we both enjoy and my room is quieter that I can, I can record in, um, less background noise here. But, um, yeah, I've been having somewhat of a rough go of it because sometimes some days I wake up and I see, uh, get a push notification telling me that my, my rights are being rolled back. And then when I go to talk about it on Twitter, I get a bunch of people saying, your rights are non-under attack. And I feel like sometimes I feel like I'm losing my mind. And that's, uh, it's very frustrating. And at the same time, I, I don't like being, um, you know, I'm not, I'm not an activist. I'm, I'm, I'm a writer. I'm a, I, I, I, a journalist-ish. Um, but it's, uh, it's, it's something worth increasingly. I feel like I need to, to point these things out and talk about trans issues, even though that's not the focus of my life. And I don't want it to be the focus of my life. Um, and it's a matter of life and death. I mean, yeah, it's, it's something that I feel like I have to use my platform. I have to use my, my platform to not just for myself, but to, to help others. And I've been trying to do more behind the scenes kind of help with, you know, when a journalist writes something about trans people and it's maybe not super great, maybe just sending an email, being like, Hey, if you have any questions, I'm around. You know, just kind of like, if you need to know how to phrase something that's not going to have Twitter yelling at you, I'm here. I'm trying. Thank you so much for being on the show Parker. Yeah, thanks so much for having me always. I'm always happy to be on. And that is it for the show. Please take care of yourselves."
