He'll be joining his third hour talking about NYC and how not just New York City but also the Biden regime is trying to message and position with the end of the COVID vaccine and mask mandates for now remember it is always temporary and with that in mind wanted to start off with 10 airline CEOs 10 airline CEOs have written a letter to Joe Biden Specifically citing the drop in cases and the different period of time now with regard to the the COVID situation and how there needs to be an end in April 18th, I think is when it expires the Interstate travel based vaccine. I'm sorry mask mandate for interstate travel. So Amtrak planes you name it 10 airline CEOs are coming out to say have written this and signed their names to this letter to the Biden regime Clay they're saying look we're in a different place now. They had I mean there's just some fascinating parts of this They had over 6,000 unruly passenger incidents last year Involve over 70% of those are mask issues Me and passengers who get agitated about this Then I just want to put out there. There are two aspects of this policy that have always just shown us how stupid it is One is it is not a mask up policy It is officially and you hear this when the announcement comes out a mask up between bites policy There's zero signs to just buy this and then there's the filtration systems on the plane Do you think the Biden administration will finally take its hand off the throat off the face of the American people when it comes to flying? Well, so let's break this down for everybody Remember this was set to expire on March the 18th and then the Biden administration extended it for at least another month so it goes till April 18th now and I think a lot of the CEOs from the airlines remember the Southwest CEO and the American airline CEO under oath in Congress testified that their filtration systems rendered it far safer to be on an airplane for instance than almost anywhere else that you could be and I think this is significant but because I just want to run through the 10 different airline CEOs Alaska Airlines American Airlines Atlas Air worldwide Delta FedEx obviously FedEx has I think more planes than anybody in the world for the package deliveries Hawaiian Airlines jet blue airways southwest airlines united UPS and then someone from airlines for America. So this is about as extensive if you fly on domestic air travel in the United States the CEO of your airline Probably that you are flying most frequently came out and said this is a Mindless it doesn't make any sense. They wrote a directive letter to Biden and they laid out the fact that the data I mean again, I know the Democrats claim to be the party of science but they have all different sorts of protocols and they basically just laid out all the data out of Why they are Completely unnecessary as it pertains to mask mandates going forward. Now. Here's the question buck Will Joe Biden As we get prepared for this April 18th date because he already extended it for a month on March 18th Will this have impact because I'll tell you this when we wrote about it at out kick the site traffic on this is Monumentally massive because lots of places frankly aren't gonna cover this right? This should be to me You tell me if you think I'm wrong on this. I don't understand how this isn't front page news If you're just being honest about what news is for the New York Times for the Washington Post I don't know how it's not being covered covered by CNN and MSNBC to get 10 airline CEOs to all write a letter to the president Laying out why there's no basis whatsoever to justify a mask mandate Here's the other thing I would say I'd call on the CEOs to Resend all of the bands of the people that were banned over mask mandates Because look you talked about 70% of them of the of the airline issues. You know buck you travel It's high stress a lot of times you got a kid with you. You're worried about making your flight You're probably trying to get somewhere on time and then a flight attendant comes by and is sort of Constantly chirping at you about make sure your mask is above your nose and you can see you can see why people Every now and then chirp back and then those conversations accelerate where both sides get angry, right? This was also how this happens Yeah, this is also how you knew that Fauci was a fraud very early on because To say that masks keep you safe on a plane where the air is cleaner than Effectively anywhere else the virus is because of the systems they have on the plane. No one disputes that signs Let's be clear. Yeah, no one says that the airline CEOs Don't know what they're talking about when it comes to the air filtration systems on their planes So that's not in dispute But beyond that as I said the mask between bites policy meant that there was always an arbitrary and Comprecious nature of the enforcement of this it was did the airline attend and happen and by the I know we have airline Attendants who listen to us and they're great patriots. They're awesome people I'm not talking about you if you were one of the people who were like sir Look, would you mind because you know other passengers might flip out? There were those people and I experienced that and I get it they want to keep their jobs They don't want they didn't want complaints about them right about the airline attendant not enforcing it But then there were the people I mean I will never forget I had I had a male airline attendant Tell me my mask look and he yelled at me your mask is too thin sir put on a different mask And I'm looking at this guy. I was like you are a true moron and a fascist. Do you realize that? I wish I had said that but they would have kicked me off the plane This this shows us how stupid it was the whole time And and I think it's important clay and it should be a bigger news story I'm glad that out kick out kick calm. I'm glad that out kick is doing a good Huge traffic on it because people need to know we need normal now We don't need the continuation. This is the verb This is like the frisking of of granny from oklahoma In her wheelchair as a possible suicide bomber risk on the airplane remember that we saw those videos, you know This is the equivalent policy of making you know veterans Uh, you know strip down and and have the tsa, you know imbecile Checking to see if if a you know a veterans Prosthetic is maybe you know, maybe smuggling a weapon onto the plane. This is crazy And we had it was never smart. It was never rational. It was never reasonable And the by-administration. This is a really interesting moment clay because What are how are they going to say the science is with them on this like what is the argument even? There is a it's a it's a great question And I don't know how they responded this. I mean, I understand biden's overseas right now, uh with nato But I hope that there are white house media that will hold him accountable and ask him Given the science you claim that you are the party of science There's no way. I mean again. I think this is wildly significant that all 10 ceos have signed this letter together And the reason why I think they're doing it together is it makes it harder to argue and pick and pull apart One of them or the other of them and remember buck, uh, we got to give credit There are a lot of different airline pilots now who have filed a lawsuit Arguing that the cdc doesn't have the authority to continue to implement this policy as it pertains to air travel and also I think it's significant that the senate by a 57 to 40 margin if i'm not mistaken Which is given where we are at 50 50 era where there's almost no bipartisanship Remember mit romney was the only embecile who voted against the uh republican who voted against the mass mandate being lifted This is pretty significant when you put all that together And I wish that we could get a case accelerated to the supreme court Because in the same way that they struck down the vaccine mandate as exceeding the authority of osha I think there is an argument that after two years the cdc has exceeded their authority to continue to roll This uh, this vac this mask mandate as it's being removed everywhere else. Yeah, I I go back and forth because on the one hand I I want The pot the stupid policies to end right? I mean that that is there's an urgency to that And and because the the further we go To the the end destination here of actual normalcy the harder it will be for them because they want to right now They're preparing for next fall and you know, and we already said they're gonna say there's no doubt Doesn't take the virus seriously this summer because they're idiots and they act like no one can remember anything Uh, we have to get to total normalcy now so that it makes it harder for the pendulum to swing back to lunacy Fauci's not done. You know, there there's gonna be this whole effort And I think that that's why the mask mandate on the planes is such an important fight for us to have And I I also think uh clay You know, we're seeing more and more people recognize It's it's slow, but it is growing What have what were we made to do this whole time? I mean what is wrong with these? Democrat politicians and the stupid things that they said because you know what i'm hearing Oh, well, we learned a lot during the pandemic a lot of things change that wasn't their attitude even a few months ago You're right a few months ago. It was we got it all right. We we knew exactly, you know, fauci is a genius Now you're starting to hear Yeah, there were some lessons learned. Oh, yeah, there were oh, yeah, there were so How these things end is the point i was trying to make i want them to end But I also want them to end because people realized that they never should have happened in the first place That's important and also Don't allow this to be one of those things where you swing back and forth Right when we end the mask mandate on airplanes I want to drive it into the ground so that it never comes back because The data tells us just just go ahead and and and star this segment of the show In the summer the hotter it is in the south florida in particular other parts of the south Cases go up july in august is when covet has typically surged in florida in texas in georgia In tennessee all over the south because if you remember last year buck right before football season fauci was like oh There's no way we're going to be able to play football season without case of skyrocketing And then as the temperature starts to decline and people spend more time outside Guess what happens? COVID dries up in the south and it moves to the north where when it starts to get cold everybody goes inside It's so clear. What's going to happen and what's happened the past two years is every time this occurs Oh, the reason why this is happening is because florida doesn't take covet seriously enough ronda santhis is killing everyone It may even be more aggressive this year buck because it's an election year And the governor's ship is up in florida So they may even try to sell that crap even harder this year than they have in the past two years They'll do everything that it can to make it seem like the best governor when it comes to record fact and reality in america During the pandemic ronda santhis or florida is the worst He's awful Everyone died in florida. Don't you realize no it turned out that's not the case in fact everyone We survived the winner of death everybody listening to us congratulations Moving to florida nobody's moving to uh, los angeles in san francisco right now After the pandemic given what they've seen anyway, we'll get into more of this including the new york city change Kyrie Irving maybe he's gonna drop 60 points in a home game soon clay.

What's your story? Hey guys. I am so so happy you guys are talking about this. I have been dealing with this for the past two years My wife's been a flight attendant for 25 years now with a major airline Every time I pick her up from the airport. She's iron cheers She is physically and mentally exhausted. She can't breathe. You can't catch her breath. She has migraine headaches All the time and it's due to lack of oxygen because she's in a mask now for 16 sometimes 17 hours a day by the time she's in the airport by the time she's working the flight and coming back 16 17 hours a day and they're all done with it And it's not her job to go around and be some mask informer telling people to put your mask on all the time Totally totally here. It's it's like they're running rob a Milgram shock experiment, but with masks on everybody instead of you know a little electric shocks to get them. It's crazy And let me tell you Financially it hasn't impacted my family because my wife Hey, she didn't want to work and I don't blame her because this has been such nonsense Work had little impossible Because she doesn't want to physically feel so awful And she's right and she's right. Thank you for the call. Thanks for coming I think it's underrated buck the vast majority.

There's also been a 370 foot long troop transport ship that reportedly got hit with an anti-ship missile and No, no word on casualties yet on the russian side, but this this war is not like anything we've seen in many decades Um, we also have a hundred thousand refugees that the by administration from ukraine that the by administration is now saying it will take In a hundred thousand refugees from this war into the united states So in many ways this war is going to affect us here at home. It already is What's what's going on here? How's the by administration handling it? We've got bridge colby now with this co-founder and principle of the marathon initiative former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force development and author of the strategy of Denial american defense in an age of great power conflict bridge great to have you back great to be with you What are you seeing right now in terms of the From a purely military we'll get into the by didn't response He's over in europe and all that in a moment bridge But from up from a military assessment, you know order of battle and how this is playing out perspective How how is this going from the russian perspective? How is this going the defense from the ukraine and perspective based on perceptions and and and troop losses and everything? Sure. I mean, I think as you said, it's you know, the biggest war in the european continent since since the second world war and it It's turned into something like a slugfest. I mean, I think a lot of us including myself have been surprised By how the russians Not only haven't done as as well. It would at least seem at this point. Although there's a lot There's reason to be skepticism about some of the war reporting But they they haven't done as sort of well as we would have expected in the beginning part of that seems like Probably because my guess is that it's from the top from poutin They try to sort of puta gras take out, you know decapitate the linsky and the the state would fall apart and they've been surprised As we all have I think by the ferocity and the vigor of the ukrainians fighting for for heart and home fighting for their own country And that has really led to and now they're kind of devolved into a slugfest which is sort of the traditional russian way of war is Artillery clear the place out and just win by by mass and saturation. That's where we seem to be going That said the russians, you know that they've seemed to have been having difficulty There may be more difficulties coming out. They have been making some progress particularly in the south So I think the jury's sort of still out and we don't see the russians relenting at this point. So Definitely too early for a victory lap Bridge uh pretty much coming on with us. I was reading nato estimates of russian casualties particularly the dead Uh, their report is pretty wide ranging in terms of its scope. They say between seven and 15 000 russian soldiers are dead Around 40 000 or so wounded How accurate do you think these estimates might be and what sort of numbers would have to occur For russian forces due to losses to decide not to continue their advance Well, I mean, I think it's a pretty big range. It strikes me as plausible. I mean, this is high intensity warfare I mean, these are extremely lethal munitions that are being employed and and you know We've seen the russian forces. We've seen these reports of russian general officers and senior field grade officers get get killed So that it strikes me as in the right order of magnitude. I'd be surprised if it was substantially lower than 7 000 I mean, it's a real a real, you know beating on both sides You know, there's a rule of thumb that maybe you know if a combat unit loses a third of its strength It starts to fall apart. Um, I would be surprised to find the russians just kind of give up and go home It's possible But you know the russians it appears that they're bringing forces from other theaters even more they had 190 000 or so I believe to start So, you know, if you're if you're talking 50 000 total casualties, you're you're really running up against some significant numbers So, but it doesn't look like they're giving up giving up yet They're kind of going to their sort of familiar territory of just beating trying to beat Ukraine's submission for probably more partial Victory than they they had hoped for at the beginning speaking of bridge Colby co-founder and principal the marathon initiative former deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy bridge What does in your estimation as somebody who has looked at the The assessments analysis that we do at the pentagon on a whole range of issues What do you think poutine wants here? What what is the end state that he thinks is achievable because it's it would be important for us to know this so that we could At least try Diplomatically and through negotiation to get to that ceasefire into the end of the conflict But what do you think would be what poutine would finally stop the bullets and the bombs for? Why I mean, I think that's the right way to think about it's probably variable I mean he probably was looking for something much bigger at the beginning and hoping that he could get it It and and you know the key is is that the battlefield's going to determine a lot of this and my partner You know brilliant strategist and former trump state department official west mitchell had a piece in foreign affairs laying out What this might look like a kind of what he calls a fortified? Ukrainian neutrality, which I think is kind of what what we want poutine to be forced to accept Uh, which is probably a sort of a neutrality like thinland or austria traditionally had so not nato membership It's almost certainly going to be the case but a very strong Ukrainian army not the militarization Which is probably what poutine wants because at this point I bet the russians are thinking, you know This is going to be our first fight at the apple or at least they're hoping It's very bloody we didn't do as well as we wanted to we want to get as much as we can We're gonna look our wounds and come back at it again in a few years Might be what they're thinking and we we don't want that to be an attractive option We want you crane. I think you cranium is more importantly want a strong, you know, sort of You know hardy a powerful army that that that poutine is not going to be able to roll over whoever poutine successor is So that's probably the trade space and I think you know, we should you know The Ukrainians want to fight so we should encourage and supply them and and you know make them capable of doing that But also there's going to have to be a political solution And we should not stand in the way in that we should be helping Ukrainians along that along that path at where we can Bridge were one month in Officially right now How much longer does this go in your mind if you were setting the range of how much longer the process as we have seen it for the last Month is likely to continue. What do you make sense? Well, I think there's a couple possibilities. I don't think the intensity of the the first month can be sustained I mean we've seen reports that the Russians are running out of you know key munitions very quickly and they're even using Potentially hypersonic munitions maybe even because they don't have enough of a normal kind So it's going to take time even on you know with russian industry To reconsto regenerate that so what we could see is either, you know A ceasefire of some kind would be the ideal unfavorable terms for the Ukrainians and alternative though might be a kind of protracted conflict Where you know you might see a lull in the fighting for months or even a year and then and then a resurgence You know a more intensified version of what we've seen in eastern Ukraine That would be a bad outcome wouldn't be the worst outcome But I think that's probably the the space that we're looking at bridge. How do you assess the body administration? Response to this invasion. I mean I feel like it's clear there was a failure in a sense that the invasion even happened We didn't uh outside forces powers weren't able to prevent that but since the invasion has started Are they what are they doing right? What are they doing wrong in this white house? Well, look I think the fundamental thing it is and I don't think this is trellish. I think this is important I mean this is an epic failure of american policy in western policy Presumably and I think it's untoward to be sort of taking victory laps at this point any respect There's three million refugees tens of thousands of people are dead This was not the goal of american policy wasn't american policy in a last ministration and none of this administration This is a big failure at the largest war in euro And there's a very real chance of very serious escalation. We're not at the end of this path by a long stretch Since the invasion. I think the administration does deserve credit in some areas. I mean unlike some of my fellow republicans I do think we need to take seriously the fact that we're in democrats too that you know poutine has A very large and sophisticated nuclear arsenal larger and more sophisticated than ours And the only thing standing between us and a russian nuclear attack is wadimer poutins incentive structure So the administration does deserve credit on that front. They have been I think behind the curve Again before the invasion in supplying things like javelins and other really important military equipment Now, I'd say the lesson here is not sanctions. It's not allied unity What's stopping the russians is eukranians fighting what you know the title my book strategy in denial This is the lesson is if you want to stop aggression, you got to be able to fight for it It's not sanctions. It's not condonations by the g7 Putin would be rolling all the way to the western border if that's all he takes but he's not he's facing these tough eukranians fighting for their country Not fighting by the way for the rules base international order. They're fighting for their country They're fighting for a kind of popular nationalism. So great on them and we should supply them But you know, I do think the administration could do more You know on on supplying and moving quickly But I also think they have been right not to push too far because you know look the russians are not sedamasans of rock They're not the Taliban. I mean these guys can really hurt us So we've got to be careful to thread that that needle You know and achieve our goals and help the Ukrainians without precipitating frankly will work great Bridge colby the strategy of denial american defense in an age of great power conflict is his book how they recommend it to you bridge Great to have you my friend.

Can you define a woman listen to this? Can you provide a definition for the word woman? Can I provide a definition? No, yeah, I can't you can't Not in this context. I'm not a biologist I'm not a biologist, which is going to go viral now. This also Was used by judge jaxon to respond to a question about unborn babies Uh, i'm not a biologist. I think it's going to go viral by the way because Like this is pretty crazy, but this is her tagline. Let's listen to this as well. No one suggests that a 20 week old fetus Can live independently outside the mother's womb Do they I I don't know. I mean you need The child will need to be fed or sheltered and all the other essentials to sustain human life So there's no suggesting that after 20 weeks that a child can be live independently Correct Center i'm i'm not a biologist. I haven't studied this. I don't know I mean this is amazing by the way. I'm not a transportation expert, but i'm pretty sure that Carjacking is a really bad thing. I mean, you know, I don't know how to build a car clay I'm not a mechanic, but I oppose carjacking This the fact that this would be the fallback line. I'm not a biologist You're asked to define a woman. All right men have penises women have vaginas. I just gave you a pretty good Sorry, that sorry to if you missed biology, that's a pretty easy answer, right? You don't have to be a biologist to know the difference between a man and a woman And you don't have to be a biologist to have some sense Certainly for a judge who understands and had to study as a law student and has had this look I know the rovey weighed standard, right? I'm a lawyer. I had to learn it I had to understand what the supreme court did I just despise when we know that people are lying to us I'm not a biologist is a lie and it is brought to bear buck because The democratic party is so enthralled right now in the grasp of the transgender Uh Wait, what would you even call them like the transgender army the transgender? Uh interest group that they are terrified That they are terrified of saying something that could offend them This is why we have to have people like google now you can google can men get pregnant and they will tell you yes There's a pregnant man emoji that you can get on your phone men can't have babies like this is crazy Like we have to say fun. You want to talk about biology I mean these are fundamentally false scientific facts that aren't allowed to be said because they might offend Someone who is likely to vote for you the left the democrat party the activists picked these fights by the way this They like to do this thing now. Oh, well while people are suffering in Ukraine You're sitting here talking about how we refer to you as menstruating people instead of women It's like that is the worst kind of what aboutism and deflection. It's so obvious, but this is what they do They picked these fights they pushed for the trans swimmer lea tamas, you know for the nc double a defend the knee They made all this stuff happen. We are reacting to their madness And and and this is this is good going into a mid-term People need to know they need to understand. This is not a fringe belief This when katanji brown jaxon who's going to like going to be on the supreme court here soon When she refuses to define what a woman is this shows the country that to be considered a left wing Intellectual person in public life in good standing with the democrat party You must pretend you don't know what a woman in a man is you must obey the final commandment From orwell's 1984 that you reject the evidence of your eyes and ears That is what is required of libs today Buck this lea tamas case. I was reading the daily wire had an interview with Um with uh one of the female swimmers who was at the university of kentucky She said lea tamas came into the women's locker room And still has male genitalia So you tell me What person out there who has ever competed in athletics thinks it is appropriate for women who are in a locker room getting dressed to compete as swimmers naked and a dude walks in with male genitals Because he identifies as a woman And changes in the locker room beside them. I mean this is madness This is also the point that I like to make about how it's always about courtesy and kind of Courtesy and kindness should always be a guiding principle for everything that we do But it can't be a one side. It's only oh certain people deserve courtesy and kindness So do whatever they want bend to their policies bend their needs Can you imagine clay if you're the father of one of the girls in the in the locker room? And there's the the lea tamas changing law. I mean if a guy walked in that's a crime to that Almost every jurisdiction if a guy walks in and he is Identifying as a man and he starts to get naked in a women's locker room. He gets arrested That's a crime everywhere and just to be clear now whether it's a college age or even down to you know High school and junior high now they do this that they have these policies in some schools It's crazy. You're a bigot. They say if you oppose this these people look we said all the time We're not we're not exaggerating folks The left has lost its mind and this is just one of the manifestations of lunacy The people that think that triple masking alone in a park by themselves are being Scientific also think that lea tama should should be the nc double a swim champion. There's a direct correlation here Think about that It's a crime unless you tell people oh i'm identifying as a woman now Like how does that make sense that a naked man? Can be in a locker room with women because he identifies as a woman like this does not make sense for anybody We got senator marcher black burn up next with the big question she asked what is a woman?
