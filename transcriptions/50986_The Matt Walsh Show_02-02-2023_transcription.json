    "text": " Today on the Matt Wall Show, as red states move to ban the procedure, states like Minnesota are passing legislation to declare themselves sanctuaries for child mutilation. One father of a quote unquote trans six year old testified in favor of the bill. His testimony is being hailed as heroic and beautiful by the left, but I have a different take as you might expect. Also the college board makes changes to its AP African American Studies course after pushback from conservatives. A BBC correspondent celebrates the quote beautiful piece of hand luggage, by a baby that he had via the womb that he rented. Vegan activist hatcher disastrous plan to shut down a slaughterhouse.

As we've been tracking on the show for years, the Republican Party did virtually nothing to fight back against gender ideology and the trans agendas indoctrination and abuse of children. They have been doing virtually nothing to fight back against. But finally, that has changed and not by accident. Those in the anti-gender ideology movement, otherwise known as the sanity movement or the reality movement, whatever term you want to use, have been in the trenches fighting against this madness for a long time. And it's through those efforts that we now find ourselves in a position where states across the country are passing laws banning the mutilation, castration and abuse of gender confused children. Utah, as we mentioned yesterday, is the latest state to pass a measure banning medical transitions on children. And that is significant because it was less than a year ago that Utah's Republican governor, Spencer Cox, vetoed a bill that would have banned males from female sports. And his stated reason was that he said he wasn't an expert on transgenderism. And therefore, because he's not an expert on it, all he could do was quote, air on the side of kindness, mercy and compassion. It was one of the most shameful episodes of squishiness we've ever seen from the squish party. And that's saying a lot. Banding males from female sports is a layup, no pun intended. You don't need to be an expert on anything. You just need to have common sense. And that's how you know that it's the right move. And you don't even need political courage to do it because most Americans agree that sports should be segregated based on sex. Yet Cox went limp and surrendered anyway. Now that was back in March of 2022. So not all that long ago. Fast forward to January 2023. And here he is signing a bill banning child gender transitions. He was afraid of being called a transphobe just a few months ago. Now he's signing legislation that will have him labeled a transphobe by every corporate media publication in the country. All the people that he was mad that he was worried about being mad at him are going to be even more mad at him now because of this. So what changed? Did he somehow discover a backbone? Did he undergo his own gender transition from spineless jellyfish to actual human man? Probably not. Instead, the political realities changed. Because we forced them to change. You and me, those of us who have been speaking out and fighting back against this trans madness. We changed the political atmosphere by basically force of will change it so that even a guy like Spencer Cox has no choice but to do the right thing. And several other states of course are in line to do the same. Now on the federal level, the only 2024 candidate officially in the race at this point, Donald Trump announced this week. A series of proposals to eradicate the trans agenda from schools and doctors offices and government agencies nationwide. And we mentioned this briefly on the show yesterday, but it's worth listening to some of his proposal as he outlined it. And here it is, listen. The left wing gender insanity being pushed in our children is an act of child abuse. Very simple. Here's my plan to stop the chemical, physical and emotional mutilation of our youth. On day one, I will revoke Joe Biden's cruel policies on so-called gender affirming care. Ridiculous. A process that includes giving kids puberty blockers, mutating their physical appearance and ultimately performing surgery on minor children. Can you believe this? I will sign a new executive order instructing every federal agency to cease all programs that promote the concept of sex and gender transition at any age. I will then ask Congress to permanently stop federal taxpayer dollars from being used to promote or pay for these procedures and pass a law prohibiting child sexual mutilation in all 50 states. It will go very quickly. I will declare that any hospital or health care provider that participates in the chemical or physical mutilation of minor youth will no longer meet federal health and safety standards for Medicaid and Medicare and will be terminated from the program immediately. Furthermore, I will support the creation of a private right of action for victims to sue doctors who have unforgivably performed these procedures on minor children. That's all very similar to the law that we're getting passed here in Tennessee, but Tennessee is just one state. We need exactly this. We need exactly this on the national level as well. Trump also says, as he goes on to say, that he would direct the Department of Justice to investigate hospitals from sue companies, doctors to find out if they've been involved in a coverup of the horrific long term side effects of gender transition drugs and surgeries. The answer, of course, is that yes, they have been covering those things up as any genuine and thorough investigation will clearly show, which is why the next step under a Trump administration or any Republican administration should be to arrest the culprits, the hundreds and hundreds of them, if not thousands of them, and throw them in federal prison. Now, this can't be a matter of simple fines and financial penalties. I mean, that should be part of it. But the only real recourse here, the only semblance of justice would be prison sentences, very long ones. Now, if we're up to me, we go further than that. As far as I'm concerned, mutilating and castrating children should be legally considered a capital crime and it should earn the prescribed penalty for such crimes. But if we can't have that, then prison will have to suffice. These are all very positive developments. Yeah, we know that the left isn't going to take any of this lying down. They were so close in their minds to achieving their genderless dystopia that they're not going to give up now. They can't because gender ideology is the centerpiece of their entire cultural agenda. They can't give up on it. They can't give it up without giving the whole game away, which they're not going to do. And so, while red states move to protect children from these forms of physical and sexual abuse, blue states are doubling down on the abuse and doing everything in their power to ensure that more and more kids are fed into the transgender wood shipper. Most recently, the state of Minnesota, which is following in the steps of states like California, has introduced legislation to officially declare itself a sanctuary state for trans kids. In other words, Democrats in Minnesota want to traffic children into the states so that they can be castrated and sterilized. These people, they're not satisfied with simply butchering the children who already live in Minnesota. They want the state to become a destination, a hub for such abuse. Representative Lee Finke is a man who says he's a woman and he wrote this legislation and then explained it on the House floor this week in Minnesota. Listen to this. There are gender diverse people in Minnesota right now receiving gender-affirming care. More are fleeing their home states asking where they should turn. There are people in the audience today who have come here for this very reason. There are doctors in Minnesota right now providing this world-class gender-affirming care. And there are parents who are terrified about what unknown consequences may come from simply affirming their child's authentic self. This is new law. It's complex and there are questions that still need to be answered. But we can answer those questions and we need to do so right now. Utah banned gender-affirming care last Saturday. They were not the first state to do so and they will not be the last. Tennessee is both behind them. South Dakota is moving. The organized political movements that has targeted my community is at work in every state that touches ours. Well you're damn right. We are targeting your community. We are and by your community, the community we're targeting. I'm referring to the community of child abusers. Of course Finke is supposed to be seen as an authority here because he identifies as trans himself. But of course that only makes him less reliable. He has a vested personal interest in transing the kids because it makes him feel better about his own lifestyle choices, which is the motivation for guys like him. For Finke, affirming the children, quote, unquote, is really about affirming himself. And you'll notice this about the vast majority of the voices speaking up in favor of transing the kids. Most of them are either alleged medical professionals who stand to financially profit from this. Or they are trans activists desperately seeking affirmation and validation for their own self-identities. And on the other side, who are the people on the other side that are that are speaking out against this? Well, you have people who don't benefit in any selfish way at all from the position that we've taken on this subject. We don't make money on kids who are not trans. Like we don't make money on kids who are protected from the trans agenda. Every child who's protected from the trans agenda does not translate into money for us. Whereas on the other side, every child who is fed into the trans agenda and claimed by it translates into money for them. And we're also not seeking any sort of emotional validation or affirmation of our own lifestyles. We know who we are. We're not worried about that. We simply just believe in defending the truth for the truth's own sake. And we believe in protecting kids for their own sake. That's it. But back to the other side, the debate over the sanctuary state bill in Minnesota also featured the testimony of a father who claims that his own six year old child is quote trans. And this video is being passed around on social media by trans activists who say that they were brought to tears by it. Again, it's so emotional and beautiful. They said, you can listen yourself and tell me how beautiful you think this actually is. Listen, my wife and I are here today because we have a trans trans child after six years old at three. She was not sleeping very well. She was waking up every single night. It was a lot more than just a toddler waking up. And one day I picked her up from daycare. And all the teachers had said, Asher told us that she's a she. And I said to these wonderful daycare people who had never had a trans kid before at a pretty religious place, so what'd you do? And they said, we called her her. And I said, great. Oh my God, great. And Asher comes around the corner and I said, hey, there's my beautiful daughter. And I think there are a few things in this world that are, I'll remember from my whole life. And that is one of them. The smile on her face, the look of affirmation, the confidence she had to tell her teachers who had known her since diapers that she was a she, that her father said, there's my beautiful daughter. Well, speaking of people who should be in prison, there's one there. You know, I've I've heard many, many testimonies from parents of young quote trans kids. And I've yet to hear of a single quote unquote trans kid who was acting differently in any significant way from any other kid their age. So their father tells us that his son was waking up in the middle of the night when he was three. Wow, that's that's something. Wow, a toddler isn't sleeping well. Who's ever heard of such a thing? This requires, I mean, this requires us to radically rethink the kid's very identity because they're not sleeping well. I mean, well, you know, I have four kids three and they're three years or older or older. And we've actually gone through the not sleeping well three year old phase with, oh, I don't know, every single one of them. My six year old son, when he was three, he woke up between midnight and two a.m. and started playing with his toys or like walking around the house. And he would do this every night for at least six months, every single night. And I had a lot of thoughts and feelings about the fact that he kept waking up and waking the whole house up. I felt many things, most of most of them frustration. But it never occurred to me that he was waking up because he was tortured by the thought that he might have been born in the wrong body. That's just that's something that never crossed my mind. And there are many insane things that never occurred to me, in fact. And well, that's, I guess, that's really just only one of them. But it's not simply, let's not sell this father short. It's not simply that young Asher, I think his name was, was waking up a lot in the middle of the night. As toddlers tend to do, he also at the age of three announced himself as a girl at daycare. And that's all it took. A few sleepless nights, a random declaration from a toddler, and that's all this guy needed. His poor son has now been doomed to a life of confusion, identity crisis, despair, eventual medical and surgical mutilation. Why is that? Well, because the father obviously wanted a trans child. He wanted the fashion accessory to carry around. He wanted his child to become a vehicle for his own virtue signaling. And he took the first opportunity that came his way. That's the kind of thing we're fighting against. While the other side doubles down and gets more extreme in their evil, we have to double down and become more extreme in our defense of truth and of kids. That's the path forward. And I'm happy to see that it's the path we're finally walking down. Now let's get to our headlines. If the past couple of years have taught us anything, it's that in a crisis, like a global pandemic or a natural disaster, even the basics can be hard to come by need to be prepared for anything. And that's why my new partners at Chase Medical are here and they can help. Chase Medical helps you get a long term supply of prescription medication. Their mission is to empower you to be better medically prepared in the case of any kind of emergency. A great way to start preparing is with the Chase case, a pack of five different courses of antibiotics that you can use to treat a whole host of bacterial illnesses, including UTIs, respiratory infections, sinuses, skin infections, and much more. All you have to do is fill out a simple online form. And in some cases, jump on a quick call with one of their board certified physicians from there. You can ask your physician treatment related questions on an ongoing basis. And you can do all of this to make sure that you are prepared in case of anything. And as we said, we know that the last couple of years in particular have shown us how important preparedness is especially if you have kids. The Chase case gives me peace of mind. I can tell you knowing that my family will have what we need if the worst happens. And I want you to be prepared for anything as well.

All right, so we'll begin with some news from APNews.com. It says, high school senior, Kaleela Bendili is used to courses that don't address the African American experience. Then there's her nine AM class. This week, it's banned topics from Afro-Caribbean migration to jazz. The discussion in her advanced placement course on African American studies touched on figures from Marcus Garvey, Malcolm X, to Jimi Hendrix and Rihanna. In her AP European history course, she said, we're not discussing black people at all, even though they were colonized by Europeans. Well, that's, I mean, that's shocking to me. Why aren't they discussing Rihanna in their European history course? I mean, this is, that's racism. I can't think of any other reason why you wouldn't be talking about Rihanna in your European history course. What about in your astronomy class? Does Beyonce ever come up? If not, there's racism. It says her school in Baton Rouge, Louisiana is one of 60 schools around the country testing the new course, which has gained national attention since Florida Governor Ron DeSantis threatened to ban it in his state. The rejection has stirred new political debate over how schools teach about race. The official curriculum for the course released Wednesday about the college board downplayed some components that had drawn criticism from DeSantis and other conservatives. Topics including Black Lives Matter, slavery reparations, and queer life are not part of the exam. Instead, they are included only on a sample list that states and school systems can choose from for student projects. The college board which oversees AP exams said revisions to the course were substantially complete before DeSantis shared his objections. So that's kind of the headline here that there was this new African American AP history course that was devised by the college board being rolled out in public schools across the country and it included a lot of radical far left propaganda. Ron DeSantis among others brought that up and was objecting to it and said that it wasn't going to be allowed in his state. And now the college board has revised it and they've supposedly downplayed a lot of those political elements. But they claim that we were going to do that anyway. We were totally going to do that anyway. It's not because you conservatives, it's not because we're not caving to backlash from you. But of course, they really are, which is good. This is something we've seen, in fact, more and more recently, that backlash from the right actually gets results. And that is a new phenomenon in a lot of ways. Now, that doesn't mean that problem solved here or that we should at all trust this African American studies course. Of course, of course, we should. Because it was always meant to be a vehicle for far left propaganda. That's what it was always intended to be. And if the course still exists at all, then it is still going to be a vehicle for far left propaganda. Even if they supposedly are downplaying certain elements of it that have drawn objection from the right, it's still there, still a propaganda course. I mean, why would something like queer life as the AP puts it? Or BLM, which is a political scam organization, why would that ever be a part of an African American studies program to begin with? Well, because these programs are fundamentally ideological. And the queer stuff in particular gets shoehorned in because it is central to their agenda. I mean, everything always comes down to that on the left. Every subject ultimately comes down to an exploration of gender and sexuality. Because that is there on the left, that is their single preoccupation, it's what they care the most about. And so everything will come down to that. But if we want to get some, I think some really insightful analysis of this debate about African American studies and what belongs in school and what doesn't. Well, I think we should turn to the one place where we turn for insightful analysis of really any subject. And that is, of course, the view where Whoopi Goldberg had some thoughts about all this. And in particular about Ron DeSantis. And let's give that a listen. I don't understand why he believes that he wants people to see the history of Western civilization and history and philosophy of Western civilization. Because he wants to, he wants it seen through that lens. Why is your lens better than my lens? So you're basically saying, like to be like Mary and Croque, you're not going to teach about her. Her history is American history. What is it that he doesn't get? We're not going anywhere. Just because you stopped teaching it into colleges, you think people are going to stop telling these stories? You're, no, it's not going to happen. Amen. Amen to that utter nonsense. Of course, there's a couple problems here. And all stemming from the fact that Whoopi Goldberg has, you know, an IQ of 14. So, and she's also a dishonest hack as well. Otherwise she wouldn't be on that show. But a couple problems, she says, she says, well, African American history is American history. Yeah, right. That's the point. That's actually the point that's being made by people like Ron DeSantis and anyone else who objects to these kinds of courses in public school. We actually, we don't need to break American history down on racial lines. We don't need to say, well, let's do the history of this race. And then the history of this race and the history of that race. Let's teach American history, which will encompass people of different races. Nobody ever claimed otherwise. That's our point to be clear. But then she also seems to suggest that what DeSantis is really doing, and this is not the only one, this is what we're hearing from the left, that because DeSantis and other conservatives are objecting to this radical far left, African American studies, of course. What we really say is that we don't want black people mentioned in the school at all. We don't want any of them mentioned. This is Don't Say Gay 2.0. This is the Don't Say Gay hysteria, completely fraudulent phony hysteria, ginned up by the media. And this is that all over again. It's Don't Say Gay 2.0. Where they took a, with Don't Say Gay bill, which is a bill that never existed, they took a bill that really just protects very young children in the school system from being sexually indoctrinated by their teachers. And then they claim that it meant that the word gay is never allowed to be said anywhere around school system. And now what they're claiming is that, what is it? This is the Don't Say Black bill, I guess is what they're saying. They were not allowed to acknowledge black people at all. And they're being erased from American history, which is not the case. In fact, it's what we're saying is the opposite. Let's teach American history, the history of this country. And that includes the significant contributions of everyone, no matter what the race was. Now, it is true. And this, of course, is the problem that the left has, is that, well, if you teach American history and you're talking about the significant contributions made by anyone, regardless of their race, that means that you will be acknowledging the contributions of lots of white men too. That's, there'll be lots of white men going back to the founding of the country and ever since then. And that's, that is actually their problem. They don't want to have to acknowledge that. Joy Reed also, we've already heard from Wuppy Goldberg. So let's throw Joy Reed in as well. She also lashed out around to Santas, but only made him sound even better in the process, which is usually the way these things work. Here she is. What the Santas is doing is intentional in order to peel off Trump's Republican voters and get them on his side ahead of his presidential bid in 2024. He's turning Florida into a right wing paradise where the focus isn't on healthcare or jobs or taxes or infrastructure, I don't know, hurricane or flood insurance in one of the most natural disaster prone states in the country, you know, normal governor stuff, but rather on the right wing culture wars and nothing but the right wing culture wars. And he's ticking all the boxes. Not only is he banning books about history and any mention of the existence of gay people from Florida schools, he's barring public high schools from teaching AP African American studies. He's taking aim at drag performances, even suggesting that he would urge the state's child protective services to investigate parents who take their own kids to one. He's actively trying to ban COVID vaccine mandates and restricting mask rules while at the same time calling for probes into supposed wrongdoing linked to the vaccine. And he's doing all of this while making sure that anyone can walk around with a gun no permit required. It's a right wing fantasy land like Disney World, but in hell come to Florida, the meanest place on earth. Sounds great to me. Of course, much of what she said there is we heard again there that she's he's banning any mention of the existence of gay people. That's total fabrication. This is just what they they make this up. And of course there's never going to be any fact check or anything like that from our brave fact checking organizations out there. But I think this is a really good, this is this shouldn't necessarily be your primary motivation as a leader, as a governor. But it is a pretty good sign that you're on the right path when someone like Joy Reed says that this is that you've turned your state into a nightmare and she never want to move there. This is you could do worse if you're trying to figure out what sort of state was sort of community to build will build the kind of community that a person like Joy Reed would never want to move into. And if that if that's your path forward, if that's kind of your your guiding light, well, you could do a lot worse. That's for sure. There's an article from the Virginia pilot says a house of delegates subcommittee on Monday passed a bill that would ban transgender girls and women from competing on female sports teams at the K through 12 schools and universities. Delegate Karen Greenhol who introduced the measure told that legislators they had a responsibility to stand up for female athletes. Similarly gifted and trained males will always have the physical advantage over females, which is the reason we have women's sports at Greenhol. Those opposed to the bill argued that it discriminated against transgender youth. So we're talking about these kinds of bills across countries also happening in Virginia. But I bring this up in particular because of testimony that was offered by Riley Gaines. She's a recent graduate from the University of Kentucky where she had been a member of the women's swim team. And she said it was unfair that she had to compete against Leah Thomas, who's the male who identified it as woman. And listened a little bit of her experience here. In addition to being forced to give up our awards, our title is not opportunities. The NCAA forced female swimmers to share a locker room with Thomas, a 6, 4, 22 year old male who was fully intact with male genitalia. Let me be clear. We were not forewarned. We were not as forewarned. We did not give our consent. If nothing else, I hope you can truly see how this is a violation of our privacy and how some of us have felt uncomfortable, awkward, embarrassed, and even traumatized by this experience. I know I don't speak for everyone. It's impossible to speak for everyone, but I can attest to the tears that were shed on that pole deck by these poor ninth and seventeenth place finishers who missed out on being named an all-American by one place. And I can attest to the extreme discomfort in the locker room when you turn around and there is a male watching you undress while exposing himself. I can attest to the anger and frustration from these girls who had worked so hard and sacrificed so much to get to this point. Yeah, she said she doesn't speak for everyone. Well, she's right. She said it's impossible to speak for everyone. There might be maybe. I'd have to leave open the theoretical possibility that there might be some women out there who actually do want a man such as Leah Thomas disrobing in the locker room with them. Maybe there are some women out there who really are gung-ho about it and say, yeah, I want more. I want more men parading around the locker room with their penises hanging out. That's why I want more of that. Maybe there are some women out there who really feel that way. I suspect that if those women exist at all, they are very, very few and far between. What you have instead are a bunch of women. You have some women who have spoken out bravely about this and are willing to speak out. Many more who have complained about it privately, but haven't spoken out in public. Then many more who have said nothing at all, but are extremely uncomfortable with it. The reason they haven't said anything is because they're worried about the penalties that they'll suffer. Both academic penalties, the social consequences and all the rest of it, being shamed as a transphobe and everything. Then there are many more women who have actually come out in favor of it verbally because they think that that's what they're supposed to do. They want to show off their virtue and they want to win those social credit points. Of course, in reality, they prefer to have the locker room to themselves. I think when it comes to a locker room issue in particular, those groups that I just outlined, that probably encompasses almost all women. The number of women who are genuinely excited about the prospect, the reality of males disroping in the locker room, it's virtually nonexistent. And this has always been, we hear about when it comes to Leah Thomas or any of these males companions, women, much of the conversation focuses around what's happening in the pool or on the track. What's happening in the competition, the way that these opportunities and metals and trophies are being taken away from women. And that is a problem. It's a travesty in many ways. But what's happening in the locker room is even far worse. This is far more insidious. These women are being forced to endure this and being screamed at and told to just shut up and deal with it while a man disrobes them from them. It is truly, truly evil and sick. Speaking of evil and sick, here's a tweet that's gone viral over the past few days. It's from a correspondent for the BBC named Mark Lauin. And he tweeted this along with a picture. He says, after six weeks in wonderful and tearful farewells to our incredible, sorry, after six weeks in wonderful Canada, doesn't say Canada, there's a Canadian flag. I'm still learning how to read these hieroglyphic posts where they use pictures and set awards. After six weeks in wonderful Canada and tearful farewells to our incredible surrogate and friend, it's time to go home to Lisbon with our new family member, our most beautiful hand luggage. Canada, you are a shining light of democracy and equality. Thank you for letting us fulfill our dream. And then you see the two men there holding a baby that was conceived and birthed via surrogacy. You know, we've had this conversation about surrogacy before on the show. And as I have been arguing all along, this is a deeply evil practice. This is the commodification of children. It's the commodification of a woman's body. I mean, the idea that you can rent out a woman's body for the purposes of growing a child that will then, in that child, will then be separated permanently from his mother and that you're doing all of this to, not because it's best for the child, this is not being done because it's best for the child. There's no world where it's the best thing for the child to be conceived and born via surrogacy and then separated from his mother forever. That's never in the best interest of the child. But you're doing it for you to satisfy your own desires. In fact, you hear Mark Lauen say it here. Thank you for letting us fulfill our dream. But it's also in this particular case. This post really jumps out at you because it's so on the nose when he refers to the child as hand luggage, our most beautiful hand luggage. This is something that, you know, a real parent, you love your child, you would never refer to your kid that way. You know, people might have different funny sort of ways of talking about parenthood and everything. Nobody would know, no actual parent would refer to their child who's just been born as a beautiful hand luggage. But that's the way they see it. That's what the child is. The child is an accessory for these men. It is totally dehumanizing to both the child and the woman. You know, the commercialized renting and purchasing of a womb for the purposes of fulfilling the quote dreams of these gay men is incredibly sinister and wrong. But this is also what you end up with in a culture where we've decided that the ultimate good is the fulfillment of the individual's own desires. Like satisfying the individual's own desires, the individual's own ego. We've decided that's what we've structured our entire culture around that we each have our own universe that we live in and that universe revolves around us. And the most important thing in that universe is how we feel and affirming our own feelings. And in that kind of situation, it's no surprise that we do things like rent out a woman's womb so that gay men can grow children and then separate them forever from their biological mother in order to satisfy their own desires. All right, finally, this video went viral. I don't know where or when it was taken, but it's apparently from the way it's being described. It's apparently vegan activists somewhere who are protesting a slaughterhouse. And the way of protesting the slaughterhouse is to try to stop a truck from going into the slaughterhouse. They're saying that the truck has animals in it that are being brought into their demise. And so they want to stop this huge truck from going in and they have their way of attempting to do that, which doesn't work out, spoiler alert doesn't work out too well for them. But here's the video. Standing here in front of a Fierman slaughterhouse where 10,000 lives are taken daily, 10,000 innocent lives slaughtered here for no more than the taste buds of human kind of humans. Here we have the truck approaching where approximately 300 animals are stacked into this truck. We're going to stop this truck so we can bear witness. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh my god. Oh, I almost got run over. You guys are on the line. You guys are on the line. I'm going to take you guys. I'm going to stop. These drivers have no respect for life. No respect for human life. No respect for animal life. Psycho pad. Cheese. What is wrong with that guy? I'm shell shock as I almost got hurt when I threw myself in front of a truck. How could that have happened? Wow. Cheese. What exactly? They are not setting their best. The vegans aren't. I don't know if it's because they're not getting enough protein in their diet. So their brains are atrophying a little bit. That does happen. That's science. So I don't know if that's what's it. Maybe this is their best. That's the thing. I keep saying vegan activists and the stunts that they pull. And I always assume, well, this can't be their best, but I think the reality is that this is the best they got. So what exactly was the plan? We see at the beginning that there are people on the sides of this huge big rig and they're holding on to the sides of it as if they think that through just by holding it, they can stop it from moving. And the truck keeps going and they try to throw themselves in front of the truck. And the truck continues on its way. And I don't think the truck actually did run anybody over, thankfully for the vegans. But if you had, that would have been their fault. You throw yourself in front of a truck. That's on you. And by the way, when you've got, even if they are, a bunch of noodle-y armed vegans, even so, when you have mobs of people trying to stop your car in the middle of the road, the safest thing is to keep going. Because we've seen what happens in the past, when you stop for these people, you get pulled out of the truck, you never know what will happen. So for your own safety, and also for the safety of that precious cargo in the back, on its way to the slaughterhouse, and for all the the sake of all the rest of us who want to enjoy that delicious bacon, you have no choice but to continue going, I think.

Jessica says, I think he should have made the gender cake. I understand and agree with him about not customizing a gay marriage cake, but the gender cake was not customized. Both the customer and the baker were acting out of hate. That's been brewing. How is it hate on the part of the baker? Yeah, you're right about the customer acting on the out hate, trying to entrap Jack Phillips, trying to intentionally put him in a position so that he can be sued. So yes, he's acting out of hate there. But the baker just doesn't want to be a part of any kind of celebration of a quote unquote gender transition. Because that would be to participate in a lie for one thing. And it's a celebration of self harm and self mutilation and a lot of terrible things. The baker says, I don't want to be a part of that. You can't force me to be a part of that. I don't want to be a part of that event. And just because I've opened a bakery, this small town bakery, doesn't mean that I'm required to be a part of any event that someone demands I participate in. So no, he's just as justified and not wanting to make the quote unquote gender transition cake as not wanting to customize the gay wedding cake. This is not only freedom of speech. This is a fundamental case of freedom of association. You should not be forced to associate yourself with an event that you find morally abhorrent for whatever your reasons are. It doesn't matter. This doesn't need to be grounded, especially the gender transition thing. Yeah, Jack Phillips is a Christian, but this is not this really has nothing to do with religious liberty necessarily. Yeah, it would be it would be immoral according to the Christian faith to participate in an evil event like that. But you don't need to be a Christian to see the problem with the concept of gender transition and celebrating it with a cake. So this is basic free speech, freedom of association, and that's it. At the same time, if this person really just wanted the cake for this celebration, he could have just said, I'd like a pink cake with blue icing. And he could have said that and he would have got that because because Jack Phillips would not, if you ever, any baker have ever been to, they don't demand details on the kind of ceremony that you're celebrating. Now, if you offer it because you want the cake customized for like a birthday, then yeah, but if you just go in there and say, I want this cake, they're not going to make you fill out a questionnaire with a bunch of information about the type of event. And that didn't happen here. That information was volunteered. And then Jack Phillips said, well, now that you've told me that and you've given me that information unsolicited, now I have to respond accordingly. The actual final boss says, I can't believe the media continues to misgender Matt as a blogger. He's clearly a vlogger. Thank you very much. That is what I identify as. Kristen Funk says, we need Matt to do a segment on Velma. Nothing I want to see more than Matt put Mindy Kaling to task. I'm only even vaguely aware of the, so I know that people are upset about Velma. Velma is what is it? The Netflix or maybe it's HBO Max, something like that. One of the streaming services did a spin off of Scooby-Doo. That's a cartoon. And in the spin off, number one, I mean, the first problem is that from what I've been told, Scooby-Doo is not even featured at all in the show. So they've taken Scooby-Doo out and it all focuses around Velma, who's like a lesbian and genderqueer or whatever and they put a bunch of woke stuff into it and all the rest of it. And they've also made this a cartoon that's targeted supposedly towards adults, although I'm sure there are plenty of kids watching it. That's all I know about it. I really have nothing interesting to say about it other than this is yet more evidence of the fact that all we get from Hollywood is a bunch of garbage. And even if it was a faithful spin off of Scooby-Doo, I would object to it even without all the woke stuff that's disgusting and abhorrent and it doesn't belong in a cartoon especially because even if they claim it's targeted towards older people, you're still going to end up with kids watching it. So that doesn't belong there. But even without that, do we need another, do you have all these franchises with a million spin offs? Was there ever that much meat on the bone to begin with? It takes something like Scooby-Doo. It was a vaguely amusing cartoon, came out decades ago. There was never that much meat on the bone. There's not enough content there to support a decades long franchise with films and spin offs and different shows and everything. Just let it rest. Let it go. And Rodrigo says, I have to disagree about your anxiety rant. While I agree, the teacher didn't manage the situation the best way, anxiety or more specifically chronic anxiety is a mental disorder. While normal anxiety has a clear and reasonable reason for it, and if that reason disappears, the anxiety disappears. Chronic anxiety does not have any of that while normal anxiety is like fear, an alarm that signals something stressful. Chronic anxiety is like a phobia, a broken alarm that needs to be fixed. But I kind of agree that not all problems like this should be fixed with drugs. We don't understand all the brain still. So a lot of drugs affect that in other ways, but we still don't understand fully. That's a problem in the overmedicated society in the US. Okay. Yeah, I understand that you are laying out the assertions that are made in favor of treating anxiety as a medical condition, and in favor of inventing this illness called anxiety disorder. So you have, yes, you have, I think correctly laid out the series of assertions that's supposed to support that. But these are not arguments. This is just an assertion. And you haven't addressed any of the actual problems that this raises. So to begin with, well, you have anxiety that exists for a good reason. And then you have anxiety that exists for not a good reason. Well, who determines? First of all, who determines what is an appropriate reason to feel anxiety? Who exactly is in a position? Well, a psychiatrist in the medical industry, they decided, why do they get to decide that? How are they experts in what are good reasons and reasonable reasons to feel anxious? Here's a list of reasons why you should feel anxious. If you're anxious for these reasons, you shouldn't feel anxious, and that's an illness. Do you not see how totally arbitrary that is? Are we not supposed to sit back and say, well, who where are you getting this from? Why are you the authority on this? Just because you've doctored in front of your name, that makes you an expert on something as a question as big as what are the appropriate reasons to feel anxiety? So why do they get to determine that? What are they basing those determinations on? And also, even if we could all agree, I don't know, by majority vote or some democratic process that there are unreasonable anxieties that people feel, well, that in and of itself doesn't prove that it's an illness. Maybe there are unreasonable anxieties. I think that they're sure. But maybe that's also part of being a human being, is to experience unreasonable anxieties. And here's another question too. And I've made the same point about depression, and I think it's the case with anxiety as well. And this is something people don't like to, to, to, to, to possibility people don't like to think about. Okay, but what if, you know, if you're feeling anxious and you can't identify an exact reason for it, what if life itself is a reason to be anxious? What if simply existing as a mortal human being is reason enough to feel anxiety? Just like with depression, what, what if there are just realities about are the human condition that can sometimes cause people to feel despair? Now that doesn't mean that you should feel anxious all the time, or you should be in despair all the time. Obviously, you shouldn't. It also doesn't mean that you shouldn't look for help if you're struggling with these feelings. I'm not saying that either. All I'm saying is that maybe people who are feeling depressed or feeling anxious, they're not like diseased and they're not even being unreasonable. It's just it's, it is, it is tough to exist as a human being. There are many things about life that create anxiety. Let's start with the reality of death. I mean, the fact that death hovers over all of us all the time, and we know that eventually it will come and claim us and we will cease to exist in the physical realm. I mean, that alone is something that can make people feel anxious and you can feel anxious about that anytime. And it might be in a kind of ambiguous, amorphous way where you don't really understand where the feelings are rooted from. But maybe that's part of it. I mean, so maybe these are things that come with the human condition, which again, just because something is fundamental to the human condition, it doesn't mean that we shouldn't do anything to help ourselves deal with those realities. But it does mean that just labeling it a disease and trying to solve the problem with a pill might not be the best approach. It certainly might not get to the root of the problem. This weekend, you probably didn't know because I just learned in this moment right now is the Grammys. And if you're a true member of the SPG, you're aware of the outsized share of influence pop culture has on my life. I am a pop culture fanatic. Everyone says that about me. Although my affinity for televised awards ceremonies is widely recognized, it's my notorious status as a rap mogul that gives this award show truly venerable significance in the sweet baby gang. I peruse the nominees and sadly, I wasn't among them probably because I don't have anything that could possibly be nominated for. But still, it's a grave injustice that my hip hop forefathers, Pousch Aisty, and Spottum Godum have also endured. And now I'm experiencing the same thing. All this to say, I'm proud to announce the newest sweet baby album t-shirt, which is, which I have with me right now. It is, hopefully you can see this in the, it is the notorious SPG. And the great thing is that this is not a copyrighted violation. We did check with our lawyers. This latest addition to my swag shack over at dailywire.com is available right now. And you don't want to miss out on this opportunity to confuse people, culturally appropriate at the same time, experience the immortalization of both my prominence in the hip hop world and lyrical prowess in the form of yet another instant classic. We saw enough of these. I very well may have to spit bars for the game. No, I'm not gonna make, I'm not gonna have another promise. I don't keep. Cut that. I'm not doing that. That's, I will not even pretend that I'm gonna do that. Anyway, go to dailywire.com slash shop to get your notorious SPG t-shirt.

Well, on Wednesdays for our members block portion of the show, I answer emails from listeners looking for advice. And I also sometimes issue corrections to the bad advice offered by people on other forums, especially the TikTok. And the bad advice videos are curated by my producer McKenna and Sentimey. At which point I go through them all and that's when I become depressed and disgusted and the light inside me dies a little more. But at least it makes good content. And that's how the creative process works. But yesterday, I was sent one bad advice video that is so bad, in which I found so viscerally abhorrent and repulsive that it immediately graduated from members block fodder to the daily cancellation. This of course is the greatest honor I can bestow on a terrible person. And we have a very terrible person for today's segment. Jessica Ashley builds herself as a divorce coach. This is apparently an actual industry that exists in our country. After a brief Google search, I discovered there are many divorce coaches and divorce consultants charging exorbitant hourly rates to encourage and facilitate the dissolution of marriages. The divorce coaches should not be confused with divorce lawyers. These are two different species of blood sucking parasites. Think of one as kind of like a deer tick and the other as a dog tick. And even the ticks have ticks as there are now many pricey online certification programs offered for those who want to become certified in the field of divorce coaching. So if you wish to be a certified, a certifier of certified divorce coach, then you get, then you have to do that. If you want to be a certifier of people who are certifying divorce coaches, there are probably different programs for that. And if you want to coach people who certify the people who certify the people who are divorce coaches, again, there is, I assume a program for that. One thing we've learned about the modern culture is that for every evil, for every brand of misery, there are a million vultures circling looking for a way to make a fast buck on someone else's poor life choices. In fact, there is so much misery and so many soulless profiteers trying to monetize it, that it becomes a kind of parasitic infinite regress. And somewhere in this garbage heap lies Jessica Ashley, who offers three month and six month divorce subscription services. She's also on call, by the way, ready for her phone or FaceTime consultations for anyone desperate and stupid enough to pay the money for it. And sorry, fellows, I got to tell you, she does stipulate that she is a divorce coach for moms specifically. Her website tagline is, a mom's best girlfriend in divorce. Though I strongly suspect that the market for divorce coaches consists almost entirely of women anyway. It's like if the cupcake wine company stipulated that it was just for women. It's already kind of implied by the nature of the product. But Jessica has developed a relatively sizable social media following, consisting entirely of the sorts of women who have been, would have been probably tried and convicted of witchcraft if they'd been born in a different era. These are women who can't get enough of this kind of stuff. Listen, the very best piece of advice I've ever received about divorce came in the early days of my own divorce from a friend who'd never been divorced and in fact, wasn't even married at the time. She said something so powerful, really got in there and it still rings true today. And I share it with my divorce coaching clients often. Here's the best piece of divorce advice I've ever heard. Your life is bigger than one man. Let's extend it. Your life is bigger than one relationship, one marriage, one moment in time. Even if that relationship comes with good intentions and oodles of love and big dreams in a home and kids and memories and vacations, what happens if you release your grasp that this relationship defines the whole of you and the whole of your life to see what could come next? What is happening now? There was a time before this relationship you are heading into the next part. What are the possibilities that extend far beyond this one person? Now, the people in the comments section are absolutely blown away by these platitudes that Jessica plagiarized from the slogans on inspirational keychains at a gift shop somewhere. She's like some kind of feminist bumper sticker. And yet many of the commenters claim that they were reduced to tears by Jessica's recitation of modernist cliches. One woman said that the video had saved her life, which is like having your life saved by a fortune cookie. Worst of all, the cliches aren't true because if you are betraying your vows and dismantling your marriage and running out on your husband and hurting your children in pursuit of your own personal happiness, you are not bigger than the moment. There are moments in life that make us who we are, moments that tell us and tell the world who we really are. And if you're following Jessica Ashley's advice, then you will answer that moment by announcing yourself to be a disloyal, self-centered, shallow, superficial narcissist. You are not bigger than the moment. You are defined by it. The whole point of marriage is that two become one. And when you say, I do to your spouse, you are entering into something that is bigger than you. And from this union springs a family and children and all the whole life that you could never live on your own. You're not bigger than that. If you shrink away from that commitment, that's a sacred institution that you've entered into, it's not because you're bigger than it, but because you are smaller than it. You are too small, too hollow to grasp the happiness that can be found in loyalty and fidelity to your family. In the same way, if you visit the Sistine Chapel and you find that you're bored or unimpressed by the sight, it's not because you're too significant or too big to appreciate it. Right? It's because you're such a small-minded brain-dead idiot that you can't recognize beauty when you're standing in its presence. That's why none of the divorced cat ladies who pay Jessica for consultations will go on to achieve great things or contribute to the world in any important way. None of them will. Now, they say that they're divorced and they're free now and they can go out into the world and do all these impressive things. They're not going to do anything. Instead, they'll wind up dating a bunch of pathetic men desperate enough to see them as romantic options, and they'll argue with their ex-husband's and they'll watch a lot of TV and they'll be promoted to middle management and they'll make $140,000 a year and they'll feel very accomplished and they'll spend their money on consumer products and cat food and they'll tell themselves a story about the journey they've been on. But that journey will be about as interesting and unique as a hallmark greeting card. Less interesting, actually, because at least a hallmark card is something that you buy to express gratitude for some other person in your life. But the women who listen to Jessica Ashley are far more focused on expressing gratitude towards themselves. They are collapsing into themselves sucked into the vortex of their own egos, the human equivalent of dying stars, slowly evolving into black holes. Except that entire galaxies really do revolve around actual black holes. In the case of these women, that's how they see themselves, but it's not the reality. Now, Jessica has more wisdom to offer though. In another video, she tries to explain why men might change during the course of a marriage. Here's her theory. Have you ever asked why your husband is radically changed? Why he seems like a completely different person than he was in the early days of marriage before kids or maybe even before you got married? Have you looked back over the last few years with a fine tooth comb and everything said and done looking for the perfect clue and incident or event that will help bring rationale to why he has turned so hateful in his words in action when you entered into this union with such love? Have you desperately sought out the perfect things for you to say or do that will get this marriage back on track that will get him back on track that will maybe be the cure marriage counseling or couples retreat or maybe a change in meds. Now, certainly trauma, grief, mental health issues, illness, injury, so many things can cause us to be in acts totally differently. But sometimes people's masks get too heavy and they fall off and they reveal who they really are. Now, sure, okay, that might be true. In some cases, there are some men who essentially dupe their wives into marriage, sociopaths who hide their true nature, their true selves. There are women who do this also, that can happen in a marriage. But if you're a woman whose husband seems to have grown miserable and angry during the course of your marriage, you should also consider the very real possibility that he has become that sort of man in response to the sort of woman you are. You should at least consider that possibility. That is a potential explanation that you must take into account. And if you're the sort of woman who is inclined to seek counsel from a cliche spewing divorce coach on TikTok, it seems rather likely that your miserable, angry, quote hateful husband has been broken down by years spent trying to please the shallow, egotistical, wench he married. Again, I'm obviously not saying this is always the case. I'm simply saying that it's a possibility you have to take into consideration. Because as men, we very much want our wives to support us, to be proud of us. We might not express that desire out loud. In fact, we probably will never say that. We aren't generally very adept at vocalizing those kinds of emotions and desires. But when a man comes home from his from work and his wife gives him a kiss and says, Hi, honey, I'm so glad you're home. When his wife comes up to him at the blue and says that she's proud of him and grateful for how hard he works, something like that, that man will immediately be on cloud nine. He will feel appreciated and respected and loved. This is what women need to understand about men. You don't need to give us very much to make us happy. We just need your affection. And we'll never tell you that. We'll never verbalize it. That's what we need. That's what we want. We actually want to feel appreciated and loved by our wives if you can believe it. That's that's something that men in a marriage really want. Let me let me give you let me give you a secret. Here's the cheat code. This is what every man wants. Okay, this is this is how you make him happy. He wants to walk in the door after work. And his children run up to him and say, Hi, daddy, and they give him a hug. And his wife comes over and smiles and kisses him. Dinner's on the stove. Everyone is happy and glad to see him. I mean, and that's all. It really is as simple as that. That's that's if a man has that, he has almost everything he needs in the world. Of course, now it can't be like that every day. And every family is different. Every situation is different. You might be a situation where maybe both spouses have to work, especially in this economy. Maybe the man works at different shifts, so he's not really coming home at dinner time. Anyway, my point is simply to convey to you how easy it is to make a man happy, how simple our desires actually are, how comparatively little we actually want, how love and affection and gratitude are the things that we really need in our marriage. So if your husband seems bitter and angry, you might consider whether you have given him any of those things, anytime recently or at all. Or you could just assume that he's a sociopathic monster who was wearing a mask and only let it slip after years of marriage. That could be the case. But if you assume it's the case, there's probably a rather self-serving reason for that. That's what divorce coach Jessica Ashley isn't going to tell you, and it's why she is today canceled. And that'll do it for us today. And we'll talk to you tomorrow. Have a great day. Godspeed."
