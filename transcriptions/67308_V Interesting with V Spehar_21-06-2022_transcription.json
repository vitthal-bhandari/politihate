Welcome to V interesting, where we break down the viral and very interesting news that you might have missed. I'm V Sphere, and on today's show Houston is buying back guns. And I believe that we have to look at every option to deal with individuals who have lost all sense of civility, of neighbor watching out for neighbor. And that's why I think among other efforts that we have to make, we have to be able to get the guns off the street. We'll chat with a theologian from St Joseph's University about the un-baptism trend. So a Catholic theologian who isn't very sensitive to these books, am I looking to say, oh, you think you're about de-baptizing yourself? Ha, you cannot de-baptize yourself. That's an ontological impossibility. Once you're a Christian, you're stuck. And later, Beauty Giant Revlon vials for bankruptcy protection and is blaming Kylie Jenner and J-Lo, all that and more coming up on today's V interesting. Let's be smart together. And now for the headlines. First up, Houston is eliminating chronic homelessness and reducing gun violence. You know, when we talk about the Lone Star State, it is not typically to celebrate their progressive social justice policies. It is quite the opposite mostly. Most of the time, I'm hitting you with some kind of like, what has Texas done now to chip away at democracy and diminish the civil rights of marginalized folks? But not today. Today, we have a surprise. Folks, today, I want to give all the flowers to Houston, Texas for a few reasons. First, the New York Times reported that over the last decade, by taking a comprehensive housing first approach, the city of Houston has cut homelessness by 63%. And it's for real, too. Unlike some other cities, MLA, they don't just sweep homeless camps and then wait for those people to move somewhere else and then clear out the camps again. In Houston, social workers meet with unhoused people wherever they are, and they offer them permanent housing, a one-bedroom apartment without the sobriety requirements that many temporary shelters have. Housing is the critical component to reducing the number of people who are homeless, but most of them, two years after the fact, are still housed, standing up, reuniting with their families, getting jobs. As Houston's mayor Sylvester Turner notes, it is working. The city works with nonprofits, faith-based organizations, and has invested $100 million into continuously offering not just the one-bedroom apartments for people to live in, but services like addiction and mental health treatment, job training, food security, and even literacy programs. The second Houston win, the city is piloting a program called One Safe Houston, a voluntary firearm buyback program. The governor signed the permitless carry, and that has increased the number of guns, and unfortunately, those guns are not guns in the hands of good guys. Good guys may get the guns, and then they're stolen, and these guns are then utilized in criminal acts. That was the voice of Representative Sheila Jackson. She is the Congressional Representative for Houston at the federal level, and she's working with the mayor of Houston to allocate both federal and city funds towards reducing the rate of gun violence. Houston is really putting their money where their mouth is. Beyond the voluntary buyback program, they have also funded research to identify crime hotspots and expand the use of neighborhood crime suppression, mental health teams, and more. This is the kind of stuff that we need. Human-centered approaches to identifying and improving conditions for people. So the root of why crime exists in the first place can be eradicated. Third thing, and maybe the most important, Houston-born Beyonce announced she's got a new album dropping July 29th. But real Bay fans know she secretly dropped the first song off this album this morning, so get out and listen to Break My Heart. God bless Texas. What beyond say, Givith? J-Lo beauty, take it away? Revlon has filed for bankruptcy and is blaming it on celebrity influencer makeup lines and the supply chain. What aren't we blaming on the supply chain these days? Revlon was founded during the Great Depression and has dominated makeup sales since the 1980s when billionaire Ron Perlman executed a hostile takeover of the brand. And while chatting about the ethics of a chapter 11 bankruptcy or how a billionaire is about to receive $575 million in special financing would be fun, I am not a finance bro and I just don't understand it. I really did try. So instead, we're going to focus on the Varukasalt daddy situation that's happening behind the scenes at Revlon. I want one. I want to go on and go. Ron handed the reins of Revlon over to his daughter Deborah in 2018 where she is clocking an almost $7 million salary. And she's even bragged about how well things were going. From an interview with Aesthetica magazine in 2021, she says, when I joined as the CEO of Revlon in 2018, our e-commerce sales were a small percentage of our overall business. I'm happy to say that we saw double digit growth in e-commerce sales last quarter on top of a very strong 2020 for e-commerce. Prior to the pandemic, we had implemented many digital innovations, which enabled us to continue to meet consumers' expectations while physical stores were closed throughout lockdown. Okay, so she was able to meet the customer expectations. But then this week says, hey, you know what? Turns out supply chain issues, celebrity makeup brands, and the pandemic are to blame for what, Deborah, for what? For the over $100 million profit Revlon saw last year, for the $7 million salary that you draw, how do you make $100 million in profit and then get to file for bankruptcy and have your debt cleared up? Deborah, you can put lipstick on a pig, but it is still yet another reason why we can surely cancel student loan debt instead of bailing out million dollar makeup companies. She was a bad egg. Speaking of people whose daddy is giving them their hair, there's, I don't know, there's a daddy joke in here somewhere. I am not going to make it. But I guess we could just consider this like the Post Father's Day daddy drama episode. Vince McMahon is stepping down as CEO of WWE. Now, something you might not have guessed about me is that I am a lifelong avid professional. I am a professional wrestling fan from Jake the Snake to John Cena to Roman Reigns. You would not be hard pressed to find me at a Smackdown. And being a wrestling fanatic, I am also well aware of the McMahon family drama. So not much surprises me. But I was surprised this past weekend to see that Vince McMahon had stepped down from his responsibilities after the Wall Street Journal published allegations that he had paid a former employee $3 million in hush money to keep their affair quiet. Now, okay. But then the lawyer for Mr. McMahon told the Journal that the employee had not made any claims of harassment against Vince and that Vince had even used personal funds to pay the settlement. So what is the big deal then? We are about to get into some deep wrestling culture speculating because the math ain't mathan on this. Vince McMahon doesn't step down. He didn't step down in the 90s when he was accused of forcing steroids on his performers. He didn't step down in 2002 after the plane ride from hell incident in which WWE settled sexual assault claims from two flight attendants. He didn't step down in 2005 after he used the N word in a match with John Cena and he didn't step down after wrestler Owen Hart literally died from a stunt gone wrong in the ring. In fact, he demanded that the show go on. So is this all just kayfabe? Is this whole Vince is stepping down over an affair? Just another shitty Mr. McMahon written storyline? Either way, as a fan, I am personally looking forward to what Vince's daughter, the new CEO, Stephanie McMahon and her husband Triple H do while daddy Vince is out on the injured roster. But I am more looking forward to Sasha Banks' NDA being thrown out so we can hear the truth about how black women are being mistreated inside the ring and how we can hold Vince accountable for that. Speaking of unsportsmanlike conduct, FINA, the governing body for international swimming put out a new gender inclusion policy. The new policy states that trans men just have to pass a testosterone level test to compete on the men's team. Okay, but trans women on the other hand cannot compete unless they completed their transition before the age of 12? You guys transitioning before age 12, for those who are unaware, is actually impossible. In all states and countries, it is illegal. You can't have gender affirming surgery until your 18 period. And natural puberty doesn't stop at 12. It actually kind of starts then. So this policy is not only medically impossible. It's certainly not gender inclusive and it's definitely not fair. To put a finer point on it, this is a policy that is against trans women. But this kind of stuff is never about being fair, right? It's all about centering the misogynistic idea that anyone born male has a natural advantage over anyone born female period. And we know that's not true. So how are people reacting? Caitlyn Jenner, you knew it was going to happen. Caitlyn, who enjoys her position on a women's golf team and who once won Glamour Magazine's Woman of the Year award has come out in support of this ban, saying it worked. It took a lot of heat, but what's fair is fair. Pink News criticized Caitlyn for her opinion, saying Caitlyn Jenner launches yet another disgraceful attack on trans athletes without a hint of irony. Caitlyn tweeted back, no, I just had the balls to stand up for women in girls and sports. But you didn't, Caitlyn. You didn't because trans women are women. While we are on the topic of people who need to give it a rest. Have you heard of the nap dress? Inspired by cottagecore, also known as farmcore or countrycore, it's a social media movement fostering the idea that living a simple rural lifestyle is best. And it is now declared nap dresses as the must have fit for the summer. And I did take my wife out to buy three of these over the weekend. So the marketing is working. Nap dresses are loose fitting, flowy and feminine, featuring heavy smocking over exaggerated puff sleeves and a typically long, maybe like slightly pleated skirt. A sort of whimsical twee-moo-moo, yes. And my wife loved them. So I'm just saying like, nap dresses are a thing now. But if a Zoe Deschanel-esque Moo Moo doesn't suit you, worry not. According to Lavender Magazine, the classic silk captain remains in style for men, women and friends beyond the binary. It is the must have fashion fluid, gender neutral, size inclusive and age appropriate, poolside, nap wrap. Also making a comeback this summer is Y2K trends, butterfly clips, crop tops, bright colors, smiley faces, platform slides, belly chains, chunky rings, camo cargo shorts, popped collars and faux hogs. Get in loser, we're going shopping. Alright, let's take a quick break to hear from our sponsors and maybe also take a little time to Google where to get a nap dress. When we come back, we will ask what does it mean to un-baptize yourself? And can an apple help? This message is sponsored by ColaGuard. Hi, I'm Kate Bowler and you might know me from another Lemonade on Media show called Everything Happens. If you listen to my show, you know that a lot of it is inspired by my experience with colon cancer. So of course, increasing awareness around colon cancer screening is really important to me. In case you didn't know, you should start screening at 45. And a great at-home option to screen for colon cancer is with ColaGuard. ColaGuard is the only FDA approved non-invasive screening test that looks for both altered DNA and blood in your stool. You can use this test on your own time at home with none of the prep that's required for a standard colonoscopy. ColaGuard offers control of your colon cancer screening by screening how you want and when you want. In addition to the convenience and ease of use, it's also affordable. Most insured patients pay zero dollars. I really admire what ColaGuard is doing, creating an easy to use and accessible way for people to get screened. So if you're 45 or older and at average risk, ask your healthcare provider about screening for colon cancer with ColaGuard. You can also request a ColaGuard prescription today at colaGuard.com slash podcast. Do not use ColaGuard if you've had adenomas, have inflammatory bowel disease, and certain hereditary syndromes, or a personal or family history of cola rectal cancer. False positive and negative results may occur. The positive result should be followed by a colonoscopy, not a replacement for colonoscopy in high risk patients. ColaGuard is available by prescription only. Get your screenings, everyone. In 2022, the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe vs. Wade. Since then, it's been a barrage of bad news. But behind the Bleak Headlines, there are people working to protect our right to control our future. The Defenders is a new 10-part series about the fight for freedom in a post- Roe America. Co-hosted by Samantha Bee and me, Gloria Riviera, the show will examine ways people are still accessing care from crossing state borders to self-managed abortion. You'll hear from activists, providers, and everyday people doing the work to expand reproductive freedom. We're here to tell you, anyone can become a defender. The Defenders is out now, wherever you get your podcasts. Hey friends, we are back and we're going to be talking about religion. Well, it's going to be the opposite of religion, so please stick with me. An un-religion, if you will. And why are we talking about that? Because of a recent TikTok trend. It's called un-baptism, where folks are both creating and then sharing the very unique ways in which they're choosing to separate themselves from their former religions and deconstruct some religious trauma. Look, I was born Catholic and I stepped away. I have shared in this strange journey with many of you. I've seen how beautiful the community we build through shared beliefs can be, but also how corrupt organized religion can be. It is lonely and it is scary to step away from the community that you belong to. But sometimes we have to do a scary thing, right? Sometimes if we do the little scary thing, like cutting ties with something or someone toxic, even if we loved them, it can help us be a better version of ourselves. So it makes sense to me, why someone might use something like an un-baptism as a way to just wash away the parts of religion that hurt them. Jason Stidl is a theologian and assistant professor of religious studies at St. Joseph's University in New York. He grew up as an evangelical Protestant, but after college and exploring his beliefs, he switched directions and became Catholic. He is here to help me unpack why people deconstruct their faith. So let's just hold hands through this. Jason, I have to say I'm so excited to chat with you because it's rare that you meet somebody who is also in the LGBTQ community who has the level of understanding of religion and specifically the Catholic religion that you do. And I feel like a very, a safety right now. It's like being in Jesus' arms himself. That's beautiful. Well, the Jesus I imagine, yes, is a very loving, welcoming, affirming type. So... I grew up Catholic as many kids do, and in a coastal eastern town, so very Connecticut Catholic, if you will, very Christmas-easter Catholic, if you will. But I did go to church school as a kid, and I was baptized almost immediately after birth at that time in the 80s. My mom was like, we couldn't take you out of the house until you were baptized in case, and I don't know, but if we got in a car accident, then your soul wouldn't go to heaven. And I remember thinking like, that is heavy, Ma. Like, that's dark. This baby is potentially not going to go to heaven if you don't have it baptized right away. Is that still kind of like the vibe? In a lot of places, yeah. You know, I grew up in a... I actually grew up in evangelical Protestant. I converted to Catholicism when I was 23, but I can remember being a kid and laying awake at night when I was seven or eight years old and remembering that I was going to go to hell if I hadn't asked Jesus into my heart, you know, if I hadn't repented of my sins. And there are a lot of folks for whom religion is grounded in fear, you know? It's this fear of a God who's going to send me to hell. It's this God who doesn't like me from the start, you know, maybe because of original sin or because of the things that I've done. And unfortunately, a lot of religious leaders frame Christianity in that way. We so often hear about the spiritual or religious trauma that people are experiencing. And sometimes it feels like the only way to go is to give up. Right. I have to completely separate myself. And for many folks, that is true and that is valid. And that is a little bit about what we're going to talk about right now. I was growing through TikTok the other day and stumbled across a new trending ritual that is called un-baptism. Are you familiar with un-baptisms? Yeah. I believe it's when people who were raised in Christian traditions were baptized as babies or children go through a ritual process to un-baptize themselves. It's sort of declassify themselves as Christians. Is it possible? So this, then I, of course, like stay up all night thinking about this. I'm like, okay, but if your soul was given to the Lord, even as a baby, like, who's soul is it to reclaim back? How do you get it back? Like, what do you think about it? Do you think it's, do you think it can work? Like, how does it work? Well, when I think of these rituals, first of all, I think of the people who are going through them, you know, or who think that it's an important expression of who they are. And I think for them, it is absolutely essential part of their own spiritual or non-spiritual growth. From a theological perspective, from a Catholic theological perspective, baptism is something that is final, right? So it is a sacrament, according to Catholic belief, it washes away original sin, and once that has happened, someone is fundamentally different. They cannot go back to a before baptism state, right? So a Catholic theologian who isn't very sensitive to these fucks, am I looking to say, oh, you think you're about de-baptizing yourself? Ha! You cannot de-baptize yourself. That's an ontological impossibility. Once you're a Christian, you're stuck. That's it forever. Of course, there is the belief in mortal sin, you know, so someone can always sin and always walk away from God's grace and reject, you know, the truth that the church teaches they've been given, but to be de-baptized is supposedly an impossibility. So I'm trying to figure it out now because it's like, one, the amount of effort that folks are putting into and thought that they're putting into un-baptizing themselves, I think is remarkable on its own, just as an action as a human. That there isn't really like a blueprint for this. There isn't, like you said, in Catholic theology, there isn't an undoing of the baptism by their standards, so it's not like you could go to Bible chapter 15 and say, okay, when you want out, like, how do you get jumped out of this gang or whatever? There's no process for that. Some of the things that folks are using, I was wondering if you maybe have like some education for us on it. One of the rituals that I saw, the person is like, you eat an apple and you take an herbal bath and then you commit yourself to being like a citizen of the universe, which I think is so beautiful. That sounds so wonderful. But when I saw the apple, I was like, okay, like, is the apple like Eve's apple original sin? That's how she got kicked out of paradise. This is how I'm going to get kicked out of paradise, quote, or is it maybe borrowed from like the Jewish faith that considers apple as like part of their new year tradition. This is like a rebirth situation. I didn't know if you had any thoughts on maybe where that all comes over the signal, you know, apples. Yeah, you know, I'm a firm believer that religion is what we make it. So they're all sorts of traditions, you know, and the different rituals that people embrace or don't embrace what they accept or don't accept is so incredibly personal. You know, so I have no doubt that that maybe many of these ritual elements are deeply rooted in people's beliefs, you know, or images, symbolism from perhaps several different religious currents or traditions. One of the rituals that I'm familiar with actually comes from my doctoral work back in the early 70s. There was a group called Kedoligos Barlarasa, which was a group of radical chicanos who were trying to reform the church. And one of their last acts as a group was they had a public burning of their baptismal certificates in front of the cathedral in Los Angeles as a protest of the archdiocese, pretty retrograde, very racist policies towards towards Mexican Americans. And yeah, they chose fire, you know, and I believe that the symbolism there was this is a purifying fire. This is a refining fire. And also, you know, we're going to burn the very certificates that you gave us, you know, it's a walking away from their authority saying you are not a spiritual authority. You are not over us, you know, in any sort of religious sense. We're on our own here. And I think that's the sad part is that a lot of people feel abandoned by their religious communities, you know, that these communities offer them absolutely nothing, you know, instead of hope. They offer condemnation instead of a healthy lifestyle to live by religion offers, you know, restrictive rules that can really, really hurt people. There have been some questions even around this unbaptism ritual of like who gets to decide the future of the church, right? Like do humans now have the same rights and ability to speak directly to God to get those kinds of messages to make those kinds of decisions to make the kind of changes that we want to for the modern era? What are your thoughts on them? Well, I think there's been a movement, even in the Catholic church and sometimes it gets obscured by actors who don't really like what's going on, but there's been a movement to recognize what's known as the priesthood of all believers, right, that all people have a role to play in God's plan of salvation. All people experience God moving in their lives. And that it's really important for the church to recognize that so that faith isn't something that's just owned or controlled by the bishops, but that we're really open to, you know, to use language of the Holy Spirit. Where is the Holy Spirit moving in people's everyday lives? You know, it's not just a matter of doctrine. It's not just a matter of what the archbishop or cardinal is preaching, but it's who is God to me? Who is God to you? Who is God to lay people? And what are the gifts that they bring, you know, to religious communities? Because really God isn't working. Everybody's like, you know, we can't put God into a box. That's not how God works. Even according to very fundamental forms of Catholic theology, God just can't be controlled like many religious leaders try to control God. Very much so. And like you were saying, the church is really made up of the people, not just its ideals and doctrines. As a theology professor, what are some of the common complaints you're hearing from college students? Like, I think the kids often have the answers. What are they doing to move forward through this difficult time? I think a lot of young people are stepping away from organized religion. You know, this is a huge trend we see. Religious communities just don't provide the support that young people need. They don't provide the moral leadership that young people need, quite frankly. Here in the US, you know, the sex abuse crisis has been huge. You know, Catholic bishops just don't have any moral authority anymore to be quite frank. And I think here in the US, I mean, people are turning to their families, you know, they're turning to their friendships. People are turning to online communities, you know, so things like TikTok, Twitter. This is providing forms of community and surprising, exciting new ways. For me, I'm more of a traditionalist, so I think of like sports leagues, you know, sort of traditional community groups that I'm part of a singing group that gets together. We just sing for each other, you know, and we have potlucks. And it's not religious at all. But we spend time together and healthy time, you know, good time, time that's affirming, time that's supportive. It's life. And it doesn't carry the baggage that sometimes religion can. I personally think that the unbaptism ritual is such a beautiful and personal experience. And I've felt very honored to be able to be included. Like, TikTok just invites you, people, TikTokkers invite you into their world, right? And you get to see how they're dealing with things. And I found it to be a very beautiful ritual. But it's something that I've noticed about it is it's a very lonely ritual as well. Sometimes when we get to a point where we've been such a part of a community, whether that's Catholic or Christian or Mormon or Jewish or evangelical or whatever the case may be, we get to this place where we say, I don't feel like I belong anymore. And all I can do is completely separate myself. And in doing so, I have to give up everything that made me feel loved or was a center to who I am as a person previously. And that really personally like hurts my heart. I don't want anyone to feel alone. I don't want anyone to feel like you have to kill everything about something that you cherished before to be able to go forward and be the person that you want to be, you know, after essentially deconstruction. What are some things that people can do to deconstruct the pain that they felt from religion without necessarily having to completely annihilate everything about that community that they cherished? Right. Well, I think all religions are like a buffet. You sort of take and pick the things that look good to you and leave the rest behind. You know, and this is just as much true for people who are deconstructing as it is for traditionalists. You know, some people are going to be jerks and they want to be jerks. So they take the parts of their faith that allows them to be jerks. Some people are going to be, you know, about family and community and they'll take the parts of their faith that support that. So, you know, I would encourage people do what feels right. You know, the religion will always be there if going to mass is something that's triggering or going to church or synagogue or whatever. Don't go. Take some time off. You know, the community will be there when you get back. You know, and I think being confident in who we are and being, you know, from a spiritual sense, being confident who God created us to be gives us the freedom to do that, you know, to take some time aside. And I think that's what I was just saying. I was just like, I was just like, I just need a breather, you know, and some people might have to step away forever. But I think there are also ways to build new communities. You know, there are ways to build new rituals. If it's not an explicitly religious community, you know, in annual family picnic, an annual picnic with friends that marks certain events. And they're not formally Soviet countries. And they're, you know, during communism, they try to do away with Christianity. So they started celebrating New Year's sort of their winter family festival celebration. And to this day, those friends of mine find New Year's to be far more meaningful than they do for Christmas, you know, so I think it's a matter of discerning. What are the good things, what are the beautiful things that I experienced? And if I've been hurt by a religious community, how can I rebuild those in new and creative ways? You know, what are the communities that could fulfill those needs? What are the rituals that could fulfill those needs? Which is that need for community, for belonging, for celebration, for just feeling the feelings of being human and celebrating those and being there for our fellow, you know, I don't want to say our fellow man. But our fellow man. Fellow people. Fellow people. Yes. Because I mean, that is the part that holds people in religion. And that's the part that people miss the most. And if you hear anything from this, I hope it's that it doesn't have to be. There are communities, like you said, on TikTok or on Instagram or in real life or sports clubs, where we can continue to celebrate each other and build that community that we miss often when we leave religion. No, you know, I'd encourage people to trust your gut. First of all, you know, if a place feels safe, unsafe or dangerous, get out of there, you know. And likewise, if people feel drawn back to religious community, try it out. You know, sometimes religion can surprise us as a gay Catholic. You know, I've been surprised to find that there are affirming communities. Like you said, it doesn't have to be all or nothing. You know, and I think my goal for me is to be secure in who I am, you know, secure in my relationship so that if I need to walk away, I can walk away. And if I need to stay or want to stay, I can stay, you know. I think getting a good therapist is a good idea for everybody too. That's helped me process a lot of my stuff. And having friends who love me accept me for who I am, no matter what. That's also really key. Yes. Thank you so much for being with me today, Jason. I am personally feeling a little bit better. Like, okay, it's not all or nothing. We can do a little bit of everything. We can take breaks when we need them. We don't need to be completely alone. But whatever your body is telling you, you need to do to separate yourself from any trauma that you may have previously experienced and are too afraid to be a part of right now is absolutely valid and important. And, you know, there'll be folks that are there for you every step of this way, including my new friend, Jason, my formerly fundamentalist Catholic friend Jason. All right. It's a pleasure to speak with you. Okay, my friends. How are we feeling? Did that help you make some sense of, like, stuff that you might have been thinking about with regards to religion and sort of just being your best person? Yeah, I know it gave me a lot to think about. And when we come back, we're going to have something to feel good about because we always end with good news. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day. I'm going to have a great day.\ufffd Oh, september 16 Hi, friends, I have an exciting announcement. You can now show your support for your show with your very own Let's Be Smart Together T shirts, mug's together and match outfits. Welcome back. Welcome back. I hope you all took a little break, a little breath. We are going to get into all of the things to feel good about this week. First up is a piece from our friends at The Washington Post. Lego is set to open a new factory in Virginia. The progressive Dutch company said that they won't be pitted against the deeply conservative governor of Virginia the way that Disney has been pitted against the governor of Florida. Lego literally means play well, so I'm super hopeful here. But they have already pushed back on some of the governor's policies. Yunken wants to prohibit critical race theory in K through 12 classrooms. Lego says we stand against racism and even donate to organizations that support black children and educate all children about racial inequality. And it supports coal. Lego is planning an ambitious sustainability agenda. The factory is even going to be carbon neutral and features a solar energy power plant. Legos have not been American made for over 16 years, so it is very exciting to see them invest $1 billion into the new factory, which will employ 1,800 people and opens in 2025. Speaking of blocks, the crypto craze may be crashing, but there is one thing that is one group that is benefiting gamers for years. Crypto miners had snapped up the graphic processing units or GPU's to provide the computing power necessary to run their mining rigs. But with the crypto crash, miners are offloading their chips, meaning that gamers and digital artists who have been waiting for high end graphics cards are finally able to upgrade their custom made consoles. For those of you worried that the crypto bust will further inflation or like tank the US economy worry not expert economists say that because the world of crypto had operated so decidedly separate from any established currency system, there will be no drag on the US dollars value.
