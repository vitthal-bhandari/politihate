Vincero watches.com slash Bongino. See my picks. Check them out. All right. Let's go. So here's my story first before we get started. So yesterday, for those of you who I was talking about earlier in the week, the screwy recording schedule, thanks to Joe and Paul Bins to understand. I had to head up north to go do a recording for Life Liberty in LeVin, which is there it is a picture of me and Mark taking yesterday on the set. It will be on this Sunday on Fox 10 p.m. Eastern time, a full hour, me and my good friend, the great one, Mark and I are buddies. I don't say that to be a name dropper. He's just a really good man. He is and he's been great to me. And I can't thank him enough for having me on again. It's my second appearance. It's just me this time. Last time I was on with the Genova and ladies and gentlemen, I'm not messing with you. It is the single best interview I have ever done. Thanks to Mark and his questions on the collusion hoax and Mueller and on my new book exonerated and why the book matters. You will please DVR it. You will love this show. If you don't, I will be astonished. Send this your emails. My emails on the website. Love to see your views. But here's the story. I fly up to Virginia, right? It's a pain to get there from where I am in Southern Florida. Yeah. So it's a pain to get there. So I had to fly out of Reagan, which is kind of far from where the studio is instead of the closer airport, right? So I'm coming back after filming this hour long episode with Mark, excoriating Bob Mueller and the horrible witch and folks who I've not told you on this story. Who know why pass in the airport who gives me the stink guy? Do you know the stink guy? Like you would not believe Bob Mueller. I tweeted it out. Dude, brother, I'm not kidding. That's why I didn't tell you before the show. Bob, he gives me this now my eyesight's not as great as it was years ago. So I see him from, you know, Reagan's always crowded, especially that terminal with JetBlue is so I pass Madeline Albright. She walks by me first and then I see this tall guy. And I'm like, you know, when you can even in a crowd, you can see why someone's staring at you. I'm like, why is this dude giving me the stink guy? It's Mueller. So I stare him right back in the face and he walks by drops his head and keeps going. And I tweeted out immediately before I got on the plane. I'm like, this is probably the most priceless moment of my entire life. Just get done filming Life Liberty live in, excoriating this guy's horrible investigation. And who do I pass? Bob Mueller. So I thought you like that. Don't forget to watch the show. All right. So let's get to this first right. Good story. So impeachment theater up on Capitol Hill yesterday. Jerry Nadler and his hapless judiciary committee. This guy's just a pathetic excuse for a congressman. What a failed human being. He had this impeachment hearing faux nonsense. It's not even an impeach. It's just an act. The whole thing's a joke. The Democrats want to get on TV to raise money. So he has this hearing and he makes a huge, huge, Joe, huge, reminds me of a pretty woman, the Julia Roberts thing, which she goes back in the boutique store. Right. Yet when when they don't send when they don't want to sell her clothes, she's like, you made a big mistake. She's showing on the bags of clothes. She bought us a huge, huge, huge, he brings up Corey Lewandowski, who in one of the greatest on the Libs appearances we've ever seen up on Capitol Hill, just absolutely decimates. Hat tip Corey. I know Corey disclosure. Good man. He just destroyed. He's the liberals and makes Jerry Nadler look look like a fool again. How many times is Nadler? They're gonna have these hearings. They had the Mueller hearing blew up in their face. Of course, the Democrats had the Cohen hearing before that that blew up in their face. They just look like morons. Now, before I get to some of the videos, I have four videos from there just to sum up what happened. I want to give you a little behind the scenes. So you have some more in depth color than just me ragging on the dopey Dems about what's really going on. So I scoured the internet and always I wind up back at the same place every time Andy McCarthy, he's just a godsend to our movement. He has this piece up a national review. But folks, please read the show notes today at bongino.com or if you subscribe to my email is I have about eight stories a little longer today, but they're all must reads. It's everything from UFOs to this. Please read this right. National review. Can Trump assert executive privilege over his conversations with Corey Lewandowski by Andrew McCarthy? Now, before we get to the videos, what happened? What did the Democrats want? And what's the problem going on behind the scenes? So, Jerry Nadler, hapless Jerry Nadler, cannot impeach the president. Why? He doesn't have the votes. Nancy Pelosi is not going to put an impeachment resolution on the floor and lose. Even if they do get an impeachment resolution passed on the floor, Joe, the president's not removed from office. I know you know this, but for some who to introduction of the Constitution, notably the liberals, not the conservatives listening. Impeachment does not remove you from office. If you are impeached, it's similar to an indictment on the judicial side that there is then a trial, but the trial is not in our course. The trial is that in the US Senate where you need 67 votes, you're not going to get them. The Democrats don't have 67 centers to go on the record to impeach and remove the president from office. Excuse me. It's not going to happen. It's like fetch from mean girls. It is not going to happen, Gretchen, stop trying to make fetch happen. Pelosi knows this. She knows it would suck all the energy out of the room. They would lose and they would be humiliated by Donald Trump again. Nadler, who is a hapless loser. Nadler has a primary opponent shockingly to the left of of Nadler. So Nadler has to raise money. And he's afraid to be an AOC like Joe Crowley, in other words, losing a primary Joe. So he has to put on what everybody out there has been calling impeachment theater. In other words, he's not going to impeach. I don't wink at a nod, but he's going to keep it going. And these these hearings like it looks like there's an impeachment. So they brought up Corey Lewandowski. Now, as Andy McCarthy covers in the piece, what's at issue here is is the nature of the communications with President Trump and Corey Lewandowski is that privilege? Does it fall under the presidential executive privilege? Now, as McCarthy states in his piece, this is an issue of substance not form the nature of communication, not the status of the presidential adviser. Hold that one second. Here's the Democrat argument. So you have a little in depth color to this to this story. The Democrat argument, which is false, I believe, excuse me, so does McCarthy is that Corey Lewandowski is not a White House staffer. Therefore, his communications don't fall under executive presidential privilege in his communications. But as McCarthy, if you put that up again, correctly, I believe indicates it doesn't matter. It's the nature of what was said in the communication, Joseph, not the status of the adviser. McCarthy goes on. We want the president to be able to have candid conversations with worthy advisors in and out of the government in order to make the best decisions for the country. Moreover, our system is based on separation of powers. So Congress should not intrude on communications the president has in furtherance of exercising his the president's legitimate authority. Now, the piece goes on, but I want to get to the video. He says, listen, Henry Kissinger, Nick's Nick, obviously, he was a statesman with Nixon. Kissinger has been consulted by many administrations despite not having an official US government role. And by many presidents since Nixon left office, you just got to this that mean those aren't privileged either. McCarthy's right. The whole Lewandowski thing is a farce. It's based on the idea that Lewandowski was instructed allegedly by the president of the United States to hand the letter to sessions, telling sessions to limit the Mueller probe. Folks, none of that's even illegal. That's a legitimate exercise of presidential authority. As McCarthy points out, was it a good or bad political decision? I don't know. That's for you to decide the voters. But Joe, Bob Mueller, Department of Justice fall under the executive branch. They are subordinate officers to the president. Whether the president asked Lewandowski to hand sessions a letter limiting the scope of Mueller's pro-bonon is a political question, not a legal one. The Democrat, you following me, brother? The Democrats are suggesting that that was an obstruction of justice act, handing that letter Lewandowski. The Republicans are saying whether it was a bad political decision is up for you to decide it is not a legal one. The bottom aller in the DOJ worked for the president. If he hand sessions a letter and tell him it's a presidential order. So this whole thing is nonsense. Now let's get through it. First, this is kind of a funny one. Be more substance than the other ones. But this is Lewandowski. He's going back and forth with Jerry Nather and the hapless pathetic Jerry Nather who's putting on this impeachment theater can't even figure out how to get a roll call vote going. Check out this absurdity. Too many discussions did you meet with the president alone in the White House in 2017? I don't know the answer to that. How many times did he direct you to deliver a message to a member of his cabinet? The White House has directed not to disclose the substance of any discussions with the president. Did he ever discuss with you any concerns that he may have committed a criminal offense? The White House has directed not to disclose the substance of any discussions with the president or his advisors to protect executive branch confidentiality. I recognize this is not my privilege. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order pursuant to clause 2J to a rule 111 that the gentleman is out of order. He has exceeded the timeline under the five-minute rule. I will enforce the time limit under the five-minute rule. I challenge the ruling. The ruling of the chair is challenged. All those in favor of overriding the rule of the chair will say aye. Opposed? No? No. Roll call. Roll call is asked to clerk will quote. Where's the clerk? We can. I mean this clerk will call the roll. Mr. Nadler. Mr. Chairman, I'm going to say that. Let's bring in our legal analyst to break down what is happening here. Nadler can't even figure out where the clerk is. Hat tip Doug Collins, a Republican congressman who's the ranking on the committee who just owns Nadler and every other. Nadler looks so confused about what to do. It's just hysterical to watch. So I just wanted to put that one up there. Got a few more. Let me get through here is Lewandowski absolutely decimating again. Nadler making him look like a total fool. How he thinks Nadler, this works really politically. Honestly, folks, is seriously perplexing to me. Here's another on the libs moment. Lewandowski striking back at Nadler. Nice work here. Mr. Lewandowski, is it correct that it's reported in the Mueller report on June 19th, 2017. You met alone in the Oval Office with the president. I said is there a book in page number you can reference me to please? I don't have a copy of the report in front of me. Volume two page 90. But I simply ask you, is it correct that as reported in the Mueller report on June 19th, 2017, you met alone in the Oval Office with the president? Could you read the exact language of the reports or I don't have it available to me? I don't think I need to do that. I have limited time. Did you meet alone with the president of that date? Congressman, I'd like you to refresh my memory by providing a copy of the reports so I can follow along. Hey, you don't have a copy with you? I don't have a copy of the report. Congressman. Clark will say. Mr. Chairman, I request that the clock be stopped while this charade is sorted out. I'm sorry, Congressman. What page was it? The clock should have been stopped and should remain stopped. Page 90, Volume two. Okay, which paragraph, sir? I don't have it in front of me. I think time. Listen, own the libs. It's a lifestyle. Corey Lewandowski is clearly master the art of lib ownership here, making it look like a fool. What's going on there behind the scenes again to provide some color commentary to what is actually a very funny moment and one kind of viral yesterday. Folks, we owe them no respect up on the hill. And I'm deeply sorry if this offends you. And I know I'll get some emails on this and that's okay. We can politely disagree. You know, if I'm not here to lie to you, I'm here to give you an honest opinion. If you enjoy it, the show is for you, if not, maybe not, but that's your choice. I can't cater to every whim out there. We don't know these people respect. Now, I get it. Some of you may be listening, go, Dan, we should be better than them. You know, when we testify and, you know, we should look like the whatever, upstanding citizens. Don't we are upstanding citizens. We believe in God given rights for everyone, even liberals. But we don't know Jerry Nadler, David Sisselini, and the clown show of Democrats on that committee, Eric Swalwell and others. We don't owe them a thing, a damn thing. And I mean this, I'm being dead serious when I tell you this. If you are a victim of this nonsense, and I do mean a victim, not in the snowflake way, where you get dragged up there to which hunt the president on a fake charge based on a corrupt spying investigation by a Democrat investigation where they're trying to pin it on you and flip the script, you don't owe them squat. Now, what happened there? Corey Lewandowski, exercising the executive privilege of the president, refused to testify outside of anything in the Mueller report. So Jerry Nadler asked him, well, I want to talk about this thing in the Mueller report then. Of course, Nadler wasn't smart enough to actually give Corey Lewandowski a copy of the Mueller report. And Lewandowski smartly said, well, you read it, Congressman, I don't have it in front of me either. Too bad. You sit up there, folks. And if you listen, call me if you want. I don't care. And you delay that thing all day because you don't owe them squat, because these are not decent people. They live in a moral and ethical vacuum. These are spineless jellyfish worms who frame the present United States, abuse the intelligence and law enforcement community, attacked innocent American patriots with their IRS targeting, spied on people during the Obama administration, use political hacks to leak stuff to the media to ruin people's lives. Attacked an innocent man in Brett Kavanaugh this weekend with another fake news story. These people are slimed. You don't owe them squat. You do exactly what Lewandowski did. You delay and you make them look like the fools they are. Corey gets the new rules, dude. Corey gets it big time, big time. I was, you know what, that's you got it. I was just going to new rules, folks. He gets it. We apply the same rules the Democrats apply to us right back to them. You don't like syrup of Ipikak? Well, you're going to taste it. Now you know, you want to feed it to us. Now you're going to taste Ipikak. Yeah, man. It ain't cute. I promise you ask anyone who was forced to swallow Ipikak in the 60s and 70s. Makes your vomit. It's disgusting. Now we're going to give you guys the Ipikak. See how you like it. All right, moving on. Here's Lewandowski with his zinger pointing out the absolute hypocrisy of the fake, spineless, jelly-fist, loser Democrats about this email thing. He's asked the question about his emails with President Trump. This is just comedic gold here. I also received hundreds of thousands of emails. Some days with as many as a thousand emails. And unlike Hillary Clinton, I don't think I ever deleted any of those. If this was ever, ever a moment for the thug life glasses. We get a double motley. This is that minimum job. Come on, get him. This is that minimum of government. This is a minimum, a double. We've only had, I think, one quadruple motley in the history. That is at minimum, a double motley right there. Okay. Beautiful. Unlike Hillary, I have not deleted my, I love this guy. Nice. Excellent. Made to look like fools again. New rules as Jo just accurately said. All right, I got to move on. I got to let to get through. This is him trolling. Just the, I mean, Sheila Jackson Lee is like the whole, her whole Sheila Jackson Lee. I could put a highlight role of Sheila Jackson Lee mess up. I'm going to get through a tweet by Katie Palis. You have to, but here's Corey, just knocking Sheila Jackson Lee offer a high horse here, making her look just silly. Check this out. Segregation. When he asks you to deliver him a note about that very investigation, did the president tell you that? What you've just risen on the screen, Congressman? You need to look at the screen. There it is. Yes or no, read the screen. You're welcome to read it, Congressman. You're welcome to be stalling. And I'm not going to stall. You either answer the question. Yes or no. Congressman, I'll take the same privileges. You've asked other members. I tell you that nobody at the White House was supposed to even contact the attorney general about the investigation. That you can answer. Yes or no. I will not disclose any conversation I've had with the president, Congressman. Again, you are obviously here to block any reasonable inquiry into the truth or not of this administration. The White House counsel quote, shortly after Sessions announced his recusal, directed that Sessions should not be contacted about the Special Counsel investigation. We missed the end. There's the end of that. I'm sorry. There's a part of that at the end where he just wrecks her and she says, is there a question in this? Yes, there's a question because I just heard a rant. Either way, nice work with Sheila Jackson. But you've probably seen it. I'm sorry. Maybe I'll put it in there tomorrow. That's my fault. I probably cut the wrong time either way Sheila Jackson Lee just getting wrecked. Here's a tweet by Katie Pavlich, by the way. Sheila Jackson Lee at one point. This is hysterical. Sheila Jackson Lee refers to volume two of them. All the report. That's volume 11. Well, that is confusing. Roman Dan. Yeah. Those two little lines next to each other. Geez. Roman numerals escaped. I'm not I'm just leaving that right there. Very good. Katie Pavlich, good pickup of volume 11. I didn't know there was a volume 11 of the Mueller. But may I have to go back and leave right in my second book, etc. Hey Mark, don't launch that life limit even. I got to update it. There's a volume 11 of the Mueller report. We all missed. Stop the show. Stop the presses. I got to fly back to Virginia to recut one show for this weekend. We missed volume 11 of the Mueller report, otherwise known as volume. All right. Don't go anywhere. I've got video, beta, double and down on gun control. I'm getting tired of this Australia stuff. I got to do what Australia that I even heard it last night on Fox, which is disappointing. And I got Omar stuff and the vaping thing. So it really, this Joe is loaded. I can't say stacked. Someone didn't like that. I didn't even say I say stacked too much. All right.

My favorite razor by far Joe uses it too. Love you. Right Joe. Yes I do. Yeah, man. Okay. Uh, but oh Robert Francis. But oh, Rourke has now doubled and tripled down on his gun confiscation plan. So he was asked by the way, the hat tip to the woman on this. What was her name? I think we have in the script. But this is a video for my local reporter getting batot on the record saying, Hey, what are you going to do when you implement your mandatory gun confiscation? Folks, I'm I know I say this sometimes and even I've made this mistake. But please stop referring to abatos plan as a gun buyback. It is not a buyback. You cannot buy back what you never bought in the first place and don't own. My guns are not for sale. Number one. Number two, I did not buy them from the government. I bought them from a free market manufacturer that manufactures quality firearms. I don't owe the government anything. A mandatory buyback is a confiscation program. Do not let the left monopolize the language. This is a confiscation program period. You can't buy back what you don't own. So a reporter asked Beto, well, what are you going to do if people don't, you know, sell you your guns back? Here was his answer. Thanks. Could someone go to jail? It was for boys. I begin by saying that we expect our fellow Americans to follow the law. If they do not, there would be a fine imposed to compel them to follow the law. We've seen this implemented successfully in Australia, where you've seen a near 50% reduction in gun violence deaths in that country. No, thank you. Fed the liar buzzer. That is not true. Captain Beto, that is not true. He's making that up. The Australia stuff. I'm going to get to that in a second. The Australia stuff. But on the first part, do you hear what he said? You're going to be fine. So find what? I mean, how is that going to work? It's going to be now, ladies and gentlemen, there are tens of millions of AR 15 platform rifles in the country right now. Do you have any idea? I said this to Paula last night, we were chatting about this. Do you have any idea the complicated, dangerous logistics behind a mass confiscation of tens of millions of AR platforms across the country? Oh, daddy. I'm not even going on how, because this is folks, nobody's turning them in. There will be civil disobedience on a mass scale. Like I promise you have never seen before. I would estimate less than 5% of that. I'm being generous at 5% less than 5% of the population is going to turn over their ARs. That is why the want universal background checks, Joe, the Democrats put two and two together. We discussed this on yesterday's show. The Democrats want universal background checks to keep a list, a registry. That's the registry they will cross reference with IRS records or whatever, and they'll use the IRS to find you if you have an AR and don't turn it in. Don't turn it in. Don't underestimate these people. That's the first part of his nonsense. He now wants to find you this clown who's at what 4% in the polls. He keeps talking about, I heard this on Foxless night too, the effectiveness of the Australian national firearms, uh, register with a confiscated people's firearms called the NFA. Ladies and gentlemen, now we've discussed this on the show before, but sometimes topics tend to become evergreen. And now that this is creeping up again, and I'm hearing it in debates, I even heard a couple liberals on Fox talk about it the other day. The Australian gun confiscation did not do what Beto said and what liberals tell you it did in the show notes today, which I can't recommend enough. Please subscribe to my email list. Matt Palumbo's article. Now he wrote this last year. November, 2018, the truth about Australian gun control up on Gino dot com. This is an excellent, excellent piece. He also covers this, I believe in debunk this is book, um, folks, number one on the gun control topic from the piece on Australia. He says the smoking gun pun intended proving that Australia's disappearance and mass shooting. So just to be clear, the liberals want you to believe that mass shootings in Australia took a dramatic decline because they confiscated the guns. So Matt correctly says, this decline is not due to gun control in that most of Australia's mass public shootings were committed with guns, not banned by the gun confiscation, the NFA and are still legal. In a study by criminologist Gary Klecky as the sources in there too, found that just two of Australia's mass shootings in the 18 years preceding the confiscation were committed by firearms banned by the NFA. So in other words, there are no laws in effect that could have possibly prevented all but two of Australia's mass shootings from happening again, happening again. The guns used in those shootings were largely not taken by the by the Australian gun confiscation. All right. So saying the gun confiscation stopped the mass shootings that didn't confiscate those guns is pure idiocy. But Beethoven doesn't know that now I started with the most nuanced point, not a complicated one. You're all very bright. You'll figure that out. That's a bit of a nuanced point. Well, you're saying that you're making a causal inference. The cause of the decrease in Australia's mass shooting, you're saying the cause of it was a gun ban. The problem is the firearms used in those mass shootings were not banned by the actual law. So your causal inference is dopey. It's just for fabrication. The second point before I get back to Matt's piece, I want to put this is from the Sydney Morning Herald. Ladies and gentlemen, by Bianca Hall, March 27 2019, this is in the show notes too. Ladies and gentlemen, this is one of those articles. I strongly encourage you to screenshot and keep up on your phone for debating your liberal friends who cite Australia as successful models for gun control. Sydney Morning Herald, more guns in Australia now, than before the Port Arthur massacre new report. Folks, I don't know what else to tell you. If your assertion that the Australian gun confiscation led to X, the Australian gun confiscation led to Y, you fill in with that Y is less gun homicides, less mass shootings. And the reason I say the X, Y thing is not to, you know, introduce algebra one on one and make this over complicated. It's because every time I hear liberals debate and use Australia, the Y is different. You get what I'm saying, Joe? They'll say X, the Australian gun control led to decreased violence, decreased shootings, decreased mass homicides, decreased masher. The Y changes all the time. That's why I'm using variables here, because liberals will say make up anything. So the problem with their gun confiscation led to Y theory is that there are more guns now. So whatever the Y is, you're actually making the opposite point. If your point is gun confiscation led to less gun violence, your point is the opposite one, because there are more guns now. So what you're saying is more guns, here it is from the piece. The number of firearms in Australia is dramatically higher than before the Port Arthur massacre. They killed 35 people, raising fears that the gun lobby's efforts to relax national restrictions are bearing fruit. There are more guns now. So whatever point you think you made, the point is that more guns equal, this is, by the way, I'm not making a causal inference. I'm using their logic. You're saying gun confiscation equals less gun homicides. I'm telling you by your own logic, if there are more guns now, that means more guns equals less gun crime. They're making X caused Y inferences that are not true. I'm telling you that the X gun confiscation, there are more guns now. So if there's an equals in between those two things, whatever you're saying it equals is the exact opposite argument. Gun confiscation with less crime. Well, there are more guns now. So you're saying more guns leads to less crime. That's not what I'm saying. How are you not saying that? There are more guns in Australia now. No, there aren't. Yes, there are. Do you not know the data? When I said this, I did an interview with 60 minutes Australia. You all can find it on the internet if you want. Remember that. The guy here, they were nice people, but they were lives. There's no doubt about it by our standards. Liberal overseas liberals means different things sometimes. And a traditional liberalism, of course, something totally different in America too. The guy was stunned. The interviewer, when I told him that, he said, no, there aren't. There aren't more guns now in Australia. I said, sir, do you want to Google it? And I'm telling you at the end of the interview, he said, I'm glad you told me that because I didn't know that either. I'm not making that up. I'm not like revealing behind the scenes secrets to embarrass the guy. He told me after the interview, he didn't know that. So whatever point you're making on Australia, it's the opposite one of what you think you're making. Finally, on Australia, going back to Matt's piece, debunking their entire thesis is this. So Matt asked, did gun violence really decline in Australia from the piece? Well, gun violence did fall like Iraq and Australia following gun control. All right, you may be saying, Oh my gosh, Dan argument over. No, now we do the hard thinking. This is where the liberal stop. Fell by roughly half in the two decades following it. And Joe, it also happened to fall like a rock in America too. Everything is relative. And Australia's gun violence decline, post gun control occurred at a time when crime was declining globally. A 2016, this is the kicker. A 2016 American medical association study, not some big conservative group, the AMA folks, examined trends in firearm homicides and suicides before and after the adaptation of gun control in Australia from the 1996 confiscation. And found no evidence. Let me repeat, no evidence of a statistically significant effect of gun control on the pre existing downward trend of the firearm homicide rate. Crime it change. Crime it change was happening. You should put that on the teacher. Crime it change was happening globally. Crime was going down. The climate change effect was going down. You making a causal again, I know lives. I'm sorry you have to think this through. Causation and correlation are different things. I use this example all the time. You see more head colds in the winter. It's not because cold weather causes head colds as nothing to do with it. Cold weather causes you to secrete more mucus, which is completely independent, which makes you do what? Rub your nose more where you transfer rhinoviruses up your nose. Cold weather does not cause you to be sick. There is a correlation. Yes, these are completely different things. So the fact that Australia passed a gun confiscation measure and after that gun confiscation measure, gun crime continued to go down has nothing to do with cause according to the AMA's own study. They were correlated. Why Joe? Because as Joe said, crime it change was happening around the great, by the way, was happening around the globe and everywhere gun control, gun confiscation or not. Gun crime suicides, homicides were going down. What was the cause? It wasn't the gun control. I cuz there are more guns now. The causes could be a multitude of different things, Joe, more effective policing. The implementation of broken windows type policing in different parts of the world. Better technology for tracking criminality. None of this has anything to do with confiscating guns from law abiding citizens in Australia or elsewhere. Stop making it up and conservatives. I gotta tell you, this is a little bit of a, a little bit of a tick in my skin that bothers me. If you're gonna go on TV and argue this, please have this stuff handy in the front of your mind immediately. Liberals will bring up Australia every single time with their x, y comparison. Australian gun confiscation led to why you have to be able to rebut it instantly. There's no causal evidence at all that that caused this decrease in gun crime. None. AMA's own study proves it. Secondly, there are more guns in Australia now. So whatever point you're making, you're making the opposite. Have this stuff on the tip of your tongue. Third, gun crime was going down globally before anything was done to confiscate people's guns. Anyway, you're making a correlation, not a causal, you're making a correlational inference, not a causal one. Important having it at the tip of your head always, because libs are really sneaky with this stuff. All right, our last sponsor of the day, but a great one. He looks sleep. I needed he looks sleep.

The Ilhan Omar story has just exploded, folks. Again, what I find outlandish, I don't want to say unbelievable because it is believable given how awful the mainstream media is, Joe, is how you can continue to scrutinize the background of Donald Trump while finding no evidence of illegal behavior at all. Yet the evidence that Ilhan Omar may have married her brother. This is a Democrat Congresswoman with a heavy following. The evidence is now overwhelming. The media is entirely completely uninterested in this story. You know you're onto something when the conspiracy theory blogs, the Daily Beast, the media matters, the Wackos. When they start picking up on the story, Joe, as I've said before, and they start warning conservatives, don't go near this story, you conservatives. We just give them the double barrel middle finger because I don't deal with blogs with 10 or 12 readers about humiliating them. They're really worried about this Ilhan Omar story. What happened? Daily Caller piece, again, in the show notes today, great articles in the show notes. You will be much more informed when you're done. Daily Caller piece, check this out, totally worth your time. There's a tweet that Ilhan Omar deleted. Ilhan Omar, it was an older tweet. Why did she delete this tweet? Let's check out the tweet first. This is the tweet. This was back in 2013, 616, 2013. This is her verified account. She said, happy Father's Day to my Abu. I'm sorry, I don't know what that means. No, no, no, or Syed. I am forever grateful to Allah for giving me the best father and it goes on. It links to an Instagram. So just to be clear, I'm going to tell you how this relates to her allegedly marrying her brother, which is really deeply disturbing, obviously. Omar deleted that tweet and has been trying to hide the identity of her father for a long time now to give both sides if there are side. But again, I'll do what the New York Times won't do for conservatives. Her staff put out a statement today saying, well, you know, nor Syed means something like happy light. And it's just something we said and whatever. And she's still trying to hide the fact that there's a relationship, obviously, with this guy in the war, Syed. Now, why does this matter? Okay. Because Omar is alleged to have married her brother, Ahmed Noor Syed, Elmi, in 2009. She denies, of course, this is her brother. While she's married to Ahmed Noor Syed, by the way, she's in a relationship with another guy. I think his name is Hersey. It's the same Hersey who she has a child with. Ilan Omar, then formally divorces what allegedly her brother, Ahmed Noor Syed, divorces him and says, I've never seen him again. She divorces him in 2012. So you tracking? 2009. Marries the alleged brother Ahmed Noor Syed. So the son of Noor Syed, who she wishes happy father's day. She divorces him in 2012 says, I don't know where he is. I've never seen him. And of course, ignores the fact that this could be her brother, right? Leaves that out of the whole divorce thing, she said married to another guy, Hersey, who she has a child with. Well, here's a fascinating photo of the guy she claims to not know and not be the brother anymore who left her. Remember, she married. There's no question she married this guy. The question is, when's the last time she's seen him? She says 2012, and I've never seen him again. And he's not my brother. So you get her take on this? Her take is he's not my brother. Ahmed Noor Syed. And I haven't seen him since 2012. Well, that's a power line blog. Here's a fascinating picture. This is all on the daily caller story today. You can check this out. Of the brother, Ahmed, Naomi, Ahmed Noor Syed, Elmi, right? Well, I'm going to leave this kind of family friendly. But for those watching on YouTube, you can see is a picture of the same guy she's saying is not her brother who she hasn't seen again in 2012 holding a baby. This is her or her former husband. And he says, quote, nieces, fresh out of the female anatomy. I'll leave it at that. That picture was taken a day after Ilhan Omar gave birth. Hmm. Okay. So Ilhan Omar gives birth to a child. The guy she's saying is not her brother, but was an ex-husband she's never seen before. She hasn't seen him after 2012. Then appears in a photo on Instagram in a 2012 photo saying that his niece was just bored after Ilhan Omar gave birth. This is the guy she's married to. The verdict is in, folks. Play off. Wait, here's the playoff court. Here it is. I forget who says it. Play off the gym or a playoff score. You can't see it, but it's a playoff. No play. No, right. No, it gets worse, Joe. So remember, she's saying, okay, this guy wasn't my brother and I haven't seen him since 2012. Well, here's another photo from the daily caller piece, which is there's multiple hat tips and also I think it's David Steinberg, his photo, but you can see them all. I don't want to make sure to get proper attribution. Here is a photo taken well after 2012 of Ilhan Omar and the brother, the exact same guy. Remember, she's telling the court after she divorced this guy, alleged to be the brother that she's never seen him again. But this is a picture well after 2012 of her with the brother saying fun night with the ATM crew hashtag London trip. Making matters even worse. Here is another photo of Ilhan Omar sisters marriage certificate. Now this is going to be tough to read, but I'll just wrap this story up with this one. Again, this is in the daily caller piece in the marriage certificate. Ilhan Omar's sister lists the father. The father is listed at this may be a David Steinberg photo too. So I had tip there. I want to make sure I give attribution. The sister list of father has no war. Say the same guy Ilhan Omar in her now deleted tweet is wishing happy father's day two in the beginning. Same guy who is the father to the brother who she allegedly married. Folks. Again, I know the media doesn't care about these stories. I know evidence doesn't matter anymore, but what's fascinating is you ran for two years on a hoax, a collusion hoax easily discredited by a first grader with with with with two or three functioning neurons. And you have overwhelming evidence of an enormous scandal amongst a member of the US Congress and a potential marriage fraud. And you ignore this story completely. This is a unbek the breaking news by the because I've discussed a lot of stuff in the past. The breaking news in the daily caller piece was that Omar's now deleted that tweet about the 2030. Why would you delete that? Why? What are you trying to hide? But of course, the mainstream media will cover for it because that's just what they do. It's really pathetic. All right, I've been teasing it all week. And I'm sorry, I didn't get the vaping story. But there was just a lot going on. The Kavanaugh stuff was was just all over the place. So I had to cover that. I owed it to you. But I for a few days now, I've been working on the way to best sum up what's going on with this vaping story. The story is this just to be clear. There is not a vaping ban. Okay, the president gave a press avail in the White House. In there, he mentioned that him and his FDA were looking into a new regulatory structure for flavored vaping products under the allegation that they target kids. I want to be clear on where I stand because I owe that to you. You spend time with me. I owe you my honest opinion. I and I support the president. You know that I do not on this. I think this is a bad move. I think it's a mistake. Having said that, I understand respect and read your emails. Many of you don't like that. That's okay. That's why my emails out there. Okay, some of you have emailed me. This is I have kids. They're targeting this to kids. I don't like it. The government needs to get involved. I get it. I'm not disrespecting your your that's the great part about the United States of America and my show. I listen to your emails. Most hosts dump a bright Joe, you were in radio. Most hosts don't even read them. I'm simply suggesting to you that my opinion, my opinion, you don't have to embrace it is I'm a parent and that's my job. The war on drugs was a failure. Prohibition was a failure. This stuff has all been an abysmal failure. It is a cultural problem. And I believe we as parents, that's our job. Now, some of you may say it is, but we need some help by the government. Fine. That's not my opinion. I don't think the government should be getting involved in the vaping industry outside of preventing a public threat. In other words, like let's say these vaping things were contaminated with cyanide. That's different. Right. But if people want to make bad decisions, then those people should be free to make really bad decisions. And those bad decisions, those people should suffer the consequences of those decisions. Big boy rules, I call it. Now vaping, though, does have a legitimate purpose. There are people who are addicted to traditional cigarettes and most of the studies have shown that vaping in contrast to traditional smoking is safer. I'm not suggesting to you as healthy. I'm just suggesting to you on a continuum of bad choices, smoking cigarettes is the worst when it comes to tobacco. One of the worst. Having said that, in order to give you a factual analysis of what's going on with the vaping industry, because a lot of us, this is new to a lot of us folks. I don't vape. I've never smoked. I know people who do. I wanted to find the best article that sums it up. And my friend Liz Sheldon, who's really wonderful, she has this piece up. What is it? American Spectator Paul, American Great American greatness. Forgive me. It's again in the show notes today, please. I can't say it enough. Please check them out. 11 things you need to know about vaping, Liz Sheldon, September 16, 2019, and American greatness worth your time. Now I'm not going to go through screenshots of each. I'm kind of running at a time, but I'm just going to address a couple of the things that I think people are generally unaware of about vaping. Number one, vaping is a process, not a product that she indicates. It is a pro, vaping is a product, a process. It is not, it doesn't refer to one specific product. It's like smoking, in contrast to cigarettes. Smoking is a process. You can smoke a lot of things. There's some people figured out. And not necessarily cigarettes are a different thing. Vaping is a process, not a price. It's important to point out second. It uses apparently what they're called carts or pods. These cartridges or pods can be flavored. Again, I don't vape. So I'm not pretending to be an expert shelled. Apparently knows more about it than I do, but I'm just bringing up the highlights of some of the parents out there unsure of what this is. Some of these cartridges can be flavored. They come in various degrees of potency, nicotine, some of the devices that use the pods can actually heat this stuff now. So that's just a kind of a primer on what we're talking about. We're talking about a process in vaping and the product are these different things are these devices and the carts or the pods they use in them. Now, one of the things that the problems with the vaping industry that Donald Trump pointed out, and I'm not suggesting, remember, we're talking about a process again, not a specific products problems. One of the problems we've had Joe is some people are mixing this stuff with THC, cannabinoids, and one of the active ingredients in marijuana, based products that haven't and making an oil out of it. Now, again, this is me from the piece, reading the piece, Liz goes into detail. What's the problem with that, folks? The problem is, some of that oil, if it coats some of the structures in your lungs, you can get kind of a pneumonia effect out of it. And some people have died. But ladies and gentlemen, a lot of the products used, matter of fact, Liz quotes a piece, the Journal of American, the Journal of American Medical Association. They did a study of 53 patients that were suffering from problems after vaping, and up to 80% of them Joe, those patients had mixed some kind of a THC product in there. In other words, they were not, they were abusing the process by abusing the product, which is not necessarily mean it's the vaping industry's fault. People can cut open cigarettes and slice the filters off too. I mean, that's not the right way the product was designed to work. And I think we need to keep that in mind. One last point on this, vaping has been around, ladies and gentlemen, which was this was new to me again, in Liz's piece. It's been around since 2003. These recent health scares are relatively new, which should say to us all, that something recently happened here. THC, the mix of it, counterfeit products. Again, I'm not suggesting this is a great decision to start to vape or any of that stuff. I'm simply suggesting to you that we live in a society where big boy rules should matter. Sometimes people want to do things that aren't really good for their health. May say, no, Dan, that's not true. Really is alcohol illegal? You're suggesting that's good for your health? Now, listen, in moderation, a glass of wine may be, but there are people who choose to drink a bottle every night. Not a good decision for your health, folks. I'm not your daddy. You make your own rules. I drink some patron on the weekends. With the date night, is it healthy? No, I enjoy it. One night a week, have a few drinks. Big boy rules. All right, let me just tease tomorrow because it's going to be an important show. I have to joke, keep this stuff for tomorrow to poll the two. Just grace them. I want to discuss the change in the dictionary. Basically, that sounds like a portion. No, no, no, no, no. It's not. If you want to get ahead of it, go to bongino.com. The dictionary now is full social justice and secondly, I want to get to tomorrow. Elizabeth Warren appeared on the Stephen Colbert show of all places and Colbert, who's a flaming liberal, one of those late night shows, just kind of nails into the wall on this Medicare thing. And Elizabeth Warren keeps touting these nonsense statistics. I'll debunk tomorrow in this Medicare for all things. It's important. Don't miss tomorrow. Showing that and a lot more.
