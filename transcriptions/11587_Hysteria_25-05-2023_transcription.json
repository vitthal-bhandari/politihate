    "text": " Hello and welcome to Hysteria. I'm Erin Ryan and I'm Alyssa Mastromonico. So Alyssa in every relationship there is one person who kills the bugs and one person who goes, ah, kill the bugs. Are you the bug killer in your relationship? I am the absolute bug killer. Yeah, same. Same. Although my husband, my husband will do it. He'll do it. He will, David will do it. He will do it. But a lot of times he does the whole like, we should let the bug live. And I was like, not in my house. Oh, she's not like that was spiders. We had like a really intense, ah, debate about whether to, to let a spider that was living on our porch live. And it was definitely not a nice spider. It was like one of those like brown widows, you know, like won't kill you if it bites you, but it'll definitely ruin your day. Can I tell you my worst spider story? Yeah, of course. When I was living in a very, ah, ah, basic apartment in Vermont, I woke up one morning and there was something on my pants and it was the very giant spider I had bowled on in my sleep. Was it alive? No, it was dead. It was stuck to my pants. Oh, yeah, it's grow like that. I don't like that at all. So I have to evacuate spiders from the house so that I don't wake up with them on my pajama pot of salt. Oh, God. This week we're joined by Pod Save the UK's Coco Con to take on the following questions. Which country is the bigger dumpster fire, the US or the UK or a little of both? Why is the cost of childcare so high? And what UK accent currently reigns supreme? All this and more right now. And welcome back to hysteria, the podcast equivalent of getting a text from one of your friends that says, Hey, can I be mean for a second? Are you talking about our texts? Yes. Yes, I am. But every time I get one of those from you, I'm like, have sublutally. Because you know, when I'm going to be mean, it's real. I'm going to stop my entire day. Someone is really upset me. I'm going to stop my entire day. You know, um, can I be mean for a second? Yeah. Yeah. The finale of succession is coming up this time on Sunday. Beside myself. I'm beside myself. It's a 90 minute finale, right? Yes. I want people in the Roy family to die. At this point, I want them to die. I do not. They've all done something irredeemable. And I really need, I really need a Shakespearean ending. I need. Do we count? Do we count Marsha though? Does Marsha have to die? Because I feel like she really, she listened to her Better Angels in this last episode. No, Marsha's not technically a Roy. I'm talking about like, just blood, just blood. I'm talking about a blood Roy or a Tom Roy. A Tom. Maybe we could, we could make a Tomlet and break a few. Tom, Tom Wamsgan's Roy. Oh man. Yeah. Okay. So can't wait to see what happens. I am going to have a panic attack. These last two episodes have rendered me, yeah. Anxious? Affected. Affected. I was affected. I was affected. I was affected. But I'm really excited to talk about different ways that that anxiety plays out for us and the reasons it plays out and whether or not or we're alone in that anxiety or if other people in other countries are feeling anxiety as well. Today, we are so excited to welcome a new member of the Crooked Media Fam, a journalist and host of the new podcast Pod Save the UK. It's Coco Kahn. In the spirit of transatlantic unity and a dash of corporate synergy, Coco will be joining us for the entire show. Coco, welcome to hysteria. How are you? Hello, mate. You're right. Yeah. Good. You. Oh, I was the podcast. Saucyness. Yeah, love it. Love it. I'm just going well with that. I'm joining you having just wrapped our episode for this week. It's been a bonanza week in Britain of very sort of minor ministerial, ministerial misconduct, which we take very, very seriously here. And by that, I mean, not at all. Also just the ongoing car crash that is our nation in the economy. Nice. It's been a good week. How about you? Same. Same. Well, listeners, if you couldn't tell by Coco's dreamy accent, she's a Brit. And according to her new podcast, Pod Save the UK, which she hosts with comedian Nish Kumar, the UK also needs saving and not only from having to remember that the words are God Save the King now. How do you sing it that way? I just... Oh, the same. Oh, babe. That's so sweet. You think I sing that song. I don't know. I mean, the sex pistols God Save the Queen is, you know, they're not going to change it to God Save the King. Okay. So here's what we're going to hash out today. Does America take after its mother country or are we innovators when it comes to having problems? Are we fuckery Nepo babies like Lily Rose Depp or are we born into fuckery privilege, but did we take what we had and make it into something even more spectacular like Julia Louis Dreyfus? To answer these pressing socio-political questions, we're going to do a US versus UK edition of Tour de fuckery and compare and contrast the dumpster fires of our respective current events. So who has it worse, the US or the UK? Who wins or rather who loses? Let's make our way across the US before we land in the UK. Alyssa, what do we have up first? Gang, E-Jean Carroll, she's coming for Trump again. And you know why? Because he cannot fucking control himself. So E-Jean is seeking additional damages from Trump. Recall in the past few weeks, she received a judgment for a settlement of five people and five million dollars because Trump was found liable for defaming her. So when you are found liable for defamation, what do you do? You take to a CNN town hall and you do it worse again and for everyone to hear and see. So what did Trump do in the appalling CNN town hall? Let's see. He did things like say she was lying mentally unstable that he never met her and one of my absolute favorites, which CNN really didn't do anything to stop. He said, well, Trump insisted he rarely visited Bergdorf Goodman and tried to raise questions about Carroll's account that he followed her into an unlocked dressing room. Quote, what kind of woman meets somebody and brings him up and within minutes you're playing hanky-panky in a dressing room? Hanky-panky, sexual assault. Hanky-panky. Trump said, as in this Trump said, as some in the audience laughed, I don't know if she was married then or not. Well, he can't stop himself and so she's also not going to stop and as long as he keeps making these absurd statements that he's already been found guilty of, he's just going to keep going and so we'll see what's next in Eijin's latest battle. So what do we think of Eijin seeking new damages? I think it's- As she should. I think it's pretty cool. As she should. Fuck that guy. Literally. Literally found guilty and within 24 hours on television, the man lives in a world of no consequence so I hope she keeps heaping them on top of him. Indeed. Coco, what do you make of this story? Well, I found interesting about it as someone who has just seen a kind of potted version of it here in the UK was the support that Trump has and how people sort of have these rallying cries when he says these horrible things about her appearance or about what I just think is very gross and lowering the tone of our kind of public debate and I don't know how you put that genie back in the bottle. But the other thing I wondered as well because in the UK we have very strong privacy laws around anything related to sexual violence and so I was- Actually, I wanted to ask you, did Eijin Carol have to reveal her identity? Was that a choice or was she forced? So what happened was Eijin wrote about the assault. She talked about it publicly and Donald Trump retaliated by calling her a liar and defaming her and as a result Eijin lost her job. She was an advice columnist at a publication in New York City. So she lost her job. She experienced professional repercussions and she is suing him because what he said directly led to what happened to her professionally. And so it's not like a- it's not the same sort of levers of justice that you're talking about. She wasn't trying to seek criminal relief. She just wanted some- Could she have though? No. The statute of limitations in New York had expired but there was a new law in the state of New York that- I mean this is getting in the weeds. There's a new law in the state of New York that basically allowed people who had been victimized by sexual misconduct to file for civil damages many years after the criminal statute of limitations had expired. And so Eijin worked under that law. So it was- it's one of those things where Trump is just always going to be a sexist prick. It's- if you remember those like reading about those experiments where like they gave rats cocaine and they just like there's one button that like you hit the button and it's like more cocaine and the other button is like food. I think Donald Trump is like the rat with the cocaine button when it comes to attention. He cannot help himself. He simply cannot help even though it's like this is really going to damage you buddy. Like you can't just keep hitting the cocaine button. Yeah. This is going to cost you tons and tons of money. I was you know we're talking about like taking the- letting the genie out of the bottle, can't put it back in. I wonder Coco if in the UK prominent UK political candidates get away with that sort of misogynist rhetoric. Are there- is there anybody who's kind of like frustratingly a dick about women? Look you know in this competition of our who has the worst nation and I'd just point out that actually my nation had an empire so whatever. Take that as you will. That's true. In this like terrible competition that nobody wins we all lose. You know Trump is unprecedented. You know certainly in the UK obviously our kind of closest comparison was the former prime minister Boris Johnson. He was similar in the sense that he seemed to be utterly shameless. He would say anything. He was a womanizer. He was a philander. Although he did it within the kind of context of marriage. He wasn't known to be having numbers of a kind of the way that Trump did of having however many models on his phones or appearing at parties and being hand-zied that didn't quite happen. We have had MPs and serving politicians who have been involved in sexual assault allegations and I'm happy to say that most of them have been dealt with very very swiftly. But our two relations are very very close and so even though you're seeing maybe Trump is exceptional in the sense of how he talks about women and releasing that junior from the bottle but obviously we're in an internet connected age and I have definitely seen that language. Maybe not play out in the political theatre but play out walking around. You know our one great US-UK collaboration which isn't succession or the office is Andrew Tate. You know he's rich American right? So he's a really good example like okay maybe we haven't seen it play out in Westminster but we are seeing that play out very much that the tone of conversation has become very misogynistic and we are all losing for it. Yeah that's a super interesting point to bring up because you know Andrew Tate's audience and the people who are super charged to watch Donald Trump in a town hall there's probably not a ton of overlap and it's almost like there's this pipeline of misogyny that has kind of secretly and quietly behind the scenes gone from like the older generation that we were like whoo they're getting old few years we're going to be rid of them but there's kind of a renewal of it among younger now with Andrew Tate etc. It's pretty disturbing to witness. Can I ask you a question about EJN Carroll? Yeah go ahead. So this is maybe tangential but a little while ago I was reading an article about whether women in high powered positions are actually working because quite often you have a situation where you have a generation or say in politics or even sports where women rise to the top and then after that you actually see the numbers shrink and this article was just like a piece of offering some opinion on it said that they thought it was because when those women rose to those positions they were treated so badly that it was a deterrent for any other woman to kind of do that and I was wondering how you felt about the legacy of EJN Carroll do you think that how she is treated is going to inspire another generation of women to be like no he did do that and I am taking him to court that is my right that's the only way to punish him or will it actually make a lot of women go do you know what I can't deal with this this is horrible. Elissa what do you think? I think it would I think that if she came forward 10 years ago it would be different than her coming forward now. I think that because women specifically have been so overwhelmingly supportive and people have been rooting for her and people have largely denounced everything that he has said about her in public. I think that it still goes to the point that no woman would make up being sexually assaulted because what is the fucking upside but I do think that her experience would prompt more women to come forward or maybe not maybe not prompt more but at least not deter people as much to come forward just based on public sentiment not necessarily on how horrific he's been. I think there are really prominent examples of women being treated so poorly that it makes other women not want to run for things in the US and I'd like specifically I think when it comes to elected office. I think that there are some women who have been just treated so importantly I mean Nancy Pelosi does not care like she just does not give a fuck. Well look at Anita Hill. Yeah if you look at somebody like Anita Hill there's there's a specific type of woman who weathers the storm and we see the storm and we see that she weathers it but a lot of people see that and they think like I can't do that. I don't want to put my family through that is something that I hear a lot from women and it's really I mean even like Sarah Palin as awful as she was and as a national nightmare as she was the way that her children were discussed publicly the way that her family was talked about publicly I think was really probably upsetting to people at all points on the political spectrum but I think E.G. and Carol is an example of it going well. Oh brilliant. And what does that say? Yeah I know what does that say about us but like she just you know didn't care that you look at the coverage of her here in the US and you see that it's largely positive and the only people that are really critiquing her or being shitty about it are like hyper partisans who no matter what she did and no matter what she said would say the same things. So I think it's probably it's it's like a best case scenario with her. Okay story number two culture wars being fought in the sports arena less than a week after removing the sisters of perpetual indulgence from their pride lineup the Dodgers the Los Angeles Dodgers my team on Monday re invited the organization to pride night amid backlash from LGBTQ plus and civil rights groups as well as local politicians and even Dodgers employees Dodgers staffers across all sexual orientations were vocal in their dismay on the other side of the debate are people like Marco Rubio who is from Florida who is from why Marco you care about the Dodgers so much dude name a guy on the roster right right to the Marlins name a fucking guy anyway and conservative think tanks I don't think any of these people were really upset about an LGBTQ group based in Los Angeles being featured at a Dodgers game I don't think they even care about the Dodgers but whatever this is this is but a huge story in the US weirdly and even people who don't pay attention to baseball are sticking their noses in it the Los Angeles sisters have said they accepted an apology from the Dodgers leadership over the decision Wednesday to dump them from pride night and they said they will indeed be honored with a community hero award they were originally to receive so you know here's my question for you Coco why do you think sports I know in the UK sports are also a hot zone for culture wars is there is life as you know you're Ted Lassar right I hate that show I truly I feel like the people who wrote it don't know anything about soccer show is not they're like well we just had the match cool what happened what happened during the match but yeah but Coco like in in what ways are you seeing culture war issues play out on you know the sports pitch the sports arena in the UK I mean we are saying it play out a lot I'm sure you've been following the news with Riam Madrid and Vinicius Jr he's had to speak out against genuinely some horrific chance and racism from the fans it's a sad fact of contemporary football that if you're a black player you do get in ordinary amounts of abuse but I mean with Vinicius Jr they were hanging effigies of him like it's horrible I mean you imagine how loud you have to be chanting for it to be picked up by the cameras the cameras aren't even looking at the crowd you know what I mean like it was very bad and so he's had to speak out he's the latest in the long line of players have had to speak out Marcus Rashford is a player that we have over here in the UK he's spoken out against racism but he also spoke out about poverty and funnily enough people really went for him on that as well which you would think that okay how is that a culture war issue hungry children we nobody likes a hungry child I thought we got over that after Oliver Twist what is this? It's not an 18-19 thought we should be able to take them down a few nighters let's take those more girls children down a few nighters yeah yeah I don't like them I like them the chimneys like let's let it go it's 2023 and I think there is there is this sense that if you were being generous to the people who are you know against sports people speaking out they might say you're not an elected politician it's not your place to influence society okay but fine but you are a sports person it is your place to influence the pitch there is no real reason why they shouldn't be able to anyway to return to your actual question how are we seeing these things play out yes we are we're seeing them almost a bit like contractions when you're giving birth getting closer together like the little incidents so I don't know what baby is going to come out but I definitely feel that like football over here soccer as you call it is is increasingly becoming more of a progressive space there's was a campaign that we talked about in Pods sports being this one place where actually people from all walks of life are united in you know we live in segregated times don't we you know economic segregation racial segregation is there's something about sports it's really sort of brings people together so I'm it is a it is a battleground and I'm glad it is because increasingly where else are we all going to have a chat about it mm-hmm and just just to bring up the the labor analogy you know you're you're moving there's progress right labor labor means that you're progressing it becomes more horrible but you're progressing do you see that progress is do you really think that you're seeing progress or you know is it sort of on a knife search could things go either way right now or is progress inevitable I mean I'm a relentless optimist and perhaps that makes me deluded and stupid I don't know you have to keep going somehow don't you I think the foundation of both of our politics whether we iterate them here in the UK context when American context is based on hope right things can get better we are optimists we must keep going and so I do think that yes things are getting a little bit better in terms of if you even if you just look at the polling people are much less resistant to outsiders people are more pro-gay marriage they are angry about gender pay gaps they are you know there's all the polling tells you that the average british person is on the right direction I think the problem is that the people who are the outliers are being empowered to dominate way too much of the airtime way too much of the headspace way too they're just given far too much influence so yeah I think that there is a a baby is coming a lovely baby a baby of progress but will that baby be listened to or kept on the bench that's the thing I don't know yeah or maybe the baby will be born and everyone will be like well this is a pretty ugly baby but we're not going to say anything because it just marries baby or you know there's quite a lot of infants are born and you're like that's a funny looking baby but I'm gonna tell the parents it's cute okay story number three we've got two new republican presidential candidates dropping first Florida governor Ron DeSantis or in my head I use the way that like Donald Trump pronounces it which is ronda santis like the name ronda yeah totally ronda santis we'll announce he's running for president during a discussion with twitter CEO Elon Musk this Wednesday can you think of two more go on charismatic men oh connect that's why it's audio only salt of the earth red state voters I cannot think of it an Iowa caucus voter who thinks more that they want to hear they're like you know what I love Elon Musk love you on musk relatable farms in the corn the field the corn fields whisper musk elon soy subsidies absolutely it's just the stoop Ron you are too online you are too online if you think that this is a way for you to connect with voters but whatever like Kendall to his ex wife you've lost the thread you're too online you're too online musk and will host an event on twitter spaces which is a platform for audio chats made up fake fake news would be moderated by david sachs god it just keeps getting better gets better and better tech where's Rudy yeah we where's Rudy where's four seasons total landscaping who is a must confidant and just santa supporter second on monday south carolina senator tim scott who's the only black republican in the senate yeah the only one uh announced his run for the republican presidential nomination the senator who has represented south carolina in the senate since 2013 portrays himself as a true conservative with a positive story to tell he does i did find his speech compelling uh you know but you can't run a country on stories you know well you forget i work for barack obama we had some stories in the beginning you know what i'm saying yeah you got you have to have some policies you you use your story you use stories to bring people in and then you got to have ideas to make shit run you do otherwise what the fuck are you doing i'm not saying that tim scott had big ideas i'm just saying that structurally and uh you know style stylistically his speech was uh listenable and not the dumpster fire that things like trump's inaugural speech work i mean and ron de santis does sound exactly like frog from the new apple tv plus series frog and toad um he is really uncharismatic uh but okay so here's the thing about the presidency i hate how much it's turned into and and political campaigns in the u.s and koko i don't know if it's like this in the u.k i feel like they've turned into speaking contests like media appearance contests yeah yeah and i understand that it's ironic for me to say for you to complain about this as a barack obama supporter um because that's kind of how he got everybody's attention by being great at giving a speech but he won people's votes by being great at connecting with what people wanted um koko do you feel like in the u.k it's sort of a kind it's like a it's kind of an empty superficial charisma contest for people who are seeking high office so can i ask you a question first of course and my question would be before ron de santis was kind of held up as being a potential presidential candidate had you heard of him no just that he was like a loser in the house of representatives who had no friends yeah that's a great review really really really really it was like mike was he like mike pence where everyone had made fun of his back no worse worse they were just like like there is a member of congress who was in a committee with him and never heard him speak huh he was a fucking dud he is a dud i mean trump's not wrong about that but no he just said some like race baiting shit and got famous with crazy people right okay okay because i think the one of the differences between our system in yours is that generally speaking the politicians that end up becoming leaders are ones that are already working in some ways and we have quite a lot of kind of political media so we have like prime minister's questions time we you know have the other question time that's on the bbc with the general public just shout at politicians basically so i mean we have a 24 hour political cycle in a way right which means around election no you don't really get as much of the mania well that's my assessment anyway i'm sure there'll be other listeners asking how i could possibly say that but you know i i think that the kind of concentration is maybe a higher there yeah here's a question for you koko is so for us here we are 19 months out or helps 18 months out however long we are out from the actual presidential election and our cycle is so long isn't yours much more condensed is that oh my god yeah yeah we're 12 months away yeah we're 12 months away from a election and nobody's really talking about it and yeah erin that's a dream come true dream come true it's like a really bad um sneaker drop though when it does finally come around because it's like you know that there isn't really okay maybe the shorter build up is better i accept that you know i'll i'll i'll pass it on to britain um but when it actually happens i have often felt that there isn't enough time to kind of interrogate stuff and it does go a mile a minute and then there is the moment where it's like election night and that seems to be 20 hours long with people being like and in scarborough nothing's happened and and that goes on over and over and over again and it is you have all the hype and then in the end you just get like the worst pair of shoes you want it anyway i mean that's my opinion because i am 35 years old and every single election i've been old enough to vote for my guy hasn't won so i mean obviously for me it's rubbish oh you guys have had you've been able to vote for someone who won that must be nice how did that feel oh it's cool yeah i guess like my the first presidential election that i was able to vote in in the us was uh george w bush's second uh his reelection and i was at a conservative a university with an overwhelmingly conservative student body among them among the men the women were a little bit more even split but um it was a catholic university and so everyone was like yay jingoism iraq war like everyone was so like into what he was doing the worst college ever oh my god college was meant to be a time of great kind of you know finding yourself and pushing out into you know questioning the the notions of nationality of mass manticl at university of roman my era of discovery and socialism began in thank you for a cut to erin ryan at the university of Notre Dame uh being like where the fuck am i this is crazy um i mean on a on a serious note like i think that's actually hearing you tell those two stories i think is really important because i think sometimes there's a fallacy that like young equals whatever and that's not true as your university experience told you you know young conservatives exist young conservatives exist amy kony bared the supreme court justice that donald trump appointed in the waning days of his presidency um the one the woman who helped overturn rovey wade was a professor at the university of Notre Dame law school which is my college uh so that sucked that sucks a lot but i i will say that that young people even young people who identify as catholics and who are religious are more left leaning than their older counterparts so you know you braco bama won that camp i mean braco bama won that campus in 2008 and 2012 so like there's just but it does you know it does feel nice to win i got to say election night in the u.s i hate it i hate it so much and i think people yeah and i think that there are certain people a crooked certain very certain prominent people that crooked seem to like it and i'm like this is not fun this is not fun for me um they want they liked it back in 2008 too and i did not like it i was like god just get me through this i mean it was uh it was look they they like living on a knife set you know john john tommy and dan great guys i do not understand anybody who says they like politics no i don't think fyfer does he was always kind of with with me and very uh lots of tums and and this is the most inside crooked galsy i've had yeah i'm working on this anytime join our group chat i will send you a can i be mean for a second yeah just us just that's yeah nobody else i mean okay no we'll talk more offline um but i just i don't understand there is a specific type of person that can enjoy the run up to the election and the rhetoric and the and the drama and right now i think it's people who really look at it is theater right who can detach a little bit from the consequences well we've talked about this before that i know that the closer you are to the consequences of the policy the less fun it is for you you're gonna pressly right she said that on our show yeah the people that are closest to the pain should be the one that are closest to the policy is what you said yes do you ever watch other people because i watched the american elections but i'm in britain and i'll have a different response obviously do you ever watch ass did you watch britain yes i was britain i love france frances are a hot mess i enjoy watching that from afar until we got our own marilla pen um yeah i was i was like paying attention to what was going on in israel um i i'm not i don't have any particular personal ties to israel apart from its like role in geopolitics but i was uh kind of with like fear and horror um yeah because it seems like things are not going well over there uh but i think when i when i watch you know when i when i i listen to the listen i both listen to the bbc like new zauer every single lovey so we like are more plugged in i think than the the average american would be which doesn't really say much but i do pay attention in that i am like man it seems like things are kind of going downhill seems like they had kind of a little dodgy yeah does it does it does it feel does it feel good or bad because i must confess i have a touch of when i see another country doing badly i'm like yes not alone there was like a i only five percent five percent i felt like i almost felt like guilty i was like oh my god we created trump and now trump spreading across the globe and so i i felt a little i felt a little guilty genuinely i don't enjoy seeing you don't worry boris was he was he's been a charlatan for a very long time yeah yeah i feel like that perspective has enabled me to be comforted by the fact that trump didn't invent this he just sort of jumped on a good point like he's not an evil genius he's an evil noticer of things that he can like tag team onto like you know whatever was behind brexit nijl ferrage yes and all of those people like they're all kind of on the same dark wavelength and i don't think any of them can take credit for coming up with that and that in a way kind of is like okay well whatever we're dealing with is like bigger than donald trump and bigger than our country and bigger than the uk um but that means that we all kind of have a common enemy uh once we can identify what that is we have something in common that we we can all fight against it doesn't really matter where we're from because there's a there's a thread that we all kind of need to figure out how to snip if that makes any sense um okay let's say it does let's take a quick break when we come back we're going to talk a little bit about the cost of child care and welcome back you're listening to hysteria the podcast that answers the question what's all this then sorry in honor of our uk cast all right very nice seamless yes thank you thank you so i'm not even going to try to do an accent because i know that like when britts here americans try to do a british accent of any kind they're like this is terrible like i think britts have better american accents than the river uh do you mean like the time i was loaded on cold medicine and pretended to be call and birth in love actually to call and birth himself oh wow i don't know this big british accent it was that sorry which which bit in love actually we hate uncle jamey we love uncle jamey that part she's doing it i did it because i can't do the bit i can't do the bit without the terrible accent but just no i did it just like that to call and birth rule sculpt away i loved it i thought it was great i thought it was very nice i thought you know the show love actually in this country nearly every single christmas should i just what's about you if we watch it shouldn't you watch it i just find it interesting that we watch collectively as a shared experience we all watch that film because cocoa love actually is all around yeah i feel like the american equivalent of love actually is that really bad 2006 movie crash which could have been called racism actually um it's such a bad movie should have been such a bad movie have you guys seen nothing hill have you seen nothing hill obviously um right not for quite sometime when when i was in college it was one of our like comfort movies that we had on dvd and i remember waking up many times like at three in the morning after a night out like i would come home be like i'll watch it on a girl put it on the dvd player come home wake up to the menu playing over and over again i feel like i'm dating myself i feel like i'm dating myself here um but yeah that was uh anyway yes anyway okay cocoa you've got something yes tell us yes so you know we have this competition about who's got it worth and i have found an area in which we win hands down and that is the cost of child care so in the uk putting a child into daycare nursery whatever it might be is the third most expensive system in the world we're just behind switzerland who famously have a lot of money and new zealand maybe a bit closer but anyway whatever that's i digress the point is that the price of having a child in the uk is going up and up and up it's having a whole host of terrible consequences in terms of many women dropping out of the workforce we're seeing more women leave the workforce entirely because it simply does not make sense for them to pay for child care if they're not earning enough really you know there was a number of articles that were coming out that say that effectively for a for a certain salary and that salary by the way was above the average uh which is i think memory serves 30 000 pounds but do fact trick me on that one but above that average there were many women who were essentially paying their employer to work when you sort of divvy it all up oh my god some of the prices yeah so some of the prices are roughly somewhere between sort of 15 percent and 30 percent it's much more concentrated in kind of major cities where women are in the kind of more professional spaces with lower income women tend to use informal care you know they might use like friends family that sort of thing but it is having genuine um i mean i think we can all agree that in the world that we live in a woman must earn her own money to assure that she is not held to ransom in her own home right that's like the sort of foundation of what you need for a kind of independent woman um so to see in a modern society in one of the wealthiest countries in the world women having to leave the workforce i think is very very sad um i can give you some numbers but i'm reliably told that a coffee in la is eight dollars so i don't know if any of these numbers will mean anything to you yeah a coffee in LA is well it depends on what kind of coffee but yes eight dollars is not not out of the question for sure i think all these numbers will be meaningless so but just over the last 10 years the price of child care has gone up 44 percent it costs the average household income somewhere between sort of 10 15 percent and 30 percent if you're one of those couples who lives in a major city where there's high rents and the ramifications of that sadly are women leaving the workforce slowing down their career progression um again more duties onto grandparents can't grandparents just retire why have they got to do these things over and over again um and sadly not enough is being done about it there were some reforms recently the conservatives announced some it's a classic conservative reform in which actually when you dig into the numbers it's not really going to move the dial very much but it makes them sound good um so yeah anyway i i hope that uh you never want to have children in britain well i have one here in the US and uh in a in a high cost of living city and the percentages that you're talking about are pretty eye-popping um can you talk a little bit about what child care workers make in the UK like are they underpaid is there a shortage what's going on over there with that yeah so i mean generally speaking child care providers are not paid enough certainly in my opinion there is a shortage of child care workers that is only getting bigger so one of the problems with the new uh i mean do you want do you want the actual details of it do you want to know about how i'm super curious i've i've got an 18-month-old kid that that like i've somebody's got i mean i don't know where she is right now but no she's somebody's got to look after her right and like there's no way to i think there's this kind of common misconception among people who don't actively care for a child that you can like have them running around the house while you're doing work which is just like not the case because kids are innovators in figuring out ways to hurt themselves and you really need to just like keep an eye on them for the first like five years of their lives you need to be that pretty much paying attention to them so child care is like not a it's not something that you can be like there i'll work from home and do child i mean it's not really negotiable really i mean exactly expect women to be in the workforce you have to supply some of this and i think one of the things that i've found very frustrating is when i looked into it here in the UK i spoke to an economist and and just simply asked why can't we just spend more money on child care like why can't we and the economist said that it's a political lightning rod that it would be perceived is expanding the welfare state i mean i i personally think a welfare state nation is a good thing look at arms are awesome country sir great yeah sounds great but even if you are someone who finds the word welfare very toxic how on earth is helping a mother go to work and contribute in the economy welfare i mean it's it's it's it smells like misogyny doesn't it yeah do you think is there like racism and xenophobia knitted into like an aversion or resistance to expanding child care in the uk i don't know if it's knitted into i mean there's always going to be an element of racism and xenophobia because of the pay disparity so child care workers are not paid enough so i would not be surprised if there's quite a lot of foreign born child care workers although you know i don't know off the top of my head what those numbers are and there will again be that thing where if you are a person of color or a a migrant to the uk um you may also not be accessing better paid jobs so your ability to access child care is less and that gives you less options and it will probably latterly give your child less options as they grow they don't get the enrichment that perhaps a nursery would provide so it does certainly entrenches racial injustices it certainly is not helping them though i couldn't say for sure that this was like i waited how much it would be weighted more against a sort of person of color or a new migrant to the uk i feel as though here in the u.s that there is a kind of baked in racism to resistance to increasing access to child care um like there's the perception that people who are low income have more children and thus would benefit more from the system um and you know there's the perception that people who came to America from elsewhere specifically Latin America there's a perception that people from Latin America have more children um which actually doesn't really it the statistics don't bear it out as much as the fearmongers think that it so are you guys having a um because i'm hanging on about it here are you guys having a baby shortage oh yeah oh yeah baby shortage everywhere yeah you know what they're doing i contribute to the baby shortage well you know what they're doing in the middle of the country in the midwest they're trying to get rid of child labor laws because the baby shortage started like 20 years ago and there aren't enough like 20 year olds now like there's they're trying to make it in the state of Wisconsin which is where i was born and raised trying to make it so that kids as young as 14 can be bartenders because there are I know too yeah yeah there aren't enough people right they were trying to get kids in Iowa to be able to work in like chicken factories like yeah yep fucking gross yeah yeah what are they saying about the baby shortage there are they're like i guess we should just for all the people that want to know what it's interesting isn't it because it's one of those things again it's like okay you know certain stereotypes of low-income people or minorities or that they have too many children but then on the other hand they're all complaining all the time being like we need babies we need babies we can't pay the pension uh you know our pension commitments in 30 years down the road like which is it what one is it that you want you know you can't please any of them and you know what the answer is oh you mean you want white babies just say it then they're just be easier like let me know what we're dealing with but yeah they've tried to release uh uh in terms of like policies that you know our European neighbors have had a range of them uh you know even giving like vouchers and money to families who do it i'm not convinced any of that that has had a benefit we haven't done that here in the UK the conservatives uh reforms to child care was their kind of big play but just to give you a summary of how that works the provision of child care in the UK is divvied out over 39 weeks so that's that's basically school term time but obviously parents work 52 weeks a year so even if they do provide 39 weeks of paid for child care which again some parents have to top it up depending on where they are anyway actually when you divide that across 52 weeks parents still need to pay for uh for the rest of the time they have to make up the difference so what because the government provision was only applying to kind of three-year-olds and some two-year-olds what it meant was that nursery care providers had this shortfall of money and so what they did is jack up the prices on the one-year-old so the one-year-old was subsidizing the three-in-j week so it's it's it's a classic alternative tactic we're on the headlines it's like we've done more for child care than labor have well i mean they've not been in power for 13 years but that aside um you know but when you dig into the numbers actually the unintended consequences to certain women of certain backgrounds is is there the new reforms apply that same broken policy but they're like oh we'll include two-year-olds in it now and some one-year-olds it hasn't even started yet i mean i'm sure it is a benefit i don't want to be glib about the fact that even 39 weeks spent than nothing but a comprehensive system that works for women is is way away and meanwhile they're talking about like women please have more babies i know you don't like any of the men they're very mean but um but it's fine it's not it's not it's not it's not joining up yeah you know i've got a solution um why don't women just give birth to children that are already two you know wait until they're already two years old to give birth to them be pregnant you know as long as an elephant we all love being pregnant it's super fun uh no it's that that seems nonsensical in like a stopgap measure here in the u.s i actually oh go ahead i think i do have a solution though like genuinely yeah what is i think i have a solution which is i think they should make it easier for women to be single parents yes because i have i mean i'm 35 i've got loads of friends who haven't met the right person but they're in a good part of life but because the costs are so high they have to be with a partner they have to be partnered yeah actually what if you could do it so that women could have kids without that partner especially when the partners are fuckboys and they're really mean on this maybe that would be maybe that's the solution uh well i met i met my husband when i was 35 like a couple weeks after my 35th birthday uh and i had a baby at 38 so you know whatever like it's i'm i wouldn't have it any other way i he was too tired to be mean by the time i met him um but uh you know i think i think that's that's a really smart take i know several women um out here in los angeles who have done it themselves but usually by the time they're in a financial position to do that they're like just at the very end of possibly being able to do it themselves they're like i know a few women who turned 40 and they were like all right doing it doing it this year yeah um and uh you know those are just a very privileged few who have had long successful careers um and and had been able to save the amount of money that it takes the massive amount of money it takes um well i think we solved this problem in both countries let's take let's take a quick break so we can get to sanny petty before we let you go today so stick around and welcome back you're listening to hysteria the podcast that was living plus before succession was living plus we've almost reached the end of the show but not quite we are going to talk about what is keeping us sane or making us feel petty coca why don't you start us off yeah so it was funny you were talking about accents earlier erin because the thing that is keeping me saying this week anyway was an article that i read in the guardian that talked about American young people doing british accents apparently it's a thing which i did not know about apparently it's big on tiktok and it's also a phenomena that people just burst into british i found that hilarious and it has been keeping me sane all week and i just want to read the quotes in this piece by the way are incredible and i just want to read you one case study so they speak to a person called brenton parker who's a 30 year old who lives in the bay area working in tech marketing now brenton needs to speak to her employer about overwork and overload i could imagine having that conversation would be quite difficult and you'd probably be quite stressed and you'd worry if they think less about you but nonetheless she has the conversation and when she talks to the manager about having burnout it just comes out and she says it's affecting me mental health for me is what she says to the manager this is in the article i'm not making this up this is in the in the story it you know she goes on to explain like my manager was like what what are you doing and and she says that she thinks it adds levity to a vulnerable situation the quote there i love it is the tougher the conversation the more cockney i become so that's what she said i'm a cockney i'm from east london and i've been thinking about that all week i have been walking around being like brenton parker in the bay area has told me that the tougher the conversation the more cockney you get and i love it i also think just on a i mean do you guys you guys do accents sometimes right like when you're out at home i mean bed british ones sometimes a little bivarian american regional accents i love to like go in and out of like my minnesota or my other accent or whatever yeah i talked to my aunt like she's from southy oh yeah you're gonna do go on those snowmobiles boys okay anyway well yeah we've american regional accents are a horrible sounding compared to british accents i find them yeah they're they're egregious my husband is from pittsburgh oh yeah some of the world's worst accents people from pennsylvania are on my husband's from philadelphia what are they oh please do it because i don't know what they i don't know the difference please humor me oh my god you know there's a i want to drink a water water uh there's also like uh go dantan go dantan oh yeah it's oh it's terrible it's terrible it's stillers it's terrible yin's yin's gonna go downtown wash is stillers oh oh it's good eric oh i don't understand any of this but i'm loving yeah yin's is like hittsburgh for you guys or y'all yin's oh right i see it's a weird place well i mean in the piece and you know i we won't talk about this too long but you know in the piece they try to analyze why people are doing it and i think there is something about when you don't have the language to express something because you're feeling insecure you kind of reach for things i'm sure any of our your listeners or our listeners on like poth day the uk who have got a parent who speak a second language or for in who for whom english is not their native tongue they will know that you know when they're angry they go to a thing or when they swear they go to a thing and so i was like delighted that crockney has now become a range of people's second language so um i i'm i'm very touched by this it's making me very happy i walk down the street all the time being like yes bruv we've done it you know he's oh wonderful i love that i love that so much um i'll go second because i don't want to go end my own show um i am feeling petty i've been feeling petty about this for a long time and i'm not sure if i've brought it up before on this show because we've done 251 episodes and i've lost track of how many things that piss me off um but i am feeling petty about tiktok ruining food tiktok is growing and it is food it is uh tiktok videos that showcase specific dishes at restaurants tend to go viral when those dishes are especially saucy cheesy melty gooey and so a lot of restaurants in the interest of having their food their menus become a viral tiktok fad are adding more sauce more cheese more goo right more stickiness and that is not that food doesn't taste good that way unless it's supposed to be made that way like i don't want to eat like a pasta that is essentially a bowl of melted cheese unless i'm very depressed but like that shouldn't be my every day that's not like how it's not everyday kachioi pepe shouldn't have like a cheese stretch you know what i mean like we shouldn't have like sauce dripping off things no i love i you know i'm not one of those people who's like don't season my food i love spicy i love different flavors i love different different cuisines i don't love drowning everything in unnecessary amounts of sauces and it's tiktok's fault i don't think we should ban it but i think we should ban videos of people putting too much cheese and things i just that's my that's my take on one of the video this week couldn't i know alissa you you like have you do you see the video where it was like the um block of feta in the middle of a casserole dish with noodles i have watched my favorite is my favorite there's one woman who comments on all of these tiktok videos about food and i will not do her accent because she has a specific voice but she's like isn't this hilarious and she's like everybody's so creative everybody's so creative creative yeah and but in every way whether it is from tiktok influencers trying to get like free meals and be gross about their food to these like disgusting recipes that people make on their countertops with no seasoning it is disgusting and i've had to stop it is it is it is more restrictive to my appetite than weight watchers don't go to tiktok for recipe recommendations go to the epicurious app or perhaps the new york times app if pressed all right alissa bring us home what are you feeling petty about or what's bringing you sanity this week guys i'm actually i'm calling a bit of an audible i had one but then i remembered there was something else that made me feel sandy and petty okay okay so the can film festival is happening right now and it is uh it was like i kind of knew this a little bit in the back of my head but i really started reading about it how several years ago a few women showed up at the film festival not wearing heels and they were not allowed uh in the film festival yes and so now women like jennifer lorence and christen stewart when they show up they take their shoes off as a bit of a fuck you but that is not even it just when you think the world is changing and you're like you know what maybe can's like picking up what everybody's putting down and maybe they're gonna like address the the like a tire guidance that people are supposed to follow no guys now they're cracking down on the men someone showed up in like a rose gold blazer and uh and and the official from can came out and said uh it is not appropriate it must be new art both jacket and shoes so i guess they're regulating everybody now i don't know but as someone who only wears burkin stocks i clearly thank god i haven't had a reason to go to can because i would not be welcome as i teetered like miss piggy on shoes trying to make myself uh acceptable to their rules and guidelines uh like a baby deer on ice skates um exactly what's here's here's my conspiracy theory about that um i think that this is a plot by the editors of wiki feet trying to get more people to take the shoes off and show toes on man in can i mean who's gonna have better feet i don't i'm not a foot person i'll tell you not for me not no but jennifer lorance had met they're all nicely pedicured when they go barefoot on the red carpet here so i think your theory is correct it is correct it's a wiki feet conspiracy also if you don't think you're on wiki feet if you're in any way a public-facing person you're probably on wiki feet if there's ever been a oh i'm on wiki feet i didn't know that i was on wiki feet i didn't know i was on wiki feet i was on wiki feet not a chance my barni rubble feeder on wiki feet oh i well i the thing is like somebody had taken screenshots of instagram stories that i had posted years ago that had just like i'm standing on a beach no man no man no man oh that's disgusting the foot people are aggressive that feels maybe a touch like a violation no yeah i mean taking your photos but that seems some sort of misdemeanor at least they did rate my feet highly so i um well it can't really come it was fine yeah it's fine it's my pictures it's take the good you take the bad you take the good in the bad i don't post foot picks anymore not not on main uh that's that's gonna be my only fans if i ever do that um okay that's all the time we have for this week's episode of hysteria coco con thank you so much for stopping by this was a lot of fun um you need to come back again because we need to yes definitely we haven't solved whether or not the uk or the us as a bigger
