    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. We appreciate all of you hanging out with us. Fantastic Wednesday across the country. I encourage you to download the podcast. Make sure you don't miss a single moment. As we are speaking to you right now, Buck, I was just pulled up watching during a commercial break. There is a Netflix employee protest. The tons of employees have walked out of Netflix to protest the fact the audacity that they would have a comedian and Dave Chappelle making jokes that might be offensive to the transgender community. And I was watching some of the protest speakers and leave me to say this. We have got to have some of that audio for tomorrow's show because it is goldenly insane. But we are joined now by Elbridge Colby. He's the co-founder and principal of the marathon initiative and a formerly he was a U.S. deputy assistant secretary of defense for strategy and force deployment. He's the author of the strategy of denial American defense in an age of great power conflict, which just came out last month. And Elbridge, appreciate you joining us. We want to talk to you about the situation with China right now. And I'm going to ask you the big picture question right now as as we confront a major issue in Taiwan. If China decides to invade Taiwan, what should the United States do? What do you think the United States would do? Well, first off, it's great to be on guys. Many thanks for the invitation for all to be here. I think to get to it, the answer is yes. We should defend them. It's in our interest. It's not open and shut. But the key here is to have our military focused on it and to be ready. And we're not there right now. But Taiwan is critical for our position in Asia. And look, Asia is the world's most important market. And China is the other world superpower. If China dominates Asia, trust me, they will be using their power to change our lives at home. What would we do? I'm not sure what the Biden administration would do. They've talked a pretty big game. So that's one signal. But I mean, at the end of the day, who knows, right? But I do think that the pressure on the Biden administration be compelling would probably be almost irresistible. But the issue is if China can wrap Taiwan up in a couple of days or weeks, it may be too late. So we need to be ready and prepared with the idea ultimately of the turn this of avoiding God for bit of major war. Bridge, it's Buck. I want to know why you think China has been making such aggressive noises about Taiwan recently. I mean, what is it about this moment in time? Certainly the Biden administration plays a role in all this, but other other factors too. And you know, how how close are we? I mean, I know there's the Defcon scale for nuclear war, right? I mean, if we had a Defcon scale for Taiwan, where would you put us in terms of Chinese aggression and the possibility of the Chinese Communist Party deciding that it's go time? Well, thanks, Buck. It's great to talk to you again. I mean, I think that Defcon level should be high. And I mean, I'm not talking necessarily tomorrow, although it might be, but I think the next couple of years, but if we're going to be able to change things, then we've got to start moving dramatically right now. And the key, what are they doing? I don't exactly know. I actually do think that their best option at the end of the day is to go big, go big or go home, because they're never going to convince the people on Taiwan to live under the rule of the suppressors of Hong Kong, right? They're not going to be able to kind of hoodwink or magic trick them out of their freedom. So what they're going to do, if they're really serious about it, which I think they are, if they're going to go big and they're going to take it and they're going to dare us to come and try to reverse the trends. And given the military balance in the theater, we might not have a good option. I could see us backing down. And I mean, I think it is possible us and our allies, God forbid. What are the indicators? I mean, look, they've got the will, right? I mean, Xi Jinping hasn't been shy about it. The Chinese have always said that they want to take Taiwan. Also, it's a great way to humiliate us, right? I mean, MacArthur called Taiwan the unsinkable aircraft carriers right there in the middle of our strategic position. If China could take Taiwan, it would be a massive blow to our credibility. And I'm not somebody who thinks that everything we do around the world is always connected, that we can't get out of any commitment to the contrary. But look, if you're Japan or the Philippines or Vietnam, you're going to be looking at Taiwan, right? Yeah, why is it a bridge? Why should Americans honestly care all that much to the point of possibly even militarily defending this island? Let's be honest, very far away. And not a lot of Americans spend much time thinking about that. That is the right question. It's a question that we need to answer. And in fact, the question that was hanging over my book, the issue is, is that this is about Asia. This is about who dominates Asia and whether China dominates Asia. We're not looking to dominate Asia. We're looking to stop them from doing it because think of the reality. If China is in a position where everybody in Asia, 50% or more of global GDP, all the world beating companies, all the regulation is set there, they are going to be able to do to us what they're doing to the Australians or what they do to their own people. I mean, the example I think of, Buck, is we all have concerns about the social media companies. But the premise of our debate in this country is that we will be able to change it if we get the right political coalition. But if the Chinese dominate Asia, we won't have that ability. We'll have to go to Beijing and we won't have much of a chance. And Taiwan is critical to how that overall issue resolves because the people in Japan, I don't really, I care about the American people and their interests. And I don't want to fight a major war. But at the end of the day, I don't want Americans to have to live bending the need to the regulators or the Communist Party in China. We're talking to Bridge Colby, co-founder, principal, the marathon initiative. All right. So Buck asked a good question about why we should care about Taiwan. Here's a bigger question too, in the result of Joe Biden being in office, how much does our weakness in Afghanistan in your mind factor into how China makes a determination upon Taiwan? In other words, is the way in which we departed Afghanistan is the low approval rating of Joe Biden for foreign affairs? Does that factor into the calculus for China as they try to determine what to do with Taiwan? I mean, I think the answer is yes. I mean, I supported the withdrawal from Afghanistan. I think it was the right decision. I mean, President Trump was going in that direction. Look, we need to focus on Asia. That's the big problem. And we need to get rid of other commitments like Afghanistan. We need to reduce in Europe and elsewhere. But how you do it is critical. And it was clear that we could have done better here. I mean, we all pay more than 3% of our income to the national security state. Buck, you worked in the CIA. I mean, we deserve better than that. And I think what could happen is that the Chinese could assess these guys can't tie their shoes straight. And at the end of the day, they're not going to be ready to stand up. I mean, I think one of the things that the Trump administration did right was in trying in some ways to reduce in the Middle East, there was also a face shot to Iran, which said, don't think that we can be toyed with. Don't think that we can be pushed around. Yes, we're pulling back because we got bigger problems. But we are prepared to go harsh. And I think that's probably the question. I think that's one thing that people really underestimate is that a lot of people just assume that Chinese won't do that. But I mean, what about the Chinese Communist leadership, especially Xi Jinping, gives people the confidence that he's not going to pull the trigger if he thinks it's going to be advantageous for him. We're speaking to bridge Colby, who's the co-founder and principal of the marathon initiative. He's the author of the strategy of of denial, American defense, and an age of great power conflict. What is the by I mean, to the degree, you can know this. I know you work in the Trump administration at the Pentagon bridge. But what is the Biden vision? And I mean, his foreign policy team around him. What is the vision of how we should be dealing with China and how does it differ from the Trump team? Yeah, I think there was an article in the New York Times, a good reflection of the Biden administration thinking by David Sanger that I think they are actually, I think, or at least important segments of the administration, they are trying to focus on China. But their view is that it's almost like it's kind of weird. Almost it's like they talk about it. We're going to compete hard on the playing field about technology or economics or military signaling or the military buildup. But then we're going to keep that in check and we're going to cooperate on climate and so forth. And at the same time, the Biden team is like, well, it's all going to get together with our European allies. And we're going to stand up in the UN Security Council and the G7 and NATO and what have you. And I think the fundamental problem here is that it underestimates the importance of real hard power that the Chinese have been investing in and is going to be increasingly attracted to them. So what I'm worried about urgently is that the Biden team is focusing on like this economic condition, quote unquote, competing international institutions like the UN. But at the end of the day, Mao Zedong had one thing, right? Power comes out of the barrel of the gun. If the Chinese can force Asia to kind of, you know, cue their line and toe their line, then it doesn't matter what happens in the WTO or the UN or the WHO, right? And so this is what I'm concerned about. And it's different than the Trump administration. I think the Trump administration understood correctly, and I mean, I'm generalizing, but that we needed to go through a really confrontational period to reset, right? For 20 years, we'd had a screwed up policy of engagement that was naive. John Mearsheimer has an excellent piece on this in the current issue of foreign affairs. I'd recommend it to your audience. We'd have this screwed up policy. Nobody trusted us to take a firm line against China. And the Chinese didn't believe that we would take a firm and endearing line against China. And what the Trump administration president Trump himself did is stood strong, Pope the Chinese in the eye. But I think the long term goal there was yet to build up as a position of strength with our allies, with our military forces, et cetera. But ultimately, to be, yeah, the president was right to be able to cut a deal. Now what that deal looked like down the line, it wouldn't mean cutting our our allies loose or something like that. But it would mean, like, we're not going to try to turn them in. You know, it's not the American people's responsibility to turn the China into democracy. We might wish for that. But that's not our job here. That's not what this is really about. This is making sure that China does not dominate our future because it dominates the world's largest market. What does an invasion of Taiwan look like and how rapidly would it transpire? How long would we have? I know we've got troops in Asia. How long would we have to react? How quickly would Taiwan fall? In your mind, what is the process under which a Chinese invasion would look like? And what would the timeframe be for American response? Well, I think it's a lot more urgent and short than than people appreciate. And part of that is because there's a presumption that China will kind of test or work its way up through what's often called the gray zone by trying to kind of con Taiwan into giving up. But I think the Chinese recognize that's not going to work. Nobody in their right mind on Taiwan wants to turn into Hong Kong, right, let alone Shenzhen or Shanghai. So if China knows that and knows Taiwan's never going to come over, their incentive actually is just to go big and resolve it quickly and what's often called a fed to complete, right? And to move as quickly as possible before the Americans have the chance to mobilize our military forces, go through our political process, etc. Just wrap it up and create a much more difficult position. Fundamentally, it's usually easier to defend an island than to retake it, right? So if we have to retake Taiwan, that's terrible, terrible. Whereas defending Taiwan, that's something we can do much more feasibly. So China knows that. So I think part of what they're doing about to get back to your question is I think they're trying to desensitize us. If you look at examples of surprise in the modern world, well, they're often not because something came out of really nowhere, but because we kind of like discounted it. So if you look at the 1973 war, the Arabs very carefully dulled American and Israeli intelligence to understand what the Arabs were about to do. And that ultimately worked quite effectively for the Israelis came out on top, fortunately, but it worked in terms of surprise. I think that's what they maybe try to do. So we could wake up one morning and it could be a matter of a couple of days. And so what I'm really trying to do by pounding the drum is get us ahead of the problem. So the Chinese understand that if they try, it's not going to work like that, they're going to fail. And if they fail, it's catastrophic for them. So we have that going for us.

All right. Clay. This is interesting at Netflix. Yes. We can start at every segment with this is interesting because obviously that's why we're telling people about it. But Dave Chappelle's now I'm gonna say this. I don't want to get into a cultural critic thing here. But this was not his best. I'm just gonna say this is not his funny aesthetic was okay. There were some funny moments. There were some kind of moments. But he had long a long commentary about the trans community specifically. So it's within the LGBTQ plus world, but the trans community. And there are there are a lot of people on the left and from the L the LGBTQ plus plus community and the trans community that are very angry about this. And there's now a Netflix employee walkout underway today in Los Angeles because they say that it was Dave Chappelle's comments were transphobic and that it it is putting people in danger and the employee demand. They've released a list of demands, which of course, whatever, all hostage, terrorists, right? They're releasing a list of demands. They want three areas, content investment, employee relations and safety and harm reduction. They want more investing in trans and non binary talent and content along with involving more input from marginalized communities around potentially harmful content at Netflix. Netflix is woke. It will not go broke, but they got a problem on their hands. Ted Sarandos, who is one of the co chief executive officers of Netflix, came out and apologized for not being sensitive enough in his initial comments about the Dave Chappelle special. And here's why I think this matters. You might be out there. You might say, I don't care about Netflix comedians. It matters because as who gets canceled changes, the overall power of cancel culture declines because it starts to feed on itself. This is what happens with all revolutions. Eventually they end up guillotining their true believers. Remember Robespierre got guillotine during the French Revolution because the purity contest starts to pit ideologues against each other. And Trump was in their mind of the woke universe, the great Satan who they could ally against without Trump. They don't have any easy foil. And so they're starting to turn internal. So Buck, if they cancel a black comedian, because his jokes are not considered to be acceptable, a lot of black people who are fans of Dave Chappelle and white and Asian and Hispanic fans too, are going to say, wait a moment, they're starting to turn on what would otherwise be a member of their coalition. Can I tell you where I see this going? This is going to turn into Netflix will make concessions to the trans demands. I didn't mean for that to rhyme, but it did. Yeah. Trans demands here. And that will be the way they they'll say, Oh, we'll address, we'll address the concern. But they're not pulling down the Chappelle special. They're not going to pull it off their streaming service. It's not going to happen because you have, as you point out, a very successful black comedian. And there are sensitivities on the left around what that would mean as well. So he's, I don't think he's going to get canceled, normal is special. But you will see a whole lot more, you know, Netflix specials in series, scripted series about, you know, non-binary characters, etc. We're pet lovers here on this program during the height of the pandemic, pets were a constant companion. I took my parents French bulldog, Talulah, for the entirety of the pandemic for the first year of it, I should say. And it was incredible. But I want her to be as healthy as possible. That's why we feed her rough greens now. Remember, dog food is dead food. There's no live nutrients in it. And dogs need live nutrition just like we do. Rough greens is not a dog food.

I'm in there. It should be fun. All right. That is out there. News breaking in the last hour. We got some budget reconciliation drama. Oh boy. Fireworks. This is from mother Jones website that Joe Manchin has told Democrats that he is considering leaving the party and has an exit plan in place. Now, Manchin is saying this in the context of negotiation that is ongoing about exactly how much this budget is going to cost. According to this article, he has let the White House know that he will not support any higher than $1.75 trillion in the budget. That's still a lot of money, but it's half of the reported price tag that Democrats wanted. And he has said 175 is his top number and that if the Democrats reject it, here's what he would do. This is according to mother Jones. Now, Manchin has come out and denied it. Manchin says he would send a letter to Chuck Schumer announcing that he was pulling himself out of Democratic leadership in the Senate. If that did not get his results after another week, he would change his voter registration from Democrat to independent. The question then would be whether or not Manchin would caucus with the Democrats or the Republicans. It's worth mentioning Sunday, New York Times had a big article saying that Kirsten Cinnima from Arizona, who is also among the most moderate of the Democrats, has also contemplated in some way being an independent and that maybe that would be a better fit for her. So, Buck, when you see this story and obviously we saw was it Jim Jeffords, I think, who switched his party affiliation and changed the overall makeup of the Senate back in the day. He flipped from Republicans to Democrats, right, and became an independent but caucused with Democrats and changed the control of that chamber. Do you buy into the idea that Manchin potentially could become an independent and leave the Democratic Party or is this just a negotiating point? It feels so hard to separate the leverage that he gets even from this flow. Of course, he denies it. Oh, no, no, no, he denies it right away, right? But this is a pretty detailed article, right? Supposedly breaking down decision making. The Democrat Party is a party of progressive authoritarian. I mean, that's really the truth. I mean, I throw around the term commie sometimes. That's their more revolutionary vanguard. That's more the squad at AOC. There's a communist vibe that comes from some of the more extreme Democrats these days. And I think it's filtering into their policies. But does Joe Manchin really have a home in today's Democrat Party? When you look at it, it actually would make sense for him to be an independent given these realities. Also the fact that West Virginia is a quite red state and that the reddest state supporting Trump in 2020. Oh, I thought it was Wyoming. Wow. It's West Virginia. I think it was West Virginia. We'll get a fact check on that during the commercial. But I mean, it's very red at the point. And so you've got this Democrat Senator from a very, very red state. And remember, you know, he was a very important vote just a few years ago when it came to or, you know, very important voice and vote for confirmation when it came to Brett Kavanaugh. And that situation, right? And he realized West Virginia did not believe the Kavanaugh smears as a state that the people less Virginia. So that was a wise move and the right move for him. Here's the problem I think the Democrats have. They put forward this 3.5. And remember, it's really more than that. I mean, when people actually look at the numbers at 3.5 trillion plus a trillion in infrastructure. So when you look at the total spending package, it was massive. Yes. And to put this in perspective, the Obama administration, the Obama administration spending spree that ignited the Tea Party when you're looking at the stimulus package, it was about a trillion dollars for the stimulus package. So we're now looking at 3.5 trillion, which is completely just blow out spending with rising inflation. And the Democrats keep going, Oh, well, inflation's a little worse than I thought. Why is inflation going up? It's so it's like, this is math because you're putting so much money into the economy. You're you're putting pressure on the currency. But I think that they're going to have a tough time convincing Democrats, even if Manchin gets his way here, that what they've passed is really enough and shows that the Biden agenda is real because I think they overshot what the initial price tag. So there will be a letdown even if the 1.7 trillion Manchin's holding out for becomes the final number. And as for Manchin switching parties or not, I think a lot of it is going to be determined by how this actual debate and this political wrangling turns out for him. But it doesn't strike me as implausible at all. Here's the way that I would look at it. If Manchin wants to remain in the Senate in the years ahead, he was elected and reelected in 18. He's going to be up for reelection in 24. I don't see any way possible that in 2024, he wins given how much the Senate has become a national referendum, particularly given how important his seat is. So I wonder whether you tell me what you think about from a Manchin perspective. If he flips and decides to run as an independent instead of a Democrat right before 2024, politically, he's going to get attacked as being a turncoat who only cares about his reelection. If he changes parties several years in advance of 2024, he can say, hey, I wanted to be representing the people of West Virginia the best way that I could. And even though I was elected as a Democrat, I decided to become an independent. So I'm not now changing my colors just to get reelected. Does that make sense? He can say what is true, I think of a lot of Democrats. The Democratic Party left me. I didn't leave the Democratic Party. And in order to best represent West Virginia, I needed to become an independent. I think that's a compelling political argument. I think it's easier to make now than it would be as a prelude to running in 2024 when everybody would just say, Oh, it's awfully convenient. You did the Democrat bidding. And then as soon as you mate might face the consequences, you now try to change your party affiliation. I think if he's going to do it for 2024, he has to do it now. And if he's not going to do it, I think he's basically saying I'm out. I'm not going to try to win reelection in 24. And in the meantime, we have the fate of the Biden agenda hanging in the balance because there is nothing. I mean, those executive orders that Biden signed the very beginning things like stopping the Keystone XL pipeline. Oh, that's great. Just remember that everybody every time you go to put gas in your car, the Biden administration approach in general to energy, because they'll say, Oh, but the Keystone wasn't. Yeah, whatever. The approach in general, when it comes to leasing on federal land, when it comes to hydrocarbon, general, they've taken the let's make it as hard as possible and expensive as possible for you to heat your home and have gas for your car. But you look at the early Biden administration executive orders, that's not that doesn't cut it. What does cut it? We haven't beaten COVID. The economy looks like it's I mean, we keep talking about this, how it's just not a good year for Joe Biden. If they don't get the massive spending package through anywhere near even what they said they would, and we're talking about cutting it in half. That's going to be a tough sell. I mean, maybe it's funny. It's a tough sell because of the expectations they set up clay. But then about the same token, as I said, it's double almost what the Obama spending package was. And we thought that was crazy. So it's all right, everybody, don't worry about it. You know, your savings will just keep disappearing. Smoke them if you got them. Clay and I'll be here for you as the Democrat commies ruin the economy that we have. So that's what we got. And so we got in the meantime, we got to tell you about the tunnel to towers foundation. They come every day hoping to do good deeds for men and women across the country. They pay attention to our first responders and our troops and their families. And they've done remarkable things this year. In fact, there's even more remarkable outcomes from them. By New Year's Eve, they'll have gifted 200 mortgage free homes to America's heroes and their families. And earlier this summer, they let all of us and remembering the first responders who sacrificed their lives on 9 11 in the days and months afterward. And we've got Veterans Day coming up and Buck, they can make a tremendous difference for everybody out there as we get closer and closer to Veterans Day. Help tunnel to towers. Do good. Donate $11 a month at t2t.org. Again, it's just $11 a month at t the number two t dot org. The closing up shop here today on the clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. But we appreciate so much.

You can listen to clay Travis and Buck Sexton show there anytime you like. And we also have social media accounts. I get Facebook messages from you during the show. Sometimes I'll say people write me and you're writing me in real time. clan. I check our Twitter or Facebook during the show. I'm Buck Sexton on Twitter and Facebook and Instagram. If you want to see Tallulah photos, a lot of Tallulah photos. And you got clay Travis on Twitter on Instagram as well. Clay, we're the cat photos, my man. We have many cat photos lately. Well, first of all, Ali and my wife, our producer, Ali, techs back and forth, I think cat photos, these cats are destroying my house. They just tear things apart. My wife is furious when the boys break anything in the house. And you can imagine with three young boys, there's always wrestling and things getting broken. The cats destroy everything and they get away with it zero responsibility at all. So there is tension now in the house over that over that interact. Did you put little cat costumes on the cats? Like, is your wife good? You know, is one of your cats in a little spider man costume or a little Fauci lab code? That cat, I wouldn't like. I don't think she's done that because the last Halloween party last year, we had an issue with the cats. The cats can't go outside, right? And but there's tons of people going in and out. So the cats escaped and we weren't sure where they were. It was a major calamity in the house every time the cats disappear. So far, they haven't gotten out. So I think the cats are going to be locked up so that they can't interact around Halloween. I don't think they'll be in in in costumes at all. Do you have a favorite, by the way, like, are you allowed to pick among your cats? You love your cats equally? I am anti cat. Like, on the I would not have had cats. Yes, play Travis. I would have had to take that one. The house like a lot of people out there during this whole COVID mess. We added family cats because my kids and my wife advocated for it and I get out voted four to one on the cat front. So I had I would have no cats in the house if it were my choice. Man, all these all these people that thought you were there. You were their brother in cat ownership. No. And now you're you're telling us you're all you're a dog guy. Well, not only that, we have the bingo cats, which are hypoallergenic. So they don't give have create major allergy issues. The cats cost me like a thousand dollars each. I mean, this I was in disbelief. I think there's inflation in cat prices and dog prices because everybody's trying to buy them all right now. This is why I can't stop working buck because my family spends money like drunken sailors. I said this a lot. I wish I could come back as either my wife or one of my sons for a second life because I'm out here working 20 hours a day and they get all of the benefits and none of the stress. It's an amazing life. To be a Travis boy or my wife would probably say it's an awful experience to be married to me for almost 20 years. But I think they got pretty good lives. Now let's take a turn for a moment here toward. But just one one quick thing, Clay, you know, when I asked about English bulldog and French bulldog breeders on air, because I actually had a I put in a kind of request for a friend of mine who was breeding his Frenchie turned out their French. He only had one. So I then they kept the one, but I was gonna have a Frenchie as of this fall. That was the idea. But I got so it's amazing. I say to this audience, you know, hey guys, I need to know what the what the special, you know, the little screw that goes in the back of the Blackhawk rotor is. And you'll get 50 guys who are like, Oh, I'm a Blackhawk mechanic, 117th there 117th aviation, you know, right away. And with the dog breeders, I was inundated with people who were like, I've got Frenchese, I've got bulldog. So it's so nice. I appreciate that. And I am going to be getting this spring. I got, I got to put a marker down, man. What's the bulldog cost? Did you look at the pricing? Bulldogs are really expensive. Like, I have no idea. Like, I mean, a French bull. So French bulldogs, because they're French, they cost a whole lot of money. I mean, they, if you were to buy one from a standard breeder, they're usually about $4,000. Oh, my God. Yeah. And actually $1,000. This is I mean, remember Lady Gaga, someone stole or two Frenchies? I mean, there's like, it's a French bulldog is the most expensive in the bulldog family. Yes. Accurate. Yeah. English. What is the French bulldog versus another brand? I think the English bulldog, you probably pick one up for about, and again, these are city prices. They're people who are like, I live in Nebraska. We will give you a dog for 300 bucks, right? But yeah, or for free or whatever. But you know, the city prices on this, meaning if you go to a breeder within a driving distance, not just of New York, but New York, Dallas, Los Angeles places, you know, Houston places like that, big cities, big cities, you're going to, you're looking at probably a couple of grand for an English bulldog and four grand for a Frenchy, but the blue Frenchy breed or brother blue Frenchy type, not breed the blue Frenchies can go for a clay. There's a guy in my building who told me he paid $10,000 for his French bulldog. And that French bulldog I'm telling you, looks to me all the time and it's like, get out of my way, peasants, you know, that is a 10,000 dollars. Yeah. I just want to know how he got the little blue Frenchy to walk around with the berry and a little cane that he hits the peasants like me with whatever I get in the way and a little monocle too, you know, so 10th. I mean, I knew it was going to be expensive, but I don't feel as bad paying as much for these cats as I did now. I so there you go, man. See, I thousand five thousand dollars for a cat. Like I don't feel like that's that's that crazy. Although you probably could have just gone into an alleyway somewhere in Nashville and certainly there are lots, but they wouldn't be hypoallergenic. We've got two brothers that are destroying the house. I'm I'm ready to put them up. I think I've given you a great idea too. I think Mrs. Travis, you guys should get little costumes for the cats. I hope she's not listening because that definitely she's probably thought of it. Oh my gosh. She's probably already ready to go. She's laughing at us right now. She's got a little cat costumes for the for the kitties. We were going to talk about Jen Psaki making fun of that. That's a question. But you know, we'll get into that tomorrow. Some sometimes you got to talk about cats and dogs living together. Mass hysteria, folks. Mass hysteria in your hometown of New York City where the Thomas Jefferson statue came down. They used to be the town of the Ghostbusters. Oh man, just gave us such a good time. New York New York don't worry. From a New York listeners out there, the Clann Buck show, we're here for you. You know, we're things are a little crazy here. We're here for you. But we're here for you in Los Angeles, Miami, Tampa, Portland, Houston, Omaha, that's not the city where they will be here a long time if we tell all the cities across the country. We're here for you. So we appreciate you listening in and spend some time with us. And we'll be back tomorrow. We're going to have more on the board. We hopefully have a couple of fantastic guests in the pipeline for you in the next day or two. We'll see who's going to be joining us and Clay. There we go, man. We did it. We did it again.
