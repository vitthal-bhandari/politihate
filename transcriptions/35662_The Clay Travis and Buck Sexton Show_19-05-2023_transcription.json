    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast Welcome in friday edition clay Travis buck Sexton show. I appreciate all of you hanging out with us We have had a lot of fun so far this week and we're going to finish strong I hope you all have started your weekend maybe even a little bit early Uh and you are rolling in here for what is for many of you going to be a graduation weekend We've got so many different people out there high school and college graduation season underway We've got a loaded program for you. Let me give you an idea of what we got going on at one o'clock Justin marino is going to join us. Justin marino is the attorney We're going to get into this story and we've hinted at it a couple of times this week Crazy viral video of a six-month pregnant nurse Trying to get a bike to ride home after her shift at a hospital in new york city area Um and she was accused of being racist. She was attacked Uh just in incredibly graphic detail all over twitter She's had to to relocate so she and her husband are safe. Uh, we're going to talk with her attorney He's coming in studio at one o'clock. We'll also be joined in the second hour by riley gains Uh who has been fighting out for women's sports and then in the third hour Senator josh holly of mazuri has a new book out He's going to hop in with us in the final hour of the week all that Scheduled to to break down with you. Uh, we've got news that tem scott senator from south carolina has filed paperwork to officially become a candidate for president. He is reportedly going to announce on monday And began his campaign for president which means that to south carolinians nicky haley also already in the race And then there are reports that rondesantis is going to announce in miami on wednesday So we will give you all the latest analysis there With rondesantis prepared to announce there is a monster probably four or five thousand word attack piece On kc desantis his wife. We will discuss that Federman uh more audio of federman attempting to uh inject himself into the body politic. We will discuss that Uh, georgia and arizona battleground states new polling out what does it tell us we will discuss and uh, there is a lot of uh, news out there surrounding what has suddenly become A very controversial topic and buck if i had told you If i had told you buck in 2016 That we were going to be in a situation where 14 and 15 year old kids were going to be having surgery to remove body parts And change their gender And that the idea that a state should say you know, we're not going to allow that Would somehow be a battleground issue Would you believe that we were going to end up there? I mean in all honesty i i would not have ever believed even in 2016 that a 14 year old having for instance her breast removed Uh stopping that from occurring or some of the sterilization basically procedures Yet that is where we are where left wingers in this country are up in arms over the idea that we would say hey If you want to be trans you have to at least wait to adulthood Uh, are you stunned that this is where we are? You know As a normal person just walking around day to day i could understand how somebody would say how did we get to this place couldn't have seen this coming But when you understand the nature and the inclination of the left and the way that they engage in uh in relentless Activism and and the way that they're willing to lie endlessly you see that from the very beginning clay it was always Premised on A man can become a woman. I mean there's always been this incoherence all of the different um You know qualifications or all of the different modifications that have been made up to this point We're all rooted in a fallacy and so What the left is realized is that the only way this whole thing sticks together The only way that they can get their preferred policy is to take it all the way Because otherwise there are limitations right? Otherwise there are concerns What I mean is If you don't believe that that you can transition your gender Then you don't believe you can transition your gender all this stuff that we're doing all these accommodations Was the word i was trying to think of before all these accommodations usage of preferred pronouns You know that the bathroom policies under obama if you remember all of this stuff It can hold together. It makes no sense Um unless you actually believe that a man can become a woman and why are they going after kids? Why do they say that doctors get it wrong when it comes to the gender of a baby now? Well because otherwise you start to get into well if this is a psychological condition Is it one that is healthy that should be celebrated? Is it one that requires the suspension of reality for everybody else? Clay you may have seen this nbc news Had parents file a police report after teacher offers lgbtq themed book to her middle schoolers But when you actually look at what nbc news is uh is sharing on this when you actually look at what? The book is they're lying about what the book is And they're lying about what's in the book and this reminds me of here the uh the reader context on twitter here The incorrect book is shown by nbc The book in question is this book is gay which explains how to find sexual partners online and contain sexually explicit pictures Yeah The only way nbc news can make this argument about how look at how terrible these parents are for stepping in is to lie And that is where we are lie about the book that the parents don't like because no sane person thinks You should be teaching fourth graders about where to find partners Uh for any sexual proclivities online. No sane person can make that argument Yeah, it's crazy And I actually went and looked up this book and I would just encourage Because there is this argument on the left as you well know that these are books that are being banned They're not being banned. This is just a discussion about what's appropriate At what age for kids to be exposed to a variety of different subjects Which is and has long been the province of parents and I just go back to movies every time Every time you hear someone say this book has been banned. You should respond Really? Is it banned? Is it impossible to get it anywhere in the united states or Is there just a discussion about age appropriateness in the same way that there is with every single movie? Right if you're going to the movies this weekend with your kids What's the first thing you're probably going to look at when you decide what movie to take them to see? What is the rating? You're probably not if you got an eight-year-old going to take them to an r-rated movie If you got a 10-year-old probably not going to do that So that is the appropriate response. I think but I want to play these book because I will say This is one of the first times where I've really felt and I think you can give matt wall shit the daily wire credit Because I think his documentary What is a woman which I would encourage people to watch we've talked about I think we had him on It really kind of opened many people's eyes to how aggressive and anti-children The trans movement has become and how much frankly they are encouraging young children To be uncomfortable in their bodies and tell them hey, maybe you're not a tomboy Maybe you should get your boobs chopped off because you're actually a boy greg abbot And also I believe ron desantis are out here fighting this battle right now Let's listen to greg abbot governor of texas Explained this bill that he just signed in the lone star state here's cut seven I'll be signing it heres. This is about protecting children Now remember this and and that is a person under the age of 18 They don't have the mental capacity to make a life-changing decision to Lose there's sex organs in the set of texas if you're under the age of 18 You can't get a tattoo you can't buy cigarettes and so many other things But people think that they should be able to make a decision to permanently alter their sex organs That's just outrageous in texas We believe that cutting off the child sex organs is child abuse and it's going to be treated that way by law I mean, it's crazy that this has to be said the same thing by the way also happening in florida Here's what ron desantis said let's play cut 10 We also did a bill which is sad that we're even having discussed this to criminalize the mutilation of minors who are undergoing the sex Change operations by these really rogue ideological physicians and we've had heartbreaking testimony From people that have gone through this when they were minors now they're adults And this is something they're now having to overcome really for the rest of their lives because irreversible changes were made We banned this Administratively last year through our medical board. So if a medical doctor did this they lose the license in florida Which is appropriate but we felt you had to do more I mean if you're taking off the private parts of some 15 year old kid, you know, you should go to jail for that This is the most obvious the most common sense Position that I think the gop has had to take an opposite opposition to the democrat left in a long time And and I think it's it's worth noting clave that One of the reasons that they're going after this remember they keep pushing this there are other states so that everyone Has the full context here that are creating sanctuary states. Yeah So that a 14 year old who's convinced that he is a she can go to colorado or can go to washington state I'm not even sure which all of the states are under this umbrella yet And and the parents don't even get notification and the parents can't do anything about it They're running to these clinics. These clinics are going to be funded by by the left. It's very ideological But if they don't intervene at this level one thing that you can expect is that a lot of these teenagers Who are you know believe their trans or they're going through this this psychological process of thinking they're the other gender What happens when we get data on the percentage of them who How else do you say it grow out of it? Yeah, which is going to be very high mark my words You know how you know this because you look at the practice of psychiatry before it was overtaken by left wing zealots Which unfortunately it has been the most left wing of all of the medical specialties is psychiatry by far Before psychiatrists were just all you know doing their their best To destroy civilization in the name of of equity or whatever Uh, they recognize that a lot of these kids just grow out of it And what's the harm if it's so important? What's the harm and the harm and waiting clay is what you have to you have to live Uh, you know Not the way that you think you should be for a few more years to you're an adult ever Heal They have open gashes folks that never heal And you're supposed to pretend that the gash is female genitalia This is the definition of monstrous I mean It really is buck and there was a good piece I know we've talked about it on the show and I saw the wall street journal build on it I believe it was monday or tuesday's journal They wrote all of the laws out about tattoos And you know giving kids under 18 in some states is a felony a tattoo Literally giving them a tattoo and the whole logic behind it is Hey, how many people when they're 14 or 15 they even have One of the most the the nations for most tattoo artists And he says like I won't do tattoos under the age of 18 and his quote and i'm paraphrasing is basically How many kids 14 or 15 get a tattoo? And when they're 40 or 50 they're like man that tattoo that I got when I was 14 or 15 is great I'm so glad I have it so we have some states treat kids under 18 getting tattoos as a felony And these same states, this is what's crazy buck to your point These same left-wing states are like oh, but you should be able to chop off your boobs At 14 or 15 and it's a human right they won't let you get a tattoo But they'll let you remove your breast and stop yourself from going through puberty These doctors are violating the Hippocratico. No doubt I mean this goes to the most basic These surgeries that they are doing these hormone blockers they're giving and there's also this massive Recognition among many of us after the covid fiasco Whether it was doctors rushing people onto ventilators which killed them or doctors insisting you double or even triple masks Which was useless or doctors saying get shots four five and six Those are the really good ones that'll protect you people recognize now the ideological rot that has spread within the medical community Such that yeah, the same doctors What I want to ask this what correlation does everyone think there is between doctors who support gender transition for minors And doctors who think fauci is a genius Masking was a lifesaver and the vaccines were a gift from well I wouldn't say god because they don't believe in god, but a gift from you know somewhere 100% clay yeah, 100% guaranteed they overlap We'll get into all this and more 800-282-2882 obviously it is friday as well We will take some of your calls, but in the meantime. I want to tell you how about saving some money and getting a brand new phone in the process That's a good idea.

Oh, they sure exceeded by a longer stocks falter than they get dark Doc follows a new buck Is that for sacred all our jobs the blicks and rober met the persona on board? Yes come over jake it Yeah, that's all right. Thank for all of for a ride and for data brought up into now the flood gates of candidates are opening right now We uh Have mentioned to you that the desantis announcement is supposed to come next week even more reporting on that now that looks pretty set Um, I believe it's gonna happen in miami the announcement. That's what's being reported right now Um, the desantis announcement, uh, tim scott has filed paperwork officially clay mentioned that And then I just saw this one a little bit of a surprise Uh, and that is that chris christy Is thinking that he may get into the gop race now this will this look the chance of chris christy Winning the gop primary is zero. We all know that He but this is what we've seen the primary process has changed right clay for some people it's Trying to run to be the vice president or secretary of state, etc Of one of the other candidates who's running right to try to sort of just be in the mix and be a A brand enhancing moment for others. It's just they've got a message they want to bring and maybe they got books They want to sell If chris christy does get in and I know people are saying why are we even talking about this like what's Look, he's probably going to make it onto the republican debate stage or at least he's going to try really hard He wants to just go this is interesting. He wants to go after trump I don't believe that ron desantis wants to make this a personal thing with trump although who knows how this is going to go If chris christy gets in He's going to want to throw his weight around on that stage. He's going to want to go right at donald trump Yeah, and and I wonder if chris christy. I like so so much of this calculus. I don't get buck right Chris christy has as you said a zero percent chance of being the republican nominee for president So is he running to cross his fingers and hope that desantis wins As the nominee and then maybe he gets in the desantis cabinet. He if you've watched his media We've played some of his clips here. He's been appearing. He's become a republican quote who goes on msnbc Yep But there's a trump feud that he has now he's one of these individuals. Yeah, and You know say what you will about chris christy Uh, you know, he likes he likes to brawl it out and he doesn't care He has no standing in the gop to protect at this point So i'm just saying it might be interesting if he really gets in because you have this wild card for whom I mean trump is his white whale man like he's just getting in there to throw throw shots at trump Now the of course trump has said he's not going to debate So this may encourage trump even less to debate But chris d will do it in the media Yeah, he'll be going on all these platforms to try to bait trump into fight look maybe trump I was gonna say maybe trump ignores him. I think that's unlikely I think we could all agree that's unlikely But uh, he's just it's interesting you know you have like the vac who's very very pro trump as a candidate for republican Chris christy's only getting in there to stick a thumb in donald trump's, uh, you know bowl of soup so to speak How long do trump rips christy for being fat But that is gonna be even good to be constant how long before christy throws it back at him Well, we'll see good question You can count on one hand the number of companies in america offering the value proposition my pillow does one product after another from pillows To sheets the slippers they come through with great deals and right now They got an incredible offer for you six piece towel set made with us a cotton extremely absorbent yet still providing the soft feel You'll look for in a towel set comes with two bath two hand towels two washcloths typically at retails for 99 98 right now you can get them for 25 bucks when you use our names clay and buck as the promo code That's over 70 off in savings $25 for a six towel set you know they'll sell out fast to find the offer just go to my pillow calm Click on the radio listener special square $25 on the towel set enter our names as the promo code clay and buck get on my pillow calm today Welcome back in clay travis buck sexton show You know that we are moving towards official primary season when his buck just mentioned christy's thinking about jumping in tem scott has jumped in ronda santis Going to jump in as well into the republican primary there's talk that christin new new Uh the governor of new hamster may be entering the race. We expect that mike pence will enter the race Basically buck The only two people i believe i'm correct in this that we have rumored and or discussed about entering the race Glen yunken even though we put out that video at least so far may or may not be entering Is christ is uh is the uh is mike Pompeo the only person who seemed to flirt with running for president in a big way And end up not running right? I mean didn't he declare and then uh and then get out of it. I thought I thought no I don't think he ever officially announced I think he explored it in great detail mike pumpayo And then decided hey ultimately it was the wrong decision for me to run like he did all the back channel work that you would anticipate And then announced hey, i'm not actually going to run because we discussed with like he was one of the few guys who was right You're right. He was everyone thought he was about to run and then he didn't I thought he kind of said yeah I'm gonna run and it no but turns out he took it right up to the brink I wonder you know, maybe somebody I don't know. Maybe somebody who lives in marlago was like, hey, I got a better idea Why don't you be my guy for the following? Yeah, potentially but as we talked about pumpayo's the only guy it felt like who had done everything and might not be running Because he wanted to be vice president right? I feel like on some level nicky haley tim scott vivik rama swami So many I mean, I know asa hutchison There's people like that he would kill for the opportunity to be a vice president because he has I mean you or I could get more support for president right now than asa hutch doesn't asa Remind you of the oldest brother from succession who's like we got we got to fight hard for that one percent 1 in elaska or whatever. Yeah. Oh that the connor character on succession is so great and greg says well He said we're you know our support's wavering a little bit. We might be falling and the greg character is like What how could you fall from 1%? Which is like the lowest isn't that isn't that the lowest already? Uh, that is uh just a fantastic interplay there. So De santis getting attacked on uh, I saw this I mean politico has got like a 4 000 word hit piece on kacie de santis right now Which is uh, which is a sign that you're a significant. I I think buck i'm curious if you agree if you if your wife is getting roasted in a 4 000 word politico piece To me, that's a pretty good sign that you are a serious candidate to potentially be president now There's a report out there that uh that ronda santa said on a call with uh top advisors There are only three people who can win this race joe biden Donald trump, uh and or serious contenders in this race joe biden donald trump and me and de santis said Trump can't beat biden. I'm the only person who can beat biden But if you wonder whether somebody's a significant candidate I think the sign is when they start coming after not only you but also your wife your husband whoever's running If it's like your spouse is a target that is a sign that you are making people nervous Particularly on the left and I wanted to hit you with this buck Uh battleground state polling from public opinion strategies They've got new polls out from georgia and arizona, okay georgia and arizona 1 billion percent have to be in the republican camp in order to win the 2024 election they were not in the republican camp in 2020 they were in 2016 According to this poll biden has a one point lead over trump in georgia Interestingly buck de santis has a three point lead over biden according to this poll in georgia So biden uh is doing four points worse against de santis in georgia in arizona This says biden has a two point lead de santis has a four point lead in arizona Over biden all right so de santis six points better according to this poll in arizona Four points better in georgia again according to this poll which just came out today De santis would be in the lead against biden in georgia and arizona so buck do you buy it? Do you think this polling Is reflective that de santis would be stronger in georgia and arizona than trump right now Do you buy that the poll is accurate? I don't want to ask a question in response you ask ask your question ask your question in response What is the case not that trump would win nationally Uh because then I think you just bring in and and that feels very you know people feel that deep in their soul one way or the other Um, what is the case for donald trump to do better this time in those two states georgia and arizona that's a great question um then the last time around and and if someone's telling me Uh, well they cheated to that. I would say okay Have we fixed the cheating? if so how Let me know what that is Um, I so I have I have questions in response to it Um, the other problem with the with polls of course at this moment in time is everyone's going to say it's so early It's so early it doesn't mean anything But from a more long-term strategic outlook By the way, I asked that question. It's not a rhetorical question. I really want to know How does trump win? The extra whatever it's going to be you know 10,000 or 20,000 votes that he needs in arizona to win or the 15,000 votes he needs in georgia this time around what's the plan and I well that's what we find out in the primary Right? This is what we will be told. This is what this is what the process is all about Buck it's it's such a good question and I feel like georgia in particular I have a good read-on because for people out there who forgotten I went down to georgia and campaign for her shall walker about as hard as you can campaign Tennessee was getting a little jealous after mr Tennessee was becoming mr. Georgia there for a while It's it's hard to campaign harder in a state you don't live in than then what I tried to do for her shall in in georgia And I think trump this is my opinion I think trump has major major issues in georgia Uh, and I think you can look at the data and reflect that it's true buck Because we lost two senate runoff seats in 2020 that we never should have lost in georgia They gave republicans a minority in the senate and has led to trillions of dollars and extra spending that shouldn't have happened And then just look at what happened in 2022 and by the way if you're listening to me in georgia And you disagree you can call in and say clay. I think you're reading this wrong Here's why I went down to georgia and campaign as hard as you possibly can for her shall walker Herschel was the only republican running for statewide office who didn't win in 2022 and camp One re-election as the governor by seven and a half points over stacey abrams Herschel lost by a couple of points who was the candidate that donald trump was most associated with in georgia remember trump campaigned against brian kim And brian kimp in the in the primary and then trump even came out and said I don't even know that there's that much difference between stacey abrams and brian kimp remember he said that And then brian kimp in georgia went out and won seven and a half by seven and a half points buck I think kimp won by more in georgia because trump attacked him and that made some of those suburban housewives Actually comfortable voting for kimp meanwhile trump picked her shall walker as his hand pick candidate And as hard as I worked to get her show over the finish line. I think that heard him So when I see this polling, I think trump has got real issues in georgia And I don't think desantis would have those issues and by the way I've said I would consider putting brian kimp on my ticket if I were run desantis or someone else or even trump I would I would implore trump Apologize to brian kimp put him on your ticket as a vp. I would like to see that I think that would put georgia in his camp Oh, I think that would be a very smart move. I think the chance of donald trump doing that is almost zero I agree with you that it's zero, but I think it would be strategically if your goal is winning Do whatever you have to do to win. I totally Taking georgia for the republicans right away off the table. Yes should be easy. This should not be Georgia has been the sore point for republicans here in really three cycles in a row It's been the place where you say hold on a second What's going what's going on? And you have to start looking at the factors here you have to start looking at and if people could tell me that they cheated And that's what happened. I want to know what so they don't cheat against kimp But they cheat against her show. In fact. Yeah, in fact kimp wins a landslide buck It's far from cheating. It would be like cheating in favor of kimp Why are we missing? I want people in Georgia people in Arizona We are on a poll. Do you buy it? I mean that's a question for you buy this and and do you think? I mean really comes down to you.

So neither alto the catch up for the vent my dog But is there exceeded by a long starts falter and take a duck open duck follows a new buck Is that for sacred? All I were just a blicks and hope I met the persona Yes, come over Jacob. Yeah, that is all I had for all of war harder and four day of what happened tonight Welcome back to play and buck appreciate you're wrong with us 800 282 282 let's see what we got here We got an alabama caller close to georgia. So I guess geography will let it slide David in alabama. You got some thoughts on where the gop race stands right now. What's going on? Hey guys, how are you doing today? We're great sir. Thanks for calling in gree I absolutely agree camp would be a great partner for Trump I think that would be a great idea. But you know that was the this a reason of my call. I had um I was fortunate. You know ruscious. So she's different homes with a caller Which you know, it's pretty much a record. I think and the phone that I made to rush you agree You know half the guys and more than half the guys that run for president Could be just one of her former presidential candidate on the resume I think you boost how much they get I have to do weekend shows and they come along and do these other talks. Yeah most of them Are they submitting your his answer president? Um, yeah, look I think thank you for calling in. Uh, I guess this is call number seven. He said he got through six times with rush Um, thanks for calling in. I would say yeah, we we all see this the same way there are people who run I said this I think in the last hour people who run for book sales or to raise their media profile at to get a lot of free media Um, if you're somebody who just wants to get a lot of attention on the right very rapidly Or or on the left democrat democrats do it too. I mean look at mary Ann Williamson. No one thinks she's going to be president, right? But people talk about I just mentioned her name on the radio show people will talk about her So, uh, that's a that's a clear strategy But it's interesting to see clay. I think sometimes how the different candidates even handle you never know somebody may get in a particularly worthwhile moment a worthwhile shot Whether on stage at a debate or just with an ad that they run Yeah, and look the the the the play here. I think I think you could put these candidates in two different camps, right? Almost everybody who has announced so far Seems to me as if they are auditioning to be in trump's cabinet or to be trump's vp Uh, because if you think about it, most people would be attacking the leader nicky haley Uh, I think we'll see what happens with tem scott vivik rama swami They've almost exclusively been going after rondesantis And so if they're going after rondesantis, it makes me feel like they're auditioning at to be a part of the trump cabinet meanwhile Chris christie would be I think buck probably the first person who would get in and actually be attacking trump himself, right? Usually you attack the leader more so than anybody else, right? But as we've seen so far Most of the attacks have actually been for the guy who in most polls is in second place, which is strange Strategically, it doesn't really add up unless you're angling to try to be a part of the trump cabinet And I I think that for desantis the pathway is is pretty clear in his mind or or the the strategy That's that's likely to be deployed here, which is going to be I I appreciated trumps endorsement. I thought he was a great president I think people who voted for him twice made a great decision at the time And I appreciate what maga has done up to this point and want to continue and implement more of what was left on the table So it's just a question of who's the right guy now? It's not about being bitter or undermining anything that was achieved by president trump in the past And it's certainly not about telling his voters that they made a mistake or that they weren't right in voting for him twice I think that is what desantis So it's not going to be deeply personal with him is is what I it's going to be about I'm talking about desantis's approach crumbs approach might be a different thing But chris christy is going to get up there and he's going to be like donald trump is a liar who lied about He's going to just that's the way he's going to get attention So I just want everyone to be prepared for this whether it's on the debate stage or just in the ads and on tv Now you can say it doesn't matter or whatever Okay, but he's going to get under trump skin that the only reason he's going to enter the race is to get under trump skin And it'll be interesting to see how that plays in the republican electorate because I think you and I both agree That there's about 25 or 30 percent Of the overall republican primary Electorate that is all in on trump no matter what right like trump is their guy their right or die trump You could say around 25 30 percent maybe it's 20 but 20 to 30 right And then I think there are about 20 to 30 percent of people who are never trumpers I really do think like they're they are convinced trump's not the guy he can't win And so then you end up let's say that's 25 percent 25 percent And then there's about 50 percent that are somewhat persuadable How exactly does all of that play out? We will discuss by the way 800 282 282 we didn't take germany calls. I want georgia and arizona only in the second hour Okay, only people from the states of georgia in arizona Do you believe that trump can win your states or based on what you have seen And based on what you hear from your friends and family. Do you think trump has unique uh challenges there in other words Is this poll accurate that disantis would win georgia and florida trump's going to be challenged and one thing that I also I do think about Is trump's focus is going to be so much on beating Desantis the only real competitor that we think he has based on the polls right now That's going to be such a focus is that is he going to take positions that are helpful or harmful In the general for those states by trying to beat ron desantis You know because remember it's not it's not the gop base that's going to be determining It's going to be you know college educated mccain voters in arizona for example It's going to be pro camp Uh, you know more moderate suburban republicans in the outs on the outskirts of atlanta, etc And georgia, right? How does the attack stuff play with them for the general, you know, we'll have to see it's a great point It's scott's dale It's uh, it's uh the marietta area surrounding sandy springs those of you who know the atlanta area Well, it's voters in those communities that are going to decide who the president is in 2024. How does that play? I only want to hear georgia arizona We cleared the decks will take some of your calls in this second hour, but fuck i believe in studio This has been a huge story about this woman who is pregnant six months Tries to get on a bicycle and gets labeled as an awful racist a nurse in new york city her million 40 million plus views of this video this week All premise under the lie that she was in the wrong when she was not"
