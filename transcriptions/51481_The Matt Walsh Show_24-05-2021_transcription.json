    "text": " Today on the Matt Wall Show, millions of children are being experimented on, abused, and mutilated, all in the name of gender ideology. The problem has reached epidemic proportions so much so that even some mainstream media outlets have started to notice shockingly. We'll talk about that today. Also, five headlines, including the mayor of Chicago announcing that she'll only accept interviews from non-white reporters. One elected politician in Washington had the courage to condemn her for this kind of bigotry and to do it specifically. And it wasn't a Republican. Also, is Prince Harry a victim of emotional abuse? We'll ask that question. And BuzzFeed reports that the White House wants to help Americans have more sex with random strangers this summer. And our daily cancellation will consider the mother on TikTok who's worried that her white male baby will grow up to be, quote, awful and has developed a plan to prevent that from happening. We'll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Wall Show. Now we're going to check in with the great courses plus. You know, I think one of the best, maybe the best measure of someone's intelligence. It's not an IQ test. It's not any kind of written test at all. I think it's just have a conversation with someone. And is this someone who can speak intelligently on a wide range of issues? Is there a depth to their thought process, that kind of thing? And it's great. If you can speak intelligently confidently about a subject, multiple subjects, I think some of that's being lost in our culture today. And that's why you need to check out the great courses plus. With the great courses plus, you'll get thousands of hours of fascinating content across hundreds of topics from, you know, everything from science to history, astronomy, whatever, whatever subject you want. Literally any subject at all, you can imagine. They've got a course for it.

So I spent the weekend driving from Tennessee to Maryland and then back again, 1500 miles give or take. It was almost long enough to make me wish that I had taken a plane instead, almost, but not quite. The good thing about the drive is that it gave me a chance to listen to and almost finish Abigail Shrier's book on how gender ideology is destroying an entire generation of children. The book titled Irreversible Damage, the transgender craze, reducing our daughters. You probably heard of it. It came out last summer and I had put off reading it partly because I'm very well informed on this issue or I thought I was and I'm cynical in general. So I didn't think the book had anything to tell me that I didn't already know or assume. I was wrong. The crisis as Shrier documents it is much worse than I thought and I already thought it was very, very bad and I've told you that many times. I had to pause the book frequently throughout just to collect myself and at certain points to stave off bouts of nausea so that I didn't start vomiting all over myself and I don't even say that as a joke. The chapter describing phalloplasty, that's when plastic surgeons use bits of a woman's body to construct an appendage that's supposed to look like a penis had an especially sickening effect on me. I won't go into details here except to give you one little morsel of information. Part of the process involves de-sleeving the forearm and that's exactly what it sounds like. They pull the skin off of a woman's arm like a sleeve and then they use it in the construction of the fake male reproductive organ only it's not a reproductive organ at all of course. You can't actually give a female a male body or a male a female body that's impossible. All you can do is take a healthy body and mutilate it. You can make a body less feminine. You can't make it male. A male body is male down to its very bones down to its cells, its DNA. The only way to turn a woman into a man would be to obliterate her body completely and build a man from scratch which which also is impossible right now but that wouldn't even be turning a woman into a man that would just be killing a woman and creating a man to take her place. But the main point of the book is not to describe sex change surgeries which have plastic surgeons basically acting like leather face from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre all the name of alleged medicine. The main point of the book is to show in painstaking detail how children, girls or the special focus of this book, are indoctrinated into gender ideology at very young ages and eager eagerly put on the path to gender transition if they show even the slightest sign that they're questioning their gender. And of course it's not hard to get a child to question their gender. Almost any child will if the idea is suggested to them early enough. That's how millions and millions of children are fed into this system. You truly can't understand the full scope of this problem until you've looked at the numbers. We are losing an entire generation to this madness and that is not an exaggeration. Gender ideology is both jammed into the kids heads by the school system, academia, Hollywood and media and every other powerful institution and also spread among the kids themselves. It's a full on social contagion unlike any that we've seen in our lifetimes. And the problem is that and I think the book does a really good job of explaining this in particular is that all of this stuff, the gender ideology has a very special appeal to kids in particular girls as they go through puberty and they endure a perfectly natural period of feeling uncomfortable in their own bodies. Kids have always felt that way in puberty after it before it. People have always felt that way at one time or another to one degree or another. But now I mean we everyone has had an experience of looking in a mirror and not being totally happy with what you see. We've all been there. But now we're given a framework for interpreting those natural feelings. And the framework tells us that if we feel not totally at home in our bodies, then we're gender dysphoric and we should embark on a quest to get a new body. As the book describes, doctors and therapists will diagnose gender dysphoria almost automatically. In many states, they're essentially obligated to legally. The so-called affirmative care standard means that counselors and therapists must affirm a patient's gender delusions. Even if the patient is a child, if a 10 year old boy comes in and says, I think I'm a girl, there's no effort to figure out why he's saying that, what lies at the at the root of it. What is he really trying to express? Where is this coming from? None of that. None. The only thing they do is say, well, okay, then you are. So you're a girl, let's talk about how to make you more into what you feel that you are. This, in spite of the fact that the goal of therapy should be quite literally the exact opposite of that. When it comes to the gender stuff, therapy, along with the medical industry generally has flipped itself on its head and performed the opposite of the function that it's supposed to perform. Now, kids are put on puberty blockers at the drop of a hat and cross sex hormones. And before long surgery, girls as young as 16, sometimes younger, are having their breasts cut off an entire biological capacity, permanently removed all in the vein hope that they can become men. And sometimes they don't even want to become men. They talk in the book about a quote, unquote doctor, I think was in Canada, has done over a thousand of these so-called top surgeries. And in some cases, the girls aren't even claiming to be gender dysphoric. They don't even say they want to be men. They identify as non-binary. They want to be neither. It's a cosmetic. It's entirely cosmetic. They approach it like another person would approach getting a tattoo. Only a 16 year old can't get a tattoo in most places, but they can get the breast chopped off. The doctors are not only performing these procedures, but recommending them and profiting off of them, of course. Now, it just so happens that after my weekend spent listening to these stories, I came home to find out that 60 minutes in a true shocker performed some actual journalism and aired an investigation this past Sunday night into this very problem. 60 minutes interviewed a number of D transitioners. Those are people who went through a medical transition to become the opposite sex, then regretted it and tried to go back. And unfortunately, depending on how far along they are in the process, they can't fully go back. Now, there are many such cases and there will be a great many more in the years ahead. Here's just one example. This is a girl named Grace who went all the way through the transition, all the way through the double mastectomy, having her breast removed before changing her mind. And here she is describing that process. Did the therapist not question you about how deep the feeling was and what it was stemming from? She didn't go really go into what my gender dysphoria might have been stemming from. We only did a few sessions. Because she was over 18 and didn't need parental consent, she says she nearly signed an informed consent form at a clinic and got hormone shots. They asked me, so why do you want to go on testosterone? And I said, well, being a woman just doesn't working for me anymore. And they said, okay. So that was that. You got your prescription for testosterone. Yep. Just four months after she started testosterone, she says she was approved for a mastectomy, what's called top surgery that she told us was traumatic. You know, I'm kind of surprised, because based on everything you've set up to now, I would have thought you'd have a great sense of relief. I started to have a really disturbing sense that like a part of my body was missing, almost a ghost limb feeling about being like, there's something that should be there and the feeling really surprised me, but it was really hard to deny. And so she detransitioned by going off testosterone and then went back to the clinic and she says, complain to the doctor that the process didn't follow the W. Path guidelines. If it sounds like the doctors and counselors she consulted seemed to have no concern for her physical well-being at all or her psychological well-being, that's because they didn't and they don't. On that note, I want to play another clip for you. This one was mentioned in Shire's book. That's how I was made aware of it. I had never seen it before. These are and I should have seen it. We should all see this and I want to make sure a lot of people see this clip. These are comments made by a woman named Dr. Johanna Olson Kennedy. She's one of the most prominent Texas chainsaw physicians sending countless young people off to get mutilated. She's also the medical director of the Center for Trans Youth Health and Development at Children's Hospital Los Angeles and she's also married to a trans man that is a woman who identifies as a man. That's where she's coming from. That's her background. Here she is at a conference in 2018 explaining why it's okay to chop the breasts off of an adolescent girl. This again is not theoretical or academic. People like this woman are actually doing this to girls, thousands of them, or referring them to surgeons who will do it. Here is her justification. I want you to listen very carefully to this. I'm just going to say this. Actually people get married when they're under 20. Actually people choose colleges to go to. Actually people make life altering decisions in adolescents all the time. All the time. And honestly most of them are good. It's just the bad ones that we talked about. Oh my god the sentiment challenge right. I mean why do we know about it? Because it's a thing and it's not it's not common. Like most teenagers aren't eating cinnamon right. But some are on YouTube and that's stupid. But we don't put on YouTube the things that are really good decisions right. Oh my gosh my kid took the SATs. Not a very exciting after school special right. But so what we do know is that adolescents actually have the capacity to make a reasonable decision. And here's the other thing in our chest circle. If you want breasts at a later point in your life you can go and get them. The first thing to understand is that the woman there is evil. We're talking about Nazi scientist evil. We're talking about abortionist evil. Now she may sound like a lunatic in that clip but she isn't. That'd be let her off the hook. Lunatics don't get medical degrees. Bad people can get medical degrees and unfortunately a lot of them have but not lunatics. If you're crazy delusional you're not going to get through medical school. But you could be a bad evil person and make it through medical school and she's a bad evil person. What's her argument here? Well she says first of all adolescents can make good decisions. In fact she says most decisions adolescents make are good. They make life altering decisions all the time she observes which somehow means that it's good for them to make those decisions and we should help them to make more such decisions. Ironically the one example she gives of an adolescent making a good decision is taking the SATs but that's not a decision that kids make. Parents make that decision. Adults make it. Kids go along with it. Indeed it turns out most of the good the actual good long-term decisions quote unquote adolescents make are the ones that adults tell them to make. Kids need adults to help them think more clearly when it comes to long-term choices. Long-term planning and this is another thing that a doctor knows. If I know what a doctor knows it a long-term planning is a function of the prefrontal cortex and teenagers do not have a fully developed prefrontal cortex which is why they do dumb things all the time which is why almost all of us if we survived our teenage years should be thanking God that we did because there's a really good chance that we you know you're the only one to take one or two things to go wrong of all the dumb things we did all the dumb destructive reckless things and I can look back at my teenage years and think of plenty of those. Why were you doing that? You look back to being a teenager and you think about some of the things that you did. Some of the things you said the way you acted and you think that was like what was I was I what was I it's like a different person I even know who that person was was because your brain wasn't fully functioning the way that it is now they literally can't make good long-term decisions at least not reliably they don't have the neurological hardware in place just yet. This is also why we say adolescents can't consent to sex our laws against child rape and pedophilia are all based entirely on the idea that young children cannot make sexual decisions for themselves. Dr. Johanna wants to undermine the legal scientific and philosophical case against pedophilia and that is not a coincidence by the way check back in 10 years or maybe sooner and she'll be explaining in one of these videos with equal passion why we must be tolerant towards an accepting of adult child sexual relationships. Quote me on it 10 years from now maybe sooner but even if she personally never gets to that point what she's already advocating for is just as bad a child who's put on hormones and then who has their body mutilated is being sexually violated in a way that is just as depraved and damaging as molestation or rape all of these kids are sexual abuse victims and their abusers are people like the doctor here she's like a pedophile that's how she should be treated and seen. Somehow though we haven't even gotten to the most arranged part of that short clip. She also says flippantly practically laughing as she says it that you could chop a young girl's breasts off and it's no big deal because she can always go and get new breasts later if she wants. This is what this doctor thinks of the female body. She thinks of it like a lego playset or a potato head doll. You could take parts off attach reattach mix and match a body is nothing but a pile of parts cut a few off swap them out. Nothing will be lost in the exchange. It's obviously not true. I would hope I don't need to explain that it's not true. Your body is a whole coherent complete thing. It's not perfect. Nobody's body is perfect. No person is perfect but it is your body. And yet you should love your body because it's the only one you have. You can never have another one. This is what any therapist or counselor worth their salt would be saying and there are very few of them out there that are worth their salt by the way. I mean we're at the point where it's like I wouldn't even send my kid to a counselor or a therapist period. I wouldn't send them because I don't trust hardly any of these people given what they're saying. That's a different subject. But your body is your body. You will never have another one. A woman cannot have her breasts removed and then go and get new ones. You can't. Her new breasts will not be breasts but they'll be mounds of flesh, lumps of meat. Now perhaps that's all that Dr. Johanna thinks breasts are to begin with. That's all she sees and perhaps that's understandable as her brain seems to be nothing but a lump of meat. Even so she's wrong. And you know something she knows she's wrong. All of the doctors and therapists and counselors treating kids like Frankenstein's monster, they all know what they're doing. I mean when you feel like you're the one going crazy because you see stuff like this and you think what is happening? How can these people not see how insane this is? Well they do see it but they're motivated by ideological conviction, politics and most of all money. There's a lot of money to be made and social clout to be gained by doing what they're doing. Especially when most of the public is too afraid to speak up against too afraid to say no this is wrong. A boy cannot be a girl. A girl cannot be a boy. This is all wrong. Most people are too afraid to say even that except in hushed tones or privately they'll send a message. Hey I agree with everything you're saying. Don't tell anybody. We cannot afford to be quiet about this anymore. This is one of the great fights of our time. It may be the greatest. Either we can sit back and watch while millions of kids are experimented on and abused and tortured and destroyed and literally cut into pieces in front of us or we can speak up and resist and do what needs to be done. That's our choice. Now let's get to our five headlines. You know some people are chair snobs like me. I have very specific demands for chairs.

Okay so another note for my drive by the way lighter note a little bit lighter anyway although still in the subject of perhaps medical-induced mania I was it's actually the first time I've seen this and we're a year into this thing first time I've seen what I saw in Virginia stopping at a penera bread which was my first mistake I admit why go to a penera bread you know penera bread it gets away with positioning itself as sort of a a higher class option from regular fast food because they charge five times the prices so you figure well you're getting a chicken salad sandwich for $27 it must be pretty good but actually it's not really that good or you know they sell soup in bread bowls which by the way that's you want to know why we have an obesity epidemic in this country it's because people are like you're eating soup and you're thinking to yourself this is great but I really wish I could eat the bowl too and then penera bread is there to solve the problem anyway why don't you put an air bread and uh there were everybody in there wearing masks except me and multiple tables of people sitting at their table food in front of them wearing masks I I had not seen that yet somehow there are people getting crazier as time goes on as the as the pandemic is recedes and most of the country is immune for for one reason or another either vaccine or prior exposure there are people that are getting more serious about it I would just sit there watching I was waiting for my food I was waiting for my $57 order and I'm watching people sitting at their tables with masks on and I never saw any of those people take a bite because that's what I was waiting to see how does this work are you actually are you going to try to eat that thing with the mask on I really wanted to see but um anyway all right let's go number one here nbc chicago reports as chicago mayor lori lori lightfoot approaches the two-year anniversary of her inauguration reaching the halfway point through her first term she told the city's media outlets that she would grant one-on-one interviews to mark the occasion but with one condition she will only speak with journalists of color lightfoot tweeted wednesday morning I ran to break up the status I ran to break up the status quo that was failing so many that is in just in city hall it's a shame that in 2021 the city hall press corps overwhelmingly white in a city where there were more than half of the city identifies as black latino aapi or native american what is a api is that pacific islander anyway i'm not going to guess um diversity and inclusion is imperative across all institutions including media in order to progress we must change this is exactly why i'm being intentional about prioritizing media requests from poc reporters on the occasion of the two-year anniversary of my inauguration as mayor of this great city so you know first of all it's great that this is her priority as it's just blood shed in the streets of chicago people kids women being shot and killed as they walk down the street um so that's happening you know morgues overflowing with bodies not because of covid but because of the violence and the you know the the gang culture in the city she's not worried about that she's worried about making sure there are more black people reporters that's that are that are at the press conferences and in her responses and let's be clear also when she's saying oh i i only want to have interviews with black latino aapi whatever that is or native american what she's really saying is i don't want to be interviewed by any white people so sometimes they get away with this kind of thing because they they sort of try to frame it in a positive way they say oh no we're we're uh just giving opportunities to these uh to these groups over here but what you're really saying is you don't want white people to interview you because you only singled out one there's only one group you left out you put every other group in it's kind of like when you are in third grade and you invite everyone in the class to your birthday party except for one kid and of course those of us with good parents we were raised and told listen you can invite the whole class or you can invite one or two kids what you can't do is invite most of the kids except except one that you can't do but uh lori life what we can assume for many reasons uh was not was not raised well um and so this is flat out bigotry and racism against white people it is anti-white racism and that's what we we should name it and call it that because that's what it is now there may have been some republicans sure if i check there are some republicans who complained about lightfoot saying this maybe tweeted about it i'm not sure i'll assume that some republicans did uh maybe even called it racism but there was one elected representative on the national stage only one that i'm aware of that went so far as to say this this is Tulsi gabbard who i should remind you is not a republican she's a democrat and this is what she tweeted mayor lightfoot's blatant anti-white racism is abhorrents i call upon president biden kamela harris and other leaders of our country of all races to join me in calling for mayor lightfoot's resignation our leaders must condemn all racism including anti-white white calling calling it not just racism anti-white racism and then saying that lightfoot should resign now i love this statement from Tulsi gabbard she's exactly 100 right um what i don't love is that she's the only one saying that and she's a democrat what what a shame what an absolute shaming well-deserved shaming of the republican party that this is not coming from any republican it's coming from a democrat and the thing is as a democrat saying this you you know Tulsi this takes courage i actually have respect she might be that she's the one democrat one elected democrat i can think of well i have respect for um even though i still i still don't agree with many of your views but this actually takes courage because all of your colleagues in democrat party your base you know everyone that you that you need to support you and everything they're all going to be against you for this because that's that's taboo you don't talk about anti-white racism in fact anti-white racism according to them doesn't exist but republicans they would risk nothing by calling it out yeah the left's gonna be mad at you the democrats gonna be mad at you but they'll be mad no matter what um and most conservatives no matter their race black white doesn't matter our art would be perfectly happy for you to call out anti-white racism because that's what it is and it doesn't matter if you're a republican who cares what the democrats say they have no doesn't make a difference they're gonna hate you no matter what you don't need them to like you and they won't no matter what you say so you've literally nothing to lose you might as well speak up but these cowards they can't even endure they're gonna get some frowny faces in the halls of congress when they're walking by the democrats and they can't even that even that they can't endure it's also you ever put a lot more than that on the line but we need to be very clear about this as conservatives you know if that is how you identify I think we need to be very clear it's not enough to just blanket blanket statement condemn racism in response to something like this we need to call it what it is it is anti-white racism anti-white racism exists there's a whole lot of it in fact it's the only form of racism in america that's socially acceptable and it's one of the only forms of racism that's also institutional and systemic arguably another form of being anti-asian bigotry which through a through affirmative action you know that is very real as well and systemic and yeah calling her for her to resign the same way i don't need i don't need to point this out but i will just if you can imagine a white mayor saying that he only wants to be interviewed by his fellow white people he'd be a right i think he'd be arrested i think they would send the i think the fbi would be knocking on his door and they'd arrest him for they'd find something they they would they would arrest him for felony rudeness i guarantee it hate crime charges you know you know i'm not you know i'm right this is not i wish it was like a joke or an exaggeration but hyperbole it's not they would call that a hate crime but lightfoot can say it and you know no problem all right let's uh go here now see a little bit of a news from cnn or news uh news about cnn we're not going to get news from cnn but there's some news about them and we'll start here we heard something similar to this on the last show that was from a democratic representative and this is uh another democratic representative named don lemon extolling the virtues of the democrat party let's listen to that how do you how does that correct if you only have you know a fraction of whatever the political spectrum dealing with this issue well right now the person who's in the white house is a democrat the people who are in charge of congress are democrats the people who are in the majority slightly in the senate are democrats the only party now that is operating in reality is the democratic party the republican party is obsolete okay actually the last part of that i agree with the republic republican party is obsolete there's no denying that it is obsolete and it's made itself obsolete largely by the cowardice we were just talking about a second ago um and that and that we should also note is don lemon all want to be clear that's don lemon host of don lemon tonight as opposed to don lemon host of tonight with don lemon but i think that was that was the show he had a you know up until a week ago and then they made a big announcement that he was resigning from the show or something it was this big deal um and then he comes back the next day and says yes we have ended tonight with don lemon we start a new chapter this is don lemon tonight um and it's it seems like the old don the old don lemon much like the new don lemon and uh or new don lemon like the old don lemon don lemon however you want to put it but he says the democrat party only one living in reality same thing we heard from the democrat i think it was tim ryan last week saying the same thing there's only one republican there's only one party living in reality it's the democrats well i guess i would ask don the same question i asked tim which is okay living in reality over there uh can you get pregnant first of all in your reality the girl grace the clip we played um regretting her transition you know a girl like that take a 16-year-old girl chopper breast soft can you make her into a boy i mean you're in reality stuff the kind of reality we're talking about yeah i think it is and then we've got chris quomo at the center of controversy because it was found out that he was advising his brother on how to deal with the sex harassment scandal even while claiming on air that he wasn't getting involved or anything and then it came out that he's been advising and uh and he actually apologized for that and here's his apology the people can say and write what they want but i want you to know the truth how i helped my brother also matters when my brother's situation became turbulent being looped into calls with other friends of his and advisors that did include some of his staff i understand why that was a problem for cnn it will not happen again it was a mistake because i put my colleagues here who i believe are the best in the business in a bad spot i never intended for that i would never intend for that and i am sorry for that it's also important for you to understand not only do i not cover this here i've never tried to influence this network's coverage of my brother in fact i've been walled off from it this is a unique and difficult situation and that's okay i know where the line is i can respect it and still be there for my family which i must i have to do that i love my brother i love my family i love my job and i love and respect my colleagues here at cnn and again to them i am truly sorry you know who i am you know what i'm about and i want this to be said in public to you who give me the opportunity and to my colleagues who make me better at what i do okay uh very teary moment they're very emotional i was getting choked up a little bit i don't know about you but his colleagues are the best in the business which you know maybe they are it's it's such a low bar that sure why not but here's the thing i i don't care about this at all really i'm not even sure why i played that i was trying to remember while i was playing that i was thinking to myself why am i playing this did i have something to say about this because i don't remember what it what it was supposed to be um but even if i don't care about it uh for me like i don't care he wants to call himself a journalist that's that's laughable that's a joke but as i said the bar is so low for journalism now that sure anyone can be one if they want to be but i don't care he he doesn't want to talk about his brother's sexual harassment scandal um it's fine that's fine he's talking to his brother advising him i don't care about that either yeah it's your brother so i understand your loyalty your family i i don't really have an issue with that the problem that that's not really the problem that's not the actual scandal because there is a scandal here um the scandal is during the height of all this back in in march in april cnn was bringing andrew quammo onto chris quammo's show on an almost nightly basis certainly at least weekly basis and they were doing these little buddy cop comedy routines which is inappropriate enough given the circumstances of all these people dying but also there was no attempt to be an objective journalist they were they were handing over their airtime for propaganda pieces between this politician and his little brother and then it turns out that this politician is wrapped up in a scandal that resulted in thousands of elderly people dying so in terms of the journalism scandal that's it but as far as him not wanting to talk about it now and who cares if he invite of course he'd i would assume he's probably on the phone with his brother who cares about that that's not the issue all right let's go this is from page six it says megan markel didn't act on suicidal impulses while pregnant with her son because she didn't want prince harry to be hurt by the loss of quote another woman in his life the duke of sussex told oper winfrey in the documentary series that premiered friday so oper's doing another interview with these people great uh he said in a conversation with winfrey in the uh the me you can't see a new apple tv plus series on mental health he said the thing that stopped her from seeing it through was how unfair it would be on me after everything that happened to my mom and to uh that's british for mom and to now be put in a position of losing another woman my life with a baby inside of her our baby um the prince told winfrey this scariest thing for her was her clarity of thought she hadn't lost it she wasn't crazy she wasn't self-medicating be it through pills or through alcohol she was absolutely sober sober she was completely sane uh yet in the quiet of the night these thoughts woke her up harry said he did not go to his family when markel felt suicidal because he was ashamed the situation had got that bad uh he also said the royals would likely not be able to help okay so mega-markel we already knew that she was petty vindictive self-absorbed all of that a lot a lot of flaws shared by uh by famous celebrities and so on so no surprise there but then you read stories like this and you realize that if you didn't already realize oh she was just this is a really this is evil this is a really really bad person you're she's pregnant with harry's son and threatening to kill herself this is emotional manipulation this is emotional abuse um and and if if the genders were reversed everybody would be saying that can can you imagine for a second mega-markel sitting down and saying that uh harry was threatening to kill herself kill himself if if she didn't do this or that thing that he wanted everyone would be saying this is a you need to get out of that marriage this is this is you're being emotionally manipulated and abused in in horrible ways is that as horrible you're threatening to kill yourself with you while while pregnant um yeah that would be that's that's my interpretation of it of course i wasn't there but you know what here's the other thing because i know we're we're also told that we're in no place to judge how dare we you know maybe she really was going through a psychological crisis of some kind um and and it's we should we should butt out but they are taking their personal life and putting it out into the public they are choosing the public sides they don't have to nobody would know anything about the suicidal stuff unless they told us and they don't have to tell us this not only are they telling us they're getting paid to tell us that they are in the process right now of monetizing their personal story and their their alleged personal trauma and victimization they're monetizing that they're turning it into their to a media empire into a franchise like a marvel movie so they are putting it out there in public and when you do that then yeah the rest of us we have every right to give our opinion and to try to into you know and if we want to speculate we can speculate if you don't want people speculating about it's like i always say if you don't want people speculating or giving their opinions about your personal life that keep it to yourself the moment you put it out there for the entire public as as as content for them to consume you're the one who's turned it into that that's your fault and so i feel perfectly within my rights uh ethically and certainly legally at least for now to say that to me um that doesn't sound so much like a mentally ill woman as it sounds like a woman emotionally and psychologically abusing her husband and as i said reverse the the the sex is here and that's how everybody would interpret it but it's that is it's horrific stuff it really is all right uh do we have time for this i think now we're probably going to save this for tomorrow because buzzfeed has a story about the white house uh that wants to encourage people to go out and have sex this summer randomly with strangers and of course buzzfeed's a big big big fan of that and you know if you get vaccinated then you can go and do that because apparently uh the only disease you have to worry about when having random strikes with sex with strangers is covid as long as you're vaccinated you don't have to worry about anything else we'll save that for tomorrow there may be a longer conversation if you had let's move to um reading the youtube comments this is from Richard Parker he says being a drag queen who twerks at nightclubs is officially a more respected profession than being a cop who puts his life on the line to fight crime morality is bankrupt in 2021 that's a good way of putting things in perspective and uh you're exactly right george an says this drag queen stuff is disgusting and degrading exactly what are they attempting to teach children how to be a drag queen it is this what their goal in life should be keep up the good work mat we need you yeah they want to teach kids to be drag queens uh but that's more of a of a of a pleasant side effect as far as they're concerned the main thing is to just sexualize children to desensitize them to this kind of thing um that's that's the main goal uh to to destroy within the children any nation uh semblance of of quote unquote traditional morality or anything like that that's what it is it's an attack on what they consider to be old-fashioned outmoded morality this is this is one avenue through which that attack is waged uh and uh another comment says I want a little old lady with a chain on her glasses reading my stories exactly that's that's one of the less discussed aspects of the drag queen story hour we're taking jobs away from librarians and they they when I was a kid they did a perfectly fine job of reading stories um deplorable neanderthal says matt the daily wire should do a back stage special for the ufo report to congress i promise i'll watch with baited breath and you'll hit a billion views guaranteed a billion maybe because the aliens themselves will tune in i don't know i think that'd be great i will suggest that i'll run that up the uh the flagpole to see what happens i will say that and this is a i think a serious more serious conversation that we should be having nationwide because anti ufo bigotry is uh is a big problem in the workplace and it's a big problem in this workplace here at the daily wire and i don't mean to hear dirty laundry like megan and harry here but it's it's a problem here um and i would even say those of us who are pro ufo we are made to feel unsafe i mean i feel unsafe sometimes when i hear someone like michael knolls coming out against ufo's and saying that it's basically impossible that there's intelligent life in the universe i feel unsafe when i hear that this is really a conversation for hr i guess um let's see kaya says safe travels to you and your family on your vacation try to enjoy also this episode's cancellation literally made me simp but laugh out loud for kyle i mean the kid must have not known what he was lurking into so naively pity rest in pieces kyle uh and to that i commandeer the expression godspeed i think it used i i don't think you use simp correctly there i think what you're trying to say is you you were sympathetic for kyle because i in our back and forth you thought i had the better of the the exchange i don't think that's i don't know exactly what simp means but i don't think that's it so i just i'm for your own benefit don't go around saying that you simp for people if you're sympathetic for them i don't think that's what it means and uh finally this is from pig marine great name says the bathwater comment is about bell daphne who took bath and sold the bathwater under the name gamer girl bathwater i believe she sold a few batches and the batches sold out in less than a day okay so there's someone online who's who took a bath and then sold her bathwater and it sold out what what what do you do with it i mean the

hear from you let's get out to our daily cancellation so today for our daily cancellation we return to my favorite source for cancellation's tiktok now there are some who say that i spend too much time responding to content on tiktok because tiktok is frivolous and irrelevant and stupid and everyone knows it allegedly but this just goes to show once again why conservatives themselves are increasingly irrelevant in the culture we tend to think that because something seems stupid to us unimportant to us a silly distraction to us that it must seem that way to everyone else but that's not the case the fact is whether you like it or not and i most decidedly do not like it tiktok is one of the places where millions of people especially kids go to get information and have their own views affirmed for that reason it matters even more than mainstream media i mean i should spend more time on this show responding to tiktok than whatever they're saying on cnn or mbc because tiktok and platforms like it move the culture and influence people much more than does say don lemme so with that preamble out of the way a recent viral video must now be brought under consideration here's a young woman by the name of sarah she made a video to tell the world about the books that she'll be reading her very young son bennett she's being applauded for this and i am being mostly condemned for having criticized her but you can make up your own mind let's watch the video first hi there my name is sarah this little cutie is my son bennett as you can see my son is a white male so here are some books that i bought to help prevent him from growing up to be awful starting out strong we have c is for consent um pretty self-explanatory but it's a picture book that goes into detail about consent with your body with family along that same note we have will ladybug hug teaches the same kind of concept in a more childish way about a ladybug who is hugging his friends even has one friend who doesn't like hugging so this one is called only for me all same concept teaching kids about consent and things that feel comfortable with their body because i'm raising a feminist we've got a is for awesome 23 inspirational women next we have i clean like daddy there's even a page in the end where the whole family is cleaning together to show that it's not just mom and sister's job finally we have except when they don't a book about um boys and girls liking whatever they want regardless of their gender okay so we have two major issues here one is the book themselves the books themselves and the other is the stated reason for reading the book so let's go with the latter first sarah informs us that her son is a white male which in some ways perhaps is progress at least she didn't tell us that her son is a white female or a non-binary pansexual kangaroo or something she does at this point have a fundamental understanding of biology it seems and realizes that her son is indeed male um that's good the only hang up is that she seems to have a lot of suspicion and resentment even towards her son for being male now you forever for whatever reason you don't immediately understand why the phrase my son is a white male so i have to prevent him from being awful is a problem imagine the same thing but directed at a different kind of baby imagine a mother with a black male child saying as you can see my son is a black male so here are a bunch of books i bought so that he doesn't grow up to be awful or perhaps even better a father imagine a father pointing the camera towards her his six-month-old daughter and saying as you can see my daughter is a female so here are a bunch of books i bought to prevent her from being a shrill overbearing harpy would there be anything to discuss in either scenario no everyone everywhere would unequivocally condemn that sort of attitude only where pretends pertains to white males do we suddenly want to make an exception which proves not that sarah isn't bigoted but that she's far from alone in her bigotry of course there's nothing wrong with parents endeavoring to make sure that their children grow up to be good people as opposed to awful people every parent on the planet has looked to awful adults at some point and said my god i need to make sure my kids don't turn into that i have thoughts along those lines every day of my life i thought up in their bread watching the people eating their bread bowls with masks on at the table and i thought i might i hope my kid whatever happens with my kid i hope they never turn into that the problem is when your concerns are specifically racial and gendered as though you're worried that they'll be awful because of their identity it's one thing to acknowledge the fallen state of the human race in our propensity for evil it's another to imagine that your own child is especially susceptible to it based on their identity that's called bigotry and yes to be bigoted against your own flesh and blood is deranged beyond all imagining it's the type of thought process that has been made possible by the critical race theory cult but one of the most basic strategies of any cult is to turn its members against their own families now usually this involves turning children against parents and crt does that too but the even more demented thing is to turn parents against children and then what about the books themselves even many of the people criticizing this video have still allowed that the books are fine in and of themselves it's just the framing that's the problem but i disagree the books are a problem too first of all she has three books on consent three of them but she'll begin reading to her child from infancy and remember she's not reading the books in order to protect him from being the victim of non-consensual touching no this is all about stopping stopping him from sexually assaulting other people this is a woman so worried that her son will be a rapist that she started him on an anti-rapist curriculum from infancy she might as well read him a book called we eat dinner with people not people for dinner in order to teach him how to not be a cannibal i mean she has imagined that her son is at a very high risk of being an absolute monster not just a bad person but a monster and now she'll spend most of her maternal energy steering him away from what she believes is a near inevitability all you're really doing at best is creating an issue where it didn't exist and introducing concepts where before there was but childish innocence and ignorance by the way in spite of the feminist insistence that we need to teach our sons not to rape and they say that all the time right the truth is no you shouldn't need to specifically teach that i don't know about you there was never a time in my life when my parents sat me down and said now son don't be a rapist any more than they than they ever sat me down and said now son don't be an axe murderer they never said either of those things and yet i i became neither an axe murderer nor a rapist why well because they inculcated in me a more complete value system they taught me to respect the dignity and value of other human beings as well as my own and they instilled virtue as well as they could anyway while warning against sin and vice and so on when you do that with your children they they will not grow up to be perfect people but they will develop a moral code and a system of values that will direct them away from things like rape and murder and hopefully it'll do a lot more than that it turns out you should aim a lot higher than just don't be a rapist don't be awful and when you aim higher when you aim for actual virtue the don't be awful and don't be a rapist lesson is baked into the cake you don't even need to say it or focus on it especially not when the kid is still in diapers you damn fruitcake as for the other two books or other three um there was one telling the boy that he should help clean around the house and then there was another telling him that he can play with whatever toys he wants regardless of gender those could be okay in and of themselves depending on the specifics i haven't read the book so i don't know but this this mother is not reading those books in order to open up possibilities and to allow the child to express himself she has rather a very specific and rigid idea of the sort of boy she wants him to be she's already labeled him he's a feminist six months old he's already a feminist she's decided that from birth so although she says oh kids can like whatever they want they can do whatever they want in reality she has made a box for him and she will fit him into it one way or another now of course we all make boxes as parents for our kids we all have ideas of uh about the sorts of people we want them to be um that's what instilling values is all about but the difference is that progressive parents quote unquote have an even narrower and more constricting box all while pretending that there's no box at all and that's the real problem and that's why they are all canceled today along with Sarah but not her poor child who is certainly not canceled and is going to need all the help he can get and i i fear for him and so many other kids and we will leave it on that uh wonderful note today have a great day god bless godspeed well if you
