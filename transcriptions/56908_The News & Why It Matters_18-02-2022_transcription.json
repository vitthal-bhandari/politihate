    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Today, the Freedom Convoy protest organizers arrested in Ottawa and a dude swimmer destroys the women because he can't compete with his own kind. We've got all that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Happy Friday. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and I hope that you're watching this on YouTube. My producer just told me in my ear after that intro that we were going to get the video pulled for sure off of YouTube. But you know what? I got to report the truth either way. I don't give a crap. No, it's not going to be a pool, Sarah. Listen, I know I have to cut you off. Don't even give it. It's not going to be a pool because Leah Thomas is the greatest athlete of all time. She is the Jackie Robinson. No, they're serious. I didn't come back to your body. Let me tell you why she's a better athlete than Jackie Robinson. Can I Alex Steinhose of conspiracy, Kat Von Sjakoblyens? Where's the sheet? She is the best athlete of all time. Because sports integrated way earlier than it got treated. You know what I want to do on the show real quick? Pull the men's record. Pull the men's record. Show this new record that she met. That she meant it. Okay. And then you go, oh, that's right. Wouldn't even make it onto the podium. Yes. Thank you for having us on the show. Yeah. Hi. What we have to do is off to do this for the situation, guys. YouTube is crazy. So I'm defending Leah Thomas. I just want to YouTube. If you're listening, Leah Thomas is the greatest athlete of all time. We're so grateful for her. And that is what a cop out looks like right there. That's a cop out statement. That's for the censors. That's for the technocrats. I don't care about the technocrats. No, okay. So really, let's talk about this then. We'll get to Canada. But let's talk about this now that it is a front and center of our show. The transgender female, again, I get like, you get hate mail, whatever you say. So born a dude identifies as a woman. I just like to say shim because it covers like all of the bases. But Leah Thomas has, of course, destroyed the competition at the Ivy League championships, winning the 500 free by more than seven seconds. Here's the tweet from Penn Swimming and Diving This Is Penn State. Leah Thomas is the Ivy League champion in the 500 free her time of four minutes, 37 seconds, and 32 milliseconds is a new poll record. Catherine Berker finishes in second, which really actually technically should be first, I believe, because Catherine over there is the one who is an actual female. The other one is just pretend. Oh, darn it. Malice, did I? No, she's not pretend as she's been she's had gender reassignment medicine, hormone blockers. That's what they take. They take for 30. Okay. But listen, this is what happens with Leah Thomas. This is why it's really bad. This is like a little bit of Luprin. Yeah, the same drug that they give to men with prostate cancer. Okay, but sterilize them. But on this, on a serious note, this is why it's bad because Catherine does get second place. And we know that Leah Thomas, even though is taking 36 months of gender reassignment medicine that puts your testosterone levels at, I guess, whatever level that dictates her to be a female, it just stinks for the person that gets second place. That's why it's so good. This was my award. This was my award. And scholarship and producers can help me out real quick. What was that time? Give me that time real quick. It was. Can we pull that? Yeah, pull that back up. I just want to give the audience. All right. All right. All right. Leah Thomas breaks, shatters the Ivy League record with seven seconds from 434 to 437. Let me show you the men's record. This is why Leah wants to swim against the women. Here's the men's record from the same meet. Four minutes, 18 seconds. She hasn't even made the turn on the last lap and the men done. That's why he is swimming as a she against the women because you wouldn't even be on the podium. So, okay, so you bring up a great point because and I tweeted this out earlier, but I just can't wrap my brain around it. If we keep hearing that trans people don't have rights, which I would love to know what rights they don't have, and no one really can explain that to me, but if it is in fact that they are fighting for equal rights, so they say, why wouldn't they just want their own league? They want that. You want 100%. I mean, you can't help but think if that's really what you wanted, you would want your own league. If that's not what you want and you actually really do want to erase and replace women, then you're gunning for them, which is what we see happening. Absolutely. Well, listen, I mean, I talk about this all the time. It's kind of like there is a transgender agenda, whether you want to put on your tin foil hat or not. It's like, you look at in the Olympics this year, they had Laurel Hardy, who was another transgender Olympic. So, basically, even if you ask the gay community, the amount of people that have actually had the gender reassignment surgery now in the 2020s compared to the 90s and 80s and 70s, is up literally like a million percent or something. So, there is some sort of subconscious drive that is encouraging young people at a young age to say, hey, you know, you're gender fluid. You don't even have a gender. So, it's like, we've really, people that trust the science the most, the science is going to save us, are the people that deny the biological science and people's sex. So, that's like the upside down. In the kids, Hakko, you know, are the biggest ones in the easiest to manipulate. Yeah, we used to deal too. The irony is the very community says, look, we're about inclusion and we're about opportunity is literally stripping women from opportunity. 100%. Yeah. It's literally putting women down. Create your own league and let's have three world records. And then if you want to decide that the three champions have a swim off, the guys are going to win again. Right. Right. Right. Right. Okay. But have your own league. Yeah, because you can't, because you can't say that it's discriminatory to not allow them in because it's for the same reason that women are not racing with men. Right. I mean, you've already got those subsets. So, why wouldn't you want your own? Right. Well, and you know, this is all you have to do. It's an anti female. I'm telling you, I'm sorry, guys, but the second you don't hear often, it's easy to be a man. A woman, it's easy to be a man. You hear, it's easy to be a woman. It's a boy. It's a rain. Yeah. I don't know. It's true. Yeah. They do. They do say that all the time. It's hard to be a woman and a man, but we'll go this regardless. It's impossible for a guy to be a. I say that. Oh, yeah. Not that they can show me. You're a uterus. No, no, I'm just pushing baby out of here. Every day. You push a baby out of you. Yeah. Logically, I'm saying, I'm saying, but this is, this is the point I want to make though is this is how we know Leah Thomas is bad. If you ask her teammates, her teammates hate it. And that's what this sport is about. Sport is about your teammates. So like if you alienate the people that you're supposed to have your back the most, then in my opinion, you're doing something wrong. You know, it's kind of like the team diva. And that is what Leah Thomas has done. She's like the diva wide receiver, even though it's swimming, she's getting all the attention and all of her teammates are getting second place that earned it. But a scholarship to, you know, difficult that is because you know, by schools like Vanderbilt, only as a women's track team, not a men track team because they get so many scholarship per sport, so many sports. So these Ivy League schools, it's really hard to get those scholarships. If there's a full right scholarship for a swimmer, there's only so much, so many of them on the team. And now all of a sudden it's going to Leah. It's not just the metal and event. It's a, it's a life course. It's the great swimmer that swam through high school that it swimmers invest time. They're in the pool five o'clock in the morning. They put five hours a day in the water. Now, let's say they're sorry, you didn't get your scholarship because she man over there decided to swim on this team. Give the people their own league. I have to believe, I have to believe too that it wouldn't be hard for her to alienate herself from her teammates because I just feel like just by way of her being on the team, I say her. I got it. It's a he. All right. But you know, just by way of him being on the team, it's like, I mean, look at this. If I'm there and I'm as Yaku said, waking up at five a.m. every morning to try to be my best and practice for this competition. And then I have some dude showing up who wants to show us all up. Like I'm pissed. It gets worse, Sarah. Did you know, there's reports that other other teammates complain that Leah would change in front of them. And still Leah still has her male gender. This male genitalia. This is a fact Google it right now. Leah Thomas teammates complain. That's what I think. I think that's a little in the locker room, it's weird. You're supposed to be naked. It's kind of a weird dynamic, but for you to be a different sex that makes the dynamic already weird and odd. Like the locker room's already kind of awkward. The rape cases where where institutions that allow this to happen, particularly child rape on child rape and Leah Thomas is still attracted to women, I believe. Yes. Yes. I believe Leah Thomas is a lesbian. Yes. He is. He is to attract a two women. So she's getting naked in her locker room with the women that that she's attracted to. It makes sense. And you know what? You know, it makes emotions out of me. I'm sorry America. I believe red white and blue, but I have royally and you know, I don't cost, but I am royally pissed. Okay, that we are tolerating this crap, man. We are decorating a whole culture of women where they have no there. You matter as well, just not matter because we can just flip flip. Hey, okay, so we have a hot girl walks in there, naked Leah goes, hey, this is a prospect. Well, she does. That's an opportunity. She's a lesbian with a penis. So she doesn't she gets to get to be normal. We used to have straight jackets for this kind of stuff. Yeah, it will. And loony bins. We used to. Well, how could you know in the 60s, I believe you'd have to get like a doctor's permission to get a facial tattoo. And now every kid in the world has a facial tattoo. Don't you love how he calls me, Hocko, how he makes me Spanish. What I'm Spanish. I'm Spanish. This this is not Hocko. It's yacko. From Hocko. I always say Hocko. I guess it's yacko. Excuse me. I'm Spanish. You still have illegal immigrants coming over. Right. Yacko. I say, I am from south of the border. Just way. You're way south of the border. Well, the only place I've ever been in Costa Rica, you said Hocko has lost its wheels. No, this isn't your side. No, no, no. Okay. Okay. Docko. Excuse me. I know. I don't care. I don't care. I don't mind. If I like it already, it's good for the entertainment. Already, this is the debate show. It's the Hocko, it's a yacko in prime time 99 debate and Sarah has to make sure we don't kill each other because I'm probably a Thomas. I think that she has a fine cheese lesbian with a penis. As a matter of fact, I think we need more lesbians with penises. And Hocko wants less lesbians with penis. No. Hocko. Yacko. Hocko. Absolutely. Less lesbians with penises. Okay. I prefer my penises to be on men. Yeah. Does that make me old fashion? One man. I want to fight for my dude. I'm a fight for Stephen. Stephen, you're like no other buddy. One man. One woman. By God. Yes. I just, you know, it makes me feel like such a funny duddy to say I just, I would, I just think penises belong to men. That's just controversial. Controversial. Controversial these days. All about it. All about it. Just because. It's controversial these days. All right. So before we, before we go to break, I do want to get your thoughts on previously in the week we discussed the transition closet that was happening in an Oakland school district. So Alex, if you missed this, this was, it's, it's basically, it's for children who identify as a different gender, but they don't want to tell their parents. So they go to school and the school has a transition closet for them. So they walk into the closet and they can change from their clothes that they wore to school. So it doesn't, they don't alert their parents to the fact that they are identifying as a different gender. And of course, the teachers don't tell the parents because they're in on it. And so this is what we are faced with. I just feel like I'm like, how is this still happening when they saw what happened in Virginia, when we just saw what happened in San Francisco in deep blue San Francisco, the school board, they recalled three of their members by overwhelming. I mean, it was like 70% was like the lowest percentage. So overwhelming margins. How, like, how, when are they going, are they going to get a clue? I don't think so. I mean, I think that they kind of want their kids to, it's a, it's a perfect example. They have the transition closet, but now they're getting legislation where a 13 year olds can get vaccinated without parent consent. So it's like they want to make a kid, they want to take away the parents control of a kid and make the school in control. So at school, it's okay to transition. Oh, you have to lie to your parents, but here you can be yourself. Oh, you know, your parents might not want you to get the vaccine, but oh, just come over here with your teacher. So yeah, I mean, it's literally the takeover of our youth. And I think the transition closet is a perfect example. No right parent, no parent in the right mind would be okay with a teacher deciding what kind of clothes your kid can wear. I think, and I think you could, and I agree with you, that it is the school, but I think you could also change that back and forth with just saying the state, right? The state thinks that they have a right to your children. If you've ever wondered where there are children are being coerced. So in sex trafficking, this in prostitution, it's forced fraud coercion. The schools and the states are co-hursing kids into questioning gender. They are literally feeding them this. And you plan a seed in a child's mind, that seed's going to grow. All you need to do is feed it. So it's by no happenstance or chance that you're seeing all the gender confusion and the transitions and all this stuff. They're being co-hursed. And now they're telling a child to lie to his parent. They're encouraging a child. So they're driving a wedge between the child and the parent. Why? Because the state wants to be in charge of the children and not the parent. Yeah. Thank you for that opinion, Hawco. We've got more to come first. I don't speak Spanish very well. And I don't speak South African either. South African. You know what I mean? We're going to bang up star here. Team mobile. Only Christian conservative self. No, Patriot mobile. Okay. All right. All right. All right. I got this. First of all, I think our sponsor, Patriot mobile. So look there, in case you haven't noticed, just by listening to this last segment, there is a full-scale assault on your right to speak the truth. You've got YouTube, you've got Spotify. The left is obviously waging a war on your speech with the help of big tech and the United States government. But there are some companies that still stand with you. They support you. They believe in the Constitution. That is why I am proud to partner with Patriot mobile. They are America's only conservative Christian cell phone provider. It's 2022. Okay. So they offer the same nationwide coverage that all of the other carriers offer. They're all sharing the same towers in case you didn't realize how that works. It's the same towers and Patriot mobile shares them as well. They've got really, really, really great plans. They can fit any budget and they support the causes that you also do. So if you are with any other cell phone provider, you are taking a portion of your hard-earned money that you go to work every day and you work hard for and you are giving it to a company that is donating it to places like Planned Parenthood. And every town, these places that want to take your guns, take your freedoms, don't do that anymore. Go to Patriot mobile. You can go to PatriotMobile.com slash news, get free activation with the offer code news. By the way, if you're a veteran or first responder, they have special discounts on top of their already reasonably priced plans. So you got to go there. It is patreon mobile dot com slash news. I was just saying off there, I need a whistle, I think, to to referee you guys. I like the friendly rivalry. It kind of reminds you of like, you know, like the ESPN shows where they debate sports, but we're going to debate the news. You know, I like that. I don't actually know. I don't know any ESPN show that still debates sports. Yeah, I know they know. They don't talk about sports at all. I think they just talk about the same issues that we are, except you listen to us instead, because who wants to listen to a bunch of ESPN talking heads talking about the things that actually matter. So let's switch gears to Canada. Ottawa police surged their numbers into downtown area of the nation's capital, Ottawa. Yesterday, they started yesterday. They are still going into it today as law enforcement prepared to push out the freedom convoy protesters who have sat in. Of course, you know, if you listen to Justin Trudeau, if you listen to these people, they are telling you that these are violent insurrectionists. They are racists. They are Nazis. They are, you know, insert phobic here. But really, these are nonviolent protests and protesters who have engaged in these nonviolent protests for the last three weeks. So law enforcement is passing around written warning for the second consecutive day, their ordering protesters to quote, leave the area now and quote, and their threatening potential arrest on a charge of mischief, they say, and they have sanctioned off a security area around Parliament Hill, which is encircling the protest area and checkpoints to prevent anyone without an approved reason, they say, from entering the area. And just being like a free being is not actually one of those approved reasons. They also have a security fence around the Parliament. So on top of that, you guys, it is getting very tense over there. They are starting to not only arrest the protesters, but also the organizers of this entire thing. So they had Tamara Lick, they have Chris Barber, I believe is his name. There are several arrests that have been made of the actual organizers. But let's listen to first, I want to show, I want to play a couple clips for you. Number one is Tamara herself, which is again, one of the original organizers of this convoy. Let's listen to her talking about, you know, I think she knew that this was coming, and she wanted to make sure that everyone knew that she was okay with it and that she was not afraid and to stand strong watch. There's a pretty good chance. Well, I think it's inevitable at this point. But I'll probably be going somewhere tomorrow where I'll be getting three square meals a day. And that's okay. I am, I'm okay with that. And I want you to know that I'm not afraid. And then so she went on to say, you know, hey, maybe I'll probably get some sleep finally. So I was trying to put a silver lining on this. And then of course, there came yesterday when she was actually arrested, we have that moment watch. So, you know, really evil things going on right now in Ottawa with this. And I would just like to add into the conversation here, we did have BJ Dictor, Benjamin Dictor, who we have had on the program before he was scheduled to join us remotely. He had to cancel at the last minute because of all of these arrests, because the police law enforcement have been ramping up their attacks on these nonviolent protesters. So he was unable to join us. We do, of course, we are thinking of him and praying for his safety because we know that it is, it's getting rough out there, guys. No, it's getting really sick. This is how sick the Canadians are being the Canadian government right now. In Ottawa, if you have a pet in your protester, they will impound your pet. And if you don't get your pet within eight days, it will be euthanized. I'm like, that's like, that's waging war against your citizens. The moment you come out against people's children and their pets. It's ridiculous. I mean, you know, as a pet lover, I mean, what is that other than cruel? I mean, I get it. They want people to leave. They're trying to, you know, whatever they're trying to do, the government is going to create, they're a fascist government regardless. Canada kind of always has been. It's kind of always has been a socialist place. But regardless, I get that they're trying to come up with creative techniques, but they're trying to take away people's dogs. That's evil. That's sick. That's based in like this, this almost hatred for your own citizens. And I think that's what Justin Trudeau actually thinks. And it's very similar, always say to January 6th. They think there's people that are in federal prison are actually terrorists. And they compare them, like I said before, to Pearl Harbor and 9-11. And these people in Canada, there's nothing like that. It's nothing like that. It's no way a racist insurrection. It is people that want medical freedom, basically. That's it. And for them, that's too much to ask. They got to go. And I want to add to this conversation, just for clarification purposes, Chris Barber, what he was charged with was counseling to commit mischief, obstruction, and counseling to commit obstruction. Tamara has been charged with counseling to commit mischief. So I mean, they are really reaching for these charges. Yeah, I'd like to see what the mischief charge, the penalty was for mischief maybe a year and a half ago, and see if they're actually going to give her that penalty or if they're going to tack on to it. And okay, so you're going to arrest her for mischief. Let's say it was two weeks in jail and some community service or whatever. I want to see that, right? Because that's going to show the nefarious nature of what they're doing. Look, they created this monster. And when you create a problem, then be the one on the hill yelling, we've got a problem when you created it. You've oppressed your people. You've taken their voice. You being all the leaders of the world through COVID, our leadership. You have done this. You've created, you've woken people up, not woke culture, but truly woken them up to say, hey, my life, my choice. And now that people are just standing for the right to choose and the freedom of like HIPAA laws being violated in America, just medical freedom. Now, all of a sudden they're terrorists and you're labeling them. You know someone has lost a fight when they go outside the rules of the fight. When you start going after their children and their dogs, this to me, as a combat lover, this shows that the Canadian government knows they're losing the battle. So they're resorting to dirty tactics. This is when you take a knife to a fist fight or something like that. They're going to dirty tactics because they know within the law actually these people are not breaking the law. Yeah, they're not. Isn't it interesting too that Justin Trudeau calls it a small fringe minority? Yeah, it's so small fringe that they have to hold out all these big powers. Yeah. I want to say this. I think Benito Mussolini defined fascism, I believe as the merger of corporation and state. And that's what's happening in Canada. It's basically they have merged with these corporations, the pharmaceutical corporations. And basically they're running the show in Canada. And so now this is a peeing match, lack of a better order between the Canadian citizens and the government. Because if he gives in, if Justin Trudeau gives in, and all those corporate backers, those are the people that are pushing Trudeau to say your citizens are not important. This is China, right? So when you think of a guy owning a steel company in China, he doesn't own it. Cinto Steel really owns it, which is the Chinese government. And they'll give him some freedom, but they'll dictate to him what he's going to do or not do. Trudeau is just running a company. Yeah, exactly. He's just running a company. And he has a board of directors that's pressuring him saying, we put you here for a reason so that when this day comes, you dance puppet, you'll dance. And this is Joe Biden. I was going to say how's the same thing? Same thing. Big and see illusion. So it's PPP. It's public-private partnerships in America that is happening. It's no different than America. And it's no different that's what's happened in Australia and New Zealand. And all these places, the people are finally saying hold up. Enough is enough, right? And all of a sudden, they want to cry, you know, because people are saying enough is enough because they're so used to people just bending the knee. Well, these bending the knee. The multinational companies, the multinational companies, the apples that operate and all over the world, they will destabilize America in order to gain more power. So that's why they want to take away the citizens power so they can gain more global dominance. And it's very obvious. It's one world order. It is. And people don't want to see it. You know, they don't realize that, like I said, you and I, we could never get anything passed, any legislation. But a company can basically get anything done. And these companies, they don't have the empathy. They're not able to feel empathetic to homeless people. That's why they got to build a building and move homeless people out. So the human being nature of our politicians is gone. They're all run by political action committees that are basically robotic companies that pay these people to make decisions that are not in our best interest. Well, that justifies the means. And that's to them power. Yeah. Yeah. To them. All right. We've got more to come. But first, we want to think our sponsor built bar. So guys, I don't have you ever tried built bar? I haven't was having all about built bar. Okay. Well, I have so I am known as the built bar dealer in the building. So I which we had attorney general. Oh, Bill, yes, the bar. Yes, of course. And how many bill bars did he eat? I mean, I was like, I feel like I'm in trouble. If I say like, I'm the built bar dealer, I need to be very careful. I say the Texas AG, I'm going to get arrested as soon as I leave the building. But it's not a big thing. Yes, it's not a legal. That's the good thing is that it is not illegal to eat a built bar. They are actually covered in 100% chocolate and they are a protein bar. So they are healthy. You've got the high protein, you've got the low calories, the low sugar, the low carbs, but the high protein, the high fiber. So you're going to feel like you're cheating on your diet, but you're not built bar is going to keep you on track. I've heard from so many of you who have tried them. By the way, they have mint puffs, I believe still available right now. The puff is the marshmallow consistency bar that they have. And they are all freaking amazing. Okay, I'm just telling you, you will not regret it. Yaku's had that. Absolutely. I'm about to go build bar nights when I leave here. I'm going to have my pockets. I'm going to go build bar night. I'm going to eat them all. This is the addictive personality of ours. So you just literally became he's because I want to marshmallow mints. I want to put the marshmallow one with the mint one. They have a mint marshmallow. Okay, they're perfect. Okay. And I know, but I looked and I saw the email and I was like, Oh my God, I need to go online and order it before they run out because this sounds amazing. They've got a mint puff. So make sure that you go. Okay. And get the mint puffs. It is built dot com use promo code news 15. You'll say 15% that is built dot com. Remember way back when about two years ago when we sat at this table, Yaku, I'm sure you were part of this conversation. We sat at this table and we talked about how the constant wearing of masks would impact children. I was one of those ways that it would impact children would be that they would not be able to learn how to speak as quickly that they would be behind because how are you supposed to learn how to speak when your teacher has something covering their face up to their eyeballs and a lot of other things, right? But speech, one of those things. Well, you'll be shocked to hear that the CDC just lowered the standards for speech in early childhood development. Now children should know 50 words at it used to be 24 months. Now it is 30 months. So just very slowly, quietly, but very deliberately lowering those standards. And by the way, so that it doesn't show up in anything, there will be no one outside of the norm because they've just changed the norms. So that's fine. I mean, similar to changing the definition of vaccine and all of these other things that they have done. Yes, racism, all of these other things that they've done to rewrite history so that you can't say that anything bad is happening. Nothing wrong is happening. All the kids are fine. All the kids are not all right. Well, the problem is, human beings, one of the ways we communicate is nonverbal communication. We just look, we just smile. It's kind of a friendly way. It's like, when you're driving in a car, sometimes you lift in, you're in Texas, you might lift your fingers up. But I'm saying that mask in school all day, you're not able to smile at your classmates. So you have this disconnection and now we're with a computer screen. So it's like, now they have this, the metaverse that they're trying to push us into. They really are encouraged to do that because as human beings, you're kind of scared. Am I going to get a virus as a young kid? You know, maybe I should put on my mask. So it's, it's a deliberate plan to encourage kids basically not to verbalize with each other. And it works perfectly. And we're going to have a lot of germaphobes, I think, I think grow older. Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And they're going to get really sick because they're naturally immunity, natural immunity will not work. But kids that age, I've got 300 age of seven, they are visual learners. So where they learn to speak by watching your mouth and how you shape sound. And I have an accent in my house. So the kids will pick up on that because they can see how you shape sound. And they can't at the moment. So of course they're going to fall behind. And then we just look at statistics. Dr. Jack Brewer is looking at the, you know, the massive decline in literacy in young black men. 12 years old having a third grade reading level. This is going to decimate that. You're going to have high schools that can't read what we would consider a decent reading of a third grade level because they're not forming and they're being encouraged not to be smart. So you lower the bar and no one aspires higher, right? But they won't do that where there's money to be made. There they raise the bar. Right. Well, I think they're going to just keep, you know, moving the field goals post as they say so that more kids can be eligible to move up in grades because they don't just kids held back because these kids aren't going to be able to read like you said. And so that's why they're doing the test. I mean, they're changing the levels at an early age maybe to kind of hide it in some sort of way. But just you can just tell from this COVID epidemic, can you imagine being a senior football player in your whole? I mean, I'm just talking about from my experience of losing your senior year of football that you'll never get back because of the flu. And whether it's, you know, like I said, I've lost people that I love from it. So it is, you know, something bad. But your youth, your football, yours is the only thing you have in this economy. As a kid, you only have one eighth grade. You only have one sixth grade. You only have one fourth grade. And that whole grade, all those memories are gone because you had to hide behind a mask. It's called core memories. And we're in a certain things that create core memories, right? And this generation, you're touching on something so we can have a whole share on this. This is the generation Z that they're most informed, but they create the least amount of core memories. So you and your dad walking out, standing in the rain, throwing football in the rain, right? You'll never forget it. It's a core memory. It anchors you to certain things. And you always go back to that as centered like, that felt great. That felt like real attention from my dad. They're not making core memories because everything changes every day. It's like, well, yesterday, this was the norm today. It's not. So it's, it's super detrimental to the future. Well, speaking of masks, I want to play this for you guys earlier this week, there was a video that surfaced that went viral of a man getting kicked off of a legend air. This is what his offense was. He actually, and you I can't even hardly see it in the video. He apparently, he was wearing a regular one of those blue, likes, I guess, I don't know that you would call them surgical, but the blue generic masks. And I guess he had written, let's go brandon on the mask. And the flight attendant was not putting up with that. Here's that exchange. Is there a comment that you've written from there? Like you said, it's like a painters mask. It's not an unofficial mask. It's not even like a surgical. So he was removed from the flight for wearing that. And she cited some like it's, it's FAA standards, but I have yet to see a legion air show us where that is in the FAA regulations. I think this was just, she was just very. So what can they tell you what Brian is short to wear? Well, I'd love to know if any Black Lives Matter people got kicked off. But let me say this case, because I love to joke around, but this is actually really sad because now flying, like you just talk about this core memory, some of my core memories are traveling going, you know, getting on an airplane. Obviously, you've traveled internationally. You know, there's just some of your best memories. But this day and age, when you go on an airplane, they used to compare like, Oh, a Greyhound bus is rough. I think an airplane might be the roughest place on earth. You know what I mean? Like you're getting pictures of people duct taping each other on there, because if you don't wear the right political mask, they're going to kick you off the plane. They're going to put you on a no fly list. I would have never thought that the 911 no fly list would be used on these American citizens for wearing a mask. This is let's go Brandon or that says, you know, FJB, whatever stupid slogan they say, these people are not only sometimes getting kicked off the plane, they're getting put on no fly list where they can't fly on an airline. They have to buy a ticket on a totally different airline or they can't fly at all. And this is over stupid stuff that's not even FAA regulation. So it's sad for me because I used to love to travel. And now I don't want to travel in all because I don't want to have to go on an airplane and deal with some sort of Karen telling me, Oh, you know, you got to put on your mask the whole time. You're going to do this. You're between bites. It's just they've made it a nightmare to do the things at one point where the most fun things in the world. Yeah. Yeah. When do you think the airlines drop the mask because states are dropping it like crazy? Well, I'll tell you we had we had Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton on who is suing. Yeah, he's suing the CDC for their overreach in making this I also have to say he's a friend and he's an amazing AG. He's also the AG that has sued Joe Biden the most of 22 times against Joe Biden. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, he yeah, he is great. But I mean, it does make you wonder because if this was, you know, Alex, you pointed out earlier in the program that they like to to throw the word science around it's all about the science. If this was about the science and the data, an airplane is like one of the safest places you could be because the air is so freaking filtered. Yeah, that's fine. The airline was yelling that the whole pandemic was like, no, it's safe. It's safe. They don't want their airlines to fly. Please fly. Yeah. They're going to be somewhere that brand. So what if someone comes up with a clothing brand and it's literally, you know, let's go brand and it's the actual name of the brand. Unless your brand owner kissed the ring, you can't wear the brand. I feel like probably a couple times, just a few times there have been people who have worn Black Lives Matter or LGBTQ gear that have been totally fine and not talked to at all. So cool. I mean, but it's last word. And we know hypocrisy exists and we know that they're only going to usually target one side when it comes to the social justice fight. But really, and truly, the kind of social justice fight on an airplane is not real. You know what I mean? They're trying to like literally that woman is trying to fight social justice by telling this guy to take a mask off. That's where we're at. That's how these social justice warriors think they're fighting the social justice war. And it's terrible and it's really a travesty. Well, also, if COVID was so dangerous, why would you want to put someone at risk by asking them to take their mask off and put another one on? Because it's not about the mask. It's just off. I don't even know if that's a legend or just her personal personal. I don't think it's a legend. And now, but I will say I need to go back and look. I need to go back and look and see if they have said anything that I've missed. But last time I checked, they had not. Yeah. And like, I mean, I'd like to hear a strong statement coming from the airline saying that was heard that that is not representative of us. All right, we've got to take a break first. We want to thank our sponsor, my go to doc.com. So you guys are always asking us, how can I find a doctor online that I can trust? They're going to be a COVID expert. And you know, they're going to get me the right prescriptions, not just a prescription factory, though. And more so, where can I find a pharmacy who is actually going to take these prescriptions and fill them without questioning me or canceling the prescription or anything like that? You got to go to my go to doc.com. All right, this is a look. Omocron is milder than Delta. And look, we if you look at the science, you look at the data, the pandemic should be over soon, but we also have the left in charge. So who knows when they are actually going to determine that we are over with it. But Dr. Said Hader has built something over at my go to doc.com that you need to know about for three reasons. Number one, he is a COVID expert. This is all he does. He's treated over 40,000 patients with zero deaths. Number two, you can register for free, ask questions as many as you want for as long as you want. And most importantly to me, they connect you to pharmacies that will ship you a full 28 doses of Ivermectin for less than $150. I did it. It was very, very easy. I communicated with their doctor's office. I got them what they needed. They connected me with a pharmacy that got me what I needed. And I know that in the event that I get sick, I am protected. You got to go check them out. That is my go to doc.com. My go to doc.com. Speaking of Black Lives Matter, we just mentioned that with the flights, Amazon has officially kicked Black Lives Matter off of its charity platform, Amazon Smile, after the company said that the progressive organization Black Lives Matter has not lived up to its standards as a charity in good standing, they said, after the group. I mean, we've seen all the headlines. We've talked about them here. Actually, we've talked about the way that they spend their money. Black Lives Matter for a very long time here on this program. But they've come under fire in recent weeks for failing to properly disclose how they are spending the millions of dollars they have donated, that have been donated to them, rather from individuals and groups and corporations. Now, I will say certainly that all of these donations have not gone at all to actually help the Black community. But you do see the founder buying multi-million dollar homes. So I guess great for her. But very shocking, I think personally, that Amazon would actually come out and take this stance. And by the way, those of you who don't know what Amazon Smile is, they donate like a half a percentage, I believe, of whatever your total bill is to the charity organization of your choice. And now Black Lives Matter has been removed from that organization. If the organization is vetted, you go through the vetting process and you qualify for Amazon Smiles. And of course, they qualify it easy. But we had chapter leaders throughout the BLM movement. Chapter leaders started coming up and saying, hey, the organization does not support the chapters financially. But we're raising all these funds for them. We're campaigning on the ground and nothing's coming back. Within the BLM movement, even the local chapter organizers, as from, I think day one, started saying, we're not seeing any resources coming out. So good on Amazon. I mean, you know, you got to be pretty bad when Amazon turned on a group that they kind of supported and changed. Yeah, I mean, are they going to get canceled next? But look at this Patricia Colors, the leader of Black Lives Matter, she bought $3.6 million in property in Atlanta. And then she bought property in a neighborhood in California outside of Los Angeles. That was 98.7% white. And then the rest is mainly Asian. So these are the biggest hypocrites in the entire world. So you're right that it's good. They should be shut down. But I think it's almost a long time due because I believe a lot of that money was funded to, you know, Joe Biden's campaign. Now that once again, that's a conspiracy theory. I'm just saying, where did all this money go? It's just weird that like all that money that BLM raised was missing. So I mean, I don't know if Joe Biden necessarily took it like that. I'm just saying all that money, all that good will that was given to the Black Lives Matter movement really went to the Democratic Party in my opinion. Well, and then imagine how you feel if you are Black Lives Matter, because then you have the president who then get well, 81 million votes, we know he was the most popular president of all time the best. Everyone loves him. But he gets into office potentially with maybe some of that money. And he tells them he's like, yeah, no, I'm I don't care about people. I mean, he eulogized Robert Bird. Can you tell me what? No, I'm literally, I guess I was, but it just that's the thing is Joe Biden will give you this impression. That's what they do. They play Kate, the African American community that has the lowest vaccine numbers are the ones that are going to be the most limited in the places where they have the vaccine passport. They don't care. So it literally they give that that's why these people and when I say these people to us, we need to take back the power because we get marginalized by our race, by our sex, by our gender, by these politicians every day. And we let him, like I said, Joe Biden, oh, I'm going to help black people does nothing for the entire Democratic Party. I mean, look, look at those cities that have been run by Democrats for 50 years are black people better off now than they were 50 years ago. Absolutely not. No, because this is the party that has historically targeted the black community for their own game. They're the party that a lot Margaret saying are to target the black community as a race that she wanted to extinguish. They're the same party that's just franchising the black father from his home by incentivizing him to leave. They do not, they virtue signal. And it's also the party that has no footing unless they talk about race. Well, you say Margaret Sanger too. Oh, sorry, sorry. You got to mention William Gates, senior Bill Gates, his dad started with Margaret saying plan, Parenthood. Yeah. Yeah. I didn't know that. Yeah. So this party, they have nothing. This is why they induce race into every conversation. Well, he said Margaret Sanger, I just had to cut in because William Gates, senior Bill Gates, his dad, they founded plan together together. Yeah. I mean, not shocking at all. But all right, last word, Yaku. They're terrible. All right. Well, that's a saying. We're going to take a break. We'll be back. Yeah, the Margaret Sanger thing literally can euthanize. But you know, I like, oh my blackface. The latest on Russia and Ukraine, it seems to be getting pretty tense there. Some people are accusing they're they're making accusations of a false flag. But again, I'm sure as of the time of this taping, something new will have happened by the time you're watching this. But as of the time of this taping, there was a wrecked vehicle close to the headquarters of the Don'ts people's Republic that had that had blasted that had blown up. The cause of the blast was unclear at that time. There are Ukrainian officials who are saying they expect provocations from Russia in the separatist regions. And Biden will speak with his NATO allies about the Russia and Ukraine crisis today, they say ahead of his afternoon remarks. So again, as of the time of this taping, we don't know what that conversation looks like. But it does appear that things are ramping up between Russia and Ukraine. You know, I asked this of all of my guests on the program lately with this conflict. Should America be concerned? We should be concerned, but this is not our fight. NATO step in EU step in. This is this is this is your continent. Ukraine is applying for status with you, NATO. You're about to give them status. They're applying for support. EU, you go and step in for once UK bar a step in. You know, all you other guys, you know, Macron, you guys go step in and help here. This is not our fight. But I think you're looking at something here. You're gonna see a major misstep by Joe Biden in this issue. You're gonna see something evergreen. Well, I have to disagree. Listen, I don't want American involved at all. I want Kamala Harris not to worry about the Ukrainian border to worry about the southern border. And I think I've said that before, but this is another thing you look at the Ukrainians, they have Zelensky, they have a guy that's basically like an actor puppet that was on a TV show that they chose to be their president. And so it kind of similar to Trump. I was gonna say, it's not always a bad idea. It's not that crazy. But what I'm saying is these people, you know, the Ukrainians deserve respect. But at the end of the day, we are not there a protector. It's not our responsibility. We're not the world's police. No, we're really not. And that's what we're doing. We're getting drawn into another geopolitical fight that we don't have a dog in. And Joe Biden, like you said, is going to end up looking stupid because he's looked stupid by Ukraine this whole time. And Putin, we say what you will about him being a bad guy, killing people within his own country that, you know, speak up against him. He's smart. He knows what he's doing. And he can play Joe Biden like a fiddle. And I think that's when you say the false flag, I think this is just another way for the military industrial complex to get a leg up on Joe Biden. Yeah.
