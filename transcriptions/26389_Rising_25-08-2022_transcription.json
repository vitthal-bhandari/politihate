    "text": " Good morning and welcome to Rising. We have a historic show for you today. Brianna, what do we have? Well, with that leading, we'll discuss Biden's student debt cancellation with a special panel. I'm excited about that. And Alan Kerrick-Katsanis weighs in on the brutal Arkansas police beating. But first, a group of families of the victims and survivors of the U-Valley shooting at Rob Elementary are filing a class action lawsuit that seeks $27 billion in damages that will target multiple law enforcement agencies on the federal, state, and local levels. U-Valley schools police chief Pete Eradondo refused to attend a school board meeting yesterday saying he would not participate in his own illegal and unconstitutional public lynching. Eradondo did end up getting fired for his catastrophic handling of the shooting, which we have criticized numerous times on the show. CNN's Shimon Prokopach reported on school board meeting and what transpired. Let's watch. Right, last night, Jake, there was a school board meeting where they were listening to grievances that the community members, family members have against the superintendent. Over three hours this meeting went on for over three hours and it was all behind closed doors. And so family members couldn't listen to what was being discussed. And then there was just this level of frustration after the school board members came out and simply suggested some changes that they would have a town hall before school starter, that they would look into some of the police response, the school police response of that day. It wasn't enough for parents. You know, time and time again, I'm at the school board meetings and time and time again, you leave these meetings and it's just you get this sense that the parents are just not getting the answers that they want. There has been no accountability. Tomorrow there will be another school board meeting, Jake, where we expect that the police chief, the school police chief will finally be fired. But that is still not 100 percent certain, but that is certainly on the agenda tomorrow night. And that is what parents are expected. So we will hear more about that tomorrow night, Jake. Shimon tweeted out that this is nowhere near done and tonight there will be another school board meeting. It's kind of incredible with the kinds of things that people get fired for routinely, the kind of mistakes that are made that are so much less significant than what happened at Oval Day. But he's still in his position. It's frustrating. It's not surprising. I mean, this is you talk about qualified immunity. You talk about the other protections that government employees have. You know, these are the people who work for they work for us. They work for the tax payers and they are harder to get rid of when they screw up than right average employee of any company. You do this latest thing wrong. You can get fired. It happens to people all the time. It's often unjust. It's often wrong. These people trusted to keep children safe, failed horribly. I mean, we can, you know, recount the failures here. Everyone's standing. The police officer standing in that hallway for an hour, hour and a half while children have been murdered, are dying, bleeding on the floor, calling for help, calling 911 for help, that we can see the security footage of them holding back of the officer. They held back an officer whose wife was in the room dying who had called him for help. And he goes, he draws his gun and they hold him back. They hold him back and remove him just as they held back all the parents outside. Tackled, handcuffed. One escaped, went in the school, got her kids out, got out. They're holding all these people back and to be one thing if they're holding them back because they're doing something. They're just holding them back for the sake of holding them back. They don't do anything. There were multiple different kinds of law enforcement agencies on the scene. There was all the reporting about how they had a SWAT team and all of this military gear for this relatively small town and none of that amounted to anything when it came down to their ability to save lives, which many observers have noted could have been saved if they had behaved differently in that moment. So, you know, I think a lot of people are waiting with baited breath to see what the accountability actually will look like in this town. And it is frustrating that now, you know, so many weeks, you know, months out that we're still waiting. This whole thing is a good lesson in that just investing a community with more police resources, more law enforcement resources, which is an impulse I understand, you know, given that crime is rising in some cities, there's a lot of concern about what's going on in the streets, etc. And I, you know, I'm not for defunding the police, but you say, you know, if you want to throw more money at the problem or go, yeah, get them get them a fancy SWAT gear, get them a tank, get them all this stuff. Do they use that to stop actual danger to stop actual violence? Or do they use that to just, I'm harassed people who, you know, with the not wrong door raids, Breanna Taylor type stuff. Yeah, or the beating that we've talked about yesterday. Yeah, look, I think that this moment is really instructive because so often these conversations about policing pretend that one camp doesn't care about crime and another camp does care about crime. And I think that when we're talking about children, there's a little bit less of that. There's an acknowledgement that, of course, everybody wants the right outcome here. Nobody wants children dead and on these teachers as well. Nobody wants people to be punched randomly in the street, whether it's by people who have mental health issues or people who don't have mental health issues. Nobody wants to live in a city where they're or anywhere where they're perpetually feeling apprehensive about crime. The real question is what kinds of interventions are well calculated to actually improve conditions? And what we've seen in Oval Day and in so many places around the country, is it simply throwing money at police forces doesn't actually do that. And what, whether it's a defender or an abolished person or someone who just wants criminal justice reform, the argument that people have been making for years is that we do have evidence about the kinds of interventions that do bring down crime. And it has to do with addressing some of these root causes, including mental health crises, including some kinds of community policing. And including, potentially, when we look at this Oval Day case and we'll see what happens down the line, but certain kinds of, you know, gun measures that prevent 18-year-olds people who tend to want to go back to schools to do shootings because that's the environment that they're comfortable with because they're so young from getting weapons of mass destruction. Because in this case, you can't say, well, they needed a better training. They had training. They had the exact training for how to handle a mass shooter situation, a training that has been honed over the last 20 years of these things. Tragically. They knew exactly how they were supposed to react. They were armed. They were, they had the right equipment. There were tons of them, tons of them. This school district had its own police force. Yep. And they just didn't do what they were supposed to do. And this is why people say, you know, you can't reform this. You don't have to agree with that thinking, but that is literally why so many abolitionists or defenders say, this is a system that can't be reformed because at a certain point, there's no amount of kind of sensitivity training that can get to some of the structural reasons why police departments act in these ways. And some broader, I think, cultural qualities about some of these police forces, you know, there was that image of the person with the punisher screen on their phone. And I don't want to read too much into that sort of thing. But you know, is there a culture that relishes the kind of vengeance that the punisher represents that a kind of, it is that police forces attract the kind of people who are out to satisfy some kind of personal aggression as opposed to wanting to really be in a role of making a real statement? Why don't we bring that aggression to the deranged teenager who was murdering children? Because it's purported. And not bring that aggression to the guy outside the CVS or the gas station or whatever. Yesterday, he was having his who's unarmed and having his face bashed into the pavement. Right. Well, I think it's because it's channeled that aggression toward keeping people safe. Well, it's a performative shtick. And I think that probably in both instances, what you need is not aggression, but like strategic analytical thinking about how to solve a problem, which I don't think is something that most police departments regretfully solve for. Well, it makes a good probably makes a good argument for a class action lawsuit. This behavior from the police being so outside of what they were supposed to do. So obviously, discordant from what they were trained to do, what they were instructed to do, what they were prepared to do. So we'll see. Yeah, we'll be following this. And we'll have more rising in your radar. Coming up next. Indeed. Well, Brianna, I'm dying to know what's on your radar. Well, Robbie, something good finally happened. Now, look, bare minimum Biden didn't live up to his campaign promises. He failed to cancel all student debt for public school graduates, making less than $125,000 a year. Like he promised, he failed to cancel all student debt for HBCU graduates under that same income threshold. But yesterday, he did announce a plan to cancel $10,000 of debt for all student debtors earning under $125,000 a year, as well as 20,000 for recipients of Pell grants. Pell grants, of course, are federal grants awarded only to undergraduate students who display exceptional financial need. And I got to say, I have a lot of complaints about Biden, but this from a press conference yesterday was pretty based. Mr. President, is this unfair to people who paid their student loans or chose non-takeout loans? Is it fair to people who, in fact, do not own the $1 million businesses that if I see one of these guys get more effective, is that fair? What do you think? What about people who paid their loans, so struggled to pay their loans and how others don't have to? Biden's right. The logic articulated by those reporters that someone helping out some people is unfair because other people exist is so anti-solidaristic, so anti-worker, so anti-community that it deserves the score and that Biden served up. Should childless people pay for those with children? Should people who don't have special needs pay for families with kids who do need more support? Should non-drivers pay for roads? Should people without homes support all the mortgage subsidies that have been pitched to good, wholesome middle-class Americans for years? Truly, what is the difference there? Well, we'll get back to that difference later in this radar, but first, let's review the public reaction to this policy, shall we? Now again, Biden literally did less than what he campaigned on and elites who desperately want American workers to be deeply indebted to have no social mobility, no ability to start their own businesses and get out from under the thumbs of Wall Street Control still wet their collective pamper. House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy tweeted, who will be forced to pay for Biden's debt transfer scam? Hardworking Americans who already paid off their debts or never took on student loan debt in the first place? Well, I can't reply better than podcast or Brian Tyler, who replied, your party added $2 trillion to the debt to give permanent tax handouts to billionaires and major corporations. And you're mad that President Biden is taking some action to help relieve a generation of working Americans from mountains of debt? South Carolina Senator Tim Scott tweeted, President Biden's plan to cancel student debt is no compassionate freebie for Americans. It's a $300 billion economic burden placed on lower and middle class families in the midst of a recession. $300 billion? That's not being compared to the $700 billion in PPP loans that were forgiven, the overwhelming majority of which went to millionaires or billionaires like Paul Palosi, Chloe Kardashian, and Jared Kushner, the subject of my radar yesterday. Mitt Romney, famous for being so rich that he has an elevator for his cars, Mitt Romney, who founded Bain Capital, an investment firm that staged an epic wealth grab, destroyed jobs, and stuck others with the bill? He had the audacity to tweet, sad to see what's being done to bribe the voters. Biden's student loan forgiveness plan may win Democrats some votes, but it fuels inflation, footstacks payers with other people's financial obligations, is unfair to those who pay their own way and create irresponsible expectations. Brian? Now it's a bribe to do something to help the middle class. The lower 60% of earners who will benefit from this policy as we discussed on the show yesterday with Sparky Abraham. It seems that conservatives want to divide Americans up into makers and takers, not to reward the middle class makers who did the quote unquote right thing and went to college, but to excuse their choice to do nothing for anybody. And Senator Rick Scott, Republican from Florida, literally tweeted, from a yacht in Italy, Democrats pushed to forgive student loans, won't solve the problem. We need real solutions that don't create an added burden on taxpayers. My college act will actually hold universities accountable for student outcomes and force them to answer for skyrocketing tuition costs. Scott, of course, famously got 100% of the purchase price of super yachts written off as a bonus depreciation in the 2017 tax bill. Will he and cashless communication strategist uh, summer I Scott's out of touch sentiment beautifully, uh, tweeting, pay off your own debts as a generation of pundits that went to school and classes were $100 in the minimum wage could finance a mortgage on a two bedroom wall. And he's right. College costs have skyrocketed exponentially over the last 30 years. But I will give at least Rick Scott some credit for acknowledging the student debt crisis is real and for offering something in the way of a policy solution. But his plan is a band-aid that does nothing to expand on what should be the goal here. What progressives and conservative populists alike should be using this movement to springboard to. And that's free public college. Look, as I've said before, people who point out that student debt cancellation is a short term solution that doesn't get at the root of the problem are absolutely right. That's why I have been a longtime advocate of Bernie Sanders plan, which combines full student debt cancellation with a free public college program financed entirely by a relatively small tax on the Uber rich. In addition to funding free public college, Bernie's plan would cap student loan interest rates going forward at 1.88%. And you cannot overstate how important these interventions would be in preventing the same debt crisis from reemerging 5, 10 or 15 years after this cancellation. After all, this $10,000 of cancellation amounts to merely one year of interest for millions of borrowers. And it will be back on their balance sheets in no time flat if interest rates as high as 8% aren't taken care of. That's exactly why the loan servicing industry lobbied for the loan cancellation amount to be $10,000. This was literally their plan designed to keep their profits flowing. All they want is for the moratorium to end so they can start collecting again. And they know that $10,000 is nothing in the grand scheme of the interest payments they still stand to collect. Truly free public college means anyone who takes out debt going forward truly would have no one to blame but themselves. For that choice. Unlike now where public colleges are not always available and still cost a pretty penny, it was literally cheaper for me to go to certain well-endowed private institutions than the average in-state tuition. Free public colleges also have an equalizing effect devaluing the power of institutions like Harvard which which which merely peddle prestige to elites while leaving out much of the working class. 15% of the Harvard class of 2019 were legacy students. More than half of Harvard students come from the top 10% of the income distribution. Other countries with free higher education have less class division and more regard for those who opt for vocational educations. The more equal places with more class mobility. This is the populist dream we should be working toward and which we were working toward before Ronald Reagan as governor of California purposefully worked to make public universities and colleges inaccessible to the poor. Making poor and working class people dependent on federal loans was a way to disrupt working class populist equality movements in the 1970s. And whatever you think about those movements was all of our kids who suffered. Now it's the moment for everyone excited about student debt relief to join with those who raised real concerns that this is but a stopgap solution and push for more meaningful legislation to be passed that gets to the root of the problem. If you were objecting in good faith to student debt cancellation on the grounds that it didn't get at the root of the issue you should push your congressional representatives to back Bernie Sanders free public college bill which was introduced in the house in 2021. The bill is fully funded by the Tax on Wall Street Speculation Act which would levy a 0.5% tax on stock trades and a 0.1% fee on bond trades and a 0.005% fee on derivative transactions. That would raise up to $2.4 trillion over the next decade according to a summary of the bill. This is a moment where momentum is building. The bullies who want socialism for the rich in a miserable precarious life for the 99% are losing ground. Things have become so painfully and equal that it's difficult for even conservatives to justify. It's why we see conservative states like Florida voting for a $15 minimum wage. It's why we see conservative states like Kansas voting down ballot initiatives that would ban abortion in the state constitution. This is a moment where the people can start making the government work for us again but it won't happen if we can't put aside petty partisan fighting triggered by elites who want nothing more than to protect the status quo in which they thrive. And that gets me back to a point alluded to at the top of the segment. Why is it that elites are so invested in keeping us indebted? Why do they support tax breaks for homeowners and families even though those often target the same middle income folks targeted here and not the poor? Why are elites in both parties mad at student debt cancellation for targeting the middle class when middle class is usually considered to be the most politically deserving group? Well, the difference is that elites of both parties have a deeply vested interest in preventing mobility for working people. They push home ownership and childbirth both because they serve capital, big business, industry. None of it is about supporting a cultural or personal desire for family. It's about convincing otherwise precarious people to maintain an economic status quo. You see once you've bought a house, once you've had kids, once you have student debt, your options to leave your job, to start a business, to move, to become free, are limited. And that's why the government will tell you or even now force you to have a child but won't actually help you with child care. It doesn't want you to be able to work from home. It doesn't want you to be free from the yoke of employer-based health care. No, it wants you in the office with less free time than anyone in the free world. Because when people have time to think, to innovate, to start businesses of their own without fear that they'll get sick and go bankrupt from medical bills, they no longer can be under corporations control. Without the threat of student debt and medical debt, how could they even get you to join the military and fight in their unjust wars? Sound conspiratorial? Well, look at the evidence. Liberal lion Malcolm Gladwell, who is wax poetic about how he loves to write his best-selling books from cafes, lectured normal folks to get back to work. What have you reduced your life to? He asked the commuting masses. Democrats bragged about having child poverty with the child tax credits, but despite being overwhelmingly popular, those tax credits were quickly on the chopping block. Can't have parents free up enough money that one of them can stay home or work one fewer job. The market demands a desperate labor force. Not a happy one. And just this week, they admitted it. Can Kippenstein and John Schwartz at The Intercept just broke this news yesterday. On an earnings call, real estate CEO and president of Douglas Emmet Incorporated, a real estate corporation worth over $3 billion, and based in Santa Monica, California, said a recession could be good if it comes with a level of unemployment that puts employers back in the driver's seat and allows them to get all their employees back into the office. Recession could be good? Employers back in the driver's seat? That's code for be able to exploit their employees without their employees having any recourse. And that's the whole game. The reason so many elites hated the stimulus checks is not because they drove inflation. You see, they don't tie the PPP checks for billionaires to inflation in the same way, or Trump's tax cuts for the rich, which added more to the deficit for absolutely no reason than anything that's happened before since. And they aren't talking about the supply chain crisis or the war in Ukraine. Two key causes of inflation know they talk about spending because they don't want working people to have options. Because when working people have options, they can demand higher salaries. When workers have options, they can bargain for a bigger piece of the pie. This is why union organizing is so important. It gives workers who individually have very little power to attain the power of collective bargaining. The powers withhold their labor together and force employers to share profits more equitably. In the golden age of labor, the 1950s and the 1960s, CEOs earned about 30 times more than their employees. When I guess what that ratio is now, well, over 300 to one. And this is while workers are working more hours with less to show for it. COVID relief unexpectedly empowered labor. And now elites are trying to put a lid on it in whatever way they can. We started student loan payments, canceling support for families with children, and intentionally, intentionally driving up unemployment. We need to recognize this and use the student at victory to continue to pull together as a community of working people and keep demanding more. In the richest country in the history of the world, education should be free. Yes, even for rich kids, just like public high school is free for the rich should they choose to attend. And I got to say, I think rich people would be better people if they did attend public high schools. And just like libraries are free for the rich. And services of firefighters, it's our country. And we get to make it work for us. Let's follow through on legitimate concerns that student debt relief is only a partial solution and finish the job. Let's make America great again by establishing a well educated, able workforce, one we can be proud of, one that can build semiconductors and make doctors and plumbers and invent medicines and fix our roads and bridges and create clean energy solutions. One that can compete on a global stage without relying on the power of American imperialism. I truly believe we can do all that. And I believe that free public college is a solid first step. So what do you think, Robbie? Have I addressed some of your concerns that you raised? Well, look, I appreciate the point you made in the middle of your radar that and that you support changes to the system. Because that's really where I'm coming from. I don't understand how this can be done with and I listened to Biden's remarks yesterday where he talks about how he speaks eloquently about how people are drowned are mired in this debt. They're drowning. They were swindled. They were scammed. They can't get out of it. Okay, fine. But how can we do this without fixing any of the underlying incentives that like, shouldn't we end the scam? The scam being this subsidized student loan process that the government, it's a government policy. The government could just end it. If it's so, if it's so vicious, if it's such a swindle, we should stop doing this window. So I, I would, I think the best, if you're going to make the most powerful steelman case for doing this, I would say it should be accompanied by a change to the systems or else we'll be right back here in a couple of years. I completely agree. Now, I don't think that you should, you know, get rid of stopgap measures and you have nothing because the reason that plan was put into effect, even though it has these horrible downstream consequences that we're all living with now, is because the reality that no one wants to talk about and all of the people who say go into college is pushing people to go to college is elitist. I mean, yes, I want to live in a world where workers can earn as much as people who go to college. I want to live in a world where we respect people who have vocational training. And I do and I fight for the rights of those people more so than a lot of people who claim populism. But the reality is there's, I believe, a $30,000 more year average income that's earned by people who do go to college. So I think that your ability to go, she'll simply be driven by, do your desire to go? Do you want to go to college? Do you want to go to vocational school? What kind of job can I have? If everybody goes to college, it'll cancel out that advantage. Well, yes. But, you know, I personally think there's other reasons also just to have people, regardless of what you want to do professionally, to go to college, but I don't, I'm not in a place right now. I'm this show where I necessarily want to be getting into the kind of the philosophical reasons to go to college. But even if you only care about it from a pure training, the workforce perspective and riching America's workforce that we can do more and compete more in the world. So the lever I would pull ideally to control college costs would actually be at the state level. I view state schools are state institutions. They're government institutions. State legislatures should cap. I mean, frankly, they should drastically lower what the tuition price is. I agree with you. I wouldn't make all college free everywhere. But I would say that a state school, in that state should be affordable to the people who pay taxes there. And right now, they're that used to be true. That's not true anywhere now. And I would say it's on state legislatures to act. The universities can let some employees go. Maybe some Liz Wolfe, we have on the show frequently, my colleague, I've reason she was tweeting about this. UVA's Vice President for Diversity Equity Inclusion makes $357,000 a year. UC Berkeley's Vice Chancellor for Equity Inclusion makes $325,000 a year. None of these institutions have raised educator salaries whatsoever. Professors have... Yeah, that's why the salaries are insane. They're insane. And these play... It's not all... I've looked at these institutions have... I think those salaries are insane because the salaries are insane not because I'm making value judgments about what kind of jobs that people do. But I completely agree that's why... But if they have 100 other employees, making 100, 200k in addition to that person to do these roles that are not education roles. There's a huge problem where adjuncts aren't being paid properly and they're being treated like professors with a burdens of professors but without any of the support or the tenure protections or anything like that. If we care about free speech and the ability of people to actually use these these contexts, these universities to drive public conversation in productive ways, I completely agree, which is why I love Bernie's plan. It was all right there. And this whole time I felt a little bit hamstrung because in the context of the Bernie campaign, all of these objections that people are making were mooted by the fact that he did have a comprehensive plan to deal with all of this. And what Biden is experiencing right now, some of the blowback... here's really a lot of support, but some of the blowback that he is getting is because he thought he could pick and choose from these kind of plans. No, Bernie had a plan for that. Bernie had a holistic vision that really wasn't appreciated by all the technocrats that spend a lot of time bloviating on the cable news. So here is the plan. It's already been introduced in the house. Anybody who was concerned about interest rates at public institutions and more broadly, like as you just said, should embrace the fact that Bernie has a cap on interest rates, should embrace the fact that he has a funding scheme on a tax on Wall Street to make sure that public colleges are free and frankly should be, you know, the problem is that even though they're available, they are still very, very expensive. So people should be having no debt coming out of public institutions whatsoever. I know that you're a public institution grad and you know, I've had many friends who went to your institution and they did have debt, Graduate University of Michigan. So there are, there's a solution out there people. It's right there in front of you and hopefully we can use this moment to capitalize on it. Well, we're going to keep talking about this issue. I think we're having a debate on it a little bit later with some guests. Obviously we're both fired up about it. We weren't arguing on Twitter, but I was arguing with Ryan and Baccio, what's the argument? Baccio agrees with me. Ryan agrees with you. Only television show, there is where there's actual differences, serious differences of opinion. I will be back with more of that after this. Earlier this week, Arkansas officers, including two deputies and an officer who were shown on video beating a man during an arrest, were suspended with pay. We showed the clip on rising earlier this week and we will pull it up again now. In it, you can see three officers punching a man in the head and meeting him several times as they pent him down. Just horrible to watch. Founder and Executive Director of Civil Rights Corps and author of usual cruelty. Alec Caricatsonus was founder and Executive Director of Civil Rights Corps and author of usual cruelty. He tweeted about the matter, writing what is shown in the Arkansas police beating video is utterly normal. It's what dozens of my own clients and their families describe to me over the years. Everyone who works in the system knows about it. After Rodney King and calls for accountability, we got the 1994 crime bill. After George Floyd, some Democrats are now pushing for another 100,000 more militarized cops just as reproductive health is criminalized and Alec is here with us now to weigh in. Welcome. Thank you for having me. Yeah, thanks for joining us. So you say you have seen things like this and I mean, I know you're right. Obviously, we see similarly, occasionally violent videos like this when they're caught on camera. They go viral. They enter the public domain. But if we're only, you know, we're only seeing the ones where it happens to be someone records it, how much more common is it? It's absolutely ubiquitous. In all of my time in my years as a public defender and my years as a civil rights lawyer representing people charged with crimes all over the country, this is the kind of thing that happens every single day in every single city in the country. We had a little joke at each of the public defender's offices that I was at, where if you saw certain charges, like for example, resisting arrest or assault on a police officer, it was almost certain that your client was going to be in the hospital. And almost to a fault, every time I went into the neighborhood and investigated, I talked to several witnesses each time I would talk to the client, I would talk to their family. They always had the same story, which is that they were brutally beaten by the cops, often tased, sometimes shot. And they were charged in order to basically cover it up because in many places, it makes it much more difficult and not impossible to sue the police for brutal beatings if you're also charged with a crime. Yeah, and this is part of the conversation we've been having for a while over qualified immunity after the George Floyd uprising in 2020, many folks who are perhaps unfamiliar with the ubiquity of these kinds of moments were horrified by what they saw on camera. And there was a lot of public support for some substantial criminal justice reform. Unfortunately, the George Floyd Justice and policing act, which many folks again didn't think went far enough, didn't pass either in part because of these conversations, his disputes about qualified immunity with conservatives feeling very strongly that they did not want to get rid of it. What do you make of that ongoing debate? I think obviously qualified immunity is a ridiculous doctrine. It was invented at a full cloth by the Supreme Court that's no basis in the history or text of the Constitution. It has no basis in the history or text of US statute 1983, which is the provision that the Supreme Court has applied it to. It's a complete joke. I think it's much more important to understand though that the qualified immunity only applies to civil liability. The only relevance of that doctrine is whether you can sue an individual cop for harming you or other public employees and what legal standard is applied to that case. It's often treated by people on the left as some kind of panacea for everything that's wrong with police misconduct. But even in the places that don't have qualified immunity, you're not seeing criminal charges for most of these incidents of brutality. You're not seeing police brutality end. Really all qualified immunity does is shift who pays you if you are beaten. In many places, even when there is no qualified immunity, the police are just indemnified by the local government or various forms of insurance. It's actually, I think, a red herring to talk about the issue of police violence and police brutality, which has plagued this country since well before the Supreme Court invented the doctrine of qualified immunity as some sort of solution to this much more significant problem. I just want to also note that it's not just a conservative or liberal issue. The biggest proponents of ending qualified immunity are people like the Libertarian Cato Institute and others who have a much more originalist view and perspective on textual interpretation of law and also who, at least in that one area, are more able to see the incredible ineffectiveness and inefficiency an absolute horror of state-sponsored violence. So what would you suggest, Alec? What is causing some of the lack of accountability? Is it just these structural issues with how police are recruited and the culture of these police institutions? Is it a criminal justice system that uses a reasonable man standard when assessing whether or not a police member has acted appropriately? There's this reasonable policeman idea that basically allows them to act with impunity. What would you focus on as one of the core things to shift to have better outcomes here? I think there's a very important fundamental point that's much more basic than any of the things that we're talking about now. And that is that the vast bulk of police violence is utterly legal. So for example, in this country, there are more arrests over the last couple of decades for marijuana possession than for all so-called violent crime combined. Think about what it means to be arrested for marijuana possession or anything else. You are caged, you have metal chainspin on your body, you're separated from your children, you're put in a cage where you're unlikely to be given any medical care or your ongoing medications, you lose your job, you lose your house, you're extraordinarily likely to be sexually assaulted or to contract an infectious disease. This is perfectly legalized violence. This is the vast bulk of what police do. I don't think most people understand that 96% of what police do is what they themselves call non-violent. Only 4% of their time is dealt with things like what they call violent crime. The vast bulk of it is low level enforcement and surveillance and control and sort of brutal repression of mostly poor people. What is often lost in these discussions is most of the police violence is legal. So if I was just walking down the street smoking a cigarette, the constitution protects me from even being stopped by the police. But if I put a little marijuana in that cigarette, all of a sudden the law allows me to be seized, to have metal chainspin on my body, to be taken away from my church and my school and my home and my family and my job, that is violent. In any other context, it would meet the legal definition of kidnapping. So when we talk about the need to change the conception of policing in this country, it's much deeper than this. And that leads me to a more direct answer to your question, which is what is the actual purpose of policing? One of the reasons that there has never been a single reform in the history of American policing since 1900, that has significantly reduced police brutality, is that most people have entirely the wrong conception of what the police force is trying to do. Most people think that police force is a genuine, highly trained, well organized government response to control violence and protect people against crime. That's actually a marketing ploy that the police developed in conjunction with police unions in the second half of the 20th century. In the first half of the 20th century, it was much more widely understood that police had like three main functions. Early on, they were supposed to brutally crush and surveil and control newly freed black people and people who are running away from slavery. Then as the 20th century began, their main function in the northeast and throughout the Midwest was to control striking workers and laborers. And the third main function of police is to protect the private property and well of the people who own things. And so those are the historical functions of police. It's only actually relatively recently that they developed this idea that their goal is to serve and protect people. So if you have a force whose actual goals are to control the poor and to crush social movements like they did with the black panthers and the new left and environmental movements that we can see them doing with the protests to the abortion rulings and environmental protests. Now, if you actually understand the function of policing as its goal is to violently crush people and to crush people who don't have power in our society, then you understand why there has never been a single successful reform. So we need to stop talking about things like the reasonable man's standard and the qualified immunity standard. And we need to have a serious social conversation about what are the police doing, whose interests are they protecting, and why is it that the vast bulk of what they do has nothing to say about what they actually tell us their purposes? I don't know. I think that goes a little further than I would be willing to concede even as a libertarian. I mean, doesn't the concept of policing, I mean, it doesn't even originate in America, right? It originates in what the English tradition in like the 17th, 18th century, right? I mean, that was not all that was about keeping cities and streets safe to some degree. Wasn't it, am I wrong? I think in early English history, it was really about controlling poor people and debtors. It was a way for the rich to sort of use state violence in a more professionalized way. I think what I was talking about in particular is really the history of US policing, which I think is beautifully captured in the history our enemies in blue or the end of policing to our great books. I think the if you look at the actual history of US policing, what I was really talking about was what I would call the professionalization of US police over the course of the 20th century. They went from becoming sort of small time roving bands of people that really served the interests of particular political bosses in particular cities into a massive organized unionized professionalized force that has access to incredibly sophisticated surveillance technology, incredibly sophisticated military weaponry. And if you look at the history of the use of that surveillance of the military weaponry, if you just look at who police are arresting people from, police aren't arresting wealthy people for wage theft, right? They're arresting poor people or shoplifting. Even though wage theft is a problem about five times all other property crime combined. They're not arresting wealthy people for tax evasion. Even though tax evasion is a problem 63 times all other crime combined, all other property crime combined. So you have to look at the evidence of what police actually do. And then you can look at the history of how they unionized and professionalized and developed and went from sort of unarmed people walking a local community to highly professionalize, highly organized, highly political actors. All right. Well, these guys got suspended with pay. Didn't my friend David Weigel when he Washington Post reporter tweeted an offensive joke suspended without pay for an entire month? Dave Weigel got the book thrown out of harder than these cops. Beating someone's head in into the sidewalk. Alec, thank you so much for joining us today. We appreciate it. Thank you for having me. And we'll be back with more rising right after this. Using the authority Congress grant at the Department of Education, we will forgive $10,000 in outstanding federal student loans. In addition, students who come from low-income families, which allowed them to qualify to receive a Pell grant, will have their debt reduced $20,000. Both of these targeted actions are for families who need it the most. I will never apologize ever helping Americans working Americans in middle class, especially not to the same folks who voted for a $2 trillion tax cut that mainly benefited the wealthiest Americans and the biggest corporations that slowed the economy didn't do hell a lot for economic growth. Mr. President, is this unfair to people who paid their student loans or chose non-takeout loans? Is it fair to people who in fact do not own the $1 billion businesses if she want these guys to get more actions? Is that fair? What do you think? That was President Biden at the White House yesterday announcing perhaps one of the boldest moves by his administration thus far. Student loan forgiveness, a lifeline for the working class, or as some think just bad economics. Our rising panel joins us now to weigh in. Ashta Taylor is author of Democracy May Not Exist, a political organizer and director of What Is Democracy. And Brad Palumbo is policy correspondent for feed.org and co-founder of Based Politics. Welcome to you both. Thanks. Brad, let's start with you. You know, a lot of people have been pointing not just to the overwhelming sums of money that were forgiven with the PPP program including to folks like Kim Kardashian and Paul Pelosi and other very rich elites. They also point to Trump's tax cuts, which were valued at 1.7 now. Some people are valued at 2.3 at an enormous cost to an American which overwhelmingly went to the top percentage of the country. So why so much pushback now that there is a policy that's targeted to get to the bottom 60% of people in the country, people who were too poor to pay for college out of pocket and who had to take out student debt? Yeah, look, maybe actually we have a point of agreement there. I was a critic of PPP from the beginning. I said it's corporate welfare. Big companies ended up getting the most benefit. It was wildly inefficient. I opposed that. But as far as I'm concerned, two wrongs don't make a right. I think the Trump tax cuts is a whole different story because in that case, you're letting people keep their own money, not giving them someone else's, which is ultimately what taxpayer or what student debt cancellation is. There's no such thing as cancellation. It's a transfer. We can argue for it or against it. But ultimately, according to the Warden School of Business's analysis, it'll cost taxpayers $300 billion. That averages out to about 2,000 per federal taxpayer. That's a lot of money. And it's mostly helping a relatively more affluent slice of society. The income caps are good. But even with that, according to that Warden analysis, 73% of the benefits go to the top 60%, which means the bottom 40%, right? The working class, the poor, the people that progressives say this is supposed to help get less than a third of that benefit or about a third of that benefit. So it is ultimately a redistribution that helps mostly affluent people on the backs of working class taxpayers who are already struggling right now. So to be clear, Brad, that $2,000 per taxpayer you're talking about is over a 10-year period. And the average student debtor, and correct me if I'm wrong here, Astra is going to be, who is paying about $300 a month. Many more people are paying much higher amounts than that. Moreover, the analysis that you cited that said the top 60% are being benefited, it's also the bottom 60% as we spoke about yesterday with Sparky Abraham, because what it really is, is the middle of the country that it's often appealed to through mortgage grants and all kinds of policies for the middle class that are being helped here. So Astra, I want to ask you this, I'll give you a chance to respond. Do you see some inconsistency here between how other kind of tax breaks to the middle classes are pitched, as well as tax breaks from a very rich, like the Trump tax cuts, versus how people are interpreting this tax break, as it were, this listing alone cancellation for those who took out educational debt. Oh. We can't hear. Hold on. Hold on, Astra. We got to do that again. Sorry. When we talk about 60% for the first act. Go ahead. Sorry. When we're talking about 60%, 40%, these numbers are flying around, we're talking about people who took out student loans, right? So these student debt is already means tested. Rich people do not take out student debt due to college. They or their parents more likely are able to pay the cost upfront. So, you know, we are already talking about people in need who had to borrow to get an education. Absolutely. There's a double standard going on. We see, you know, we did not see anything like this amount of hand ringing over PPP loans. On average, the forgiveness granted was $90,000, but many rich individuals and big corporations got much more than that. You know, of course, there was also all of the bad corporate debt that the government stepped in and purchased at the beginning of the pandemic, the bank bailouts of 2008, which actually launched the debt cancellation movement. So 100% we see this double standard time in time again. We also need to push back on just some of the assumptions that are floating around here too. For example, I want to lift up a piece by Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist that just came out today that said, you know, this is this is not going to be inflationary at all. If anything, it might reduce inflation precisely because of some of the ways of costing things out as Brianna said, you know, when we look at this over the long term, you know, this is really, you know, a rounding error error in terms of federal government spending. If I would just hop in with a quick response to that, I'd just say that, you know, facts are stubborn things. In the notion that rich people don't have student debt, it's false because people who go on to become rich have student debt. So you're right, if your parents are Bill Gates, you're not going to have student debt, but say that you go and your parents aren't Bill Gates, you become a lawyer and you make 500 grand a year now, you still probably have a lot of undergrad student debt. It's a fact, a University of Chicago study found that full student debt cancellation would benefit the top 20%, six times more than the bottom 20%. Most Americans didn't go to college, only people who went to college benefit from student debt cancellation. And guess what? They make more money. They tend to be more affluent. That's why people go to college. These are the facts of it. We can defend it. We can debate it, but it benefits affluent people as a matter of fact. And look, like Brad, I was against the PPV loans. I was against the bank bailouts. I was against the auto bailouts. I was against the airline industry bailouts. I'm against, you know, unfair tax breaks. I want to reduce everybody's taxes and spend less, but I don't want to give special favoritism that any special corporations, I've, you know, and I'm besieged right now on Twitter because I've been complaining about the, about Biden's plan. And it's like, oh, did you say that when Trump's debt's got to forget? Yeah, Trump's a crook. I don't want to be president. You think, you're mean, Robbie, what it is is that a lot of people. So you say it's double standard, but how is it double standard? What I've complained about. I'll explain it to you because the tone and tenor of the way that you're reacting away, so many people reacting to this student debt cancellation is qualitatively and quantitatively different than whatever internal frustration or, or moderately expressed frustration you might have had with the PPP loan cancellation. We did not, facts are stubborn things you say, Brad. We did not have this robust public conversation when the PPP loans were canceled without fanfare earlier this year. Reporters were not shouting down Joe Biden saying, why was it, why is it fair for these millionaires and billionaires who donate to your campaigns and the campaigns the Republicans and Democrats alike and our corporate plutocracy? Why is it so, why is it fair that Paul Pelosi and all of these people get their loans canceled? That is not a conversation. So it's not really fair to hear us. I can respond to just one of your other points. Lawyers, very, very, very few lawyers make $500,000 a year and I can say this is not just an attorney myself. I got it from Harvard Law School at the top, you know, at the top of the profession and I know almost no one who makes that sum. And when they do make that sum, they pay off their loans. I have colleagues who paid off their loans very quickly because they did in fact have very high paying jobs. A few of them really get to pay off other people's debt. I'm sorry, Brad. A few of them were able to do so within, let's say five years or so. Those people who have high incomes absolutely should be taxed at very high rates. But we should not try to have a corrective tax policy where rich people aren't given win falls by punishing people. The overwhelming majority of whom are low income and who have to take out loans to go to college. 40% of people who have student debt were unable to finish their degrees. Many of them, because they were unable to have the money to pay for and finish their degrees. And when you talk about the top 20% of owners, we talk about the 99% versus the 1% precisely because there is such an enormous income gap between the top 1% and the rest of the country. So when you're talking about the top 80% of owners, of earners, people who earn 70, 80, 90,000 dollars a year are in that top echelon that you're talking about. And yes, people who do graduate from college tend to earn more money. That's the whole point of graduating in the college. And what people are fighting for here is for everyone to have that opportunity to go to college regardless of how much your parents make and whether they are able to dig into their pockets. And mommy and daddy are able to pay for your total tuition. Right. So Ash, I want to give you a test to get in there. That's not the story for a lot of people. The reason it's so vitriolic, this backlash is because it's personal for people. Joe Biden is making suckers out of people like me. I went to a public college. This is not true. Education is a public good that should be publicly funded. It makes you a million dollars more over your lifetime. It's a personal investment in your own future. American people have been told that the only path to a decent life, excuse me, you've spoken a lot. Americans have been told that the only path to the middle class is to pursue higher education. This is why millions of people have done it. And student debt, if you're so concerned about taxes, student debt is a tax on poor and working class people who are trying to pursue upward mobility. And the government, the way loans are structured, causes them to pay off, well, often many more times the principal. This is what calling it debt forgiveness is a joke. Many people have paid back many times more than what they've worked than what they've worked. They are stuck in a debt trap for what should be a public good. Student debtors are taxpayers. These are the same categories of people. People are doing what they have been told, which is pursue higher education. And asking for debt translation is utterly reasonable, given what they have paid. And the $10,000, 20,000 in some cases has been granted, is a really trivial amount considering what people have endured. So I understand where you're coming from. But I find it so if we're saying that this process of making these loans, it puts people in ruinous shape, a lot of people, they're so bad off, they're swindled, they're scammed. Why are we not then changing that system? Isn't that the thing we have to change the system? We're going to be right back here in five more years. If we, like people, if you're saying people should not take these loans, then the government should not make these loans. I would support that policy. Yes, the government should not make these loans that should fund higher education directly. It's far more efficient than you get rid of the predatory loan servicers, the profit tiers. And when you fund higher education with public money, you can say, keep the costs down, institutions, stop rising tuition. You can say, stop underpaying your staff, you know, stop exploiting your workers. There can be conditions on public money. Right now, you know, funding education through a very inefficient system, right, by subsidizing this lending program. Let's get rid of that. Let's get rid of all the bureaucracy and the red tape. We can save hundreds of millions of dollars a year by getting rid of the draconian debt collection system that is just pushing people further into poverty. Let's reallocate those funds to education. The Department of Education should be in the business of providing education, not, you know, lending and debt collection. Brad, I think you were going to bring up your own situation. And if that's not the case, feel free to react otherwise. But you know, you and other people I've seen online are sharing their stories right now of, you know, all the links they went to to not accrue massive debt that's going to be forgiven to making different educators either, you know, paying it some other way or choosing to go to a different institution, one that is affordable. I paid off my debt. I just want to say that. I've paid off my debt as well. Anyone else have to do that. Everybody paid off their debt. I paid off my debt. That's great. My only point is that millions of Americans right now are at home feeling like absolute suckers because I went to a state school where I got a scholarship. I didn't have millionaire parents either. I worked as a security guard nights from a week before my school started. I graduated in three years with a credit overload all to avoid student debt. And I wish I could take back those 24 hour shifts I worked on long weekends because now, you know, I should have just ran up the charge and gotten 10k and federal loans and then had Uncle Sam take care of it. And the thing is, we're not spiteful. It's not like we just don't want other people to have nice things. It's right. That's not the case. We don't want to pay for it. We don't want to pay more in taxes so that y'all don't have to pay back the return on your investment that will earn you a million more dollars over your average. For $100,000 a year. No, I do not. Because Joe Biden has promised not to raise taxes for anyone who earns less than $400,000 a year. You already know that's not true. There's this really interesting dynamic that's happening right now that for public policy reasons, Joe Biden and many people have agreed on both sides of the aisle that $400,000 represents some kind of middle class status below which everybody shouldn't have their taxes raised. Now, I would couple with that number, but it seems very peculiar that when it comes to student debt cancellation, anybody who earns over $125,000 is apparently a richy rich who doesn't deserve to have this benefit. But $400,000 is the level. So, this is a point that a lot of people in this movement have been making for a long time. If you think that the tax system is regressive, if you think that there are some outlier cases where people recent graduate or whatever who are pretty affluent, who do have debt but have a lot of earning potential, are going to get a winful, why not just tax their income or even better tax their wealth since that's the better predictor of who or who is actually suffering it in the world, right? Because income is precarious. Why not just have a wealth tax or a billionaire tax, which is a very popular bipartisan policy, instead of trying to enact tax policy through this policy, which is supposed to be reform in our education system, Brad? Yeah, look, because those taxes may be formally levied on billionaires or on wealth, but they have economic ramifications that hurt people throughout the economic spectrum. And Biden has already broken his problems. Like what? This $400,000, the raising taxes, joint committee on taxation, all these people have found the IRS increase will hurt the middle class. The corporate tax is an acting would be more in part by workers. Economists agree. Can you talk about how people are going to be hurt? You said that these policies are going to hurt the worker. How so? By because I'll have to pay more in taxes to pay off somebody else's debt. Ultimately, they'll have more debt. They'll have more money printing or they'll directly have more taxes. The reason why people don't have to meet an American people who are in debt is because there's not enough federal spending for the things people need like education, health care, housing, transportation. Federal spending is actually what will help reduce personal debt. And the fact that we are forced to debt finance these necessities of life, the American people are not going to be hurt if billionaires are taxed. And that money is not just billionaires. But the fact is we don't need to tax billionaires. We can spend federal money on the things we need right now. Do you support? We're 30 trillion in debt. We've been doing that. It's not working out great. Brad, Brad, do you support a billionaire's tax? No. Okay. This is where we are. We're not born with a lot of donations far beyond just billionaires. Brad, you could confiscate the entire network. It won't even hurt billionaires. They'll still be rich. They'll still need the time for re-eats than they could ever use. Brad, we can't just tax the rich. We're skating everybody's net worth. Elizabeth Warren's billionaire tax was two cents. Two cents every dollar over like 500 million. Government for even a year. Wait a minute, Brad. Wait a minute, Brad. You have to tax more than just the rich. Federal government can spend without taxation. That's why we have deficits. The question is, are deficits used to enrich regular people? That's literally not true. I'm really sorry, but you said facts are stubborn. You're ignoring a lot of economic realities here. There is a disproportionate influence, emphasis on money that is given to working people and ignoring money that is given to PPPs. There are millionaires. Wait a minute. We said we were against it. Wait a minute. It's not about whether you're born or against it. The point is that that conversation, the conversation about whether or not that's inflationary is never had. We're not sitting here talking about the supply chain crisis, which is largely out of a lot of people's control and how inflationary that is. We're not talking about the Ukraine war and how inflationary that is on gas. Who's the way in that? Wait a minute, right here in the context of this conversation. So I respect concerns about inflation, but they seem a little bit in bad faith when they're only brought up in the context of this one time that a transfer is being given to people who are working, people who are debtors, people who are trying to take on education as the education loans as they've been instructed to do for decades by a country that didn't want to actually deal with an unemployment crisis and economic precarity among many groups of people who were then ushered into these loans and to go to college. And now Brad, you're sitting here telling me that you don't, you're worried about the deficit and you're worried about inflation. You're worried about that spending, but you're not worried enough about very rich people's spending to actually want to tax it and pay for some of these social services that make our country better. I mean, you'll go back in London, be sure to smash the program. I will bring or hit many more of the goals of this. Most of the guests we have on from the right here. I can't control other people. I've been consistent. So most of the guests we have on from the right are against the PPP loans, the spending on Ukraine. We rail again. You want the poor astro that's right. Having to take out debt to go to college and to the tax on working people. If I go in my U. You can't make up definitions. That's not what the tax is. The tax is an optional. You can't choose to have a tax. No, because here's what happens. Someone like me, I paid more to go to college than someone, my classmates sitting next to me in the chair, whose parents were rich because I didn't pay the, let's talk about law school because I actually paid all of my law school tuition, my mother helped with undergrad. But I paid, if I paid over a 10-year loan, I paid 240-ish thousand dollars on a 180,000 degree because of interest. A rich kid pays 180,000 dollars for the same education I have. That's what happens when we have interest rates. I had a 7.5 loan and an 8.5 loan interest rate coming out of college in 2007 going into law school in 2008. That's what we're talking about. So instead of having people who have less money, having to pay more for the same services and opportunities, we should provide it free through the public college system per asterisk point. But in the interim, get some relief for these debtors and to the extent that you're concerned about the deficit and funding of those kinds of things, there is always the option to tax the rich. There's always the option, as Bernie had in his plan, to tax Wall Street transactions in order to fund free public college. But nobody ever wants to do that because there's no solutions coming out of the right. At the end of the day, you just want it to list the world where only rich people can go to college. No, I don't. I have plenty of solutions we can talk about to end the cost of college and the administrative blow, you know, and the federal subsidies that have jacked up the cost. I agree with you, there's a problem. We can even talk about forgiving interest on federal loans. I'm not saying there's no problem here, but I will say big government intervention caused a lot of it in the first place and a taxpayer bailout at the worst possible time isn't a good idea just because we've done bad things in the past. One off taxpayer bailout without any reforms to the system whatsoever. Astro will give you the last word. Look, this is a problem where the solution is incredibly obvious. We can use federal funds to solve the problem at the source by funding full public higher education for everyone who wants to attend. I totally believe that people should be able to live dignified lives to earn a living wage without having to go to college. But in this world, we need college educated people. We need nurses. We need teachers. We need therapists. We need all sorts of career fields that require higher education. We need lawyers who can go into to be public defenders and not just work for big corporations. And the fact is spending that federal money will make us all richer in the long run. It's good for the government to do good things. This amount of relief is a great first step, but you know, we're going to come for the rest of it. So get ready all. All right. That was the fiery debate we had promised our viewers on this subject that we are all pretty passionate about. So Astro Brad, thank you so much for participating. Thank you guys. Thanks. And we'll have more rising in just a minute. Yeah. Yesterday, Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene tweeted that she had been swatted just after 1 AM. According to NBC, police rushed to Greene's Georgia home on Wednesday after a false report of the shooting there. Authorities said calling it an incident of swatting. The police report shows two separate calls, one to officers at 1 0 3 AM, that alleged that a man had been shot five times in a bathtub after checking up on Greene police received another call to officers from the same computer generated voice. And the suspect stated that they quote were upset about Mrs. Greene's political view on transgender youth rights, according to the report. Marjorie Taylor Greene gave an interview on Newsmax following the news. Let's watch. Here's the the very terrifying truth of it. This is how they get people killed. So this person that made this phone call intentionally wanted me to be killed by police officers because they are our base. It's like political terrorism. They hate my views and they hate the legislation that I introduced last week to protect Children's Innocence Act. And this bill would make it a felony, a class C felony by federal law to perform gender affirming care on Children under the age of 18. So that is not hyperbole. This is very dangerous doing this and people have absolutely gotten killed for this. Usually this happens with the most common type of occurrence is when people are playing online video games. It gets very heated young men and there have been several instances I remember writing about one. I can't remember where it was, but a case where someone called it said, yeah, it said, hey, call the police said there's guns or explosives or something. There's a hostage situation at a certain address. And it was actually not even the address of the other person. So the cops showed up to a random person or might have been where this person used to live, but it was a different family and they they killed something. So it's not really honestly, and we criticize the police a lot. It's not here the blame is not really on the police necessarily in this. Well, if they're being told, if they're being given the information that this is a hostage scenario, this person has a bomb, this person has a gun, they're the weapon, the person who made that false report is essentially guilty of attempted murder and the punnet, this is not just filing a false police report. It's difficult. So it obviously is, you know, also filing a false police report, but there is this way, weird way that it also seems to me to be an indictment of the police and the police practices, if they are in a position to intervene, ostensibly in order to protect and serve, because they've been called to intervene on a domestic disturbance of some kind and are so reckless and dangerous that there is a high school likelihood that they will kill a innocent person. So even if this were a true scenario, the police would have to enter the house and try to figure out who the victim or who the perpetrator was. And the idea that they are conducting themselves in such a way and engaging in this high risk activities in such a way that could have resulted in them bursting into Marjorie Taylor Greenminder, home and business center kitchen and end up killing someone, it's a little bit of a mis-fry idea. Well, but if they're specifically told this is a hostage situation or this guy is shooting people, I mean, like, we have called on the Uvalde police to storm that classroom, guns blazing and shoot that guy. If they're told that is the situation, the person who gave them that false information on purpose has committed the crime. A serious crime. It wasn't that they didn't immediately bust down the door and start spraying a classroom with bullets. I think that we would also have concerns if they did that and killed a bunch of kids in the process. The concern is that they mose it around that on the hallway without even trying to get a door open for over an hour while kids were being shot inside and they heard live gun fliers. So, I'm just, this is like a nuanced point, but it does seem to me that the risk that a regular person cooking dinner or whatever in their house would be storm by police because the police call them does speak to the lack of perception, the lack of strategic assessment that goes in before a person would enter a house. Even if it were a hostage situation, the police would have to make some assessment to make sure that they're shooting the right person in a house situation and the fact that they don't is exactly how it gets situations like the Breonna Taylor case. Well, right. I mean, the police didn't need to, the police did not need to initiate the Breonna Taylor situation the way that they did. They, yes, I have been critical of these police tactics. Right. They knock down her door in the middle of the night and so when you, the police sometimes do that in a way, so if you do that, obviously the person is going to think they might think they're being robbed. They might think they might reach for their gun thinking they're under assault not from the police, but so those are really foolish tactics. But if you, if you, if the police are told that they're, if they're explicitly told that they're going to have to enter a very dangerous situation with an armed maniac who is killing people, okay, it can still, there can still be a failing if they, you know, take action that is wrong and they kill an innocent person. Obviously, what I'm saying in this case, but the main, it should be considered like just like you are a participant in the crime and, well, and, but the stats of the statutes, because I've written about this, the statutes in many states are not strong enough. I mean, I rarely recommend new laws ever libertarian. They should be, the statute should be enhanced for this kind of, for squatting, for people who make, yeah, people make a false police report of this kind. It's not just a false police report. It's attempted murder. And she's right. That's, that's what a person who makes this kind of call. That's, that's, and this is, it's not like this has just happened to right wing people just having to David Hogg. This happened to, this happens to famous people all the time. It is, it is, it needs to be punished, harshly punished and harshly disincentivized by cracking down on the people who do it. I mean, that's just no other way around it. So I hope they catch whoever, whoever made the call if that's possible. And there is some dispute, about who in fact did make the call as we read, the person who made the call expressed discontent over Marjorie Taylor Greene's legislation that is perceived by some to be targeting trans people and their ability to get medical treatment. But there are some discussion, and I'm sure that people will figure it out eventually as to whether or not that is a false law source time, time will tell. Yeah, I had that thought it's, it's totally possible. I mean, it happens in the reverse situation a lot, a lot of hate crimes or hate incidents on college campuses in particular. We just had this Michigan governor Whitmer case kind of resolving recently. That, yeah, and also I've seen a lot of cases that were at my own, my own university Michigan where I went. Yeah, they were, I can recall several cases when I was there and after someone said they were, they were targeted because they were Muslim or something. And it's usually they did. There was that great classic case of the someone of the person who said that like a black person had held them down and carved like a B for black in their cheek, but the B was written backward as though you drew it in a mirror. Sorry not to make fun because of course there's a lot of, or there's a lot on campuses. There are a lot of like accidental hate crimes. Like so many of them, someone hung a new sit in front of it. It was not intended to be in this. Yeah, you throw out your messy throat of an anemas, a trash bag. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. So well, some figures on the right have called out Green's opponent for tweeting that MTG must be stopped after he linked to an MSNBC article that says Green has officially declared war in the trans community. And according to police fake 911 caller swatted Green again this morning. Officers responded once again to her home around 3am. I don't think if all he had said was we have to stop Marjorie Taylor Greene. That's just that's surely benign. Yeah. And and conservatives got to be careful here if they're going to say that's because liberals have criticized conservatives for you know the the very um you know extreme defeat the Dems rhetoric from like from Sarah Palin in the past remember she was accused of it being her fight. She was explicitly accused it was that it was her fault the Tucson shooting because because she had had some kind of map with targets over but of course the shooter had never seen that and there's no evidence he was motivated by Sarah Palin whatsoever. She ended up suing the New York Times over getting getting this wrong like years after the effect. So we always want to be and it's so tempting for both sides to be like oh well this is now I get to blame Democrats or now I get to blame Republicans the baseball shooting that it's so easy and in the very same people who will say well I'm not my rhetoric is not responsible for other people's actions. I know I didn't call for explicit violence. They'll say that and then when there's any opportunity for them to accuse the other side of doing that they will take it every single time. Yeah and you've been really consistent on that Robbie and I appreciate that. I think you're right. Thank you. entirely. All right more rising in just a minute. You have people like Fauci saying that his lockdowns didn't cause any permanent damage to any young kids. I got news for you it did and we are going to reap those rewards across the whole country for years and years and years because they treated kids so poorly and I'm just sick of seeing him. I know he says he's going to retire. Someone needs to grab that little elf and chuck him across the pauma. All right that was some spicy rhetoric from Florida Governor Rhonda Santis. A potential likely perhaps even presidential candidate in the next cycle. I agree with him that and we criticize or I criticize at least earlier this show this week. Fauci's comments saying that he didn't think it harmed that permanently harmed anyone and that I mean that's just not true. People committed suicide. I mean people really did suffer. Because not just not because of the disease. Some people suffered obviously because of the disease but some people suffered more so because of the restrictions so I take his point on that. I would not have used the words throw him or kick him across the pauma. I think when I thought the words little elf. Robbie would you be so awful? Elves? Well okay elves are not little first of all. Okay. Elves are tall. Here comes the dungeon master. Hundreds they live for hundreds of years. Tolkien has set the standard for what elves are and look like elves are more like vampires essentially. Okay outside of D&D. If you want a little we're talking warms. We're talking gnomes. We're talking various other creatures. Okay the point being that I think that he rightly anticipates that he's going to get in the republican party can get a lot of traction out of some legitimate frustrations that a lot of parents have had over the way the shutdowns were handled. Moreover I think that many people were pointing out on that clip that he seems to be very purposefully adopting a very Trumpian style of manner. I know people are saying that. Have you seen a person distitulating like this other than Donald Trump? You're not an angler. I'm very much an angler. Not as much as me. No I definitely do see it but I find it to be less effective that's a weird kind of a thing to say. Look I think that Donald Trump with a TV star. Donald Trump do with his hands of deaths right? It is the turning of the hands. It's like this motion which I think is very specific to him I gotta say and that I'm seeing from Rhonda Santas here. Many many people have tried to mimic Barack Obama over the years. We've seen Beto O'Rourke do it. We've seen you know Julian Castro try his hand at it. We've seen a lot of people who judge most basically. There are those who say and I think it doesn't work. None of these people I mean maybe you gotta be your own person. You gotta be your own person. It doesn't work and it actually I think can remind people of the budget version of the original that they're actually getting. That the fact that they're not getting the real thing and so as we see more and more of Rhonda Santas I'll be really curious to see how public opinion shifts and how much he's able to still capture the idea that he's an inheritor of the crown of Trump. Especially if Trump is inserted back into politics because he runs for office. You know the most interesting thing to me about the DeSantis approach that is actually I wouldn't even characterize this as necessarily a Trump approach. It's really being pioneered as we speak by DeSantis and his team is how they want to handle the press. They are very consciously at Christina Pasha is this you know major press person for him. I think she was part of the governor's office is now on the campaign team. Her view and then the kind of view of the team is that they they speak to local media but they're not going to generally speaking not going to do interviews with with what they would term as hostile mainstream or progressive people and let them frame and tell their story. They don't do that. They sometimes when they get interview requests like that they actually just post them on Twitter and say we're not responding to this. They their view is they're not going to play the media's game. The media doesn't get to be this oh yeah we're you know we're the media so you have to you have to sit down for these interviews with us where we're going to mock you and hate you and try to destroy you because we actually are on the team that's against you but we're pretending that we're not on the other team. DeSantis team is not going along with that fiction anymore. I think that's smart especially because you get your media clip and then social media takes it to another dimension and gets it where it needs to go. So all you need is the interview. You don't need it to be necessarily on CNN to get the circulation exactly. They're gatekeepers. They don't need they don't need the mainstream media's framing of it. They can just speak directly to the people through social media or whatever. You know that's the gatekeeping effect that has been eroded by social media that allows candidates. I wish a lot of left candidates would learn that lesson. You know Bernie Sanders wasn't a pioneer in some respects. He had his own radio show and he had this kind of fireside chat style podcast before he ran in and even I think it was even predated 2016. And during the campaign he tried to devil in a little bit of that. I was in charge of the campaign podcast which came out once a week. We didn't actually use it to speak directly to the public in the way that I thought that he could have. There were also a lot of live stream events that got a lot of traction. If you're one of these people who's really big on Twitter and has a big social media following, the world is or oyster. You can really sidestep a lot of these hostile environments but most politicians Bernie included still choose to go into the lines then and face Whoopi Goldberg and all of the thoughts and things going to be interesting if increasingly they just don't. Republicans are going to take inspiration from this to Santa's approach and and do less and less of that. It's interesting. I think sometimes it can go too far like when we talked about you know to Santa's turning down or not wanting to be on the view. I think like if I was an advisor for him I'd say that's probably even if they're going to over the top mock you they then they look bad and you look good. So you have to be a little bit tactical about it. You have to know what the capacities of your principle are. Not everyone can handle that situation. You know for all that I don't care for his politics I think a peep-boo judge not that they would ever be hostile to them but to the extent they were I think he could handle it. AOC they were actually somewhat hostile to her on the last appearance I saw of her on there and she handled it very deftly. She's I mean she's she's good at talking to and working with people. Not everybody is like that and I do also think there's a lot of value. Couple of hairs. Exactly and sometimes if you do go into the lines then and they are super hostile to you and you come off as above it all that's a huge win for you. Absolutely. And we saw that with one of those early breakthrough interviews with Jordan Peterson where he went. Yes absolutely. And that one there. So you're saying like women should be killed or whatever she would just say these ridiculous things and he would respond so normal. For a long time that maybe convinced he was more than actually. Yeah exactly exactly. Okay more rising right after this stay with us. No vac joke of which will not be joining other players at the US Open. He tweeted this and put it up on screen. Sadly I will not be able to travel to New York this time for the US Open. Thank you. Noel Pham for your messages of love and support. Good luck to my fellow players. Etc. Etc. He's not able to come because he is not vaccinated and he's not a US citizen and we have this rule that is I think impossible to defend at this point that you can't come to the country unless you're a citizen if you're not vaccinated. So but this policy doesn't make. And so he chose not to get vaccinated because he's a very professional athlete. His risk calculation is probably that he's at minimal risk of COVID and he might have already had it. Who knows. But you know the while the vaccines have very you know small risks it could impact a high performance athlete. They could make the calculation that doesn't make sense for them. The US government will not allow people to make that calculation for themselves. There are other countries that want to come here even though other countries don't have this requirement. Yeah and even though obviously you can come and go from America. You can come and go without having the vaccine. So this is the issue that cracks in the inconsistencies and the policies are causing people to have. I think a lot of legitimate concerns about how well thought through these policies are. If you can come and go as an American if getting vaccinated isn't as tethered to your ability to spread COVID or affect your neighbors the way that people once thought it was. If you know it really is a personal health decision at what point are we going to keep doing this and having these policies when they're blowing up in such a high profile ways. Nope. There's no public health rationale you can make for this. If whether he's vaccinated or not does not at all impact how likely he is really to spread it to someone else. Now we're all kind of we've conceded that finally. It's just for his own benefit and he has made a different decision. It's really none of the government's business or anyone else's business. You know it just doesn't again this is not a policy that other countries have. In general don't we want to be friendly to immigrants and other countries and have an open society that's something why are you looking to me like that? I don't know I I do think it's a little bit of a stress to pretend that this is all about benevolent feelings about immigration and wanting people to be able to come in the country. Look I do think that there have been other times historically in the United States of America there have been very strong prohibitions against people coming in with all kinds of not just kind of communicable diseases but what were described as kind of defects different kinds of you know disabilities and there was this desire to have able-bodied people check and people checked out at Ellis Island for all kinds of things that we would consider to be ableist to exclude them from now not wanting feeble-minded people and all kinds of things like that. So I just not just this isn't what's going on here but just a little bit of historical perspective here. My ancestors. Everyone should be able to come no matter how they're hacking up in the garage. Lots of productive hard-working violent people. I could say that because it's my ancestors. But you can only knock your own you know your own category of ethnicity. I see you were doing little identity politics here Robbie. It's just for fun. It's been a long day getting into the the fun stuff. So anyway it's uh and we we've talked about Novak Djokovic on the show a lot. He's really been hampered in various places from having to deal with you know the COVID regime and you just can't you just can't make an argument anymore for keeping this in place. Now if he got like some kind of exemption or some kind of waiver you could then also argue well that's unfair. What if he didn't know what else. So clearly it's just the policy should be ended I think for everyone. Well maybe if more high-profile people like this do take these kinds of stands and there is public backlash against it. I haven't really been following this but I presume there has been some commentary from other people in that field other athletes sports commentators and the like about whether or not this is appropriate that it will help provoke the government to consider making some of these kinds of changes. I mean the CDC has come under a lot of scrutiny for its unwillingness to say maya kalpa and make some pivots at this moment and maybe this new changing of a guard without you and as a way out is an opportunity for them to have a reset with the general public. I think addressing a policy like this and its effects might be a good way to go about it. I'm not even sure what is this policy is this a DHS policy is this uh this is just the this is the FDA or the CDC's that's a that's a good question. I have no idea who who is managing the I get this is the this is forced on the airlines essentially right this is how this is being forced. How is it being forced? I guess you could just come in and know how could you know you have to you do have to present a vaccination form yeah I think you do and is it equivalent to what we had right I didn't go I was supposed to go and then I ended up not going because I wasn't feeling well I did it remotely because I was supposed to go to Canada to speak and I ended up not going and then it yeah it looked like I think I was going to have to take a test at that point to get back in this was months ago now oh to get back in it wasn't that Canada was prohibiting you from coming in I can't recall which way it was okay so you know this is from from the CDC non-citizen non-immigrant must be fully vaccinated to travel by air to the US so it does look like a yeah so that's what has to but but they'll always say that's just the guidance and DHS extends COVID-19 vaccination requirements DHS yeah it's DHS yeah great another wonderful idea from our national security state well that should be changed today tomorrow as soon as possible and we will have more rising right after this FBI agents were prohibited from investigating the infamous Hunter Biden laptop according to a report from various conservative media sources which say a whistleblower told GOP lawmaker senator Ron Johnson about it so this whistleblower is alleging the FBI's top brass did not allow any probes into the laptop to prevent influence on the 2020 presidential election so Ron Johnson's letter about this is pretty this is a pretty big claim if this is accurate big if true well it's big if true because as I said when we talked about the Twitter whistleblower and I've said about previous whistleblowers like okay this is we don't know who this person is this could be someone within acts to grind so you have to take it you have to just listen to it and and hope that more information comes out what the whistleblower is saying is that yeah the FBI slow rolled this they didn't want to do anything with it maybe they maybe it was because they were trying to shield Biden before the election maybe they just didn't like sincerely didn't believe it or like numerous law enforcement agents remember that you know numerous people signed a letter saying this has all the hallmarks of Russian disinformation that social media suppressed it based on recommendations from mainstream and liberal and democratic pundits and other news sources saying oh yeah this is probably Russian disinformation it's not Russian disinformation and it's now been verified over again that is true that he left this laptop at repair store it made its way to the near post it's that's never been called into doubt at this point seriously that is what happened so it would not be it is not unbelievable it would not be crazy at all that the FBI did in fact slow roll this because represent people former law enforcement officials former intelligence officials signed a letter saying oh yeah this is probably Russian disinformation so it would not be surprising if that is actually what the people inside the bureau thought yeah and you know I think this doesn't make it right but I think there probably also were some concerns given the blowback that the FBI got over the timing of the investigation into Hillary Clinton's emails in the election I think there was some implication in the article that you know they didn't want to get any more smoke they didn't want to get any more heat for interfering with the outcome of election to the extent that the hundred Biden laptop might have thrown things one way or the other they just didn't want to be in that position again which of course I don't think is an excuse for withholding information pretending that it's misinformation censoring information from being able to circulate freely on social media but it is an interesting context to think about right now in addition to the fact that there are some people who are going to perhaps look at this skeptically because we're in a place where skepticism of the FBI does help those who are looking to exonerate or take the heat off of Donald Trump that's he's being investigated right now I've spoken here on this show and elsewhere about how I think this is an opportunity for criminal justice reform advocates to go ahead and make the claims and critiques that they want to make about the FBI because those are legitimate critiques and to deal with prosecuting Trump separately if it is the case he has actually done something wrong but you know I do think that's going to be on the background of some people's minds as they consume the story I mean it's not because the agency is not they can't say well we're just trying to be neutral so we didn't want to do this during an election because they were not new and that would be one thing if they were just totally neutral but of course they weren't because people used the good name of the FBI to it's you know it's maybe undeserved good moral standing where I probably you and I as the leftist and the libertarian always had more skepticism about law enforcement to yourself as a leftist case of trying to be left I don't think I'm passing for a left to say well we did a lot of good police good policing segments not a student loans but but anyway the the the agency did not behave in a neutral manner because or at least people who are not neutral toward the 100 Biden story who were trying to say it was Russian disinformation we're saying you know we know because we were worked for the FBI so the FBI was thrust into it in a non-neutral way so they can't just they couldn't defend themselves from my point of view by saying well we just didn't want to you know do anything one way or the other well you did do something you did it in the in the not in the favorable to to Biden way yeah I mean I think that in addition to all of the you know subtext about the FBI right now there are some you know disproportionately liberals are going to look at this and say even if this is all real what is the news value of it why do I care that the president's son is engaged in all of the things that he's engaged with and I do think that those people who are trying to make the case that the FBI needs to be critiqued for showing bias or that the social media companies need to be critiqued should do more to make a substantive case for why there's news value here outside of just the censorship story and so to think some that there are real claims that there was some wrongdoing by hunter Biden that was facilitated by Joe Biden and some of the dealings in Ukraine and those kinds of things I would like to see to extend that it's true emphasis on those aspects of it as opposed to kind of the purian interest in you know hunter Biden's you know person like tavity's drug use those kinds of things 100 percent agreement I don't even write on for drug legalization I don't care if people you I don't think people should go to prison for using drugs I don't care if other people use drugs I think I know hunter Biden looks like someone who is struggling with addiction and some other things and I just I have sympathy for those people those people need help now the influence peddling is a is a actually serious potentially serious potentially criminal matter we don't know how much Joe Biden was involved in it but but yes and it is frustrating that the media is often very focused on the prudent exactly what you said the you know the pictures of him half naked with prostitutes and whoever else and using drugs and because it's it's salacious it was our attention but again I don't care it's it's that that should all be legal in my view yeah well we'll see what comes up this and this whistleblower claim in this letter um tomorrow on rising we will hand the baton over to Ryan Grimm and Emily Jashinsky is it Thursday already we've it's hard to believe time flies and you're having fun rapping is that what we've been
