Plus, the media continue to blame conservatives for a trans man shooting Christian school children. I'm Ben Shapiro, this is The Ben Shapiro Show. Today's show is sponsored by Expressive VPN. Do you like your web history being seen and sold to advertisers? No? Me neither. Get Expressive VPN right now at expressvpn.com. Slash, Ben. Well, they finally did it. They did it. They finally indicted Donald Trump. It's the thing that they have been seeking for years on end. Basically, since 2015, when Donald Trump decided that he was going to run for the presidency, certainly since he actually won the presidency in 2016, the left has been foaming at the mouth seeking the day when Donald Trump would be frog marched into a police precinct somewhere and then thrown in jail. And many prosecutors all over the nation have been aiming at this for a long time, but it was only Alvin Bragg, the brave and true. You know, the guy who won't prosecute like any crime in New York, but he definitely will prosecute a supposed misdemeanor that happened back in 2015. That guy, well, he is going for it. The grand jury yesterday finally decided they would go forward with the indictment of Donald Trump. Alvin Bragg tweeted out quote this evening, we contacted Mr. Trump's attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan DA's office for arraignment on a Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal. Guidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected. According to the New York Times, Trump's indictment comes on as many as 34 charges of falsification of business record. Now here's the thing. These charges, the falsification of business record charges and misdemeanor in order to elevate that to a felony so as to escape the statute of limitations and so as to effectuate probably an arrest in order for any of that to happen. They have to tie that to a campaign finance violation. The campaign finance violation, as we've talked about before, is specifically the question as to whether Stormy Daniels was paid off by Donald Trump using his own personal funds rather than using campaign funds when it actually was a quote unquote campaign expenditure. So the question is going to come down to whether Trump paid off Stormy Daniels because he would have paid her off at any time because he's for sure signed hush money payments before or whether he was doing it as an election expense and then failing to properly build that to his campaign instead paying it via Michael Cohen. Now Michael Cohen did go to jail on the basis of pleading guilty to something like that. But then Cyrus Vance, who is the DA in New York at the time, refused to elevate those charges against Trump. The feds refused to elevate campaign finance charges against Trump. Only Alvin Bragg seven years later is now doing this, which is kind of absurd. The New York Times says Donald Trump was indicted in Manhattan on Thursday for his role in paying hush money to a porn star, according to five people with knowledge of the matter, a historic development that will shake up the 2024 presidential race and forever mark him as the nation's first former president to face criminal charges. Listen, the Democrats have now broken the glass and they broke glass in case of emergency and now that glass is broken. It's going to be very hard to put it back together because here is the deal. Democrats do this all the time. They take a step that is absolutely unprecedented in American history. Say, kill the filibuster for judicial nominees and not very long afterward. The that entire process boomerangs around on them and Republicans are ramming through the Supreme Court nominees with 51 votes. Well, if you think this is the last time you're going to see a former president indicted, you got another thing coming. Now that Democrats have made clear, they are willing to go after a former president on the flimsiest of charges. And again, we'll get to how flimsy these charges are in just one second. You can just expect there will be politically motivated prosecutors on every side of the aisle going after everybody's favorite politicians. So we have now entered an era in which the opposition is basically under threat of legal indictment at all times. According to the New York Times on Thursday evening after news of the charges have been widely reported, the DA's office confirmed that Trump had been indicted and that prosecutors had contacted Trump's attorneys to coordinate his surrender. Three people with knowledge of matters that Trump was expected to turn himself in and face arraignment early next week, at which point the specific charges would be unsealed. Trump had for decades avoided criminal charges despite persistence, scrutiny and repeated investigation, creating an aura of legal invincibility. The indictment threatens to puncture. That's one way to put it in New York Times. The other way to put this is that this is a trumped up charge and that they are going after Trump mainly because Alvin Bragg want to make a headline and because Democrats had to have their day. This whole situation just smacks the check offs gun idea. There's this idea in theater. Take the playwright and then check off that if you put a gun above the mantle in the first act, it must be used by the end of the second act. The looming threat of an indictment on Trump, that's been the gun above the mantle since 2015. It was going to be used somewhere in here. Trump himself put out a statement in response in which he called Bragg a disgrace. Trump's actual statement reads, this is political persecution and election interference at the highest level in history. From the time I came down the Golden Escalator at Trump Tower, even before I was sworn as your president of the United States, the radical left Democrats, the enemy of the hardworking men and women of this country have been engaged in a witch hunt to destroy the make America great again movement. You remember it just like I do, Russia, Russia, Russia, the Mueller hoax Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine, impeachment, hoax one impeachment, hoax two, illegal and unconstitutional. Mar-a-Lago rate. And now this, that Democrats have lied cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to get to Trump. But now they've done the unthinkable in fighting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant election interference. Never before in our nation's history has this been done. The Democrats have cheated countless times over the decades, including spying on my campaign, but weaponizing our justice system to punish a political opponent who just so happens to be a president of the United States. And by far the leading Republican candidate for president has never happened before ever, says Donald Trump in his statement. Manhattan D.A. Alvin Bragg was handpicked and funded by George Soros as a disgrace. Rather than stop the unprecedented crime wave at taking over New York City, he's doing Joe Biden's dirty work, ignoring the murders and burglaries and assaults he should be focused on. This is how Bragg spends his time. And this is all Donald Trump's statement. I believe the switch home will backfire massively on Joe Biden. The American people realize exactly what the radical left Democrats are doing here. Everyone can see it. So our movement and our party united in strong will first defeat Alvin Bragg, then will defeat Joe Biden. We're going to throw every last one of these crooked Democrats out of office so we can make America great again. So listen, it's a shot in the arm to Trump's campaign. It's not a political level. We'll get to the politics of this after we get to the legality of all of this and what comes next in terms of procedure. Because things are going to get very spicy very quickly now.

Okay, so the next question is what happens next? So apparently Donald Trump is going to turn himself in. This has some ramifications, not only for Donald Trump's campaign, but also for the other campaigns, Rhonda Sanchez in particular, we'll get to that in a moment. First he will be fingerprinted. He'll be photographed. He might even be handcuffed. Now all of this for Trump's campaign again is a shot in the arm because the feeling that he has been viciously attacked for no reason other than they hate him is obviously going to boost him in the Republican primaries. Just politically speaking, that that is absolutely what it's going to do. Trump for political reasons is going to want pictures of himself being victimized by Alvin Bragg's ridiculous prosecution here and barring some sort of extraordinary change in the sealed charges from what we have seen before, it is a ridiculous legal case. Trump will almost certainly be accompanied to every step of the process by armed agents of the US Secret Service. They are required by law to protect him at all times to weird unprecedented situation. There'll probably be some accommodations made for him. He's just defended to arrested on felony charges are handcuffed, but it's unclear whether there'll be some sort of exception made for Trump, particularly because again, he's going to turn himself in and negotiate. His lawyers have already said he's not going to resist any sort of extradition or anything like that. The legality of the case itself is incredibly weak. Even Trump's most vicious enemies, people like Eli Mistall over at the nation. Even he says that this case is particularly weak. He suggests the odds the path to real justice level on prison time runs through the Manhattan DA's office still seem very, very long. He points out that Michael Cohen, who's their key witness initially lied to federal investigators. This makes him an not particularly good witness. The fact that the Southern District of New York has already looked at these charges and decided not to do anything, that the federal government looked at these charges and decided not to do anything. The fact that this is going to be a state of mind crime, really. How do you prove that Donald Trump paid off Stormy Daniels to keep quiet because of the election as opposed to he paid her to keep quiet because he just wanted to keep quiet? State of mind crimes are very difficult to prove. And ten crimes, particularly for Trump, are very, very difficult to prove. Again, Eli Mistall says so at the nation, very hard to think of somebody who hates Trump more than Eli Mistall. Unless it's maybe David French, David French over at the New York Times, says exactly the same thing. He says, most likely prosecutors will rely on an allegation of violating federal campaign finance law, specifically the claim that the Hush Money payments to Daniels were illegal campaign contributions. But this isn't a simple case to make. The prosecution might claim that state campaign finance laws apply to Trump and his payments violated New York law. But remember, we're talking about a presidential election, a federal statute expressly states relevant campaign finance laws supersede any state law. That is a formidable barrier to prosecuting Trump under state campaign finance laws. There's no obvious path around it. The claim that Trump violated federal law isn't necessarily frivolous, but his defense is really simple, which again is that the Hush Money payments had nothing to do with the election and everything to do instead with his desire to keep the story quiet. So is this prosecution actually going to succeed? Here's the thing. Everyone knows that the prosecution is so weak. If it does, people are going to feel it's one of the great miscarriages of justice in modern American history. If Donald Trump ends up being convicted on charges this flimsy, just because it's happening in New York where everybody hates his guts, can you imagine the political consequences for the country if that goes forward right now? Now, remember, this is only the first trial that Trump has on the docket. There may be others coming up. There's still something for the three other open cases against Trump. There's a special counsel, Jack Smith, on the federal level who's currently investigating whether he interfered with the peaceful transfer of power on January 6th. He's also investigating Trump's handling of classified documents. Both of those cases are still open again. I think both of those probably amount to nothing, but there's a Fulton County Dean and M. Fannie Willis again, a Democrat who's attempting to prosecute Trump on the basis that he tried to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia. So this may only be the first case against Donald Trump, obviously. So now we get to the political fallout. So again, in the primaries, there is no question this boost Donald Trump because every Republican in the world is going to swing behind Trump. They're going to say what is true, which is that he's being unfairly targeted. And Trump, the victim does really well among Republicans because there is the feeling, a correct feeling that if Trump were not a Republican, he would not be getting the treatment that if Trump were not standing in the way of a bunch of other people that the left desperately hates, he would not be getting this sort of treatment. So Trump is definitely going to get a boost from this. And here's the thing, I think Democrats know this. There's sort of an internal debate in conservative circles right now over whether Democrats are targeting Trump because they want to take him off the table for 2024 or whether they're targeting Trump because they actually want to elevate him in the primaries for 2024, knowing that if he wins the primaries, he will then lose the general election. This is the going theory in democratic circles, the same theory they used in 2015, 2016. They could be totally wrong, by the way. They could elevate Trump and then Trump could win, which is their worst nightmare. But it is certainly plausible from their perspective that if they indict Trump and Trump is then elevated in the primaries, and let's say he wins the primaries, does that win any independent voters in general election? Who voted against Donald Trump is now like, well, he was unfairly indicted. I'm going to vote for him this time. Very unlikely that you're going to swing a lot of voters in the sort of undecided category back toward Trump based on a flimsy indictment. Democrats seem to know this. I mean, like they're coming out of the woodwork this week, Democrats basically saying that they're hoping desperately for Donald Trump. Here's Joy Behar doing exactly that yesterday. I just, this is what they call a dwee. And Trump is the one who needs to get the nomination because then the Democrats will win. He's a two time loser already. He's a actress. Hello. And he also likes loser. Again, Democrats want Trump, George Conway, right, who's made his money for the past several years ripping on Donald Trump. He's actively encouraging to Santa's natural run this cycle is before the indictment came down. Quote, it makes no sense for DeSantis to run the cycle to beat Trump. DeSantis would have to go hammer and tongue in a one on one race against him. DeSantis is incapable of that. And no matter what, Trump will try to destroy the GOP. If it ever became clear, he wouldn't get the nomination. The smart play for DeSantis to flee stoners by pretending to run and pocket the cash for 2028 when he'll still be only 49 years old. So George Conway encouraging there to be no rivals to Trump or how about the Lincoln project, which is attacking DeSantis and the left would love nothing. They make all their money off of Trump and they get their base out because of Trump. And right now, if you look at the polling data, what the polling data shows that in a general election campaign, DeSantis is the candidate who scores most favorably with independence. When his Quinnipiac poll has Trump up, has DeSantis up 13 points in the favorable favorability ratings, 43% favorable, 30% unfavorable got Trump net negative 27, 32% favorable, 59% unfavorable. So there is every reason to think that one reason Democrats may be very happy with this is specifically because it elevates Donald Trump, which brings up the question of how exactly is Ron DeSantis responding to this because we saw that Ron DeSantis sort of botched his first iteration of this particular question a couple of weeks ago when Trump suggested that he was going to be indicted. And DeSantis said that while the indictment was unfair, he then talked about paying hush money to porn stars. And it looked as though he was taking kind of shots at Trump level left was attacking him. Well, now DeSantis has a second bite at the apple and he learned something for the first go around. We'll get to that in just one second first. So I have the fact that it's very difficult to get the fruits and vegetables that you need on a daily basis. So I've been traveling a lot. I was just in Rome. So you're always on the go. And what that means is that it's very difficult to get the allotted amount of nutrients that you need. This is why I'm a huge fan of balance of nature. Balance of nature fruits and veggies are the best way to make sure that you're getting essential nutritional ingredients every single day. Their capsules are packed with 100% whole food you can take at any time. Balance of nature uses a cold vacuum process that preserves the natural phytonutrients in 16 whole fruits and 15 whole vegetables and encapsulates them for easy consumption.

He's doing so with alacrity and aggressiveness because again, last time this happened, he wasn't fast enough off the off the mark this time within an hour of the news coming down. He tweeted out the weaponization of the legal system to advance a political agenda turns the rule of law on its head. It's un-American. The Soros-backed Manhattan district attorney has consistently bent the law to downgrade felonies and to excuse criminal misconduct. And now he's stretching the law to target a political opponent. Florida will not assist in an extradition request given the questionable circumstances that issue with the Soros-backed Manhattan prosecutor and his political agenda. So that doesn't mean that Rhonda Sanchez is going to like send people out to Mar-a-Lago and block federal arresting officers from from getting into Mar-a-Lago or that he even has the ability to do that. He's sort of limited in what he can do here. Basically, the standard method for extradition. Now, again, all this kind of a moot point because the prediction is that Trump is going to go to New York and just turn himself in. He actually doesn't want to be seen being dragged out of Mar-a-Lago bodily. That's not a particularly good look. It makes him look weak. Instead, he's going to turn himself in New York, Sam, innocent, and proclaim that this is all a witch hunt, which it is. Okay, but let's say that he were to take the radical path of attempting to avoid extradition. Well, the process of extradition de-sances has some say, but not total say under Article 4, Section 2 of the Constitution States are supposed to extradite people who are guilty of crime or who have been accused of crimes in other states to the states where they are being accused. That's just pure Article 4, Section 2. But there are certain procedures that the sances could theoretically use to slow the process. So for example, the standard method for interstate extradition in Florida is basically the governor of New York would write to the sances. Kathy Hochl would write to the sances with a form signed by Alvin Bragg, including a copy of the indictment. And then the sances would have to make sure the indictment is valid before ordering Trump's extradition from Florida. Now, making it make sure it's valid, that can be read in one of two ways. One is he just looks and sees that it's facially valid, like all the blanks are filled in properly. The other is that he actually reinvesticates the case and determines that the indictment isn't just a show trial or whatever. Now, he could theoretically do that. But in the end, that's going to be adjudicated by a judge, not by Ron DeSantis. He doesn't actually have the power to fully stop an extradition. He could theoretically delay the extradition. Theoretically, he could ask his legal affairs officer or prosecutor to review the extradition to man and read a report on it. If the extradition to man were legal, he would have to sign it within another 60 days. But again, I don't think any of this is going to happen. I think it's a smart political move for DeSantis to say that he's going to do this without actually having to do it. Certainly, if he had not been fast off the mark again, Trump would have attacked him for that. And that would have been a smack against DeSantis that scored because again, one of the things that Trump is trying to suggest is that DeSantis is insufficiently fighting the left, which is an absurd contention, but it is Trump's major line of attack against DeSantis in the 2024 race. So what is the effect of all this going to be? Well, again, again, for Trump in the primaries, it's great. Trump in the primaries, he's going to he's going to zoom in the polls because Republicans are going to rally around the Trump. There will be a rally around them now. Will that last long enough to get him all the way through the primaries? I mean, it's only March of 2023. So it's doubtful that that's going to last long enough to actually get him all the way through the primaries. But there's no question that at this point, he is certainly the very strong front runner in the presidential race. And as I say before, that may have played into the entire math that Democrats are doing here. See, I don't think that Democrats when it comes to this stuff are completely stupid. I think they're corrupt. I think what they're doing is wrong. But I think that they're smart enough to realize what they are doing. And as I say before, are they trying to take Trump off the table? Or are they very much trying to elevate Trump inside their Republican party with exactly the same issue that will hurt him with independence in a general election? It seems to me it's probably the latter could be the former. In any case, they may get more than they bargained for here because as it turns out, maybe Americans don't actually like when you Trump upcharges against a former president of the United States. And again, the president that's being set here is absolutely insane. And I promise you, there will be retaliation from the other side because we are no longer in an era where Democrats can break all the rules and then expect markets of Queensbury rules to apply for their opponents. Joe Biden will be indicted by someone. Somebody will come up with an indictment, a rationale for an indictment, and they will indict him either while he's president or after he's president. There will now be a significant push by Republicans in positions of power to go after political opponents using the methods of law. If Democrats are going to do this, some mutually assured destruction has to be created. And what Alvin Bragg is doing here is a really, really dangerous stuff. Inviting a former president of the United States on charges that are not clear cut and open and shut is a wild, radical risk. I mean, he's going to have to prove a lot more than he's proved so far. If what we've heard so far is reflective of what the underlying case is going to be here, then he is just open a Pandora's box that's going to be almost impossible to close. He's exacerbating the massive divide in American life that separates American from American. We all like to believe that there is a rule of law and that people aren't going to just be brought up on charges because they're members of the wrong party. That faith is fading really, really quickly. Honestly, if Joe Biden actually wanted to help achieve the unity that he preaches about so much, he would actually tell Alvin Bragg to cut this out. But very doubtful that Joe Biden is going to get involved at all, obviously. Just one second, speaking of the country coming apart, we are now seeing insurrections, new insurrections, not generous, six different kind of, the good kind of insurrections, according to the media, we'll get to that momentarily. All this may keep you up at night in politics, a rough business. Things seem to be getting weirder and stranger and more dangerous. Well, I still need to get my sleep.

Meanwhile, speaking of the country coming apart at the seams, in the aftermath of a trans man shooting up a bunch of Christian school children, the left has basically decided that the right is the problem. Just to get this absolutely straight, the left-wing narrative is that when a right wing, a purported right wing insane person commits some act of violence, the entire right must answer for it. Also, when a nutty left wing transgender person shoots up a bunch of Christian school children, the right must also answer for it. Amazing how the right must always answer for whatever is bad that happens in the world, almost as though the media is just basically a democratic outlet. Well, this has come out in two forms. Form number one is in the gun control arena and form number two is in the trans arena. So when it comes to gun control, the left has been promoting the idea that the right is in trans-junta gun control and that's why kids are being shot. This materialized in the halls of Congress the other day, when Jamal Bowman, Democrat New York got into with Thomas Massey of Kentucky. Bowman looks like a crazed nut job here. They're freaking cowards. They're countless. They're not here. I'm talking about talking about gun violence. You know, there's never been absolutely no one in a school that allows teachers to carry. Terry comes with you. We talk about you. We talk about you. We talk about you. We talk about you. More guns. Read some more debt. Look at the data. You're not looking at any data. No data. No carry. The water for the blood lobby. Look at the data. More guns in the more deaths. Good states that have open-caring laws that more debt. States that have open-caring laws. That's more debt. But I will listen to them. I'm saying that that's what calls that children and because the latter you get all the better your point is, according to Jamal Bowman. So this is the predicate. You have to understand that for the left, the actual arguments don't matter. It's the it's the loudness with which you make them that matters. And you're allowed to be as as praised and loud and insane as you want to be. If if a Republican protest in favor of Donald Trump on January 6th runs out of control and some people riot and trespass in the Capitol and get violent with folks. That's an insurrection that almost overthrew democracy. If however, leftists storm the Tennessee Capitol's man in gun control, that's just people who are a little bit overly enthusiastic. In fact, you can't even say they're overly enthusiastic. They're just concerned about gun violence. That's what we learned yesterday when a bunch of leftists rushed into the Tennessee State Capitol building on a national. It's Thursday morning. We have 400 people broke into the Capitol building. We have footage of them outside the Capitol amassing themselves. And you can see them large crowd. And they are trying to bash through the doors as you'll see, they actually did get inside. And in the next tape, you'll see them actually jostling with police officers on the inside of the building. There we go. You can see people getting physical with the police officers. The police officers trying to create some sort of a sort of physical barricade here so that the various state legislators in Tennessee could be rushed to the bathroom for a safekeeping. This, of course, is not insurrectionary or dangerous in any way. This is just people who are are peaceful and fun loving, you know, doing the things that really matter. And then they actually got into the state Capitol Hall itself. They actually got into like the center of the Capitol building where they proceeded to grab the microphone and yell at people. But this is all OK, guys. It's not a big deal at all. See, this is the rule. The rule is that when leftists trespass on state property illegally, then that is just because they are good, wonderful people. If right wingers do it, it's an insurrection that threatens the very core of our democracy. That's the way the sources goes by the way, all the way back to 2011. You remember that Wisconsin saw teachers, Union activists who broke into criminals. They broke into the Wisconsin Capitol building, occupied the Wisconsin Capitol building, took up all of the places around the, we're screaming, shouting, doing damage. Remember all this, this, by the way, at the same time, the Democratic legislators in Wisconsin were fleeing the states who tried to deny a quorum. So pretty simple measure to break some Union power in the state. This was OK. This is the way that it works. When Democrats do it, it's fine. And that's always the rule. When Democrats do it, it's fine. Meanwhile, you have the entire media that has rallied around the idea that Tennessee Republicans are to blame. When a trans person shoots up a bunch of Christian school kids, Tennessee Republicans are to blame. So you have the Wall Street Journal with a piece titled Tennessee Republicans face pressure after Nashville school shooting. Well, it's the Republicans who are facing pressure naturally. It's not, it's not Democrats. It's not people who promote a perverse ideology suggesting that boys can be girls. None of that. No, no, it's the Republicans, of course, or perhaps it is the New York Times saying after mass shootings, Republicans expand access to guns, right? Because of course, the problem is the guns. It's not the problem of disturbed people and increasing number of disturbed people as we talked about yesterday on the show. It's not none of that. Now, the real problem is that there are too many guns and Republicans are complicit in that or perhaps Maggie Haberman over at the New York Times reporting a DeSantis to visit gun store on book tour days after Nashville shooting. Dems call it beyond the pale. It's now beyond the pale for you to even be in the remote proximity of guns because somebody got shot. That is the way that all of this works according to the left. So you're allowed to take over government buildings. You're allowed to do whatever you want. You're on the left after all. And Republicans are the ones who are truly to blame. Meanwhile, in the second line of narrative here is even more perverse than the gun control line of narrative. The gun control narrative is ridiculous in the sense that this person legally obtained the guns. I'm unaware what law would be passed that would have prevented this person from obtaining the guns. I'm perfectly fine with banning people who suffer from gender dysphoria from purchasing weapons. That seems to me a pretty significant symptom of an underlying mental malaise that could theoretically be a problem in terms of owning firearms. But I don't think the left believes the same thing. But that takes us to our second narrative. The second narrative is that the true victims, the real reason this happened, the real reason a trans man shot up a bunch of Christian school kids is because right wingers aren't tolerant bigots. And so the real victim here is not the Christian school kids who got murdered. Those are not the Christian school teachers who got murdered. Those are the administrators. None of those people are the real victims. The real victim is the shooter and people like the shooter. That is it. That is the narrative the media are drawing today. And it is just it's vile. I mean, I'm not sure that I've ever seen the media turn this much in favor of sympathetic stories about about a shooter this quickly. You've seen it before. I mean, you saw Rolling Stone featured the Boston bomber at one point on their cover, but it's it's pretty rare. They don't do it all that often. And so now you have the now you have the media rushing out to declare solidarity with the trans community and the administration, by the way. So Korean Jean Pierre and what is the clip of the day? Korean Jean Pierre from the White House press secretary podium. She says the real you know, we have to be careful. If you're really careful, a bunch of school kids got shot in in a Christian school. You know, who's under attack the trans community says Korean Jean Pierre. And one of the things that we saw during the midterm elections is that people don't want their freedoms to be taken. They want us to fight for their freedoms. And so it is shameful. It is disturbing. And our hearts go out to those the trans community as they are under attack right now. I you know, there's some other people who are literally under attack. Actually, they're dead. The people who are shot by a member of the trans community, those people are dead. It would be amazing if this administration could muster even one smidgen of the sympathy that they have for the supposed trans people who are under vast assault for the people who actually are dead, including children that that might be nice. Like these are these supposed to be the apex sympathy creatures. And yet they can't seem to muster any sympathy at all. Remember Joe Biden out there suggesting that this shouldn't be investigated as a hate crime. Because after all, Josh Holly has it should be investigated as a hate crime or Joe Biden opening up his presser about this particular shooting by joking about eating ice cream. Weird how the sympathy just dries up immediately when the shooter happens to be somebody who has ideological kinship with a lot of left wing causes. That's an amazing clip. Korean Jean Pierre, I mean, literally a trans person shot a bunch of kids at a Christian school for what appeared to be ideologically motivated reasons. And the immediate response of the entire media is, well, obviously the real victims are trans people. In fact, Joe Biden put out a statement on Thursday morning, just a couple of days after again, a trans man shot up a bunch of school kids saying is for the transgender day of visibility quote transgender Americans shape our nation's soul, proudly serving the military curing deadly diseases holding elected office running thriving businesses today too many transgender Americans are still denied rights and freedoms. A wave of discriminatory state laws is targeting trans youth, terrifying families, hurting kids who are not hurting anyone. I can think of some kids who were murdered and were hurting anyone. But that doesn't fit your narrative does it. And again, this ties more broadly into that same exact symptom that we saw with regard to gun control activists taking over buildings. If trans activists take over buildings, that's also okay. So in Kentucky, there was a vote on banning transgender mutilation of children. And the governor had vetoed it. And then the Kentucky legislature passed it over the veto while trans activists took over the Kentucky Capitol and they trespassed a bunch of them were arrested. But this was considered not only fine but good by the media. Here's some of the footage of trans activists at the Kentucky Capitol. And that is a dude wearing trans colors and giant horns. And looking for all the world sort of like QAnon shaman, but as a hero, a hero, because after all trans trans activists in Kentucky then performed a die in a dying is where you line the ground, you pretend that you're dead. You want to talk about folks who are absolutely shameless. This would be it. After kids are killed by a trans person for what appear to be political reasons, you are going to do a die in as though you're under the threat of death from a legislature that just says that you're not allowed to mutilate children. Amazing stuff. The media, of course, by into this Benjamin Ryan, who again is the same NBC News pseudo journalist. And this is the person who's had a a raging desire, shall we say, to go after the daily wire because of our because of our conservatism. You try to blame the daily wire again for this national shooting, saying quote, national is home to the daily wire where Ben Shapiro and Matt Walsh have led an ideological war against trans people. Ideological war against trans people. No ideological war against perverse radical gender ideology that says boys can be girls and that kids must be taught this. Their colleague Michael Moles called for transgenderism to be eradicated. This is the larger social context in which the national shooting occurred. Oh, well, you know, I guess the threat is so the threat always was with trans people. The threat we were told is that if you don't give them what they want, they will commit suicide. If you if you don't give them what they want, then they'll kill themselves. You have to just pretend that their members of the opposite sex. Now I guess the threat has expanded such that if you don't give them what they want, they will commit homicide. And so therefore you have to actually just give them what they want. The Washington Post is doing the same exact routine, by the way, from the Washington Post put out a headline stating Nashville shooting exploited by right to escalate anti trans men. Ah, the pouncing the pouncing has happened. Quote, the attempts on the right to connect violence to transgender people come even though transgender people are rarely the perpetrators of mass shootings, which are overwhelmingly carried out by cisgender men according to criminal justice experts. There is a thing called per capita. I'm going to per capita examination. There have been four mass shootings carried out by people who are gender non binary or trans in the last couple of years alone. And there are very few gender non binary trans people per capita might be something worth exploring. What also might be worth exploring is whether you in fact are participating in the radicalizing of individuals by claiming that they are under genocidal threat when people simply say that boys are boys and girls are girls. This sort of media narrative was also put forward by MSNBC. So Charlotte climber, who is a man who believes that his woman was was speaking on MSNBC. What matters here is not just what Charlotte climber is saying. What matters here is the is the kyron transgender Americans under siege, not Christian school kids who are dead transgender Americans under siege. But Charlotte climber has some words about God and such. Children are only on say, but drag shows when a shooter shows up to kill them. That's right. That's where the threat is. I would challenge anyone just to get to know trans people. We are a vibrant diverse community as diverse as anyone else. You know, I'm from the great state of Texas. I served in the military. I go to transgender shooting suspects out rage on the right is that guy run God made me in her image. God made me a transgender and to see these people so cynically weaponize this and exploit these children's deaths and their teachers deaths. It breaks my heart. I wonder what those families are thinking right now. I'm I guess is that what some of those families are probably thinking is it's really screwed up that people like Charlotte climber are going on national TV and defending an agenda to to push lies about gender to small children in order to what makes some sort of excuse for what happened in Nashville. This is a very dangerous game. But of course, the media are fully perpetuating this game because they agree with the agenda agenda. Uber Alice for the media. Everything has to be fit into the narrative. And that narrative is increasingly centered centered on the idea that children must be a should be subjected to the idea of radical gender ideology and anyone who stands in the way of that is perpetuating both suicide and now apparently homicide. We got some more on this in just one second first. Let's talk about the fact that everyone who is responsible who has dependence needs life insurance is just that simple.

Go to policygenius.com slash Shapiro also folks, not many things can get me excited to visit the sad wreckage of what has become present day in New York City. But I got to chat with my old friend, Megan Kelly, and that was certainly exciting and fun. We just filmed the latest episode for season two of my show, The Search. A vilt to stream right now is fantastic to catch up with Megan. We talked about fame, making friends and of course, the culture wars. Here's a sneak peek of our conversation. When you first get married and your spouse is sick, you're like, Oh my god, I'll take care of you. This is so I feel so bad for you. Now when you have hands and obligations, they're like, why do you get to be sick? I need your wife here right now because every woman out there knows that the man flew is way, way worse than the woman flew ever is in fact, there's no accident. I did not get the flu because the guys get all the illnesses and the mothers are not allowed. We have to build up our communities before we get married and have children otherwise the whole family collapses. To watch this episode and all the episodes of The Search. This one was particularly fun, including our latest episode with comedian Russell Brand, become a daily wire plus member today, get instant access to the entire daily wire plus library of shows, movies, documentaries, upcoming kids content and more. Just head on over to dailywire plus dot com and get started today. Okay. Meanwhile, the the propagandistic crusade on behalf of the transgender agenda continues a pace. It is amazing again to see what sort of behavior is excused as okay, considering that it's coming from the sort of trans community in which behavior is considered not okay. So for example, you're allowed to basically imply violence as much as you want. As long as you're a member of the victimized community, here is a trans activist gushing over a book in which JK Rowling dies and saying, well, I wish it only been more gruesome. And people like JK Rowling need to stop because my people are dying because of her. She is killing us. Oh, but there's one more good thing about this book, JK Rowling dies. Yeah, Gretchen had the nerve to kill off the queen of the turfs. And it is glorious. I only wish that scene could have been even more brutal. That seems like an angry and unpleasant man right there. Meanwhile, our nation's biggest corporations have decided to weigh in in favor of this wild left wing propagandistic effort. So Kate Spade New York has a brand new spokesperson. Wait for it. Wait for it. It's Dylan Mulvaney. Yeah, you excited? And it's exciting. A person who has been a woman for zero days, a claim to have been a woman for one year is now getting mainstream fashion contract to promote purses and dresses and such. Here is a parody of a woman pretending to be a woman so that actual woman will buy products that don't look all that great on a man who pretends to be a woman. It all started with the first day of spring. I am at Kate Spade New York to find the perfect spring outfit. Let's go. Kate Spade New York is a staple in my wardrobe. And I think I absolutely need to have this as my spring bag. The mini bags are in. They're in. Let's go. You know, I love pink and I think the bag will go great with this. Let's try her on. Let's not always use another pair of heels, right? Here's the full fit check. I love a puppy sleeve and I added some jewelry because more is always more. And honestly, I think I'm going to wear this out of the store. So happy spring. I love you. I love you Kate Spade New York. You remember that line as good as it gets where Jack Nicholson says that the way that he writes women is he just writes a man without reason or accountability? Remember that time? And how is it joke then? That's literally how half of the American population now defines the word woman. The word woman is now a man without reason or accountability. That's like like man plus crazy equals woman. Now, that's that's that's how far we have to. But again, it's a political cause and pursuit of that political cause all is justified invading state capital buildings, violence, threats of violence, all of it, all of it. And again, the implicit threat is if you don't go along with this, then bad things are going to happen. Bad things are going to happen. Guys, well, speaking of bad things happening, Russia has now arrested a Wall Street Journal reporter on spying charges. According to the Associated Press, Russia's security service arrested an American reporter for the Wall Street Journal on espionage charges. That's the first time a US correspondent has been detained on spying accusations since the Cold War. Wall Street Journal for its part denied the allegations and demanded his release. His name is Evan Gerskovich. He was 31 and detained in Russia's fourth largest city known by the acronym FSB, the Service Aid Domestic Security Agency and Main Successor to the KGB. They are alleging that this reporter quote was acting on instructions from the American side to collect information about the activities of one of the enterprises of the Russian military industrial complex that constitutes a state secret. The Wall Street Journal vehemently denies those allegations. They say they stand in solidarity with Evan and his family totally unclear what the Biden administration plans to do about this. They said that they'd spoken with both the journal and Gerskovich's family. White House Press Secretary Karine Champier, she condemned the arrest in the strongest terms and urged Americans to heed government warnings not to travel to Russia. So great. I mean, apparently that that's going to be enough. This will use a few strongly worded letters to get back our citizens. And Champier said, we've been very clear about Americans not going to Russia. It is not safe. Well, I mean, how are journalists supposed to cover things precisely? Anthony Blinken, the Secretary of State, he said, in the strongest possible terms we condemn the Kremlin's continued attempts to intimidate, repress, and punish journalists and civil society voices. Now, again, the Russians are saying that Gerskovich was looking at state secrets and that he was, he's currently now being held in custody until May 29th at this point. This would be the second kind of high profile American who's being held presumably over the conflict with the United States by proxy over in Ukraine. The first was Brittany Griner, whom we traded for Victor Boud, the arms traffic are in one of the worst WNBA deals in WNBA history. Also, the only WNBA deal anyone's ever paid attention to at all. But nonetheless, is there an actual plan? Yeah, Gershovit track absolutely unclear at this point. Representative Jared Moskowitz, Democrat of Florida, he says, don't worry, Biden is going to be strong. He'll show that he won't be toyed with. And you said kidnapping in America. I assume you believe that Russia should release him immediately. Immediately. I mean, you know, the problem is, is that they're now going to use him as leverage. And so it's not going to be that simple, unfortunately. But obviously, you know, this is not the game that Putin should be playing. I have, I think Joe Biden has shown that he's not someone who's going to be toyed with when it comes to these sort of things. And so, yes, for his family's sake, he should be released immediately. I sort of begged to differ. Actually, Joe Biden has shown that he is a person to be toyed with when it comes to taking American citizens hostage so that Russia can get, say, you know, the world's most notorious arms dealer traded for a female basketball player who was once famous for having one stunked the basketball. Yes, I'm sure Russia is very, very intimidated at this point. Well, meanwhile, you hear me talk about being prepared for whatever life throws at you a lot on this show. And there are a lot of weird things happening in the world. Supply chain breakdowns conflict in the Middle East conflict in Ukraine. All of that stuff has an impact on sort of the way we live our daily lives. When those supply chains break down, you can't get the medicines that you need. Many of you take some kind of medication every day. Or if you don't, you probably know somebody who does. Maybe you have a parent or grandparent who's on cholesterol medication or medication for diabetes, heart health, mental health, blood pressure. What would happen? Or if you or your loved ones missed a day of medication or missed a week, this is why you have to have a supply of these medications available at your house.

Meanwhile, as we as we look at the Biden administration suggests that it has all the strength and wherewithal the FaceTime Vladimir Putin. We are now learning exactly what Americans enemies think of Democrats, especially former Democrats, according to the Wall Street Journal TikTok, which of course say Chinese front group. They've now enlisted three heavyweights from American politics and business to advise it behind the scenes. As the social media app tries to convince US authorities, it isn't beholden to the Chinese government. Now, you might think, well, I wonder which politicians or former politicians that are going to choose. Will they be right wing or will they be left wing? Hmm, let's think super hard. Oh, yeah. And another all left wing David Pluf and Jim Messina veterans of a Barack Obama's presidential campaign and Zinnia Muka, a former longtime communications chief of Walt Disney Company are now advising TikTok in their fight against efforts to ban it in the United States, according to people familiar with the roles. You mean Disney, which has done business with China like in exactly the area where they are imprisoning Uyghur Muslims. And you mean David Booth and Jim Messina, Obama people weird that they would that they would call upon top level Democrats in order to try to lobby strange if they saw the Democrats as true opponents. Why are they going solely to Democrats to try and get other Democrats to do what they want them to do? That's so that's so odd. It's so strange. Speaking of which, Democrats on the Hill are the ones who are really pushing something called the restrict act. There are a couple of different versions of a bill that would ban TikTok in the United States. The more ridiculous version is the so called restrict act according to reason.com. The restrict act carries the possibility that it would actually criminalize people using a VPN to access stuff that has been banned. According to Senator Josh Alley, he introduced one TikTok ban back in January. His bill would direct the president to use the International Emergency Economic Powers Act to lock and prevent all transactions and to prevent commercial operation of TikTok's parent company in the United States. But this new act, the restrict act doesn't specifically mention TikTok or ByteDance. Instead, it grants the US Secretary of Commerce, broad power to quote identified to turn disrupt prevent prohibit investigate or otherwise mitigate any risk arising from any covered transaction by any person or with respect to any property that the secretary determines to pose quote an undue or unacceptable risk in different areas. So that seems really, really broad. Like what exactly are they trying to apply this to? It's certainly confusing. It also seems like it could theoretically be read to imply that a person using a VPN to access an app controlled by a foreign adversary might be subject to criminal penalty. So leave its Congress to screw this thing up. A Rand Paul, a senator from Kentucky, he says the SACT violates the First Amendment. There are two main reasons why we might not want to do this. The one would be the First Amendment to the Constitution. Speech is protected whether you like it or not. The second reason would be is that the Constitution actually prohibits bills of a tanger. You're not allowed to have a specific bill against a person or a company. So this fails on two egregious points, pretty obvious points. And I think we ought to think about that. I think we should be aware of those who peddle fear. I think we should be aware of those who use fear to coax Americans to relinquish our liberties, to regulate and limit our First Amendment rights. Every accusation of data gathering that's been attributed to TikTok could also be attributed to domestic big tech companies. Well, I mean, he's right about that except for the fact that TikTok is of course a Chinese front group. But with that said, you got to draw these bills very, very narrowly. It doesn't look like the Restrict Act is drawn nearly as narrowly as it ought to be. Hey, time for some things I like and then some things that I hate. So things that I like, this is kind of a hilarious story. So there's a person named Avi Silverberg. He's the head coach for Team at Canada Powerlifting since 2012. He's competed three times in the world bench press. He won a bronze medal in 2010. And apparently he shattered the women's bench press record by mocking the Canadian powerlifting union's rules that permit biological men's compete as females. So it would be mocking it except for the fact that the current record is held by a transgender woman, meaning a man. The last record was set by transgender powerlifter, Anne Andress, who's recognized as a female on the open powerlifting ranking site. Andra said, why is women's bench so bad? I mean, not compared to me. We all know I'm a tranny freak. So that doesn't count. I mean, standard bench and powerlifting competitions for women. I literally don't understand why it's so bad. Well, I mean, maybe it's because men have completely different body construction. Maybe it's because of that. And lots more testosterone, different muscle composition. Silverberg bench press 501 pounds back in 2016, under raw rules that required an approved weight belt, approved singlet, approved wrist wraps and chalk. But apparently this he's allowed to use even more stuff here. So he said I am a woman. And then he came in and he broke the the record left by the last transgender weightlifter, which is hysterically funny. I mean, like, good, no different from when our friend, Zuby decided that he was going to become a woman for a day and break every single record at the local gym that had been set by a woman. These are the wages of the stupidity that we have now embraced. Other things that I like. So my friend, Chaya Rayczyk, Libs of TikTok, she has been unjustly accused by fools like Alexander Ocasio-Cortez of facilitating violence against, for example, Boston Children's Hospital for pointing out that Boston Children's Hospital literally told her on the phone that they were performing trans surgeries on minors. And so she confronted. She tried to file an ethics complaint against AOC and tried to confront her on it. She went to her office. AOC had kind of run away from there. And then she actually ended up meeting her. And here's how that went. I attempted to ask AOC why she lied about me in a committee hearing. She cowered away. She refused to talk to me. So I'm back here today, one week later, and I'm going to deliver her an ethics complaint that I filed for lying about an American citizen in a committee hearing together with Mike from the Heritage Foundation oversight. He helped me file this ethics complaint. So we filed that. And if you can give it to AOC, I would really appreciate it. Thank you. And tell her to stop lying about American citizens. Okay. Thank you. I just dropped off an ethics complaint at AOC's office. And unfortunately, she wasn't there. So we laughed. And then I was walking through the Capitol. I guess who I attempted to AOC herself. I just delivered an ethics complaint to your office because we're lying about the committee hearing. I actually never started a new year after being super transphobic. And I never want to trust you. Thank you. You're super transphobic. Big hand motions. Let's do this thing. Again, all kinds of guys, a very pleasant person. And if I was like, I delivered an ethics complaint to you and she's like, well, you're transphobic. Bye. I will catch you later. Out for AOC. Well, you know, you shouldn't lie about people. It's just a bad, bad thing to do AOC. And so you deserve whatever is the effect of that ethics complaint. Okay, time for a couple of things that I hate. So the trans insanity has now gone international. It has made its way over to various foreign lands. 60 minutes, apparently, is now featuring this is 60 minutes Australia. It's now featuring parents who have decided to completely botch what it means to be apparent by not raising their children with regard to genders. They are now raising them as what they call babies, which is a great way of ensuring confusion and mental unhealth among your kids. Great parenting guys. And this is Munchauson syndrome by proxy or at the very least treating your kids like you would a purse. It makes you famous and you get on TV because of it. It's really, really unpleasant and horrifying. Here we go. We didn't assign a gender at birth. This is your terrible person. I'm like this little person be who they want to be. It is an experiment. What they're doing is unprecedented. And idiot and cruel. Can't tell what your gender is by looking at your body. What are some of the biggest challenges strangers in the street have had quite a strong response. Why are you so obsessed? Why do you need to know? We're not trying to eliminate gender. It's really helping kids find their own path to it. Oh, so it's like getting the no guidance whatsoever, giving them no rules and no restrictions and no actual, no actual civilizing influences. It'll be great. It'll work out fantastic. Yeah, this is a great way to completely screw up your kids emotionally and mentally. And there will be no long term studies done on these kids for another 15, 20 years. And I guarantee you 100% certainty. Put it on the record right now. The kids who are raised this way will end up a lot more screwed up than the comparison group because they always do because that in fact is the goal. It's about the parents feeling good about themselves. So they can get on 60 minutes. You and me on 60 minutes who are just raising your kid who is a boy as a boy, you only get on 60 minutes. If you do something stupid, like salmon, raise my kid genderless. It's so it's so vile. But unfortunately, it's not restricted to Australia. In the Netherlands, they've gone even further. This is an apparently this is an actual thing that is happening on the TVs in the Netherlands. There's a show in which a bunch of adults ungarb in front of children to demonstrate what a trans body looks like. As for instance, today our guests are transgenders. These are a bunch of people getting naked. And yes, that feeling can simply be a feeling, but you can also do something about it. For example, I had surgery. The girl says in first you think, huh? Later, you realize it's actually pretty normal. It's actually really normal, says another kid. It's not just male and female. There's an entire spectrum of genders besides male and female. It's not. How did you feel after you had surgery? Yes, this very disturbed person. Do you know the word euphoric? No, says the kid. Euphoric means really happy, extremely happy. I woke up, I knew that my breasts were gone, but I looked like I had always wanted it to look. It finally matched the way I feel inside, and that made me feel ecstatic. So it feels a bit like flying? Yes. You simply feel intense happiness. I want that too, says the kid. So in Dr. Nading Kids in life ending insanity, that's great. Slow clap for our Western civilization. We are the same civilization that brought you Bach, Beethoven, Brahms, the Sistine Chapel, Augustine, great works of Western literature, the enlightenment and capitalism is now bringing you, let's teach small children that men can be women and get adults naked in front of them in order to make that happen. These folks are going to worry. They're not coming for the kids. It's all, it's all just, it's what's the effect guys? Why are you so mad? Why are you so upset? After all, this is all just open-mindedness. This isn't damaging kids at all. All right, guys, the rest of the show is continuing right now. You're not going to want to miss it.
