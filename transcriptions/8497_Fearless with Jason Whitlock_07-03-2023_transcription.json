    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it.

Now, that's just sleeping better. You'll probably enjoy our conversation about the movie Creed 3, Michael B. Jordan, Jonathan Majors, this gentleman and Steve Kim has joined us via Skype. There'll be five of us talking about this movie. Steve will start with you first, but I thought this movie could have been great. Could have been a classic. Could have been right there with Rocky. Could have been for me right there with Scarface, a Bronx Tale, the Godfather, but they blew it because they wasted too much time on the guy's daughter and her sign language and her being the next Rocky Balboa or Apollo Creed or whatever. They blew it with the kid angle, the daughter angle, the little Arya Stark angle and didn't spend enough time developing a diamond dame, Adamus' rival in this. And if they had done that, they could have taken a movie that's a six and a half or seven and turned it into a nine and a half, ten. I pretty good, but not great. I would say this, this description in three words about that movie. Sue or Edge, I thought it was terrible, honestly. And I know people that are in that movie, I apologize to them, or let me just say, all of you guys deserve Oscars. Okay, I know you, but you guys are not going to be happy with me. I got to see you guys, I got to work with you guys for that movie was so flawed. They have to start getting consultant from the boxing business to actually work with them because maybe my own knowledge of the sport and actually having gone to gyms and talking to people and seeing how it really works. I mean, give me a break. They literally had fighters sparring without head gears, putting on World War three, that never happens. And one scene Adonis is out there with hand wraps hitting a tree. Folks, maybe Jack Dempsey did that. Maybe John L Sullivan. I've never seen that. Fighters don't even chop wood anymore. And this whole thing, I mean, I will say this D block game played by Jonathan Majors. I actually liked him. I actually thought he did a good job. And that's a big, strong athlete. He fit. But there's so many things that I'm watching this. And I went last night with Mario Lopez. And there are a couple moments where we just looked at each other going, Oh God. And let me just point out some of those problems I had. Number one. So a guy serves an 18 year bid with no pro fights. And he's going to get a title shot. Really, try getting that past a commission. Look, Pete Radamaker is the only person in the history of boxing ever to make a pro debut and fight for the heavyweight title. The difference is he didn't serve an 18 year bid. And he was a gold medalist in 1956. So there's a little bit of recency there. And he fought Floyd Patterson and predictably, he got stopped. But still, a woman Chanko fought for a title in a second pro fight, one in his third guys. And again, this is where my knowledge of the sport probably ruins these things. You have to at least be in the ratings to get a title shot. It kills me then. The Mexican heavyweight champion. I happen to know that young man who played him his name is Jose Benavides guys in real life. He's a welterweight to put this in perspective. A career middleweight now junior middleweight is 147. And now 154 pounds when he was squared up against Jonathan majors, it looked like Brutus against olive oil. And I'm like, okay, and what world is this guy? A heavyweight. Okay, then his career is run by the momager. Guys, I've never heard of. It's always the overbearing father that becomes the manager that makes bad decisions. I mean, there's so many things that I'm going to go on. One other thing. The trademark of the Rocky franchise is the training montage. I'm the absolutely perfected it all the way back in 1976. And by the time we got to Rocky for, I mean, I think this was just one big long MTV music video and it worked. I thought the training montage was an absolute boss kill. And another thing, one last thing before I turn it over, because you know, I'm going to give this thing not even a thumbs down, but a middle finger because I want those two hours back. But I'm going to take this right now. The girl that was married to Jordan or Creed and the daughter, this is the interesting thing. Felicia Rashad was in there. And you know, they, I don't want to give a spoiler, but she's in there. But then the girl that's with Creed, I guess, his wife now looked a lot like Lisa Bonet. So the whole time I'm thinking, wow, the Huxables are here. I just couldn't get that out of my mind. But anyway, I'm just telling you, they need to kill off this series. I thought Creed 2 was awful. I don't think this one was any better. On a scale of one to 10, that sounds like a two maybe. Maybe a point eight, a point eight. I literally think if let me just say there's a rocky guy, I can give you my ratings on the whole franchise. I actually thought about it. And the only one that I can really think was demonstrably worse was Rocky 5. And to us, Rocky aficionados, Rocky 5 never happened. We don't even acknowledge it. It's like Chuck Cunningham had a brother, and then he went up to his room and he was never seen again on the series. That's kind of what Rocky 5 is. I'm just telling you, if you have any knowledge of boxing and have been in the sport, there are so many little things that they do. And I'm like, they couldn't get a consultant to at least help them out a little bit. But again, I'm a little bit of a smile. I don't think they wanted a consultant. No, they want to go off and lala land. Steve, Steve Berne. I love how Steve Kim's name dropped in Mario Lopez. Well, guess what, Steve, I got to watch Creed 3 on a screener on a portable laptop at Screeches Grave. That's what I watch it with. And I'll tell you guys why you're both wrong about Creed 3. Creed 3 was amazing because... Yeah. I mean... Yeah, that whole wasted sign language deal. Yeah, that part of the reason I'm just... Jason, the last thing I want to do at a movie is read. Okay, if it's not one of those corn films, you better not have subtitles. I just... And this is from Steve Kim who watches a lot of Korean action dramas and crime thrillers that are subtitled. So yes. Right, well, it's not true. But I'm just... So by the way, here's the funny thing about Benavidez, the heavyweight. He has a brother that is actually a super middleweight that's much bigger. I don't know why they chose him. Benavidez is actually fighting Kayla Plant, March 25th on pay per view. And I just... And I'm just watching this and I'm going, this is so far off. Because if you look at the original Rocky, yes, Rocky Balboa got the call, unlikely call at the face, the heavyweight champion of the world of Paul O'Kriene. Well, there's a difference. They put a good context to it that the original opponent had fallen out. So they're kind of in a rush like, oh my God, we got to salvage this event in the holiday season. And at least Rocky had just beat up Spider-Rico. Right? So this whole time... Rocky had a long boxing career. Ah, come on. That was insane. Yeah, real cool though. That was a great athlete. Creed 3 was amazing. I'm sorry. Go ahead, Bryson. Go ahead. Listen, I'm sorry. I'm gonna give Creed 3, the highest score. I'm giving it a 9 out of 10. I thought it was amazing. I thought the shots were amazing. I thought the training scenes were amazing. The only reason it wasn't a 10 is because of the daughter. Lovely young lady. No disrespect to her. But I do agree they should have pit more of a backstory on Jonathan Major's character. Diamond Dame. I thought that would have made it a 10 for me. But it was a non-easily... I'm talking about the scene where they were boxing and then it just threw away. Then it was boxing by themselves and nobody around. Come on. Jonathan Major is one of the best actors out right now. Okay. The scenes were... Come on. What flaws are you hiding here? I'm lost. Bryson. I didn't understand it. So they start to fight a Dodger Stadium. And by the way, the last time there was a fight a Dodger Stadium, it was very tragic. I think a young featherweight by the name of Davie Moore died and there are songs written about it. So I like that talk. Steve, Steve, Steve, Steve, you're wrong. The last fight at Dodger Stadium, a San Francisco giant fan ended up paralyzed. Oh, right. You won't write about that. But that technically took place in parking lot. But okay, so all the sudden, it's just them. It's just two men battled. And they have this big concept where it's just them, two men battling. So they went from the first and second round all the way to the 12th. And I'm like, wait a minute. What happened to the other eight rounds? At least in Rocky 1, they showed the ring card girls that were all looking like the Statue of Liberty. So you saw five, six, seven, you kind of got a contact. It's almost like here they ran out of money and just said, okay, you know what, let's just go to the talk around. And I'm like, okay, I don't I never showed the ring card girls either, which kind of disappointed old man like me. Steve, now you have to suspend your suspend reality in order to watch Rocky fight Apollo. But now you want this to be a documentary. You want the location to be accurate. You want all the training to be accurate. You want everything to be accurate. Come on now. Come on, Steve. Look, if you actually go back to Rocky, which by the way is not actually my favorite movie of the franchise, but if you actually look back at the way they train in the gym, the gym that they use in the original Rocky or the first two was a real boxing gym is the mainstream boxing club here in LA owned by the Steinler family. Okay. And when you look at Mickey, Mickey actually looked like a real trainer. He kind of talked like one of those old guys in the training that they use even chasing the chicken, the quickness feet in the in the sequel was pretty good. But the way they did the training montage, it was kind of depressing. Like to this day, I still work out to a lot of Rocky music. Most of it composed by Bill Cont\u00e9. And it's very inspirational. I've said, if you work out to the Rocky for soundtrack, it is scientifically proven. You learn 500 more calories per hour. The only people that are chasing chickens now, people who want cheaper eggs. Different. But for me, I give it a seven. There are a few things I think they could have done. You lower just score. Well, seven. Did it change chickens? It just wasn't in the third one. Okay. I mean, I give it seven. Eight. I'm good with it. It's a really good film. I love the cinematography. I love the story. Jonathan Majors. He really acted that role. If I'm ever watching a movie and I get angry with the villain, he's playing a good role. Like, it was, he was really doing his job in that movie. I loved it. And when I'm watching a Rocky film, I know or a Creed film, you got to suspend some of this. I mean, this is not a documentary. You're not going to get somebody called up. Oh, we lost you. There's nobody in all of boxing. They can get the box. Nobody on the planet. We got to reach to find somebody. That's how Rocky fought Apollo. This is how they fight Creed. I get it. I think we could all agree to this. Rocky films are never about boxing, right? It's about life. It's about outside the ring. So the scene where Felicia Rashad is passing and she's in bed and she's speaking to Adonis, but she has had a stroke and she's talking to Apollo. It's heartbreaking. And then the scene evolves and she starts saying, I don't know if you guys caught that part. A lot of people missed this part, but she said, Cliff, I watched all those sweaters for you. And I was respected how you always bought all the women cocktails the parties. Cliff. I missed that part. I think I was on a good part. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. I will say that. Let me just tell you the best part of going to the movies last night is that there's a preview for a George Foreman movie. I generally don't quite watch a lot of boxing movies because I think they're so poorly done. I never watched Ali. I just didn't want to. The Foreman movie looks promising the way they actually filmed it. That's one of the other things I didn't like about Creed. The action looked like it was a video game. It didn't even look like two humans. Like when I saw Apollo Creed played by Carl Weathers, puffing out that jab like Larry Holmes, it actually looked passable. These two guys just look like guys that went to 24 hour fitness and decided to take a boxer size class. I don't know. And then the other thing is the other preview that I liked is there's a movie coming up on Air Jordan, the whole making of the shoe. And I'm like, okay. So I got that's the best part of that whole movie with the two previews. Honestly, that's you wanted my opinion on the movie. You made me go see it. You wanted my thoughts. There it is. Well, I appreciate it going to the theater last night. I saw it last night. I took my kids. And you know, it was it was a film where we were outnumbered. There was a lot more African Americans in the theater, which I appreciated. I was like, Oh, this is kind of fun. And I'd never been in a theater where four different families bought their babies. So that was that was really exciting to hear babies crying and being breastfed and the mob walking the babies back and forth and patting them down. It was pretty cool. Are you are you being remotely serious? I'm being 100% serious. You heard babies crying. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. It was like get the binky. Shut it up. Yeah. But it was a that's what I go to movies. I went to an 11 a.m. showing. That's when you do it. Yeah. I went at seven o'clock prime time. So I don't I was the best popcorn though. Yeah. It's better popcorn, but you run the risk of people talking during the movie. And that drives me crazy. I can't deal with that. Steve, we're going to let you go. You've taken a dump on Crete. We'll circle back to you when we talk about Chris Rock. So stay at the ready. Anthony, you're now at a seven because I think you really agree with my take. They could have developed Jonathan Majors more. That's what that's what brought me down to an eight. I can seven, eight. I'm good. I'm good with it. It's a really good movie. And I would probably go up if I watch it again, because it was a really good story. You got love story. That's usually your critique. This is front and center. So we develop the dialogue. The dialogue. I saw one and it was horrendous. You want them to develop the whole stuff? How much love do you want to see in the movie? No, no, that's what some of the dialogue between Creed and his wife, I thought was weak. And if I if I wouldn't rewatch Creed one, I could tell you why I didn't like the dynamic between them and even Creed one. There was some scene, I think, in Creed one, because I did a whole critique. Everybody loved Creed one. And I thought it was like, I just watched it too. Oh, I thought it was horrific. What in the some scene where he was leaving and she was up in her apartment, leaning out the window. And she was like, all good. He's moving in with Rocky. And she's just all good with it. I'm like, what woman is this? What's she doing? I was all good with it. She was like, she was sort of confused. Like, because later in the film in Creed one, she answered, brought it up. Like, you wasn't going to tell me? I'm gonna tell you that you're bringing back memories of Creed one for me. The other thing I never, ever bought. And this is, I don't know, y'all may not have divorced parents. But Felicia Versailles character taking Creed in, somebody else's baby. It's not happening like that. Now with that, he's the movie. I get it. I get it. I get it. I get it. You can write a movie in a certain way to make it more believable show that there was, but it's like, she changed all this is Creed's straight baby that I didn't know nothing about. Let me bring him on it. That ain't happening. He was in and out of group homes. He kept getting into fights at the, at the, the youth prison or whatever it was. And she was like a last resort. Yeah, I know. She went and got it. That straight baby. That's where it goes. So everybody wants more back story on Dame. Some people want more back story on the daughter. Like, I'm watching it like, man, I want to know more about Leon. What did Leon do? Leon just whooping these kids as like, what drove Leon to be such a demon? Here was the other thing that, the last thing that didn't land with me was the picture. And we talked about this all fair. The picture that Felicia Versailles showed of, of him in jail with this guy, that's a critical, critical scene. It is. And they're expecting you to remember, oh yeah, that's the guy that beat up Droggo. That went over most people's heads. My daughter is nine. And as soon as the picture flashed, that's why they kept showing. I'm like, man, they really show this picture a lot. And I, and then they showed the picture that Felicia Versailles shows Creed. And then my daughter, my daughter is nine goes, oh, and I was like, she got it. So I think that I don't know if she can get it. I think most of us, maybe I'm in the conversation saying we could find them. That was that scene was amazing too. And he got punched in the face. And then Mike McB should know when he brought Dame over to his house, he could have poured him anything. What did he pour? Hennissi. All right, let's go to Shamika Michelle. I just want, I want to be, I just want, I want to be, I just want, I want to be, I just want. APS, the secular world, the culture uses our imperfection, our sins to shut up. You, you can't stand on truth. And if all it was was imperfection, it eliminated us from standing on truth. This would be a very quiet place. I'm trying to be as loud as I can. And as transparent as I can to try to inspire other men, we know you're imperfect. You know you're imperfect. God's grace and mercy, mercy gives you the right to stand on his truth and to speak that loudly into the culture. We have to do it. You can look around and say, these guys have taken over everything. They own the CDC, the NIH, they got the president, his transgender surgery for children. Colleges today are nothing but leftist indoctrination centers working fully against the Bible. What's the alternative? So you're going to stop fighting today and you're going to let the government raise your kids and you're going to turn around and let them chop off your 12-year-old daughter's breasts and let them sterilize your son and tell him that he's a girl. And you're going to let them make the Bible hate speech. You're the last line of defense here because nobody else is going to do it and God's going to walk with you. This is literally worth dying for. I'm telling you, so it's like everybody that's a nice little metaphor. This is it. If there's a hilda die on, this is it. The over the window has been moved right in front of our children's bedrooms. And there are all types of people that are trying to climb up in the ladder and every good father should be on his post so that when they peek their head up over the window sill, you kick the ladder back down. Let them know. You move on to the other house because we're not playing that around sometimes just standing up, just saying no, we're not going to do that. Not my marriage, not my kids, not my family, not my community, not my church, not my city. Just declaring that. That's victory enough in prepping his disciples. He tells Peter, he's like, listen, Satan desires to sift you as wheat, but I've prayed for you. We're going to face some ups and downs in life and we're not going to always get it together. But if we stay on the path, if we stay chasing after running after Jesus, running after his way, he's even praying for us. Now, I like it when you pray for me, Jason and TJ, I appreciate that. But to have Jesus pray for me, that makes me feel pretty good when you make it through this sifting process. Go back and strengthen your brothers. So we all have a responsibility as men. Once he's delivered me through this, I have a responsibility to go back and bring some other folk out. You do a roll call to just let people know you're not alone. Be confident in your positions and we're going to inspire you. We're going to eat fellowship, listen to some music. It's going to be the first of many roll calls that we do. So we're looking for soldiers. We're going to put out our best recruiting pitches for soldiers. Did you know that when a news site puts Google ads on its articles, they're also giving Google the ability to suppress any article they don't like and make it virtually impossible for you to find. It's true. Virtually every news site in the country uses Google Ad Exchange, which gives the Big Tech giant incredible power to control what you see. At Blaze Media, we've had enough. We're doing something about it. The Blaze.com has been revamped to get rid of every last ad. That makes us the only conservative news site that's truly independent from Big Tech. Have a look for yourself and learn what you can do to help join the fight against Big Tech censorship. Visit the Blaze.com today. All right, well, I'm back. Let's roll out to North Carolina. Bring in Shamika Michelle. She has seen Creed and she's also watched the Netflix special with Chris Rock. Shamika, we got a wide array of opinions on Creed. Where do you come down? I actually liked it, Jason. I think because I went in a little scared because the first one I think came out in 2015 and the second one, 2018. So I was sure it was going to be like overly woke. And the fact that it wasn't, I was very pleasantly surprised because there were a few things that I was questioning and I'm glad Steve came cleared it up. Like the momager, I was wondering how often that happens in boxing and then him sparring with women. I was just really wondering if that's something that's usual. So I didn't like those parts, but overall, I thought it was a really good one. Hold for one second. I just want to clean up. He didn't spar with women. She worked the punching hands or whatever. She worked. Yeah, but actually, I think the woman that played that role is actually a former fighter now trainer that she's called the queen of gloves or queen of the gloves. And so when I'm watching it, it bothered me as well. When I got home and did a little homework, I was like, okay, they don't put a Instagram model in here, but at least she's legitimate. So that didn't bother me as much. All right, continue. Yeah, another thing that I liked about it was how soft and feminine his wife was because I'm used to a lot of times they portray the woman as being very combative and talking back and just not wanting to listen. But the way she agreed for him to actually go and fight Jonathan Majors again, you know, and she said, do whatever you have to do. I appreciated how supportive she was this creed opposed to I feel like one and two. I just felt like she was a little bit more supportive. So I actually liked that. And I want to tell Steve really quickly, I've laughed more today than I did watching Chris Rock. So I just wanted to say that before I forget. Your little head of schedule. Hey, I wanted to get your take. What did you think of the way they handled the child and the fight at the kindergarten? That was the other thing that didn't it didn't, you know, we got to get her in boxing lessons. She's already beaten up kids. Why is Adana saying we got to get her in, but we got to teach her to fight. Shari, then beat up one of her classmates is, you know, it just that seems silly to me. But as a parent, perhaps you know better. Yeah, I mean, I appreciated it simply because I know, you know, maybe he wanted her to fight right. Maybe he wanted to make sure she had it down pat. I like the fact that the mother said, no, we want to teach her pretty much conflict resolution skills. But Adana's was like, no, we need to make sure that she's able to defend herself. And I think that's a very realistic conversation when it comes to parents that normally you have the one that's a little bit more rah-rah. Let's get it popping. And the other one that has to be a little more even keel and, you know, not want to have it pop off like that. So I like that part of the movie. I thought it was good. And I like the fact that he didn't cower to her to just say, okay, you're right. Even though he did say it'll be our little secret with the daughter, I appreciated the fact that he was willing to stand his ground and not just look like a complete woods when his wife wanted to do something else. One of the things though, Jason, I think you all all missed was how perfectly cast Jonathan Majors was. Y'all have said everything about his body. But I didn't hear anybody say that after coming out of prison for 18 years, the way he held his mouth in that second position, the entire time, I didn't know if it was. Oh, it's just a great cast. But I thought that was brilliant. I had no idea where you were. I was not expecting that. That's a good segue into Chris Rock. That's, let's transition to Chris Rock. And you guys heard my take yesterday. I thought it was tremendous. I think Shamika's kind of previewed hers. Shamika, you thought it was terrible? I didn't think it was terrible. I just didn't think it was that funny. But I think there's something wrong with my funny bone because I rarely laugh at comedians. That's why I'm looking forward to Steve sending me some free tickets for one of his shows so that I can actually go and see him in person because he has cracked me up this episode. But no, I didn't really think Chris Rock was that funny. Well, I'm in Raleigh this weekend. I'll give you tickets. Oh, yeah. Yeah. He's in Raleigh this weekend. That's not good. I'll take it at cost, at cost. Not free, but like the, we'll talk. I thought Chris Rock was terrific. I thought that, again, as I said, my fire starter yesterday, he stood on some biblical values and really pushed back against cancel culture. And I feel like, Steve, and I'm asking this seriously, it feels like we've perhaps re-state turning point where guys are really going to strongly push back against this cancel culture and just say what they think. Yeah, I really do think it's the pendulum starting to swing. I'm seeing now, May 25th, you have Sebastian Minascalco, Bird Crusher, you have Hard R-rated comedy films coming back into the marketplace. You haven't seen Hard R comedies in years because Hollywood has stopped. To us, Layman, what's Hard R comedy? Give us some examples. I like hangover, bridesmaids. Films you would watch today and go, oh, you couldn't make that today. That's what I'm talking about. And so I think you're seeing what happened was Hollywood stopped making these R-rated comedies. And so the consensus, the general public was getting their fix of comedy clubs. And so they started gravitating towards comedy. That's why comedians now are selling out theaters more than ever, are selling out arenas more than ever. Back in the day, I mean, dice, clay sold out Madison Square Garden. That was an event. And now you live in a day and age where Sebastian Minascalco sold out the garden eight times in a row over the course, I think, like four or five days. So I mean, Americans still want that outlet of humor and hearing things you can't say necessarily in the workplace, but they still want to hear it. And now Hollywood, I think, is finally getting to a place where they're capitulating and saying, all right, let's try this. Let's see what happens. And it's on the backbones of two of the more successful touring stand-up comedians, Sebastian and Bert. So, Shamiga, what didn't you specifically like? Any of it. I mean, there were a bunch of parts. I think I laughed about four times. I did like him talking about Meghan Markle. I agreed. We all do that to babies. I know I've looked at ears and around the nail bed to see how dark the baby is going to be. So I appreciated that part. I liked when he talked about the woke culture and he spoke against that. I appreciated that. It just wasn't funny for me. And I know you said you felt like he was pro-life. And I was wondering that because it was so extreme. But I have to say that I'm not completely sold on him being pro-life simply because as a mom of three, I feel like I've talked to them about how babies are made. They know that. I've shared life experiences. Their father has talked to them about how Meghan can be. And I feel like if North Carolina was to ever outlaw abortion, it would just be tough to get in. Ain't no more milk and ain't no more access to abortions. So I feel like I don't really buy the whole he's pro-life thing. I think he said he was pro-choice. And I believe that he wants his daughters to be able to make that decision. Now I do feel like I understand libertarians when they say they don't want the government involved in that type of stuff. But personally, my moral code is I'm pro-life. And I just would not bend on that even for my own children. He's got a long history of pissing off the left for basically being anti-abortion and ridiculing. He had a, I think it was in 2005, he started doing a comedy routine where he started bragging about going to abortion rallies because he knew all the women were slutty and they would be easy to pick up. And that's what got him in trouble with slate and other, they started calling him the right-wing comedian or the William F. Buckley of comedy. And he's had a little consistent history of calling abortion murder. It's hard for me to believe that someone would call abortion murder and be Ford. I felt like he was sucking the people in to, oh yeah, he's on our team. And then put it in their face. And here's what you actually support. You support the murder of children. So I thought it was good. I thought he did a good job with Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith and the way he tied that all together. He cracked jokes throughout about, I don't need another mad rapper and then ended up talking about Will Smith and clown both of them. Were you, did you have a, well you're the wrong person to ask. But did you have a problem with him calling Will Smith and Jada Smith a bitch? I had no problem with it. I actually did clutch my pearls, but it was out of shop. But I was really like, mmm, give me more. It was so good. Saying something that I was, I was, I couldn't fast forward to the end had I not been watching it live because it was time for him to actually put them in their place. He said so many of the things that we actually said a year ago when it happened, like he was watching our show and agreed with us that yes, Will Smith is so much bigger than him. Yes, Will Smith had misplaced anger and should have been mad at his bald head and hook a wife who actually went out here and had sex with her son's friend while he was having a mental meltdown. So I appreciated that part. That was actually the best part for me and it wasn't that funny. I just was so happy and surprised that he went as raw as he did. So no, I didn't have a problem with it and it didn't make me feel like he was talking about all women or that he would be disrespectful to all women. No, he was disrespectful to Jada because Jada has been disrespectful period across the board to Will bringing him on national TV, just emasculating him in front of the world. I felt like she got every drop of what she deserved. Thank you, Jamaica. Great job as always. You look awesome. We're gonna move on to we're gonna bring Steve Kim back, get his thoughts on Will Smith on Chris Rock and his Netflix special Next. All right, I don't want to do it, but we got to bring the Korean Co-Sail back because he watched the Chris Rock special, selective outrage. Steve, just being a boxing expert, a college football expert, comedy may be what he knows best or thinks he knows best, although I looked at his top five comedians of all time and not very bright, neither Steve Burns either, but we'll get into that here in a second. Steve Kim, Korean Co-Sail, what did you think of selective outrage? All right, so for as much as I didn't like Creed 3, I did like selective outrage. It was the best of times. It was the worst of times and I thought he hit it and he is Nolan Ryan as a Texas Ranger. He still has his fastball. He is still very capable of bringing the heat and I'm just telling you, I thought he laid out everything perfectly and I love the fact he actually served us a whole meal and he ended it with dessert with Will and Jade. I thought it was actually brilliant the way he he just actually had a lineup. He had a plan laid out his points and then they coup de gras and he literally just dropped the mic. He still has it. Yeah, I thought it was a tremendous performance as I've stated earlier. Where do you rank Chappelle versus Chris Rock is? Who is the premier comedian of this era? That's like the old Bird or Magic or Nause and Jay Z type of thing, Ginger, Mary Ann, it's tough. I think they're both brilliant in their own way but this is not a shot at Chappelle. I think this particular set, Chris Rock said, you know what? I'm going to let my hands go and nowadays I judge a stand up comedian's performance by not how much I laugh because that could be very subjective. But I have a new criteria. Who do you offend? And the fact on Twitter, a lot of these guys with the rainbow avatar and a lot of people from a certain grouping are offended and clutching their pearls and actually get this or actually asking, hey, was Chris Rock actually over funny? Hell yeah, he was like he was on Saturday. So the fact he pissed off those people, let me know he hit it. He hit it. He did it absolutely. By the way, I would have loved to have been a wall inside the house of the Kardashians while they were watching that when he dropped that line about God's message to the father. Oh my whoo, whoo, whoo. Uh oh. That was that was not my favorite part of the Kardashians. I liked it better. Kim Jenner, bring me your poor, your huddled masses, bring me your crack addicted athlete. Come on in here, boy. And then I think she went out to Travis Scott too, your, you know, crazy genius rapper or whatever. Yeah, I, that was actually the funniest part of the whole deal to me. You having to pick Cepel or rock? Look, to me, rock is my, is my goat. I love, I love Chris Rock. He can do no wrong. The only, my only gripe and just, I haven't seen the whole special because I was working. But when he did the mic drop on the line, don't front, don't fright in front of white people. I was like, Oh my God, that's a great premise. Like what do you, I understand everything is reverse engineered. But it's like, I, when I heard that line, I was like, I'd love to hear more about that. We already had already done it. You know what I mean? Yeah, that's the point. So, uh, but other than that, I just, I think he's the greatest. Well, actually you think Richard Pryor is the greatest? No, for me, if I, in my ranking, are we doing this now? Yeah, yeah. No. Oh, I just, I just wrote those as like, I didn't know what I'd do. Oh, it wasn't one to five. Yeah. Oh my. You blew our graphic. No one. Where's it? There's Steve Burns. You got Richard Pryor, number one, George Carlin to. Oh, well, no, that's right. That's right. Chris Roth three. No, that's right. That'd be my graphic because, because hold on, you call Chris Rock the goat. For me, yeah, but I'm going back in time to understanding Pryor is the first to kind of really peel back the curtain and reveal himself. You know, there's all these different, you know, like evolutions. Lenny Bruce is the first to kind of, and then there's other, there's a few other names that float around that said, well, this was actually the first person to start infusing profanity into into their act. But Lenny Bruce is the one we all know, right? And Pryor is the first one, I think to peel back the layers and start really getting introspective and making himself vulnerable. And so I think he is the reason we're at this place now. We're now the pendulum swung so far, we have comedians doing like therapy sessions and they're hour specials and they're crying. And it's just like, what is going on? It wouldn't have happened if it wasn't for Pryor, but you wouldn't have what you have without Pryor getting so personal. And Chris Rock, what you saw, what I'm seeing in terms of clips and everything is you're taking the personal and the societal element where you're divulging to people via microphone, hey, think about this. This is something that affects us all. But this is particularly effect, this is how I was affected. So I thought you got the best of, you're getting the best of both worlds with rock. Who is Dave? Adam. David Tell. Oh my God. Yeah, who I don't know who is Dave. David Tell is, I think one of the most underrated, greatest working standard comedians right now, he's the comic that all comics will say, oh yeah, he's the best. I mean, he was just here at Zaines. He's got lines like, you know, if you're a man and you if you basically jizz on a Confederate flag and plant it, two weeks later, you'll grow in a cracker barrel. I mean, it's that's one of just that's one of a thousand incredible jokes that he has on a nightly basis. And it's just a toss away joke for him. He's he's incredible. Steve, do you know who David Tell is? I've heard of him. I've actually heard of it. I think he's been on comedy network a few times. So I've actually heard of him. My list is pretty much the same. Look, I'm not really that much of a comedy. Let's go to Steve Kim's list. Let's go to Steve Kim's list. You know, rock and chappelle, depending on what side of the bed I wake up on can be one or two. The other guys, I think everyone else has on their list. Couple notes, Eddie Murphy to me kind of had a short run. He became more of a movie star. I will hope for a second. Why are you always stepping on my toes, man? Why are you always got to be 10 miles ahead of the conversation? I want you to send your list and then let me call you out. The list. Let me call you out. Well, then let me just transition to my list because both of these guys have leave off Eddie Murphy, the go the greatest of all time. How can I? Yes. He's the Bo Jackson of comedy. He left. He didn't he didn't he never got any funny movies. That's part of comedy. Comedians. Comedians. Micro for all those guys have a microphone on their hand. Eddie Murphy. Yes. He was fantastic. Nobody better than him. And then he walked away. He's like Jim Brown. He's like Jim Brown. Jim Brown left the NFL in his prime with to do flubber. Where there is some Disney horse shit that he wanted to go do to get all the ticket revenue. No, stay dangerous. Though absolutely that's your complaint too. He didn't do it long enough. Well, I'll say this about Eddie. He had the best movie career of any comedian. I think a lot of these comedians, you know, like Richard Pryor's great. He was doing Brewster's millions and the toy. Chris Rock is always good off the bat. He's never good as a starter. He's much better as Pookie than he is as the starring A-list guy. Eddie Murphy's movie. His his whole repertoire is very good. The one guy that I thought of that I left off and he left us too soon. And I think he's the Len bias of my list because we never got to really see him at his true Pete Patrice O'Mearg. Patrice O'Mearg. Well, yeah, Patrice is Patrice. Yeah, I completely agree with you on that one. Yeah. Patrice is great. Fantastic. And Elephant in the room is a fantastic hour special. If nobody knows who Patrice is, watch that. That's all you need to know. Jason, Steve, two notes here about I've taken some notes at the Chris Rock special. I just thought his pro choice stand. Hold on for one more second. Hold on for one more second. This guy, he takes us his show. And the fans love him and think he's great. So he thinks this is showing he's always trying to take over. Would you do? Is this an Asian thing or what? Is it? We're not really people off. So come on. What we just want. Nobody wants to give Red Fox any love. Oh, now we're digging. Now we're digging. Now you're digging, digging, digging. It's like, if you go there, then it's like, all right, then you could go, you know, rickles. Is rickles on there? Yeah, we could get into semantics. Don Rickles didn't have a Sanford and some franchise. It's still one of the greatest shows in the history. And I know you're limiting comedy to just the microphone. I'm taking everything into totality. Fred Sanford, funny as has great stand up and all maybe the greatest comedy TV show of all time. I don't disagree. Well, look, of all time, I think everybody would say Seinfeld. Even the Lisa. I would say that's the most successful, the most successful stand up comedian that parlayed into a sitcom. How about Martin Lawrence? You can't get that. Guys, Martin Lawrence had a nice run before he went crazy. Yeah, I was. Martin Lawrence. Oh my God. Just in comedy in the early 90s, I actually thought as the host, he was funnier than any of the comedians that came on. And the first four seasons of Martin before him and Tisha Campbell could not be in the same room. We'll talk about this and whatever. That was the modern day honeymooners. They had a chemistry that was special. It was as good as any sitcom as I've seen until he couldn't be in the same room as damn Gina. So that kind of ruined it the last couple of years. But I think Martin has to be in the top. His stand up is not on par with any of those. No, he's not. Not at all. Not even close. You're so crazy. I loved it as a college student. I would watch it all the time on VHS. And then I became a stand up and I was like, oh, I got to go back and watch this. This was the funniest. And I went back and it does not hold up. It's not good. And after being a comedian, you see through all the tricks, it's kind of hacky to be honest with you. And he's overselling it with energy. There's you can't deny the physicality of Martin Lawrence. That's what made the show so fantastic. But as terms of a stand up comedian, I don't think he's on par with the I would put him in the top 50. And Steve is monologue for Saturday Night Live is the worst ever. What really was the one you've ever seen when you was on SNL? What was that other thing you wanted to talk about before when you were trying to cut me off and take over the show? Yeah. So this is the thing during the Steve Kim show. We want to point this out. I think that was Chris Mark made his point about pro choice that he's not going to be a hypocrite about it. I thought that was incredibly well done and poignant because he had people thinking, oh, yeah, yeah. They were like, oh, you could hear the cringe like, oh, I got you. Because both things can be true. I mean, I thought, wow, that was that was good. That was a counter punching at the level of Purnell Whitaker. And then the one thing that I think I'm just telling you, when he talked about being in a neighborhood where men don't work in the afternoon, I kept thinking to myself, that's what Scott Adams is saying. Scott Adams was probably laughing his ass off in his lily white neighborhood thinking that's exactly what I'm talking about. And it harkened back to one of his old wrists about there's black people. And so he actually went back to that and he tied it together. And I thought that was really good. At that point there, I think was awesome. And he was making a point about the matriarchy as well. All this, you know, over backwards, we're doing for women, if we just get women jobs, everything will be better. Not won't. If you got men sitting around at home doing nothing, you're going to have chaos. But I thought it was terrific. Thought he was terrific. Thought you were okay. Steve, Kim, Steve Burt. I want you guys to jump in the comments right now and tell me who we should bring back Steve Burt or Steve Kim. You know where I stand. Well, Korean Co-Shel, but even to your point about the pro life and all that stuff, that's another aspect of why I love moving to Nashville, you know. There's just a different mentality as opposed to like living in Los Angeles. Like I have a neighbor that came up to me yesterday and said, oh, we're having a baby. And my wife and I like congratulations. It's so awesome. Is it a boy or a girl? And they just said, you know, we're going to let the kindergarten teacher decide that. So it's good to be here. All right. Hey, we got to go tight. So today we got to go. Great job guys. You got something else? You got more, Steve? My show should end right now. So just cut it. Just cut it. I'm good. I'm done. All right. Hit the likes. Hit the subscribe. Hit the notifications. Give me a five-star review at Apple. We'll see you tomorrow. Just one. I want to be. I just want. I want to be. I just want."
