She always makes for a good time I should just fire still you know, yeah, probably probably probably probably best part of the show today The reason why people should listen. Oh man. Um, we're sending F-16s. Maybe to your crane Yeah, I was a fun part like that and strangely it could be tied You know just in conspiracy-minded people like me to the Breaking news that CBS news had that the Department of Homeland Security is issuing satellite phones to the Senate Every Senate member has been issued only 50 of them took it, but they said, you know, that's just in case, you know Disruption in communications Which happens all The time almost every day. Oh my gosh. Oh so much. Okay, so much and more including James Comer is on with us talking about what he has found on the Biden some fascinating breaking news on that as well Brought to you by American giant May is military appreciation month at American giant All members of the military community active duty reserve is national guards veterans military family members They all receive a 30% discount. It's America giant's way of saying thank you for your service and protecting our freedom American giant was founded on the principles of putting a hard day's work and making a product that makes a difference It's what our military tries to do or some of the guys at the top, you know what I gotta call American giant and see if we can lose some of the discounts for some of the big guys in Washington Now we should include them all or not American Dash giant dot com slash military by American at American dash giant dot com slash military get 30% off Through your military discount great clothing all made in America You'll miss me too The best of the command Filling in for stupid gear today is Pat Gray hello Pat hello Glenn how are you? Oh? Yeah, right so we love trans Oh my gosh, that is it is becoming Sincerely a deep mental illness yeah a mental illness what I I'm sorry, but I was I went to Target on Friday and I'm just you know, we're just going to buy bananas and then I go buy the swimsuit area and I'm Hmm are the bananas here? because Sure looks like there's lots of bananas in the women swimsuit section and It's not the women's with swimsuit section. They look like women swimsuits, but they're not They are for trans people now Let's not be stupid trans people have been with us for a long time in in one auction I so regret that I just didn't go an extra bid I was bidding on a letter from the 1880s and it was from a fort out someplace out west in the middle of nowhere and it was a letter to somebody back home and They said you know, Mrs Waffleheimer or whatever her name was Mrs Waffleheimer died and she was our cook and she was the greatest cook ever and we miss her so much we were surprised however to to when we found her dead body we were surprised as we were putting her in her coffin to see that Basically she had junk downstairs She was a dude the whole time. So this is not something new. It's been around I have no problem with trans if that's what you want to do But it is a very small percentage Less than 1% of the population. Let me say it again less than 1% and You would think we are a country made up of trans people and I have to tell you When you have bathing suits for kids with the tuck it option You got a problem as a nation a real problem as a nation and I would suggest We stop it right now you I've said to you before The greatest advice anyone can give you is live not by lies do not live indoors or or associate with anyone who is telling lies and Right now our entire society is lying Remove yourself from that when I was walking down the aisles of I mean I about lost my mind walking down the aisles of target and I saw all of this all of this trans stuff and rainbows everywhere and it's like Can we please for the love of Pete? Have some balance in our lives Now let me give you the story today that I think hopefully will Awaken some people. I mean I'm wide awake. I hope my wife is wide awake I hope this will awaken people and say okay. No more target. No more target But I will tell you I spent the whole weekend here in the studio recording my new book Future a dark future and it's 500 pages. So Over two days and 12 hours. I only made it through half of the book But it is really really good. It's gonna come out here in about four weeks You'll be able to get it get it now if you can get the audiobook But please and you'll understand why when you read it get the hardbound copy as well. Don't just get it digitally These books will go away soon Soon if we really go much further Anyway in this book you will find how deeply in bed Walmart is With the wef. I mean they are neck deep with the world economic forum and ESG and all of that stuff. So you're losing Walmart and you're losing target But it's high time we lose them if that's the side they want to be on now. What side is that? They'll say they're just being open. They're being inclusive. I want you to listen to this story Target is already facing boycotts for selling tuck friendly bathing suits and LGBTQ onesies for babies now It's been revealed that target is selling LGBTQ pride products from a designer that appears to promote violence drug use and Satanism Target sells three items by the brand Abbrellon We belong everywhere messenger bags too queer for here messenger bag Cure trans phobia not trans people t-shirts LGBTQ items are available on the target website and in its stores Target describes all of the products as all items were designed for all bodies regardless of gender identity and presentation Just I want you to hear this remember that the goal of Black Lives Matter stated on their page until they removed it because everybody went wait a minute. What is to destroy? families The biggest thing in the global warming movement is to destroy families by telling people don't have children And who else wants to destroy families and children's Satan that's who Okay, we added design features to help make the fit Customizable for you another words target is saying you can tuck your little wiener in and wear a chicks bathing suit That that is that is not Normal how many are you selling of those target how many? I'm gonna go I'm gonna go and I'm making my last stop at Target I am going and buying some of these things for the museum because someday No one will believe that these were on the shelves of giant box stores like Target Our hope is it guests our guests find clothing that makes them feel comfortable and affirmed in their identity You are either male or your female Period now you can dress any way you want But you are either male or female period you go into a hospital and You've got your bleeding downstairs and you say you're a woman But you ain't a woman the doctor is going to work on you as a male Not a female. He's gonna look at the your wiener and say that doesn't look like something you should be bleeding out of Oh We understand that fit is incredibly important Yeah, Target truth is more important and we'll continue to evolve and improve on fit needs for lg dp t f q i s rnt In the product descriptions target credits gay lesbian and straight education network and they have a 10-year partnership with Glason They lead the movement according to Target in creating a firming accessible and anti-racist Spaces now, how are you suddenly? Why is lgbtq i2 plus? Why are they now? Claiming that they make things that are anti-racist too You could be homophobic you could be transphobic you could be Too spirit phobic that's the one that gets me I've spooked by those two spirit people But racism Anyway, we're proud of 10 years plus celebration with the support of their mission blah blah blah now you go to the website of the Company that they have partnered with based in London And you find that it was trans founded by a gay trans man great the founder and designer is Eric Callan and according to trans lash a Website that is building experiences to advance trans narratives histories healings and most importantly the human rights of trans people He started this company and then he wrote about his contract with It with Target He said and I quote being able to sell my stuff in Target stores is incredibly exciting Knowing that people are seeing it without necessarily explicitly seeking Lgbtq related stuff is wonderful I'm especially happy about the thought that young closeted people will see it and I hope in some way They'll feel a little more comfortable in themselves as we deserve to feel You can get the sweatshirt and the bags on Target's website or in stores He goes on these have already got the trans phobes fear infuriated with me and I feel like quite the celebrity to think that they believe this is all some sort of big Conspiracy and that I have any power to brainwash anyone. I'm just some guy drawing pictures Are you Callan claims that the world the word groomer is a right-wing trans phobic word Mm-hmm. However, he also goes on to confess that he was groomed when he was young and he will likely be working Through it for the rest of his life When I was in my very early teens I was groomed and in an abusive relationship Friendship with a person 10 years older than me Ha ha However, his designs nearly all feature the colors of the transgender flag appear to promote violence drug use and Satanism There are designs that seem to call for violence including a pin with two axes that reads Fight for trans rights. There is a design with a guillotine with skulls near it that reads homophobic headrest now imagine If I made a t-shirt that had a guillotine and skulls and I said liberal headrest Do you think they would say I was promoting violence? He sells a pin with a ball and chain flail weapon that says we bash back gay bashing lesbian bashing trans bashing queer bashing all too far far too prevalent in this world and From the comments shouted on the streets to the horrific violent crimes committed against LGBTQ plus people Sometimes there's only one language those who harass us understand Some might say turn the other cheek, but others would advise to bash them back And if you're gonna do that why not do it with a heart-shaped pastel colored mace One design features a lit lighter with the words bring to burn down the cis-tem Uh-huh the cis-tem is what keeps trans kids from feeling free This is what he's writing now on Instagram They're true selves. It makes the world a day Dangerous for them to live in it causes people to feel guilty for transitioning It aims to ensure that we stay in rigid boxes set up at birth It makes it harder for trans women to get jobs housing insurance. It tells non-binary people that they don't exist It's the reason trans women face both misogyny and transphobia in equal measure It's becoming the cis-tem that trans men are erased and overlooked now trans men are trans women I'm not sure We don't need to restructure it he writes we need to burn it down and start up again in a system that doesn't police gender or Expression a world that allows exploration changing our minds dressing how we want to taking up the space we need Being treated as we deserve we need to burn down the system and Create a world where trans people don't get to just live but thrive His account also encourages transgender people to bite turfs Which is trans exclusionary radical feminist the design features a snake biting a hand of a human and The caption reads never trust a turf. They're not well meaning. They just don't care about cis-cis women's rights They don't have the right intentions avoid them when you can and bite them when you can't Another one another other slogans that you will find from the designer of the target clothing Join my gay cult Transitioning saves lives heteronorm normal Normalivity. How do you say that's better on normativity? Yeah, I'll that room normativity is a plague Binding doesn't make you less of a man and trans witches for abortion So I think we're doing good Hail trans demons he also says oh and one more t-shirt available Satan respects pronouns Congratulations are you shopping at Target? I hope not This is the best of the Glendbeck program Congressman Comer welcome to the program sir. How are you? I'm well. Thanks for having me you bet So I understand you've carved out some time for us, and I really appreciate that You have been doing just God's work and and thank you for everything that you are exposing and the trouble I imagine you are having just even running your life because of it. So thank you My pleasure. It's it's something that I think despite what the mainstream media wants to think I think the majority of Americans are keeping up with what we're doing and are very concerned about public corruption Yeah, because it goes beyond you know crack cocaine and and hookers And it even goes beyond the White House this goes to the intelligence community the FBI the Justice Department All of it all of it seemed to be involved in this is it yeah, is it something we can? clean up Well, I hope so I think that The Durham report was a start it didn't go as far as what I think most of us would have wanted knowing how bad the FBI is But you know there's a pattern here that dates back to the Hillary Clinton years at least Where the FBI has gotten engaged in elections and tried to cover up Democrat mistakes and and try to create Republican mistakes especially with the With in the case with with Trump so you know the intelligence community Has suffered a black eye. I think polling shows that the average Americans lost confidence in the FBI And I can tell you from this Biden investigation We the stuff that the Biden family alone did let's take Joe Biden out of the equation Okay, let's just take him out of the question the stuff that his family not just the son The family has done no other American could have gotten away with no other American could have gotten away With having this mini shell companies with having this many banks Notified the federal government that they were concerned they were committing among other things money laundering and No one could get away with with the the tax evasion Situations that the family has not just the Sun, but the entire family So I think the American people are starting to see there is a two-tier system of justice and and they want Reform and the only way that's gonna happen is to get rid of The people at the top and not just the department not just the attorney general and not just the FBI director But the next level of leadership too. We need completely new faces in Our intelligence community and the Department of Justice. I will tell you that it concerns me that Some people will just drop this let's say, you know Biden dies tomorrow from a ham sandwich or whatever And he's not there anymore. I think there's a lot of people in Washington that would say okay We don't need to pursue this. I will tell you No matter how he leaves office or when he leaves office This has that someone has to pay a price Otherwise, you're gonna get the next politician and the next politician You've got to you've got to go in and root this cancer out Absolutely, and that was the disappointing thing for me with the Durham report. There were no criminal referrals There was no well, how do you how do you feel about his answer to that with? You know well, I did say that you can't do anything until there's fidelity restored to the Constitution Yeah, I mean, well, that's the that's the most obvious thing That that's been written in a long time, right? We've this is something where right now with these debt ceiling talks you finally got the Republican Senate leadership Getting our backs for trying to be the adults in the room and restore some fiscal discipline To have some budget cuts, you know to try to get closer to a balanced budget the next thing that the Senate leadership's gonna have to do is get our backs when we when we carve out the the appropriations bill Which will start in October? We're gonna have to hold these agencies accountable. That's the only way to reign them in Be it with the with the Democrats controlling the White House with the media turning a blind eye and not Providing any type of investigative reporting or checks and balances or even accurate reporting on the corruption and the wrongdoing they're going we are going to have to Cut their budgets in these positions to the bone we have tools in our new rule package to do that with the homin rule and The only way we can do it all day a lot people talk about in pH and pH well the Senate won't convict The one thing that the Senate can do it will get is get our backs and help us cut the FBI Positions, you know halt their their expansion you do whatever we can with the power of the purse until they Resign and we get new competent leadership in these these government agencies I hope I hope that they actually follow through with that I know there's several of you and in Washington for the very first time in probably 12 years I feel like there are More than a handful of people that actually care and are trying to do the right thing and that's given me a lot of hope Let me go back to the the Biden family you say that No one would be able to get away with this Explain what the crimes are that the families are involved in I mean they they have what 20 plus LLCs And even like some of the grandchildren are being paid and I can't figure out for what Right. Well, neither can I I've been looking into this for for several months, but let's start with The payments coming from from China and Romania because they're the only two countries that I've discussed and I can assure you Then there are many more. Let's just talk about these two countries For some reason these countries provided payments to Primarily the present son and brother now for what we don't know so either one of two things was happening either they were providing some type of representation For for those countries Romania and China And even in some of the material that we've seen from the CEFC which is the Chinese energy company that Hunter was was getting paid by Angium they had in there that Hunter was basically a lobbyist for them with the with the federal government now There's a term for that. That's called a foreign agent Jonathan Turley talks about this all time At the very least if they were if Joe Biden at like the New York Times wants to wants to say Joe Biden had no Knowledge of this had nothing to do with this whatsoever Then the president's son and it would have been then vice president son and brother Were foreign agents for to the worst countries on the planet? And they weren't registered and that is a felony where you go to jail you pay a fine It's a very serious felony or Joe Biden Was doing things for the country and funneling the money to his brother and his son So that's one crime somebody committed a crime Either either Joe Biden committed a very serious crime. You could argue treason or whatever For espionage wheel. There's a million different things you could you could argue Joe Biden did wrong or his brother and his son did There's no other option somebody committed a crime there either the either Joe Biden Or his son and his brother or all three of them then the next crime For whatever they were doing instead of those countries just sending the money directly to the Bidens They funneled it through all these different LLCs And there's a term for that called money laundering and that's a very serious crime now hang on just a second is there any way anyway to Look at this in a different way and have a reasonable No, I didn't think so you're not there's no other way somebody committed a crime So if you're gonna say if if the if the New York Times wants to say that Joe Biden didn't do anything Comer exonerated Joe Biden which by the way, we're just getting started But let's just say listen and no one in America believes in New York Times other than the crazy liberal loony That that won't have believed in your time. Let's just say Joe Biden had nothing to do with it the family If they're unregistered foreign agents They money laundered then they've created all these LLCs to try to disguise the payments which if they were legal payments Why are you trying to disguise them or are you trying to deceive the IRS and not pay taxes? You know there's some reason they've created all these companies that don't have any legitimate purpose other than to Receive and transfer funds from foreign nationals. You know, there's a term for that creating companies That have no legitimate purpose Fraud but to laundry money that's called racketeering racketeering and then there's another term called wire fraud I mean the list goes on and on and on that any American if your last name isn't Biden would have already been convicted on and that's if Joe Biden had Absolutely nothing to do with it and I will tell you that is is not what I believe But because you look at these countries whether it be Romania Whether be China and and the other countries that will talk about in the future Ukraine is No Biden went there during the last year and a half of his vice presidency and took his son with him You know what I mean? So they were setting this up is very clear what they were doing All right back in just a second. We're talking to Congressman James Comer from Kentucky about the scandals in Washington. I want to get to The whistleblowers and the informants and FBI and the IRS when we come back This is the best of the Glenn Beck program Okay, so let's talk about the informants and the FBI and the IRS is everybody safe Yeah, the ones that the most racial ones are the ones that are missing are informants that Have been around for several years since since my investigation began Which was basically the end of January when I got subpoena power first in February the IRS informant and the informant that integratically brought forward that is alleging The FBI has information pertaining to a potential bribery attempt by vice president Joe Biden those informants and whistleblowers are alive and well and and there was some confusion as to interview I did on Marie by Roma We were talking about one of the the the Israeli whistleblower informant whatever you want to call him that has been in the news for several years and and he is missing but I think the media didn't understand who I was referring to and and took it in a different direction and maybe I should have done a better job explaining it but for our investigative purposes The two main whistleblowers that are in the news are alive and well now the the people that have inside knowledge of the Biden family Infillate pedaling schemes and we know who a lot of those people are Because there have been books written there have been you know reports issued about some of these people they're very concerned There they've been threatened. They've been intimidated so And you saw how the The FBI whistleblowers that they hadn't had fun of his committee were treated by the federal government It's amazing and then the IRS whistleblower was removed from the Hunter Biden case. So, you know, there's lots of examples of intimidation And scare tactics by not just the White House, but also the Biden Legal team I was surprised to see the IRS said that wasn't us that that that order came from the Justice Department To get rid of that team. That's Wildly illegal is it not? It is it is. I mean to retaliate against credible whistleblowers that That's about as bad as it gets in the federal government and for someone that's in charge of the House Oversight Committee We depend on Two people if nothing out two types of people we depend on the inspectors general Because they're the ones that that are supposed to be independent and do audits So if we want to try and wage fraud and abuse the their iGs as they're called are very important for us They're important tool for us and then whistleblowers Because whistleblowers are the ones that that know what's really going on in these deep state bureaucracies So for the federal government Joe Biden's administration to actively arrogantly Retalliate against whistleblowers says says a lot about the corruption in this administration Yeah, it says it really kind of says they're not afraid. I mean that's that's the that's the overwhelming impression that I think the average American has is these guys just don't ever think Anything's gonna happen to them and it kind of knocks the wind out of Americans because you feel like I've talked to so many people who say oh Yeah, yeah another whistleblower and they haven't even paid attention to some of the stuff coming out of of Congress and your your committee Because they say and then what what's gonna happen nobody ever goes to jail? Yeah, and that's Something that we're very aware of and we want to hold people accountable that's we change the name of the oversight committee to oversight and accountability because What's happening in the past as you know is these committees they identify problems, but then nothing happens changes There's no solution to the problems. No one's held accountable for wrongdoing and again that goes back to the Durham report I'm not a fan of special councils. I know a lot of Republicans call we need a special counsel on the bidet look It show me one special counsel that ever amounted to a thing Haven't seen one right and Durham took up a lot of time a lot of resources And and didn't didn't accomplish anything. We do a special counsel on the Bidens. I have no doubt Because it's so obvious I tell people investigating the Biden families like tracking a bleeding bear through a snowstorm I mean they have left evidence everywhere and we have their bank records, so they can't lie about their bank records Yeah, and we have a minute before I have to break again, but the 170 flags from banks saying this looks like money laundering That's that is overwhelming. Is it not that doesn't happen all the time? And I'm not allowed to talk in great detail about those bank violations, but it wasn't just money laundering They alleged other crimes too, and this wasn't just one or two or three banks. This was many banks Many banks all imagine the same thing. I mean it's unprecedented. I was the director of a bank for over a decade.
