    "text": " Phil Robertson here, they told me Hollywood doesn't want hard stories these days. Well, my story is about as messy as they come, but it turns out our movie, The Blind, is reaching a mighty throng out there. You break a few box office records and suddenly, Hollywood takes notice that this is a message you'll want to hear. You're never too far gone. God can reach you wherever you are, no matter how dark things have gotten. If you're lost, he can give you refuge. If you weary, he can bring you strength. It was hard to watch my darkest moments on a screen, but when I hear that people are finding hope after seeing this movie, I know the embarrassment was worth it. I hope you'll watch The Blind and share it with someone who needs to know it's not too late to turn it around. On The Blind today at blazetv.com slash The Blind. Welcome. Welcome to Phil is with Jason Whitlock. I am Jason Whitlock, your host, Happy Tuesday to you and yours. It's the day after Monday. We're soldering into the week and boy. Am I excited about today's show? I hope you are as well. We had an interesting Monday night football game that we will start our discussion with today. We'll do that with Steve Kim and Jason Brown. We'll talk about Cooper Rush's performance and what it might mean for Dak Prescott. Then the second half of the show, we're going to pivot and we're going to beautify the show and make the show smarter and better and easier to watch and look at. As we invite Shamika Michelle, Tiffany Odom, Jill Savage and Lauren Chin onto the show, we're going to talk about the movie Don't Worry Darling and we're going to talk about a video of that some group called CBC or something put out where a black woman is sitting around at a dinner table with a bunch of white women and having one of these uncomfortable conversations that everybody loves to talk about and she asks the white women would you trade places with a black person. Anyway, it was stupid but we're going to play the video and we're going to discuss it with Jill Savage, Lauren Chin and Shamika Michelle and so we'll start with some football talk then we'll pivot to some what girls tripping is maybe what I want to because I want to I'm coming up with reasons to bring the ladies on to the show to diversify our conversation and get a different perspective. Anyway, so I don't know if I want to call it girls tripping or what but anyway fantastic show playing for you today. We'll start by bringing in Steve Kim and talking about last night's Monday Night Football Game, the Dallas Cowboys won their second straight game with backup quarterback Cooper Rush leading the Dallas Cowboys to victory. His stats were somewhat modest but had a couple of passes not been dropped one by CD lamb and one by some rookie wide receiver. His stats could have looked really impressive and we must remember that Jerry Jones the owner of the Cowboys has stated and maybe he's just pushing out conversation maybe he's being facetious or sarcastic but he says it'd be a good problem if the Cowboys had a quarterback problem when Dak Prescott had a quarterback controversy when Dak Prescott returned healthy and we may have inched a tiny bit closer to that last night. Steve welcome back to the show. Did we move an inch closer to a potential quarterback controversy last night in Dallas? You know just when I thought Michael Irvin had the greatest overreaction to Cooper Rush then I hear this no no look this you I knew you're gonna do this I'm watching this game last night and I think you know Cooper Rush is okay did a nice job late but I said I wonder if Jason's gonna go there and here we are look Cooper Rush did a very nice job he's actually won two games but this is a bad giant team let's see how we're talking about Cooper Rush after the next two weeks when they play some really good squads I believe Philadelphia and the LA Rams and even Detroit if it gets that far who's a really improved team under Dan Campbell Cooper Rush is a great placeholder he's proving to be a quality backup now I'm not saying Dak Prescott is super elite because he's not but there are certain things with the backup quarterback that you just simply can't do and you saw how limited the game was in the first half which was an offensive pillow fight for the first 30 minutes but no this this is not Danny White and Gary Hogan boom this is not even Troy Aikman Steve Walsh let's put that in the rest when Dak Prescott is ready to come back and with that 40 million dollar contract you will be under center of the Dallas Cowboys listen the best argument is what you said at the end Dak has a 40 million dollar contract that pretty much stops any thought of a legitimate QB controversy however if this guy continues to win games and he doesn't have to win them all but if he wins enough I do think people are going to start asking this question I lived through this in Kansas City where there's a quarterback that's like what is he you know is he really good and again this is you know what this analogy does work because I'm not sure Dak Prescott's any better than what Elvis Gerback was when he was the quarterback of the Kansas City Chiefs and and Elvis Gerback they had a backup quarterback by the name of Rich Gannon undersized ran around a little bit you didn't really know what his arm strength was it was tough to figure out exactly what Rich Gannon was but the Chiefs won when Rich Gannon played quarterback and they lost when Elvis Gerback played quarterback and Chiefs fans wanted Rich Gannon out there as the starting quarterback the organization was financially committed to Elvis Gerback and they would never make the move to Rich Gannon lo and behold Rich Gannon goes off to Oakland and becomes a superstar that's not me predicting that Cooper Rush is going to go someplace else and become a superstar but I've just seen quarterbacks that like you're sitting is this guy really good and what's going on but but he's the team seems to win and the thing I come away with from last night's games Steve is if Dallas gets any kind of consistent offensive production I think their defense is very good I think they get after the quarterback maybe as well as any team in the national football league and and they did that last night without Michael Parsons I think Dallas has all the ingredients particularly on the defensive side they need to shore up their receiving core I'm not really sold on CD lamb as a number one receiver but on the defensive side they're solid if they get they got two good running backs and Tony Pollard and Ezekiel Elliott if they get adequate quarterback play this is a dangerous team and I can sit I don't believe it I'm not ready to go there but I do think we took an inch forward towards a quarterback controversy I don't think the Giants are as bad as you're making them out to be yes they are their offensive line is and Danny Dimes I'm actually surprised that our guy Jason Brown's that high on him I think he's a bust I think there's some athleticism but he's not good but going back to Dallas a couple things you're right about CD silence of the lambs I don't think he's the number one he gives me the Alvin Harperfield and not the Michael Irvinfield certain guys are really good as the secondary guy that can stretch the defense but when he dropped that pass it made me think of what do great players do because he made up for it according to some people with that one-handed grab you know what the great players do the real number ones they make all the routine plays it's not about the spectacular highlight real plays it's about making the routine play at a high level every single game because those type of one-handed grabs they make the highlight tape you're right but I want a wide receiver that gives me good game tape by catching every pass that hits them right in the numbers the other thing you talked about the kind of the thunder and lightning they have with Pollard and Zeke look Zeke gets a lot of heat because of his contract but he still has a pretty good chain moving running back he can get you the top yards and he keeps you ahead of the sticks early down right so consistently get you two second and six now if you need an explosive play that's Pollard but Pollard because of his size I don't think he's a heavy-duty 25 per game guy which is fine because now you could split the carries look at what they did yesterday and game flow is important this was a relatively close game for three and a half quarters I believe they passed the ball 31 times and they ran the ball 30 so that's about a 50-50 ratio I think they found out something for the future do that with DAC I don't believe DAC or really a lot of quarterbacks are meant to carry a team by just shocking that ball 40 to 45 times maybe even when DAC gets back they're gonna say you know what this phrase applies less is more in other words stay balanced love that argument agree with that argument that they are going to have to go that route with DAC but again that that's a guy you're paying 40 million dollars a year that you're basically asking just to manage the game don't put the game in his hands and I'm just for fans because really what a QB controversy is is a conversation driven by fans sports talk radio opinionist columnists whatever ESPN talking heads what and so it's really not a locker room controversy as much even though with that Gerback Ganon illustration there was a locker room controversy and there could be one here because of the contract because again if we're paying a guy 40 but we're treating like we're only paying 25 inside that locker room why they paying DAC all this money when when he's basically being asked to do the same things as Cooper Rush Cooper Rush last night 21 to 31 215 yards and a TD if he doesn't have the CD lamb drop which was a atrocious and then I think the other guy's name is Jaylen Tolbert yeah some some rookie Jaylen Tolbert he had a huge drop that I couldn't believe Troy Aikman and those guys didn't make a big deal of it last night it was a hell of a throw you throw another 60 yards on the Cooper Rush's deal and now he's 23 or 31 for 275 yards or 255 yards now I'm just you're inching closer much closer to a QB controversy if he only has instead of 10 incompletions eight incompletions additional 50 yards his stats now look very impressive and maybe one of those long balls has turned into a touchdown and he's got a second TD the seeds are being planted for a controversy Steve well Jason two things here you would have to talk to some of the covers the Cowboys intimately I would love to know the locker room politics if it actually became a full-blown quarterback controversy slash competition because you know the way it works sometimes it's certain guys are very popular guys are with them it's their guy and even if it's a warranted benching you know the things that can happen with that dynamic okay the other thing is this going back to Rich Gannon Rich Gannon had a career renaissance and the last I believe quarter of his career under John Gruden I mean he was a highly productive quarterback to a point but I'm not mistaken I think he won an MVP in 2002 you really see that type of upside with Cooper Rush under any system under any circumstance no but crazier things have happened Steve I didn't see Rich Gannon as an MVP at any point when he was in Kansas City I actually and again I got to admit like when I was wrong all the fans or a big majority of the fans and I'd say half the locker room wanted Rich Gannon to be the quarterback I argued at that time I was like man they're paying girl back too much money to go to Rich Gannon it's an unreasonable request I defended the organization and the decision they made there look silly in retrospect Gerback not long after that moved out of Kansas City eventually out of the league and and I'm just there's no difference there's no difference other than Gerback's taller I don't think there's any difference between Elvis Gerback and Dak Prescott and and and the Chiefs had to move on from him and and to me Jerry Jones in his desperation to get a championship I think he he would mentally I don't know if financially I think mentally he's capable of moving on from Dak Prescott because this dude is desperate to prove and and I just I think Dallas has a really good roster listen to this Steve I mean yeah the quarterback you're saying is basically untouchable and you're saying it because of his contract primarily but in his last 39 games the guy is 21 and 18 man 21 and 18 in his last 39 games not trying to put that all on Dak there's a lot of extenuating circumstances I think the Cowboys overpaid for his equal Elliot out of loyalty and and they should have moved on from him and we can be having a conversation about Zeke and his role Tony Pollard out played him last night and they're paying Zeke all that money but because it's a quarterback league and because that's what we talk about most often we're talking about Dak Prescott and what all this means for him Jason let's go back two years ago when you're at the other networks speak for yourself I know you guys spoke upon it a lot you were one of the guys it's a Dak Prescott is not worth more than 30 million if I recall correctly right so but that's the going rate it's like gas I don't want to pay six dollars for a gallon of gas but if I want to drive my car I got to pay it that's the going rate unfortunately with that said if you go back to that 2020 season I remember watching the game it was like the fourth or fifth game of the year Dak Prescott's leg gets crushed and he's out for the year and then everyone threw a lot of guilt at Jerry Johnson you should have taken care of him and then even with the veteran guy believe it was Andy Dalton the cowboys looked awful I mean they looked like the 1989 cowboys and I think Jerry's and oh my god I've got it this guy's worth it see what happened here without Dak and it turned out to be like an overreaction to an injury and there was a public pressure for Jerry to really pay his quarterback now I will say this let's table this a little bit the next two games are an eagle team that I'm very high on and defending Super Bowl champions if they even split those games and Cooper Rush is playing a good solid game a quarterback I may inch over to your side Jason let's see how this plays out here all right we will circle back thank you Steve I'm gonna keep it moving bring on Jason Brown because Jason Brown texted me last night that Cooper Rush is better than Dak Prescott and I was like oh and so Steve thinks I'm crazy I'm just saying we're inching towards a quarterback controversy Jason Brown last chance you you know last chance cue we call him he thinks Cooper Rush is better than Dak Prescott we'll discuss that here in a second but first I want to talk with you guys about my good friends over at a pre-born pardon this interruption this is not a commercial this is me speaking from the heart this is me talking

back welcome back to fearless with Jason wedlock you know what I was thinking during that short break about how emotional I am and can be as it relates to kids and and it's almost pre-born has picked the perfect person in me because every time I promote them and what they're doing it makes me emotional it makes me want to give because that that you know I'm you guys listening to me on this show I am far from a perfect person I'm a flawed person very flawed I've you know and and working to improve myself every day you're watching me try to address my weight problems you're watching me try to address my cursing you're you know I talk about you know lust and all the different issues that I deal with and I'm I mean if you follow me on twitter you see how flawed I am one moment I'm you know promoting the greatest gospel song I ever heard in the next moment I'm arguing with someone over twitter and being dismissive of them but when it comes to kids I I just that is my special spot even though I don't have them even though I don't really like babysitting them but I just do have a special spot for kids I just want them to have the kind of childhood and life that I have had and so I'm going on and on and on about pre-born but I may have to call these guys a pre-born and say hey look you guys are costing me money because every time I do this read every time I promote you guys it ends up costing me money but it's well worth it you got to get listen you got to give till it hurts a little bit that's how you know you're making a difference when it hurts you it's actually a good thing for everybody else that's how you know you're sacrificing and so I can authentically say I'm not asking you to do anything that I'm not willing to do we got to support this pre-born pre-born.com slash fearless now I want to keep the moving to bring on Jason Brown and we'll probably you'll see probably see Jason Brown gets me fired up I'll probably revert back although I'm in a very Christian like mood right now I've just given more money to pre-born I'm all in on babies but Jason Brown's gonna make me talk football and talk about the Dak Prescott and sometimes Jason Brown gets me fired up Jason welcome back I appreciate you doing this two straight days but you texted me last night saying that Cooper Rush is better than Dak Prescott and you're like the people at pre-born you know how to provoke me you know how to get me fired up a fastener I can't even say I completely disagree with you but the fact that you're willing to say it I want to hear your explanation why do you think Cooper Rush is better than Dak Prescott? As a coach okay as a coach you see different things by coaches on the sideline when certain people are in the game so compare Kellen Moore when Dak is in the game look at his antics look at his energy and then compare that to when Cooper Rush is in the game a burden has been lifted off this man he has no stress whatsoever he's not supposed to be winning right now with Cooper Rush the hundred million dollar man put stress on Kellen Moore Kellen Moore right now is running around on the sideline he's hugging Cooper Rush have you ever seen him hug Dak Prescott? have you ever seen him he's laded like he is right now because he has a no win he's in a no lose situation as a as a play caller and as a OC and I'm not a big believer in him as a play caller in an OC but what I am understanding of is that is what the business entails now I'm not saying Dak's not a listener or a leader or any of that I'm not in their locker room I'm not gonna put my foot in my mouth what I do know is though it is night and day from how he interacts with Dak compared to how he interacts with the guy making a hundred thousand dollar league minimum and he has no stress he's living he's living for Scott Furry right now and to be honest Cooper Rush is more efficient he is more accurate he makes better decisions with his body not his arm and mind his body meaning he climbs a pocket vertically and he either takes off vertically or he throws the football away to live to fight another down that is the precursor and prerequisite of a winning quarterback live to fight another down let's not turn it over let's not get sacks let's not take sacks and let's not create an environment on the road that is a hostile more hostile one than it already is because sacks make opposing crowds go crazy turnovers make opposing crowds go crazy when you limit those things you have a chance for success and to be honest what he throw forth 30 yard 30 times last night he had a 75 yard touchdown dropped by CD lamb hey he would have thrown for 300 yards two touchdown zero picks and was very very game manager looking and to be honest he's available Jason that is the number one prerequisite he is a available Dak Prescott is a bleeder he's something of what I call a CP2 in the NBA CP3 is Candice Parker by the way CP2 is Chris Paul who continues to stay injured when it counts and and that is what he is in the NFL Dak Prescott is a bleeder um you know you get punched in the mouth Jason you bleed a lot some people get punched in the mouth they wipe it off and it's done bleeding they scab up that is what a lot of people that are available do he's not he's a bleeder he's hurt he's always hurt he's injured he's injury prone he's Anthony Davis the NFL and that's what it is Cooper Rush is available gives my team a chance to win availability is the most important ability coach is saying all the time so you're right there I I here's I want to translate or give an interpretation of what you're saying and this is what a lot of coaches like you got a veteran player that's got 40 million dollar a year contract he's much harder to control he's not as dependent on the coaching staff as a guy like Cooper Rush who's trying to just prove that he's even worthy of playing in the NFL so he's going to do exactly what Kellen Moore programs him to do and some coaches like that and and particularly if they look if you're Tom Brady Aaron Rodgers Russell Wilson and there's a proven track record of like oh when this guy freelances good things happen coaches just kind of grit their teeth and deal with it Dak I don't think has that reputation or creates that feeling like oh when he freelances and just kind of does what he wants to do it skids off the road and so I maybe Kellen Moore just likes to control he has over Cooper Rush because Cooper Rush is dependent upon him and the system and won't ever really go off script won't you know change up any plays doesn't have that kind of autonomy and so maybe it's just he can control Cooper Rush so he's more comfortable with Cooper Rush I look at it differently I don't think it's control as much as it is willing to accept and do I think Cooper Rush is more willing and accepting of his role than a Dak Prescott is not that he's too egotistical too big or he's already got the bag and he's too good for you I'm not saying Dak is that way I've heard Dak is a good dude and all that but I do see a completely different side of Kellen Moore and the team if you look at the actual team you see them how they are and if they didn't like or ride with this guy you would see a little bit of a contention on the sideline you don't see it at all and can we please take the headsets off the injured player like we are putting these players on a pedestal of what is considered a hierarchy so I want to be clear Dak Prescott's not a damn coach either is a JJ Y or whoever it is they get injured and they got us headset on and you think that is how enabling we are we won't just tell a guy to go sit down somewhere and be injured we want them to have a headset on and be part of the game plan like they're really in tune like oh man I know what's going on you don't know what's going on you're not the OC you're not equal to us so that is the problem when that stops in the head coach and the OC say you know what we don't need you to be on a headset because you're just a distraction to be honest how about you go over there and just support him as a leader off the field when he comes off but let's get you off the damn headset we got too many of this I see this all over I see it in college now the guys are in the booth when they're hurt like Zach Wilson was that year I'm like come on man we are giving them a spoon at saying you know what we're gonna we're gonna hand-speed feed you here total different total different take on this if if I follow your narrative maybe they want Dak on the headsets so that he has a better understanding of what the coaches are thinking during a game and so that when he does get back on the field perhaps he will have more buy-in when he sees things and hears things from their perspective I think having Dak having your quarterback while he's out and hurt in the communication loop giving him that full 360 perspective because you're coming this isn't a college kid this is a kid that you've given hundreds of millions of dollars to that you're stuck with that you're stuck with for this foreseeable future and so you just want to give him the complete picture and perhaps get some more buy-in from him yeah the stripes on the tiger don't change though you are what you are already brother you already bought into this cat you either coach it or you allow it when are we gonna break the the curse when are we gonna break this thing because he's with you you've already paid him what can he do the man to trade okay we got a guy in here that looks like opie right now who's two and oh actually three and oh as a starter in the NFL and you're not available and you're unavailable more than you are available I would start changing the narrative and putting some onus on the ownership and saying you know what dog we got you by the sack now you start buying into what we do we're not buying into you anymore we've already paid you so why not give Jerry credit then Jason he is changing the narrative narrative he's the one that came out and said I hope we have a quarter back controversy he opened the door for this and he also waited and put him on a franchise tag and did it pay him originally similar to what Lamar Jackson's looking at doing and it's like Lamar Jackson's available dang it that's a huge difference in my opinion Lamar Jackson plays when he's hurt he even asked to play when he's injured that is what I give Lamar Jackson credit for a lot over a lot of these cats that Prescott will not do the thing that is required of him which means stay healthy be smart live to play another down I'm saying Jason we're going to be talking about Josh Allen here shortly we're going to be talking about Trey Lances we're going to be talking about all these guys if they don't start playing smarter which is going to make sure we lengthen their career we're not trying to shorten their career why are we paying them then like it's to me it's an oxymoron by these owners and what we're doing we're paying guys to hope in one hand crap in the other and see what fills up first like no let's not pay them then like what are we paying them for it's like hope they can play three years like to me it doesn't make sense let's see the result first let's give them somewhat of a good contract and money and then let's see them win us a couple playoff games before we started knowing perfect segue perfect segue into a conversation I want to have with you about ESPN and Lamar Jackson I was watching get up this morning they started talking about Lamar Jackson and I was kind of hopeful because Mike Greenberg started out the segment talking about what motivates Lamar Jackson and Lamar Jackson loves his critics and he devours them and I was like oh okay Mike Greenberg done read my column watching this show heard me and JB talking about this yesterday and and so I was hopeful and then Marcus Spears as Ian I think it's contractually obligated if you talk about a black quarterback at some point during the segment someone has to play the race card let's play the clip and then I want me and you to discuss it Lamar Jackson is a black quarterback okay that has a lot to do with how he's talked about could you imagine that Baker Mayfield was having the career Lamar Jackson is having right now if we would be having these conversations or talking about some anonymous GM talking about him winning 12 times like I hate that I got to bring that up but when it comes to Lamar Jackson it's always yeah but yeah but what is what is he gonna do bro the dude to your point gee what you just saying Lamar Jackson and it's just stop there right now Lamar Jackson is the best player in the NFL right now that's what he is why are we still having conversations about this dude not being a top to have or a top six quarterback in the NFL I tweeted out during the game I said Lamar Jackson can't throw because I wanted to see what the reaction would be you know I actually had come on Twitter and Instagram and people in the in the sphere say yeah you right Swagoo I was being sarcastic America that's what I was being but when it comes I just I'm just tired of having this conversation about what is Lamar he's he's one of the best quarterbacks in the NFL it's just stop right there go ahead Danny I mean he's absolutely right because the issue on when you talk about criticism of Lamar is it's often anonymous because you can hide behind anonymity when you're when your evaluation is rooted in bias and in preconceived notions and obviously issue throughout history that is confronted black quarterbacks in the NFL has been rooted in bias and preconceived notions and ideally you start to break down you know to Marcus's point black quarterbacks have always had their leadership abilities questioned their intelligence belittled and that's what you're seeing with Lamar Jackson but I'll take it a step further Marcus where's the camera at right there if Lamar Jackson continues to play the way that he has these first three weeks of the season he'll be the greatest quarterback this game has ever seen they've he no one's ever done it the way that he's done it I'm proud of him if he sees this message I wanted to know everything we talked about for those three years he's going out there and doing it keep your foot on their neck man I'm so proud of you keep doing your thing okay a lot to unpack here I want to just start with Marcus beers and this whole thing about this they love this anonymous quote from some defensive coordinator a defensive assistant that said you know if he wins 12 MVPs he's still not a QB one to me so they're assuming that the anonymous coach is a white guy and that's justifying their racism it's an anonymous coach there's a lot of black defensive coaches in the NFL there's probably a dozen 10 or what a black defensive coordinators in the NFL black coaches are prevalent on the defensive side of the football so we don't know what race the anonymous coach was first and foremost I want to enter that into the record no one at this point three games into this season is arguing that Lamar Jackson isn't the best player in the league the question is isn't sustainable that's what you keep bringing up and other critics of Lamar Jackson keep bringing up they won't discuss that aspect isn't sustainable I happen to think that it is I've I think he can do this for another four to five years you don't but you're not motivated by some hidden racism and other people that are question is aren't motivated by some hidden racism they're motivated by history and the history says that running quarterbacks have shorter careers I just want to address that part before I get to RG3 so so so Dominic Fox worthy or whatever his name is probably one of the dumbest humans I've ever heard speak on a mic number one RG3 actually tops him he's even worse I've heard him say some things that blow my mind you know I know some dirt on RG3 it's funny that he had a book written about him and it finally just seized out of nowhere and now all of a sudden he's on every single show in America he's on every single talk show and every single NFL college game day he's on everything I'm like damn where did he come from but anyway I love Warren sapped comments about him how he talks about how bad he was and then out of nowhere he's the best guru out there ever all of a sudden it's crazy to me I love that Warren sapped came out and blasted him but here's the thing about this thing I've only coached black quarterback I've coached three white quarterbacks in 20 years he one of them went to the NFL I've coached nothing but black quarterbacks and I have no hidden agenda it is no left right red blue it's not a black and white thing I really don't care the best player plays period and I'm going to try to get that person to the next level in life and on the field now having said that why is this always an agenda on that show it blows my mind why aren't we talking about what he's done in the crucial times of playing the sport and his position he's done nothing he's done absolutely nothing and we keep bringing up black and white and I'm like well why are we bringing up black and white because I'm gonna bring some up Jason is he really is it really a black and white thing because as if I remember and I recall and I'm closer to your age Jason then a lot of the audience probably is I believe Ryan Leif was crucified for being horrible I believe Baker Mayfield has been crucified I believe Carson Winte has been crucified and I am the one that does it I do it every day I think they're horrible and how about Trent Dilfer who won a Super Bowl but even better than that Bernard Pollard who won a Super Bowl for the Ravens was on my show and said Lamar Jackson is absolutely atrocious at playing the quarterback position this is a black man who won a Super Bowl play in defense and said Lamar Jackson can't get out of a bad play and into a good one and guess what guess what he said who could do that call in Kaepernick could do it and they played against him in the playoffs in the Super Bowl I'm excuse me in the Super Bowl where the Ravens beat the Niners in a great Super Bowl and the lights went out and Colin was at the line of scrimmage making checks all day long but nerds on the sidelines for the Ravens games and he said he's never heard Lamar Jackson make a check ever so he is playing making the call that is into the helmet he does it and he tries to execute that play by the way through Fort Touch sounds last week one of them was a shovel pass let's pump our brakes I disagree with you about Lamar in terms of what he's done so far in his career and through three games it's been impressive I think it's sustainable I think people need to open up their minds to a different way of attacking his quarterback position as it relates to Lamar Jackson he may be the actual unicorn I get why you look at the history of Cam Newton and you look at the history of any of these running quarterbacks and say you know what it just doesn't work Peyton Manning Tom Brady Joe Montana they can put together these 10 15 20 year careers it's harder to do that I don't understand I do understand these you know it's like that Dan Garziano you're right Marcus this dude these dudes are scared to actually say what they think and know Jeff Saturday sitting there playing the NFL for a long time play with Peyton Manning he's scared can't say it you know what ESPN's these shows do they're playing seven on seven they're playing non-contact sports discussion where nobody has the balls to disagree with market spears or any of these guys that play the race card and because they don't want to be called races and they know it's going to be an unfair discussion and so market spears and dominate Foxworth RG3 can do all this low racial talk because they know there's going to be no resistance they're playing seven on seven it's not real tackle football their cowards they're scared I get it JB I'm gonna and I hear you talking about the terrible quarterbacks that you've criticized you can go check my resume I criticized Joe Montana when Joe Montana was good I used to argue John Elway and still believe John Elway was a better quarterback than Joe Montana and that you could take John Elway and put him in any era of football and he's going to excel including the one we have today and so if if Joe Montana can be criticized and no one accused me of being racist if and I there are people that criticize John Elway there are people oh he didn't win without Terrell Davis you know Terrell Davis carried him he couldn't win to the end of his career you could criticize John Elway without being accused of being racist RG3 ends this discussion and no one says a word everybody yeah just cosigns this oh if he can place the way he does the next three weeks he's going to be the greatest of all time when I heard this I wanted to pass out and say this man ain't gotta he ain't gotta win a super bowl and he's gonna be the greatest of all time we don't even have to add that stipulate we got time Brady sitting here with seven super bowls and all RG3's gotta do is keep being a beast in the regular season are you kidding me look I stopped watching the ESPN last week when Dominique Foxworth said Tom Brady's overrated so when I heard him say that out of his mouth I recorded it and I'm like dude I'm done listening to this crap let me let me tell you something Doug Clutie horrible in the NFL all he did was run around Steve Young horrible in the NFL all he did was run around and tell they stopped and became pocket passers Steve Young lost playoff games and could not get passed to Cowboys until he became a pocket passer he won a super bowl throwing five touchdowns not running five touchdowns throwing five touchdowns from the pocket to John Taylor Jerry Rice and that Roger Craig or whoever the back was he won a super bowl when he became a passer Randall Cunningham had his best year when he became a passer so did Dante call pepper so I don't want to hit a black and white thing one is a runner because he's athletic one is a pocket guy because he's not athletic I've seen some freaks of nature at white boy quarterbacks Josh Allen's not a regular white boy either is Aaron Rodgers either is a lot of these dudes and we can go back and forth but the bottom line is when you throw the ball on time from the pocket you stay healthy you earn the bag that these owners want to pay you because they know you're going to stay upright and you're going to be at practice every day and you're going to be healthy and our investment is how it gets a return other than we're hoping our investment gets a return by every single time you run you should see some of these GM's that I know buddies of mine they're like this in the press box every time Josh Allen runs a football because they know it's could that fast from ending and you don't think Lamar Jackson's GM's and Aussie Newsom and everybody else is involved they're like oh suit man what is going to happen here are we paying this dude or not this is the thing Jason I want to separate the race thing from the real thing we love in today's society we want to to nurture we've gotten rid of masculinity right we want to get rid of all the alpha males in America anyway so we want to we want to nurture everybody we're so soft we want to say Lamar Jackson is hugging babies he's a great human he does everything you know he gives back he donates I get that I love that about him that doesn't mean you're the greatest quarterback that doesn't mean you earn my business results and there has to be a separation of reality and likeness we can like a lot of people that doesn't mean that they're earning us results and that is where we have become in society we want to like everything and retweet everything compared to understanding the truth and the truth hurts these people but I guarantee you to shed it'll set you guys free man if you just trust me on this I haven't missed and that I haven't missed on a quarterback I'm just telling you and I haven't missed one let's continue this conversation with RG3 in the next seven to eight weeks when it gets closer to playoff time and I love all all your fans and critics you know Jason hey I love our haters they're our biggest fans and having said that you know I love some of the comments because they say they you know they come at me with all these things and I just laugh I'm like man please show me your resume so I can continue the conversation because I know you're serving donuts in the drive-through at McDonald's and I know you know more than me but having said that you know we never understand what it takes to win this to win this thing unless you've been there done it you know the mean of times and all these other worlds but that hates me and you know we go back and forth on Twitter I think they blocked me by now her and Sarah Spain unbelievable really you're gonna tell the Raiders who to draft and what quarterback to take like when the hell did you take a three-step drop in the NFL I'm curious and I'm not against women I love women and I'm all and then I'm the farthest thing from being sexist but really you're gonna sit there and critique us on how and why and what a quarterback should do at the highest level it blows my mind and people really defend it like they really think she knows what she's talking about it's probably one of the worst takes ever to listening to her speak about quarterbacks and I'm just like wow listen I agree with you there with kind and Spain or whatever but I get what they're doing and I get why they're doing it what I don't understand are these men there was five guys sitting on that Mike Greenberg Jeff Saturday Dan Rosiano RG3 and Marcus Spears five alleged men sitting in there having a conversation and it was an emasculated conversation because they won't even deal with the real issues no one isn't sustainable it's like they're boxers that I'm the toughest guy in the neighborhood but every time I box I want to wear a headgear to protect myself I don't really want to get down like Mike Tyson and these other people and really step in the ring and so let me put this headgear on and I'm gonna play the race card and make sure no one can hit me back because if you do I'm gonna call you racist or if you do I'm gonna call you a sellout it's they don't want to have the real discussion they want to play seven on seven non contact flag football and they want to put on headgear when it gets into the boxing ring they're afraid of having a real authentic manly conversation and they this is what has happened JB we've taken the conversation from the barbershop to the beauty shop all of these dudes are sitting around getting their hair braided and hair colored sitting at the beauty shop gossiping like women all this emotional conversation instead of talking about the real facts they're not man enough for a real conversation that's why they played a race card I gotta say I've heard I got a little bug in my I got some good friends at work at that network and hopefully Dan Olafs is gonna join me on my show this week but I got a couple good friends there and I'm sure you do and it's not everybody but let me tell you something who is missing from that five men panel that you saw there did you notice anyone missing have you noticed there's one person on that channel that actually speaks the truth and they have started to separate themselves from that man and he's not on a lot of these shows that he used to be on Bart Scott actually tells those cats the real and the wrong and they don't like it at all and you can tell and I would not be shocked if you don't see Bart Scott anymore because Bart Scott actually tells them contrary to belief the real way it is and I've reached out to Bart and he's actually a fan and I'm like dude he's the one that they don't like to hear from he calls out RG3 on the set he calls out these cats and I love it and that is the best cat the best take on ESPN in my opinions Bart Scott and I have I've recently noticed he's not on the panel no more he's not there no more and I'm wondering like why is that and uh it's funny man I really wouldn't want to I want to watch that and maybe it's something for the future for you to look at but I really want to see where Bart Scott ends up because I haven't seen him and I haven't seen any takes recently and why wouldn't he be on that panel right there if if you're talking about having some real brothers on that panel why isn't Bart Scott on that panel the strongest voice in the room on that channel very very interesting and I I don't know I'm just I'm just throwing that out there in the wind all right Davey I gotta go appreciate you Dr. Adeab as always I'm gonna bring these ladies out here gonna feminize the conversation but trust me these ladies are fearless get your fearless army swag it's shop ladies media.com flash mirrorless she making Michelle Jill Savage Lauren Chan in studio Eric's after years of battling big tech we're no longer willing to play their game and watch them stifle our reach cutting us off from you it's time to make a big change go to the blaze.com for some exciting updates and join the fight against big tech censorship. All right welcome back I don't know what to call this I'm thinking about calling a girls tripping the other view perhaps but you know to call it the other view I would have to remove myself from the segment but anyway I like it and I keep getting great feedback every time I bring the ladies on to the show people like it they think it's a great change of pace they certainly think the show looks a lot better and so anyway Shamika Michelle Lauren Chan Jill Savage here in studio with me Shamika joining us from North Carolina I want to play this clip that I found interesting and want you all's opinion on it let's play the clip this is a black woman out are hosting some kind of little dinner deal video deal where she thinks she's making some great point about how bad racism is let's play the clip and then we'll discuss. Let me ask you a question how many of you would trade places with a black person in this society raise your hand. I don't know the answer to that. Well it's yes or no how many of you would do it? I know I would. I mean I I I did it is very dark. No I'm not talking about this. I was going to ask you that but I was going to have children so I spent many years thinking of myself of having very dark skinned children. Question is how many of you would be willing to trade places in this society with a black person? I think I would. Absolutely. Okay I'm not saying there's not racism absolutely not it's just saying I don't see it. Yeah but you know how racist this country is. Yes to the degree that you do. Oh no you will never know. You know in this country we created the criminalization of black people and when your skin is seen as a weapon you're never unarmed and that's why black boys and men and women are dying in the street with their hands up. The level of stupidity and again I watched this a day or two ago and now rewatching again reignites how irritated I am with this the level of stupidity, dishonesty. I find it to be a very unfair question but to end it on the note of black men or dying in the streets with their hands up that's a joke and it makes me and I'll start with Shamika and then I'm gonna bring you guys into it. It makes me think how disconnected this woman is from the black community because being connected having grown up in the living in an area right now that there's my zip code 34 or 36% black. This woman's completely disconnected from black people she thinks that that's what's going on. That black men are just out in the streets with their hands up getting slaughtered by the police. Shamika that last point just took me over the edge. First let me say Jason if white women want to be beat over the head with white guilt I'll do it for three low payments of 1999. They don't have to pay a lot I'll do it for them and yes this whole with their hands up it's funny that black women don't want to be black men cheerleaders until it actually suits their agenda. Nobody is standing up for black men on a daily basis when it comes to them actually having a mind of their own choosing for themselves you know standing up for their kids. We beat black men down every day until it comes to old racism. They have their hands up. There's not really any case where we've seen where a black man has died with his hands actually up. They proven that to be false a long time ago so for her to run with this it's just lies and it bothers me that she even implies that if they don't want to be black then that's racist. It makes me wonder if then you know that also implies that black people would want to be white because I wouldn't want to be white. I wouldn't just sign up to be a white woman. Now I might would sign up to switch with a wealthy person but that would be switching with the woman of any color. It would not matter. You know I would care what color she was if she was wealthy. I wish that that was the thing I wish she had said how many of you all would switch places with Oprah Winfrey and see how many hands went up. No absolutely. Could I be Beyonce? I would sign up for that if I could just like magically sound my fingers and be Beyonce. I would absolutely but I think what she's trying to get at is that white women are so privileged and they know that black people are so underprivileged and so they wouldn't want to give up there but it's just a very strange I mean should they want to be black wouldn't that be more racist as well because that's a Rachel Bull's all situation. I'm not even sure what she's looking for. I love that Shemika is out there. If anybody's gonna be making money off of this I want everybody to go give Shemika some of the money. Let's go ahead and start some of those classes up. Get her some extra money in her pocket but it is it's something that you look at and Shemika made the point. Would they want to switch? Would she want to switch places with me or other white women and it's really only viewed as a one-way street at this dinner party. It's only would these white women be willing to switch over and become black and you know I used to be a sports reporter and I will tell you that one year I definitely I was on the top broadcast and I did I was working 13 football games a year and I got six one year because I wasn't black so it does work both ways they literally told me this too by the way it's not like I'm just saying this not diverse it's not I was a female in the space but I wasn't diverse. You need to come out as a new gender. Yeah if if only I had identified as a male that year maybe I still would have been on the top crew who knows but you know it goes to show that we want to view racism as a one-way street and it's not right or wrong. I'm happy with who I am and the life that I have and why can't that be enough for people? Yeah the the question and the way they presented and we're just getting a clip I'm sure there's a full show maybe one of the white women did ask the woman hey do you want to be white because that's the initial question that came to my mind. I was like this black woman wants to be white she thinks there's some great advantage to being white and and I just reject that because I don't want to be white I really don't. Now just like Shamika said are there was there a time when some people's wealth made me say I'd like to be that person but but again that really doesn't have a color at this point because yeah what I'd like to be Tom Cruise or Denzel Washington have their money and have their adulation maybe there was a time that that was true but but this whole thing just bothers me because I can proudly and defiantly say no I don't want to be white but if y'all say no I don't want to be black y'all run the risk of being called racist and and there's nothing wrong and I'm not even do you consider yourself white? I consider myself both I'm half Chinese so it's you know I would say yes I'm white I would say yes I'm Chinese so yeah and so I just don't understand why y'all have to be on the defensive I'll be about being possessive and proud of who you are and and it's some style it's a bad thing that you don't want to be black and and and I'll say this and I'll get in trouble and Shamika I'll throw this back in your lap there are the biggest limitation to being black right now are the expectations that are attached that the culture attaches to being black I have to love all the hip-hop music I have to vote Democratic I have to throw out my religious beliefs and support the pro-abortion movement and the Democratic Party because I'm black or this society cast me as an outsider and outside the norm and a bad person and it's like everybody else every other ethnic group all the way down to the Latino brown people have the freedom to think whatever they want have the free they can like whatever kind of music if Lauren Chin likes rock and roll and doesn't like R&B no one cares but if you're black and like rock and roll and don't like R&B or you a seller there are limitations on being black that the culture places are you that met you know I would like to free myself of that burden definitely and I think also a limitation is the expectation that we're less than when you look at how they're changing the rules in schools and getting rid of this test or that test or getting rid of certain programs because they feel like there aren't enough black people in the honors program it's almost as if black is equated with being unsuccessful and that bothers me a lot because I feel like black people can do whatever they put their minds to it has nothing to do with color so yes there's also this expectation in the culture to accept whatever but there's this expectation to fail and when you stand up and say hey I'm not a failure my skin color has nothing to do with whether I succeed or fail you're ridiculed for that I can remember wearing the cowboy hat on one of the shows when I was in Tennessee and somebody was like oh that cowboy hat that's just ridiculous you're going too far to fit in and I'm thinking I have I've had that cowboy hat for years long before I was on fearless long before I was in any type of politics like I hold on to stuff for a very long time but I like that look I feel like I can go with any type of look I can be in the White House and be dressed appropriately I can hang on the block and be dressed appropriately I can go into a country bar and be dressed appropriately I have a different variety of things that I like from the way I dress to the music that I like to listen to to the people that I hang around and I shouldn't have that limitation put on me simply because I'm black like you said we don't do that to any other group of people we don't tell white people they have to choose when it comes to political affiliation you have to be Republican because you're white but we do that to blacks if you're not a Democrat then you're automatically seen as some type of sellout if I don't want to listen to rap music every single day then I'm a sellout I was just looking at something Melissa Etherich put out yesterday because I love come to my window that was one of my favorite songs and it's like am I not supposed to like Melissa Etherich because I'm black that's just silly to me and so you're absolutely right Jason and it has to change and we don't do it to anybody else. Moving here to Nashville particularly as a as it relates to music has really changed my perspective and thoughts on music I grew up as a kid it was R&B and then when I got older and rap came along it was R&B and hip-hop and that's all I knew and and I can remember it was just maybe five years ago that I ever listened to a Led Zeppelin song just five five years ago and the people that work with me on speak for yourself they got tired of me talking about Led Zeppelin when I discovered it because I was like I didn't even know this existed I didn't know these dudes are this talented because there's just and I was I was late to the Adele deal I started telling people about Adele and it's like man she been out for ten years but but moving here has given me an appreciation for country music that I never thought I would have but it's all odd because every other group could like whatever kind of music they liked no one would bat an eyebrow no one would think anything and and you know I basically moved away from rap music because I just find it too profane too disgusting to say tannic that you know I've just I've lost my taste for it still like R&B but it's not the R&B that I grew up with much of R&B is now very profane and and I just I don't want to hear that in music and I don't want to think about love and that kind of hyper sexualized profane way they don't make the great R&B music like the Aussie brothers their Commodore's their earth went and that I grew up on so my music taste is changing and and it's like I hear the lyrics of country music and and like yeah that's that's kind of how I want to think about love and and so Tamika let me ask you this before I put Lauren and Jill on the spot do you and this is just from watching that clip and the way the women responded I I thought I heard fear saw fear and those women were again if I had been sitting there I would have been like this is stupid you're stupid you want to be white you know I I ain't apologizing for being white just like you ain't going apologize for being black it made me think these white women and white women in general they're afraid of black women they're afraid of the racial politics do you think white women are afraid of black women yes and that's just the short answer yes I see it all the time even when some sometimes when they talk to me they start singing like you can just tell the ones that are afraid and that don't want to offend you and think you may be sensitive they start talking to you like this how are you today oh really and I'm thinking why are you singing to me I don't need a lullaby go ahead and spit out what you have to say so yes I absolutely think that there are a lot of white women who are afraid of being offensive for no reason and so they tiptoe and walk on eggshells because that's kind of where we are in society now Jill Lauren are you afraid of black women no but I think that a majority of the white women are and I think that you watch that clip and they are definitely afraid because nobody answers her question the first time that she asks it who's who wants to trade places with me and everybody's just sitting there in silence going oh how do I answer this without offending her do I say that I want to be her do I say I want to be myself I don't know and I look at you know the politicians whenever they go into a predominantly black neighborhood and and trying you know get those votes Hillary Clinton was out there going oh I have hot sauce in my purse no you don't her voice changes it slows down just like Shamiko is saying and she's like oh yeah I I know what you all go through no you don't Hillary Clinton and that's fine nobody expects you to know what it is but you know overall people change their appearance or what they're trying to say how they say it so I think all of that just kind of leads into them being too afraid I think majority of white women like you're always saying are definitely afraid and I think the reason why that is is because women as a whole are way more likely to buy into any type of woke politics whatever it is and I feel like anytime we talk about race there there are these activists who are trying to tell all white women especially college white women middle-aged progressive white wine moms that yes everything you do is a microaggression you have to feel bad about your race and all of that messaging by the time they actually meet a black person you know out in the city somewhere they come across one I feel like a lot of white men are like how do I how do I respond I don't I don't even know and it's like your person their person just talk to them like you would anyone else but we we are so obsessed with race now and trying to right historical wrongs that you may or may not have any knowledge of but you have to know that you you as a whole as a white people you did something bad that it's just it's really warped a lot of people's minds or we don't even know how to interact with each other anymore which is really sad but sometimes hilarious like in that clip it's it's we've just gone to a very sad place where and and again I'm very transparent on the show I sit here and talk about you know I have a fear of women in general in the workplace part of that fear is driven by me because I know how flawed I am and how stupid I used to be and know that I'm capable being that stupid again and the wrong things can fall out of my mouth and I don't know if I'm gonna give you a real-life example that I had no intention of of of doing but I'm just this is just me being completely transparent this is funny this involves you Lauren me Lauren and her husband went to dinner Friday yes Friday and do you know I went home that night I was like oh my god I wonder if that was offensive do you know what I was what I'm thinking about no yeah I told Lauren and her husband that oh Lauren makes love to the camera she's terrific and I went home I was like oh my god what if that was offensive what if that was taken the wrong way what if someone thought I was Bob and so that's just and you can multiply that and again Lauren is someone that you know I can buy her approach on social media my interaction with her I was able to go now they get it it's nothing but the way that black women portray themselves over social media the way I've seen them engage in the workplace virtually anything that comes out of your mouth it's like the right you have the right to remain silent because anything can and will be used against you in a court of law I've experienced that and it makes me just want to shut up say less and and I'm saying if if I'm thinking this way and I've grown up and been around black people my whole life my family friends the whole nine yards if I'm sitting there with that kind of paranoia I could only imagine what kind of mental gymnastics goes on in the average white person's mind in dealing with a black or white person a black man or woman in the in this current situation dynamics we've set up I would be scared to death you just never know who has the thinnest skin or is looking for I'm gonna give you I'm gonna give you all one more example and this doesn't involve me but just something I've seen in the workplace and this happened years and years ago when I was in Kansas City black sports reporter uh goes on a road trip with a white sports reporter their co-workers at the Kansas City Star they're going to the same sporting event they drive down together on the drive down they listen to rap music that uses the n-word and when they get back I think maybe both of them were singing the songs as it goes but when they get back the black guy tells management that you know we listen to this rap music on the way down and he sung the songs I'm not exaggerating they fired this white dude they flagged this white dude thought he was on a friendly road trip with a black guy they're both listening rap music they like get back they fired the white dude and the i couldn't the reason I know this because the situation was eventually brought to me and asked for my guidance or whatever and I had it I was like because what ended up happening is the black dude ended up his career went in the tank after that they fired the white guy and then I had to explain to the black dude I was like yeah they fired him but trust me your next on the chopping block because you put them in a spot where they had to get rid of somebody that they didn't want to get rid of they felt you were unfair and now you're getting run out and but anyway I just say this we've created a very very complicated racial dynamic in the workplace and just in society where people can engage honestly and authentically people particularly Christians are afraid of each other of you know I could just go on and on and on I've seen particularly living down here in the south people use the word boy all the time and they use it for everybody and and you got a yeah you live in North Carolina uh uh samika in the south people use the word boy and and and they'll use it towards a white person and then they'll sit there and think well I ain't gonna treat a black person no difference I'm gonna use the word boy and then you're you're supposed to be you're supposed to have all this extra knowledge of oh I'm dealing with a black person and here's this whole long list of words that I can't use here's this food that I better not mention here's tv shows anything that I can't mention because it might be construed a certain way it's just a sad place for living in shimika I'm ramma give me a final thought and then we're gonna come back and talk about the movie don't worry darling yeah no I agree with you Jason and especially living in the south it's just different you know I don't get offended when people call me girl especially at my age I would love to be seen as a girl so I think that people just have to relax a little bit I understand that society has changed and it's not easy but I love hanging around people of any color where I can just be relaxed and I can make jokes that may be as they call off color or whatever that may come across offensive I remember hanging with my friend who is white and we were out one night and she was she saw a dog and she got down on the ground with the dog and she start hugging all on the dog and just letting the dog lick her in her face and then she stood up and was like okay we need to take our picture together and I said oh you're not touching me after getting all on that dog black people will do that and we both laugh because you know it was just this difference that she had never heard of I'm like well we'll do that with dogs so I just like being around people who are relaxed and not afraid and this white woman is not afraid of me because we can really just celebrate our differences like I put my butter in the refrigerator she leaves hers on the counter that's that's so funny you just made me think of another story and I don't even know if I should tell this when I may tell it off the air but who that whole dog thing though are you all dog people you like dogs that is one of the parts of my white heritage that I do embrace I consider myself a dog mom yeah I like dog yeah so I'm yeah any I'm not gonna do it I'm not gonna do it we're gonna talk about the movie don't worry darling welcome back some more girl trippin tiffany odom has joined us she's joined uh morn chin Jill Savage and Shamika Michelle we all went to the movies either last week or this week to go see the new movie uh don't worry darling uh I think it's a movie where Olivia wild directs and she also plays a role in the movie uh Harry Styles is in the movie there's been a lot of gossip about this movie and what went on on set off camera all that kind of stuff but the movie is actually about a group of women that are trapped in a virtual reality 1950s traditional housewife role while their men go off to some mysterious job there's some kind of twist at the look I watched the movie it's very confusing they they give you this twist at the end that tries to explain all of your confusion let me just narrow it down to you narrow it down for you it's it's a movie the stepper wives made differently that's basically been updated to 2022 that basically says man women got a raw deal these men have trapped y'all in these traditional roles and and you know have limited your freedom got you knocked up with kids cooking dinner and and having sex with them when they come home from work this is horrible and that's the point of the movie it's almost a redo of every movie that comes out that you know women are getting a raw deal and men have built a satanic evil world that exploits them uh we'll start here with the ladies and shameka because you're on skype we'll let you start first loved it liked it or hated it Jason I liked it and I think I liked it because I watch the movie and I just couldn't get out that slogan from Weight Watchers this is living the woman woke up every day and made breakfast which seemed like the same breakfast every morning two eggs bacon toast buttered and couldn't have then she would see her husband off to work and she would clean the house make sure it was spotless and then she was all to enjoy life with her friends whether it was shopping or sitting by the pool either way it included cocktails then she would come home make him a nice dinner but when he got home she was the meal I was thinking sign me up sign my name on the road this just seemed like the perfect life to me so I really enjoy watching it so yes like for me I may be teetering on a love Tiffany loved it liked it or hated it I liked it I'm somewhere in between though I'd still want my freedom a little bit it seemed a little robotic the women having to do the same thing every day oh you mean like me coming in doing this show every day yeah but at least you switch it up theirs weren't wasn't switched up it was very robotic like stepford wives I mean right when I watched it I I immediately thought of that movie so my alarm goes off every morning at 5 30 a.m. it makes a different noise every day but the part I did love was the great gatsby style parties and the glamour and the cocktails I could sign up for that for sure loved it liked it or hated it I'm between lighted and hated it because I actually I think like most women watching it I love the aesthetics if you guys see me with the different haircut it's because I was inspired by that movie just like oh the 1950s bangs it kind of like that and I just like seeing all the fashion it seemed like a pretty sweet life like huh this is idyllic I didn't like the actual plot though it was confusing it didn't make sense and the movie is trying to send you this message that you know 1950s oppressive women like that's just it was a terrible life it didn't really seem terrible and what's kind of ironic is that the men are made out to be the bad guys in this film they're kidnapping women holding them against these against their will and these traditional roles the men throughout the movie are all very doting upon their wives like there's not even any sexist remarks or comments really made of like oh you should lose some weight or like oh like don't worry this is men's work no one makes any sexist comments so really the message of the movie is that traditional roles in and of themselves are sexist and it's like if that sexism signed me up that's it seems relaxing gray I'm very confused as to how this is supposed to be a negative portrayal of the 1950s I am also with where Lauren is somewhere between light it and hated it and hated it because of the plot inconsistencies because there were holes that they needed to fill throughout but the traditional general signed me up guys like this is this is where I don't really agree with what they're trying to say of oh this is so bad but shameka let's go have some cocktails right like let's sit by the pool we can go shopping and put it on credit where they don't have to pay in the movie and the men are taking care of their women that's not a bad thing ladies we don't need to have it all and go out and and do everything but I really enjoyed the way that that you know that life seems idyllic in a certain sense but the plot inconsistencies overall I would have liked a smoother movie if I could have that very confusing movie for me do you think you would have got bored with that life though doing something every day over and over the same repetition yeah but again this the whole part of us is they didn't know that they didn't they didn't they didn't they didn't make this choice themselves they didn't know that part well I guess the thing it's like Jason was saying like yeah they're doing sort of the same thing every day in that you know you've you've got to cook clean your class whatever but our work is somewhat the same every day right a lot of people even if they have the freedom to work they're going to the same cubicle every day so there's you know obviously people want freedom like that that's good and stuff but I don't think innately the life of a 1950s woman is any more repetitive than a life of the average worker today especially it's like in the the kids in the movie spoiler are not real but especially if you add kids into the mix there's there's gonna be a lot less repetition because of that enough itself listen I only clean my house you know once a month my late is there today doing some real cleaning but in terms of you know some of this is fictionalized you don't have to clean your house every day maybe you got to make your bed every day but but that's about it that the the not this whole notion that oh my god look at all the happiness we've been denying women you guys now get to go to work and be a slave for some company I want to play this tiktok video of someone that I thought wasn't even really directed at this movie but it kind of makes the overall point that I think many of us feel is like and and I'll mention a watch and post story after we watch this video but let's let's watch the video first welcome to 2022 where you can do anything a man can do I'm so excited to finally be here you are going to love it feminism has done so much for women do tell no more aprons first of all oh do we finally have a butler to cook for us oh gosh no you'll just eat pre-made greasy crap out of a bag on your way to and from work suppose that sounds convenient so I get to work outside the home totally you get to sit in a cubicle all day while you stare at a computer screen chugging coffee so liberating right I suppose I don't work all day well we finally have a rosy the robot made no you'll still have to do all the cleaning don't you weekends are for cleaning and laundry oh and errands and yard wait so I have to work full time plus still manage my home full time I mean you want to have it all right okay but what about my husband is he amazing but no you're not married you live alone with your cap what you do date though a lot you can just have sex with whoever whatever you want that sounds kind of gross actually just pick them off of this app what about pregnancy oh there's this magic pill you take totally wrecks your hormones but keeps you from getting pregnant so you can you know knock some boots the pill is magic well it's mostly effective but don't worry it's by chance you do get pregnant you can totally just kill the baby by having an abortion why would I do that so you can get back to work duh someone has to fill that cubicle space okay am I at least happy uh I mean yeah as long as you don't skip your antidepressant pill another magic pill gotta cope somehow I think I'll just stay here get to have purple hair I love that video that is amazing the the Washington Post they have a very good pop culture critic movie reviewer Elise Alyssa Rosenberg I think is her name I've followed her work for years she wrote a very good review the question that was too wild for don't worry darling to ask so I pulled a paragraph now more than ever it would have been exciting to see a director with wilds bonaf- bonafide posed the provocative question that don't worry darling hints at but can't quite confront what should feminism do about women who wonder if liberation is a bad bargain and that's what that video is hinting at it's like we make liberation out to be this awesome great thing I get to do everything men can do I get to have and I don't even think it's a good thing that men are permiss us sexually again that's like a new revelation for me in the last three to four years I'm not gonna pretend like I was always thought this way but I matured and gotten smarter and figured it out and now we've sold this myth to women that happiness comes through you know 100 200 300 sexual partners that's what will really make you happy and it's a joke that it it doesn't make you happy it actually points to your insecurities and lack of discipline and stupidity more than anything but anyway to make I want to start with you is liberation perhaps a bad bargain for women I definitely think it is I think that women no longer value what they brought to the table as wives and mothers and I think that we can see it in society how that's missing with everyone wanting to be the boss bitch or be in the boardroom or being charged there's no one really left to rear the kids and be present when they get home and help them with homework and make sure they interact with the children it's like now they're being raised by TV and social media so I definitely think it's a bad bargain to just want to be out here and be the man who wants to do that that was one of the things that I didn't like about the movie or that I kind of noticed the propaganda it was like it's if it was saying women would have these great lives you know working 30 hours a week if a man didn't interfere or it was saying that a man needed the patriarchy or maybe misogyny so that he could feel important or successful and then I think it also painted traditional families including gender roles as being oppressive force not real so those were the things that I kind of took away from the movie that I thought okay this is propaganda but I definitely love that video that we just watched and my middle daughter came away from the movie saying this makes me want to be a housewife more than ever because she just kept saying why can't she just mind her business why does she have to go out and see what's going on I'm thinking yes just live the life Tiffany I want to turn to you just because you've admitted on this show or acknowledged on this show you were always kind of a jock and maybe didn't see yourself in traditional roles liberation this whole women's movement feminism good or bad bargain for women um I mean I'm not for the whole you know women in power thing I think that women I'm with Shamika on a lot of that with the children at home these days they just give them tablets to babysit them and no one's teaching them homework no one's at home with them but it's really hard I work two jobs so it's super hard there I have no other income no you know not a man in my life to like help support me so I do it all on my own so it's very hard trying to live the role sometimes of the head of the house but I still like you know being able to have my freedom and be a woman and make those choices so I'm literally middle of the road with all of this well I think it's hard because you know as women yeah obviously you want choices but I feel like the feminist movement is they're kind of like uh like a five-year-old toddler you know the parents says you got to go to bed now and the toddler doesn't want that they want to be able to do whatever they want but what the toddler ultimately doesn't understand is that it's in their best interest until go go to bed and even if given the choice they may likely just end up wanting to go to bed anyway because they themselves are tired and I feel like for a lot of women it's like okay we've we've become liberated we have the freedom to do whatever we want but does that mean we even want to make a different choice and we've been making historically and Jordan Peterson talks a lot about this in like these Nordic countries Scandinavian very progressive where they have a lot of social equality right there's no gender barriers or whatever uh people actually tend to gravitate more toward traditional roles right uh the disparities we see in different jobs and industries it's actually higher in those countries when people are allowed to make their own choices so I mean I don't think it's like a question of either or just because a housewife is a housewife doesn't mean she's less liberated she's just choosing to embrace that part of life uh which is I mean it's some people might say it's still feminist if she's doing that of her own volition not because she's forced to I don't think there's anything wrong with that I feel like we've been told over and over again that liberation is here and it's going to make your life better and you believe it because you've been told it so many times but in that video that 90 second clip that we saw that's what I kept thinking of when I was watching the movie it's this it's the story that the movie is trying to tell of look at how much better you're going to have it but in reality right we're we're eating fast food we're cleaning our houses on a quick weekend and we're not spending quality time anymore in liberation has taken the quality out of life for a lot of people I feel like that is this a true genuine relationship a true bond that we have with people anymore or is everything just quick fast and onto the next that's what it feels like at least in this society but we're told we're supposed to really enjoy it so we go around saying that we really enjoy it one of the things I've said to men and women over the last few years the biggest myth and the thing that's driving this country off the rails is the belief that you can have it all you cannot have it all you just can't and wise people figure that out and figure out what makes sense for them but we've all been sold this myth that oh my god you can have it all you can have a summer home here you can have three cars here you can have kids that'll be this and that and the more you try to get and try to have it all you start short-changing everything and that's why kids are unhappy are that's why I think our kids young people don't have respect for authority or adults anymore is because they've watched the their parents try to have it all and we're not giving enough to our families and that's what's you know I look at all of this messaging and movies it's all just anti-family and it drives me crazy and I look at our someone at the moment I may have seen it on your page I know I certainly tweeted out there was a video live the TikTok put it out of this Wawa store I think getting ransacked there and and it was just crazy and and all I just thought I was like this is a repercussion of no families if if you know and because there was a bunch of black kids not to racialize it but you know it was like 75% of our kids are growing up in single-parent homes this is going to be the end result and and so this whole myth that oh yeah a single parent and a government check are just as good as mom and dad really commit it's not and and there are married couples that may as well be single as it relates to their approach to their kids and the home life or whatever and we're not producing properly functioning young people and there's no wonder why they're sitting in schools wondering well what gender am I and what because the parents should be defining life and everything for them we've turned it over to the government and the educational system and so I just the whole myth of having it all is destroying us any anybody else can chime in and then we'll you know family dinners back in the day were important when you sat down we all had to sit down together finish our plate I had to have a glass of milk with every you know every dinner for gonna have another drink just being sitting down as a family I think that's very very important in a young child's life that's one big memory I have it was very structured we had to have dinner together but I think everyone's too busy and people don't have dinner together anymore yeah and that's actually I mean even we were all just saying how amazing it is that in this movie this fake world they all have these dinner parties and everything that actually sounds that's one of the good things about this movie it's like okay you know they're setting time aside to socialize with each other it's not really kids in the movie very much but that's one of the things that yeah it was also appealing about the movie it's like wow look how much time they have socializing that's it that seemed foreign to me it's like you brought up there's no kids thing I wonder if that's intentional a bit on because this whole left is anti-kids and I wonder if that was also part of the fan and look how much better well that's actually in the movie remember uh Jack brings up the issue like why don't we have a baby and she's like eh and in uh in the pool scene she's also talked with bunny she says we don't we don't need kids we're just happy with each other so our our little feminist character yeah she is anti-kid and you were talking about having it all well you already mentioned Oprah she was one of the famous people who would talk to housewives every day about you can have it all but she would always say you can't have it all at once and even Oprah herself never had children so the thought of one of one of them right the thought though of one of the most heavy med stedman I can say that successful quote unquote successful women in america doesn't have children doesn't have it all but in anybody's notion if you say oh Oprah she has it all everybody go of course Oprah has it all look at her look at her life but does she really does she does yeah yeah right and I like Oprah so I need to be careful go ahead Shamika yeah and people now are chasing materialism when I look at my grandmother she's still in the same home that her and my grandfather purchased together for their four children they had three bedrooms one bathroom and they were happy that was enough space they made it work and now that's not enough for people you live in a house now with one bathroom you almost act as if you're oppressed and this is just wrong and so now people are buying I gotta disagree with you there Shamika I gotta just if I live in a place with one bathroom that is oppressive yeah I live by myself I got three full bath for just you you can't go ahead I'm sorry yes I can you do use them all yeah but in comparison to you know me and my husband we did have a four-bedroom three and a half bath house but he worked like a dog to pay all of that because we of course wanted me home with the children and it's just like now everybody can't do that they can't have like you said have it all something is going to go lacking but we chase materialism so bad to keep up with the Joneses it's you know a lot of people feel like they have to have two people to just have the finer things in life because no one wants to sacrifice when I was at home I had to learn how to do my hair myself I wasn't just saying okay times are hard you got to send me to the salon every week and send me to get my nails and toes and I'm like you have to make sacrifices and sometimes that's what you do in order to be able to to actually be there for your children and nobody wants to make sacrifices anymore they just want a bunch of materialism and a bunch of things to look like they're living the life that they really aren't living. Thank you ladies awesome job as always made the show much better we'll end with tomorrow another lady and that means we'll see you tomorrow.
