So here's the podcast for today We talk about the electoral college Democrats immediately coming after it. They're pissed off They've lost two elections because of the popular they think we want the popular vote and we lost the electoral college Now they want to they've introduced legislation to get rid of the electoral college Kevin Hart may be back on as The Oscars host he got cleansed kind of yesterday by Ellen DeGeneres. He did which is which is amazing We have a lot of stuff on the border. We have Environmentalists as movie villains. This is a new trend going on in Hollywood bizarrely We'll give you some examples of that which are pretty cool as well. It's all in today's podcast You're listening to the best of the command that program Kevin Hart Had some tweets that haunted him from the past in fact these it was a long past two I think it was nine years ago. Were they nine or ten year old tweets? I Think they were around that area. Yeah, I think they were from 2009 to 2012 or something like that And he was scheduled to do the Oscars and then these these tweets homophobic tweets appeared and he'd already Apologized for them. He'd already explained them, but they resurfaced and there was a big deal about it. And so he stepped down as host of the Oscars well yesterday he showed up on Ellen and Ellen DeGeneres I think is is kind of washing him clean of his tweets And this is really smart to do because obviously she's she's homosexual. She's a lesbian and If you get the authority to really yeah pretty much like it seems like if you want to get an okay From someone that you're not a homophobe if you can get Ellen to say it you then you're clear That I feel like that is the position our society is it it's really smart like if Yeah, there's certain people. I mean Ellen is just such a high profile person And she seems well liked she's well like she seems rational. She can she's she doesn't seem like someone who? would Would just Give anyone an excuse right like she had if she would if she believed you and she gave you an excuse and said look I know you did this a while ago. You're saying it's wrong now. I believe you you should be reinstated or whatever That's your clearance process. I feel in the United States in 2018 Where we have like probably our next president is gonna be Kanye West. Let's be honest about it. It's probably another it's another four years of Trump And then Kanye mm-hmm. So in a society like that. I mean Kanye might be running against Khloe Kardashian that might be the matchup So in that society I feel like Ellen is the authority That can come in and say look You are clean you are not you're a homophobe you are not She just the judge jury an executioner on this topic and if you can get a clearance from Ellen like you get a haul pass from From Ellen you will you're back in the game I'm on homophobic tweets I think this is that haul pass and here she is begging Kevin Hart to host the Oscars So I I called the Academy today because I really want you to host the Oscars I think that I was so excited when I heard that that they asked you I thought it was an amazing thing I knew how important it was and how it was a dream. So I called them I said Kevin's on I have no idea if he wants to come back and host But what are your thoughts and they were like? Oh my god. We want him to host We feel like that maybe we he misunderstood it was handled wrong or maybe we said the wrong thing But we want him to host what whatever we can do we would be thrilled and he should host I Hope he gets a salary double for it to man. I hope you know this is happening This is why they haven't selected another host. It's it's as you suspected and we're saying on my show earlier that They knew this was coming They knew this appearance was gonna happen on Ellen and so they've been holding out for this to happen and now he's been washed clean and He'll they'll invite him back and he'll Okay, reluctantly agree and when he does his open somewhere in there He will first make a couple of jokes about himself, right? And then he will have some heartfelt you know what is great gaze sort of monologue And maybe it'll even feature Ellen. Yeah, may Ellen might come out. Yeah, and then there will be some special award to represent gaze in entertainment and Right like this is what we get a singer who is who is a well-known gay person will come out and sing and dance or whatever They do and they will give hugs to Kevin Hart and tell him they understand And we will all need to accept it now then Kevin Hart will announce that he is in fact gay That's an Oscars to watch right there that I would watch that I would watch Kevin Respond or at least attempt to kind of respond to the Oscars offer which is amazing first of all before we play that Now we're at the point where the Oscars are asking him to host again, right like how did yeah one call for Ellen The day is goes from your fire to please let him host Crazy please come back sir, please. Mm-hmm. That's an that's a lot of power. That's a lot of power. He is here is Kevin Hart's response I think that you you have said a lot of amazing things you have put a lot of things on my mind and I know our relationship stands so leaving here I'm promising you I'm evaluating this conversation. This is a this is a conversation. I needed to have I'm glad that I had it here And I'm glad that it was as authentic and real as I could have hoped that it would be oh, it's real Oh, he's coming about me assess always coming back just just to sit in the space and and really think and you and I will talk before anything else Okay, okay He's hosting us, huh? He does it and he gets a raise. Yep. He's hosted the Oscars. That's amazing So a couple things here first of all Ellen is a comedian by you know She's a everyone thinks you know she's talk show host and she's been a talk show host for a million years But she or her training is in stand-up comedy. She just did I think it was a Netflix special She's trying to get back in that world and she's probably probably I don't know this for a fact but probably on the right side when it comes to The you know burning at the stake of comedians every time they make a joke people don't like she's probably on the right side of that Comedians even even liberal comedians who who will boycott you for if a conservative commentator says something They'll be on the front lines of the boycott, but when it comes to comedians They're they're very forgiving and so that's probably part of this here And I think I think that's she's probably on the right side of that genuinely Separately from the issues of you know gay issues and all that other stuff When it comes to a free speech issue, I'd be surprised if Ellen was on the wrong side of it Yeah, I would too so I would too I think that's part of it And I think it's interesting to watch this sort of happen because you it really we are in that in that world and which We have completely abandoned Free due process when it comes to things like this We don't even it's just an automatic outrage machine and we go after everybody all the time Mm-hmm and we've abandoned that due process for this due process, which is will Ellen say it's okay? Like if Ellen says it's okay, then that guy comes back and no one cares They he will not be a controversial figure and that just happened right and I don't think this He won't have any lingering side effects from this now. I think that's how clean she just washed him It's amazing. Yeah, it is and again the Oscars last year. We're dealing with Oscars. So white right remember that Right was so white so they brought in a black host Yep, then they fired him because he wasn't friendly enough to gaze these people are lost In their in their intersectionality. They don't know what to do They have absolutely no idea how to keep up with their constantly changing standards of what's okay to say and what's not okay to say Yeah, and it is or who's okay to host and who's not okay to host It is fun to watch it Well when liberals are eating their own it is fun. It is fun and and I think that's part of the problem here, but But this is pretty interesting because I think that was I think this was all sort of decided not on the show but pre the show before the show and this was part of the plan to get him on Ellen and I feel like I'm watching theater a little bit here. Yeah, right like oh, he's been fired Oh, wait a minute. What do we have to go? You go on Ellen and you get an okay from Ellen will bring you back and she goes on he gets and he doesn't accept it right away He's gonna make it right. I'm gonna think about it in my space for a while I'll tell you this if you get a if the Oscars announce a special like who wants to be a host special with like all the Reality TV trappings and I think they bring back Trump to host it and Trump gets the final approval to Kevin Hart That's the way this needs to end. Yes The best of the bread back program I think the closest thing you could come to right now is Louis C K and It's Lucy K is not a conservative, but he occasionally makes points that are friendly to conservatives, right? And when he does that He gets abandoned they didn't they they would have let him back into the world if he was mr. liberal Spokesperson, but he's come out and said you know some of the identity politics stuff is dumb And you know that thing that we've played before about abortion is absolutely amazing from him Yeah, and it's too conservative. I think for people's For the left. I mean they forces them into a tough spot. Yeah to admit a century. Yes. This is a baby or Yeah, it's a baby and it's killing babies Mm-hmm, and then he goes through that already teen. It's not really killing. Well, it's kind of yes It's completely killing babies Amazing it's an amazing thing to admit and I think I think it even says in there somewhere that he's pro choice If I remember correctly, I don't even think I don't I don't even think he's a pro life person He's just saying that if you want to be honest about it admit the fact that this is what you're doing and then justify it Yeah, we should play that yeah, yeah, here's Louie C K on abortion people hate abortion protesters. They're so shrill and awful They think babies are being murdered What are they supposed to be like? Yeah, that's not cool. I Don't want to be about it though. I Don't want to ruin their day as they murder several babies all the time. I Don't think it's killing a baby. I don't see I mean it's a it's a little bit. Oh, it's a little bit killing a baby It's a little bit It's a hundred percent killing a baby it is it's totally killing a whole baby But I think that women should be allowed to kill babies They should be allowed to kill babies Yeah, and they cheer yeah, and they cheer amazing And he mocks that we get to kill babies It's brilliant do some shots and kill some babies I killed like far babies last night is retarded I just think it has to be one of the other you don't like when people say abortion should be legal safe and rare Why rare if it should be legal if it should be legal it's it's it's If it should be rare, it's And see that's a hundred percent true it's a hundred percent true, and it's a way he just covered both sides really And did that brilliantly just but I don't know if the left considers that Brilliant it's a real loss losing him as an entertainer again if he did some even his explanation and the explanations and accusations against him in the Scandal we've gone over this before are not anywhere remotely close to stuff We're talking about with Harvey Weinstein He just seemed like he was a creepy guy at one point in his life that did things that were very creepy That were also consented to So, you know, I don't I don't know That whole situation if there's more to it, maybe there is I don't know but as it stands now It's a real loss I mean as far as his he's able to do that I mean this is a guy who was a liberal icon Yeah, oh, yeah, they loved this guy he was you know and he was able to do that I mean that that's the type of monologue that honestly can change opinions When you approach it like that you take someone who you heard talk rationally and interestingly on a million different topics And you break it down like that that is true You you basically have to say it's nothing. It's just removing some cells. It's removing some flesh You know, I was thinking of it. It's equivalent of plastic surgery, right? You're removing a you're maybe you're you're enhancing a breast You're lifting a nose. There's no conservative who opposes that you're removing fat cells right from your stomach liposuction same thing Exactly, and there's no conservative that opposes that right because it's not hurting another person. It's you doing something to yourself Mm-hmm if you it's the other life. That's what what is important and that's what he gets across there He does and he puts he really effective way and he does this all the time he puts you in a position where You have to sort of honestly question What you're doing he puts that so it's such a black and white and obvious truth That you know what you can do he's even saying you can take the position of You know, it's just it's just Cells or fat or poop as he kind of puts it you can say that but admit it admit that's what you're saying and also admit how ridiculous that is I mean the lines you have to go to to get to this position are They're impossible to navigate you can't you know gymnast is flexible enough to achieve it The problem here is what we do as a society is we say well It's uncomfortable don't talk about it and if we don't talk about it you never have to think about it and therefore you can just kind of say women's rights and move on with your day and It's not this is not about women's rights if it was about women's rights Then conservatives would be like you cannot have that liposuction You cannot remove that that that lump of cells from your you can't have breast augmentation you can't do that No, we would say that you know The government needs to crack down on women having liposuction. We don't do that because there's not another life involved You're not affecting someone else's rights You are affecting someone else's rights when they don't have the right for their heart to beat any longer That is a major issue and it's uncomfortable to talk about so people don't want to do it But then no one has that conversation no one's forced into admitting that decision I'm making the decision that yes It's okay to kill the baby because women's choice takes priority over it. That's a position you can take I don't know how it's consistent with the Constitution, but you can take it if you want at least make the argument logically You're listening to the best of the Glenn Beck program Like listening to this podcast if you're not a subscriber become one now on iTunes But while you're there do us a favor and rate the show Congress people have been sworn in now and Some of them have made quite a splash already. Mm-hmm. Of course, Alexandra Cosio Cortez has been making a splash for months now but there's another Congress person who Is willing to go out on a limb and do some things that haven't been done Maybe ever like called the president and emf her her name is Rashida Tlaeb and Here's here's what she had to say about President Trump People love you and you win and when your son looks at you and says mama look you won bullies don't win and I said baby they don't because we're gonna go in there win and teach the mother Great thing to say to your little young son, too. That's awesome Somehow is been overlooked in that like a yes She swore about the president, but she at least to her word swore to her kid Wow, that's a great thing to say to your ten-year-old son what an awesome mother you are that is wonderful That is a mommy of the year situation. Yeah, it's also highlights what the Democrats are facing like Like a Nancy Pelosi yet does she want Donald Trump impeached? Of course she does does she want him removed? Absolutely, but she is going to deal with the political realities of that and realize that if they do it for No reason like for example nothing comes out really in the Mueller report and they try to force an impeachment anyway It's gonna backfire on them. That's why she's slow playing it the first thing She said when when she was asked about this is well, we have to wait for that the Mueller report to come out We don't even we don't know even know what's in it yet now They're gonna say all if it's a big deal, but if if Nancy Pelosi is playing politics, which she will She will likely try to slow play this to Because that is a real what you just heard is a real passion in the party That is a lot. There's a lot of these new Congress people coming in who ran on I'm gonna go and peach the president There's a lot of Activists who really care about that going into this campaign whoever says it the most is gonna get the most points with these activists and these In these Democratic primary voters So a Nancy Pelosi's in the middle there trying to say look I think if we do this it's gonna be bad for us in the long term But I have to make it seem like we're very interested in doing it to make people like What's her name to shoot it to lose she did to leave feel like she's you know cared about and wanted They're gonna slow they're gonna slow play them like the Republican slow play us Yeah, right when they say to us. Oh, we really want that flat tax. I tell ya Oh, we want to lower those taxes. Oh the tax bill you propose is just lowering about like one point really I thought you were all excited about like a 10% flat tax what happened to that well, we are but we can't get that pass right now We're gonna get that right there. We're gonna get that right if you keep electing us. Oh my gosh It's gonna happen for sure and so they're doing this they're going through that same dance right now with their super left wing You know they have some voters real radicals in office right now, and she's one of them I mean can you imagine if if a Republican freshman Congressman had called Barack Obama an M F her they had a cow when Joe Wilson screamed you lie Oh, yeah, they went into a conipion fit over that that was the big that was the biggest story in America for how long Months, I mean they still talk about it from time time. It still comes up on CNN and they were saying you So what if you called Barack Obama a socialist which is a description of some of his policies which is a description of of some of the things that he believed in like wealth redistribution You were a racist if you called him a socialist, but they could call They can call Donald Trump an M F her and it's not a problem. Yeah, it's fine I wish you point out by the way and people cheer for Joe Wilson Because this does not get pointed out enough. Yes. He said you lie in the middle of an Obama speech Here's the CNN coverage of it at the time Joe Wilson shouted you lie after President Obama Denied the health care plan would cover illegal immigrants Here is I get I kid you not again the next election I you know the next president of Hillary Clinton versus Donald Trump on Hillary Clinton's website She has up in her platform 112 reasons Hillary Clinton should be our written next president number 70 Quote she believes we should let families buy into the affordable health care act care exchanges regardless of immigration status It went from a controversial thing to say he was lying about it to in the platform of the next candidate That's how fast that happened Joe Wilson was totally totally redeemed on that one Yeah, and I don't know that I've ever seen anyone other than us Give him credit for that. Oh, I haven't I've never seen that The other thing about Rashid Rashida to leave She's a Palestinian American who ran on a two-state solution for and continued foreign aid to Israel and Then as soon as she as soon as she won her primary She decided she's for a one-state solution and no aid to Israel Which is wait, so the one state is not Israel. No No So leave wait a minute. Yeah, you've got us Congress people advocating a one state solution. I Don't know how that works really And she's not getting any Feedback from that that I can that I can tell and you know She's from Michigan in an area where I'm sure people are fine with her stance on a one state solution But I don't know how that works in the US Congress I don't I don't know how that works with democratic leadership. I don't know how that works in the mainstream Democrat party Yeah, I mean it's true. I mean Ilana Omar who is one of the new Incoming Congress people this is her tweet from her from 2012 Israel has hypnotized the world may Allah awaken the people and help them see the evil doings of Israel My God, and she's now a congresswoman So that is Unbelievable what's happening in the Democrat Party. It's unbelievable, but What we're told all the time is that it's Republicans who are so extreme? It's Republicans who are completely out of the mainstream No, take a look at what what the Democrats are electing right now Take a look at some of these new people that are going to office. They're socialists. They're anti Israel zealots. They're They're completely out of the mainstream of the United States of America who what American? wants a one state solution a Palestine in the Middle East and the elimination of Israel I Don't know anybody And I'm sure they exist, but they're not in the mainstream. That's for sure and they're certainly they're certainly not getting elected outside of Michigan Yeah, I mean, this is the thing I think when when let's say Barack Obama's in power. There's something Even though I agree with Joe Wilson's point, right? There's something appealing to a conservative To say you shouldn't just yell something in a speech So people are like right even at the time you're like alright Well, I mean I agree with this point completely But that probably isn't the way to do it and so liberals make these points when Barack Obama's president and they say okay Look, you know That's decorum. We this is not the thing that you do and there's something that appeals to conservatives generally on that point We've talked about like the Jonathan height book of talking about how conservatives care about those types of things that care about traditions, right? But the left doesn't and so when when a Republican becomes president all those things go out the window and they act as if they Never made those arguments. I mean, you know, we have we have a congressperson Saying we're gonna impeach the M effort today. We have another one yesterday who made a three-minute speech about the equivalency between the president and Adolf Hitler Another Congress person, right? We these long-time Congress person too. They call them. I mean they call them liar all the time now look every politician is So far as I know But that was off limits with Barack Obama with Barack Obama and Barack Obama lied all the time in fact every day Even the left-wing organization PolitiFact gave him the lie of the year one year I mean, this is right who lied all the time and just was never called out on it It's so I don't you can't take their criticism seriously. You can only Try to hold your own foundations steady if you believe X Y or Z is wrong for one person you have to hold yourself to it because society in general is not going to make you do that anymore there's no longer a inertia of society no longer forces you to be consistent over things everyone just kind of you know forgives you You know the one example I keep going back to is how fast this changed I mean you could argue John Kerry lost the 2004 election Based on the fact that he said I said I did vote for it before I voted against it That wouldn't matter what I order now doesn't matter. Oh that doesn't matter at all Nobody cares if you do that you can say something today and change your position tomorrow tomorrow This will be elected doesn't you in fact you can you could say something right now? Mm-hmm, and then in 15 minutes say the complete opposite completely elected I mean you you said she ran on I don't I didn't follow her campaign But she ran on on funding to Israel and a two-state solution and day one and then switched it afterwards after the primary After the primary I mean that's amazing. It's amazing. It's amazing. Nobody cares No, and nobody cares and I you know you're gonna get all these you know I mean Akazio Cortez is a good example of the one getting all the attention I don't you know like there's some video out her of her dancing and like high school or something I was like a complete nothing nothing it's an absolute nothing Yeah, everybody has it dumb. I mean anyone who they're like oh congratulations New York Why because the representative danced when she was 20 years old at Boston University So what so what? But I did I didn't make a decision yesterday and then I do not make these decisions lightly Pat But I would encourage you to come along if you wish What you need to do is you go to your Twitter page and you click on settings, okay, right then you go to I think it's content preferences then you click on muted words and Then you type in the word Akazio and then it's asked you a time and you say forever and then you press enter And it improves your life quite a bit doesn't it does I've come to the point now like I I don't care about her She you know she's a socialist congresswoman So then it just you just don't see it on her I don't have to see every dumb dancing video that somebody releases or some stupid yeah her little She thinks she's clever tweet back at somebody. I just can't I can't I can't waste my time. There's no way me reading some Akazio Cortez tweet is a good use of my time I Will read her her new green jobs bill that we talked about yesterday the new new deal for the environment Which would cost us in excess of fifty trillion dollars by my by many estimates certainly over 30 I'll read that because it's a real thing But do I really need to hear her snarky comebacks of somebody or no or on the same same thing some dumb You know conservative site that thinks it's like the most exposing video of all time to see her dance on a roof for five seconds When she was 20 I can none of this makes any difference in my life at all. Yeah, and that's why I use the power of the mute I feel like I am you know, I'm the emperor. It's the power of the dark side I embrace the power of the dark side when I say this when one of these little trends starts coming out and starts annoying me muted And I don't hear any of the crap anymore about it That's the way you got to do it. It's a good solution. It is just get it out of your life. What is the point? You're listening to the best of the Glendec program An amazing thing happened at a game stop the other day where a customer came in and Clerk behind the desk Said something about hey you guys need and then that's set off the customer in an amazing way Listen to what happened in the game stop Oh, well, I thought you were a man wait you're gonna show me sir Call them and talk about how it's misgendered several times in the store. I need your corporate number now I'll take a woman, right? Yeah, it sounds like a woman Taylor Swift it almost sounds Stop calling me a man quite clearly quite clearly Calling me a man quite clearly. I'm not all right. This is And I yes, and I I'm sorry ma'am But quite clearly no you can't you can't use that phrase and that's a fascinating part of this because The whole point right of this gender thing Right is that you can't look at someone and identify them by their looks right right like you have to know how they identify appropriately Figure it out. So even if she did look like a woman you probably shouldn't say ma'am Right because what if she identifies as a man So the whole premise here is ridiculous I guess we have to refer to people in the plural now they and them they them and that's I think that's the preferred pronoun for some We should we should actually bring back the controversial Louis CK thing from yesterday Oh, yes, this is the exact same thing. He's complaining about in that controversial stand-up stuff but it's like first of all no Woman in history has ever reacted like that to that situation Man, I thought you were a woman. Why are you gonna show me a man? How does that happen? I'm really confused This one feels like a setup to me pat this one feels like the type of thing You know I'm gonna go in there and they're gonna call me sir And I'm gonna overreact and go crazy and make a deal at it in sue or whatever Yeah, because you know like it doesn't make any sense, you know Wouldn't you if you're in that situation if you're a transgender person and we've had plenty of transgender people called us over the years and explained basically this They understand that what they're going through is maybe not this thing that everybody's used to dealing with and so if someone were to make A mistake like that is you might correct them, you know if they're not trying to be a jerk to you though Like you're gonna show grace to them aren't you gonna say oh, you know actually just so you know I'm a dude or I'm a woman And the person you know with the person a game stuff says oh my god I'm so sorry, but that's that's that's how the incident could totally go down There's no there's no reason to turn it into that right and that's why it feels to me like a setup the other thing here Pat if you want the corporate number of game stuff just Google it You don't need to wait in there for them to give it to you Google the number Right, you're gonna be able to find it and and of course game stop We'll probably be like what we've done is we've given him free Xboxes every week for life We have given him free access to any store to come in and take a crap on the floor at any time Oh, did I say he oops? I mean she at any time can come in and take a crap at any one of our 475 stores in the continental United States because quite clearly we're talking about a woman quite clearly quite clearly as you can hear um so and I wonder a Little follow-up and see if game stop fired the employee to I hope not cuz clearly the employee Was just confused didn't know yeah I mean guys is a term that can control that can cover anybody. Yes. I say guys to women all the time all the time I mean it just I just want to go It's a group. It's a general term meaning people to me at this point. We're not we no longer live in the era of guys and dolls Right do we is that where we are I don't think so I don't think so I don't think is if you want to bring back and make it okay for me to call women dolls Then I'll consider your position on this but for the most part guys just means anybody now look I think probably The employee did think it was a man one reason why is it's a man Yes, I mean quite quite clearly Biologically a man by any outward appearance and or auditory Evidence you would think that that is a guy and aren't we supposed to deny all of that exists now? We're supposed to deny I guess that there are actual Characteristics of a man and there are characteristics of a woman right and well and that's the thing he's She's she is claiming It's obvious based on her physical characteristics that she's a woman something else and when you see the video Characteristics tell you something else Tell what if it tell you I don't I you'd have to look at it and see what it tells you right it tells you quite obviously this looks like a guy Yeah, it does. Yeah, but it's such a strange thing. It's like He he is saying Uh the employee he's looking at this person and saying that's a guy. That's what he believes instinctively And he seems to be right on that by the way Then This transgender person at least we're reported transgender person saying it says it's obvious based on my physical characteristics that i'm a woman Well, that's never that you you are now Telling this person what they should take from physical characteristics, which is much bigger overstep than getting a gender wrong You're now telling them you should recognize these things as female When intuitively he says it's a male and he's right Yes, so I mean this is just you know, it's ridiculous and I feel like it feels to me So outlay it feels manufactured. Mm-hmm. You know it feels like one of those things where here's what's going to happen You stand over there with your phone Or i'll go in there and i'll i'll raise a ruckus and then i'll i'll go ask the person for the video And then we'll go to game stop and I get free Zelda for life, right like that's the play You know or or it's a big lawsuit, right? They pay him a hundred thousand dollars Yes, and you know No, and in a week we all forget about the story We don't care but game stop gives a person a hundred thousand dollars It's just easier for them to pay out a bunch of money and then fight it in court And that that's probably what will happen It's probably what will happen that's sad bear really sad, you know, I hate that it's but that's the reality now You have to make these decisions. We've been in these situations, right? I mean we've been in situations many many times In which our instincts say look I just want to sit here and just fight with this person person in public in a public forum verbally And take down their arguments, but you realize afterwards you don't get anything out of it Like at the end of the day it might make you feel good for a few moments But at the end of the day you get nothing out of it you spend more money than you would have spent by just Brushing it off You uh, you know you don't convince anybody No one comes to your side and is like, oh wow, you know what? I first was with the transgender person, but now I see game stops this giant corporation I see their reasoning no one ever does that because no one ever cares to You know we are I think that you know, like you're if you're a listener to a talk radio show And you're sitting here listening to this stuff 15 20 hours a week You know, this is what you like you like to listen to these, you know, hopefully both sides and determine Um, what's right and wrong? I've had situations where I've come out at the beginning and my initial impression was one way And when you really look at the details you're like wait a minute. No, this is the other way it happens a lot now. It's our jobs So, you know, we have to do it And most people actually have real work to do And things that actually help the country and like move our economy forward and things like that important things Where we get to sit here and blab all day So we have that luxury of being able to sit here and look at all the stuff all day long and try to figure out The nuance there most people don't You know, talk radio listeners are an exception. I think generally speaking because they're willing to spend I mean if you're listening to this show and maybe a couple of the other big national shows You're in for full-time job listening to talk radio. I mean, we're doing 15 rush is doing 15 Hannity's doing 15 You're at 45 hours Right like you've spent a good chunk of your week listening to people talk about these issues and break them down and give you different perspectives on it hopefully And at the end of the day you're going to be a lot more informed than the average person who's just not He's not going to follow these things that closely And you see how this would react if you're if you're flipping through the headlines. You don't look at the pictures You don't watch the video. You see transgender person. Harrass the game stop. You hate game stop. Yeah, right? Yeah, and when game stop did nothing wrong there I mean at least as far as the the information we have at this point doesn't seem to have done anything wrong was completely the rational actor in that In that situation the game stop employee. No question This is the best of the Glenbeck program If the wall is the biggest issue, you know, I mean it was like I don't think if the immigration Situation happened. I don't think that he's even president today. I really don't I mean that was that was his crowning achievement His his main torch bearing issue in the very beginning Yes, so how much of his base is going to vacate if he loses this I would say a lot right? I don't know I mean really thought that in the beginning that yeah if he changes on immigration because that was the big issue I think that's changed now. I don't know that there's an issue. I don't know if there is anything We did a show remember this pat. We did show calls from people who are big trump supporters saying what's the one thing that will change your mind And overwhelmingly it was the wall the only only thing that would change our mind is the wall and now I think it's gone from Full border wall down to a thousand miles of border wall down to 500 miles of border wall down to it's not really a wall It's a fence down to it's some fence some technology and other things where they were making some repairs And we're paying for it with a new trade deal. It's not even enforced And Lindsey Graham went as far as to call it a metaphor not really an actual physical thing right So, I mean, I I don't know I think you know well if he if he were I mean he did get heat though for abandoning this when he Was let's say yeah, he came on fox news. Yeah, which was great fox news rush limbaugh like a lot of his big supporters were like You know, look what are you doing here? I mean he and let's not sell that lightly he he was backing down from the wall Sarah Sanders said look we'd rather have the government You know open then you know, you know, then you know, then then then risk this so he backed down and then everybody in mass Just went after him like crazy. He flip flopped back over So he's got to be scared about that his pollers are definitely scared about that because I'm sure they're the ones that convinced him to You know reverse course. Yeah, and I think I do think though the democrats think I'm not saying they're right because they miss on this stuff all the time But I think they think they're in a good position here because one trump has already said it's his shutdown and it's about the wall two If it gets uglier, they're going to be a little heap more blame on him and they can try to get either a giant thing that they want like a daca or They can just wait it out and wait for him to fold Because you know the other thing about the border is it's very it's popular among talk radio listeners It's popular among republicans in general. It's uh, it polls at 76 to 19 among republicans Right. So it's a very popular proposal Currently though, it's 89 to 8 among democrats against it and it's posed 62 34 among republicans So overall polling is 60 to 37 opposed to building a wall right now Wow now a lot of that's because trump isn't a particularly popular president overall in the country like he's he's popular among his base But that's about it. So part of that as we talked about with democrats moving so far on that issue from 50 50 basically to 89 to 8 Part of that's trump related, but it's not a it's not a an issue That the majority of the country is particularly passionate about getting done They actually oppose it the funny thing about this is there's no fiscal conservatives left in the gop pretty much Uh, I mean the summer in the freedom caucus. I guess. Yes, but there's a few they're not very loud at least Um, so you actually what's funny is you actually have some republicans that are against this because they don't care about spending money And all the democrats have never cared about spending billions and but this is five billion dollars That's nothing to them. You know like scrit, you know like five billion. That's true. You know, I use that now. They're acting like oh my gosh No, we can't set the budget that much that five billion. That's wasteful spending. I was like shut up He wouldn't say that on anything else that you would want to build. Yeah, well and that's a great point And what they're trying to do is use this though to pressure those vulnerable republicans in the senate. Cory gardener is the big example now first of all, Cory gardener banned birth control And that must have been expensive. It was very fast to do But he you know, he's already come out. He said he did. Yeah, he's so he's already come out and said we got to open the government We can't do this. Do you try the gas station? Come on? That's not memorized. Yeah, that's so good That's a great ad but they're already pressuring people like that who are up for reelection soon And in purple states, you know, it's gonna be it's gonna be an interesting road the blaze radio network On demand"
