    "text": " Hey guys, welcome to the show. My name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. We got a really fun show for you tonight and so happy that you could be here. To start off, we're going to be going over Mario Lopez finding himself in hot water regarding the whole trans children's situation. He quickly caved to online mob outrage, which is too bad. What else? We got Tulsi Gabbard suing Google. Very excited to hear about that. Then Alan Dershowitz is saying some funky things about age of consent laws online and we're going to finish off with the Democratic debate because that was a party. And just a big thank you to anyone who shares, likes, subscribes, comments. It really helps us out, especially sharing on other platforms like Reddit, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter. We've noticed that there has been a big uptick in people finding our videos that way, which we really appreciate because YouTube doesn't really recommend us. It feels backwards that that would happen and it kind of is. But yeah, even sharing us by email is a terrific way. Yeah. And I know someone kind of laughed when I said that in the last video in the comments because that is a very strange request. But I see that we're getting traffic from Gmail. So I appreciate you guys. The boomers are finally tripping in. Yeah. It means a ton. If you want to go even further than that to support the show, you can of course always head on over to blaestv.com slash Lauren subscribe using the code Laura. Not only do you help us out financially over here, but you also get a ton of other great shows to watch. Chad Prath or Ally Stuckey, Stephen Crowder, Phil Robertson, Glenn Beck, Mark Levin. I mean, just who is not on Blaestv? I don't know. And finally, for our live stream viewers, if you want to help out, you can also give us a super chat. We're not going to be going through them during the show, but you know, after in the after party stream around an hour into things, we're going to be going through everything, answering your comments, questions, concerns. It's a good time. One final thing is you can find us also on every podcast platform. Yes. iTunes, Spotify, Google Play. Yeah, we appreciate our podcast viewers. I think that our beautiful faces are the best part of the show. But if you're a podcast person, we got you covered. So this show is a lot less heavy than last week's, which I think is a good thing for a lot of people. Yeah, definitely. Well, I promise it would be a little bit lighter, right? Yeah. Yeah. So with another trans story, guys, I'm not meaning to like pick on trans people. I just feel like this is a lot of what's happening in the news right now. Mario Lopez, he's an actor slash entertainer. You didn't know who he was, right? No, but I don't. I don't Hollywood. Yeah. But he was later on Saved by the Bell. Yeah, I don't. Anyway, I think he's like an E kind of talk show guy anyway. So he was recently on the Candace Owens show, which I thought was pretty cool that he agreed to come on as an actor. I don't know that he'd done anything necessarily political before this, but I thought that was great. During the interview with Candace, and by the way, if you haven't seen it, I was also recently on the Candace Owens show. It was a fun time. Watch that over on the PragerU channel if you haven't already. But when Mario and Candace were talking, the topic of trans kids came up and Lopez, I think in the most general, um, uncontroversial way pretty much said that three year old trans kids to him is weird, which is like the most milk toast takeaway from trans kids, I think, is possible. And to most people wasn't a controversial statement at all. This happened like a month ago. So the people who watched it, most of us were like, yeah, that is weird. But woke Twitter. Finally, I guess either watched the episode or someone started sharing that clip of him. They're finally able to process it in their brains. Yeah, maybe just took that long. And so people in the woke community started freaking out as they often do. And despite his totally same statements, he actually did end up apologizing already. And this is all by the way in the past day or so. Maximum 48 hours, 24 hours probably. Yeah. So it went from this happened, outrage about this happened to apology all within a really fast cycle, which I was disappointed to hear that he apologized. Yeah. Yeah, I agree with that. I bet you I bet you saw his manager probably. I know. Yeah, there are financial incentives. He works in Hollywood. I get it at the end of the day. But here's what people had to say about this. We have the article. Mario Lopez apologizes for ignorant and insensitive comments about parenting transgender kids. Mario Lopez is facing backlash over comments he made in a recent interview that suggested it was dangerous for parents of children as young as three years old to definitively label their kids transgender. The incoming access Hollywood co-host appeared on the Canis Owen show in June where the conservative commentator brought up this new trend where celebrities are coming out and saying that their child is picking their gender. In response, Lopez told Owens he too was struggling to understand the mentality and was kind of blown away. Look, I never want to tell anyone how to parent their kids obviously. And I think if you come from a place of love, you really can't go wrong, he said. But at the same time, if you're three years old and you're saying you feel a certain way or you think you're a boy or a girl or whatever the case may be, I just think it's dangerous as a parent to make that determination then. Okay, well, then you're going to be a boy or a girl, whatever the case may be. It's sort of alarming. And my gosh, I just think about the repercussions later on. The former Saved by the Bell Star continued encouraging parents of young children to be the adult in the situation and wait until the child's formative years to have discussions and make declarations regarding genders. So that was so tame, the most tame thing. He even kind of emphasizes, of course, love them. Like, you know, don't, I don't know, see your son playing with the Barbie doll and freak out and start beating him. He didn't say anything like that. It's shocking to me that we live in a day and age. We're saying, hey, maybe don't let your three year old decide his gender based on a whim is apparently a controversial thing to say. And it all happened so fast, right? Yeah. And a few years ago, you wouldn't even be having this discussion. No way. And now it's like, it's the over the dux. The escalation. The over the window has shifted so, so fast and crazy. Like I said, I get why if you're in Hollywood and actor, obviously saying anything against any sort of trans ideology is not a good thing. But at the same time, caving to outrage mobs like this, I mean, a it just kind of confirms in their own minds that, yeah, this person did do something wrong. I was morally justified. I've done something good by making them capitulate and then be it encourages that sort of just cancel culture behavior because they're shown, oh, look, it works. You can get whatever you want by just tweeting angrily to people. Yeah. And I don't really think that a lot of people buy his apology. I think he said all the right words, right? But I think that at the end of the day, my opinion is that he probably thinks what he said initially. Yeah, that is weird. Yeah, he thinks it's weird and he probably wouldn't want his kids to transition at the age of three or whatever this is. It's reasonable. I think that basically everybody knows that. So he didn't regain any fans by saying all the right words because his apology was very well worded, at least in that regard. But I think the thing is, if he didn't apologize, then those people wouldn't stop going for blood. Yeah, no, I agree. And now I think those people, they don't maybe necessarily think, okay, you're one of us. It's all good now. But I think there may be at least less on the offensive. They might just leave him alone and kind of passively ignore him instead of actively going after him. We have some examples of what people were saying online though. It's pretty shocking stuff from Alex Berg. No idea who this person is, but she's verified on Twitter. So take what you will from that. Mario Lopez's suggestion that parents ought not to accept their trans kids, kids who face staggering levels of suicide, bullying and other hurdles is cruel. He conflated sexual orientation and gender identity, which is a pretty big tell that you don't know anything about this. Okay. And I think that parents should not accept their trans kids. The straw man, of course. That is like an amazing straw man. What he said was, it's weird if your child says, Hey, I'm this to just be like, okay, make sense. That is not at all. Yeah, that's just really disappointing here. And that's, that's always how things are painted now. If you push back against anything trans or whatever, it's that you're a transphobe. You hate them. You want these kids to kill themselves. This is essentially what she's saying that he supports trans kids, like suicide. Yeah, absolutely. And there's just no thought involved in any of this besides what the orthodoxy says, right? Like we don't talk about the cause of trans suicide. Why might it be? Is there any mental illness involved or is there because it's just because of bullying all the time? Because they've also shown that among trans individuals, there are higher rates of things like anxiety and even like depression and stuff. So it's very, I think, politically convenient to say, Oh, you just need to be nicer to us and accept us in every way or else we're going to kill ourselves and it's going to be your fault. Yeah. I think not only that, they didn't like there's rapid onset gender dysphoria, right? What you talked about on the show before with Dr. DeBroso. Yeah, she's she's discussed it before. We have another thing here. It's someone tweeted hashtag Mario Lopez's wiki has been updated. I don't I tried to check if this was actually a screenshot of his Wikipedia page. By the time I checked, it was not this. Maybe it was at some point it was fixed, but it says now in his biography, Mario Lopez, Jr. is a transphobic and misogynistic American actor. Well they can fix those Wikipedia changes pretty quick. Wikipedia is pretty good actually considering all things. But yeah, transphobic for saying, Hey, three year old trans kids. I don't know about that huge. My favorite thing about that edit though was that it was also grammatically incurable. Correct. Yes, it was and transphobic. Yeah, it was like, well, you're a real, real bright person doing that, I guess. Like the Wikipedia edits are like what high school stuff at best? Yeah, I think so. I don't know. Alexandra Hallaby, again, I don't know who this is. She says, it's unfortunate that someone, and I want to say she looks, no, I'm not even going to say that. I'm not going to assume any sort of gender identity on behalf of her part. It's unfortunate that someone who isn't so involved with GLAD like Mario Lopez would be so misinformed about trans kids. I wish that he would reach out to Sarah Catelli's. Not sure who that is either. For some guidance on the difference between sex and gender identity. But I mean, even here, so you admit that he's really involved with GLAD, but he's misinformed about trans kids. Why doesn't he just maybe have a different opinion than you? Why does he have to be missing the only one correct opinion? Yeah. That's what the science says. Which is funny because the science does not say this. I know that's, I know, I'm not saying it does, but that's what they say, you know. I mean, again, with Deborah So talks about this, it's the majority of kids who describe having gender dysphoria, you know, when they're five, six, seven, whatever. I think it's, I don't want to say an exact number, but something shocking 70, 80% of them go on to be cis-gendered adults. They don't transition. So that means that if you are a three year old who's displaying gender dysphoria, I don't even know what that would look like because I don't know how good the communication or self-awareness of a three year old is. But odds are you will not grow up to be trans. So just kind of saying, oh yeah, you're a girl now, which I think Charlize Theron has done for her child. That's not good for the child long term. It's a great virtue signal. Seemed very tolerant, but for the actual child's well-being, I don't know about that. And I just suspect that that kid would never have thought or said anything of that nature if they weren't exposed to all this kinds of pro-trans propaganda and gender unicorns or what have you, right? It wouldn't even occur to them because they're just a child. Yeah. And people have brought up that point, right? If you're just a child and there's no sort of outside influence, odds are you're going to be saying, I'm a fireman. I'm a dinosaur. You see a lot of stuff as a kid and that's fine. It's fun. You can play make, believe none of those statements are necessarily a reflection of your gender identity. But when we introduce this ideology, then these people say, oh, okay. Wow, okay. Okay. We'll start you on the transition treatment right away. And you reward their behavior, right? You say, oh, that's okay. That's great. And you're so trendy and popular, you get attention for it too. You might even get these interviews in sympathetic magazines. It's pretty crazy. Of course, we should love children unconditionally, right? If someone does grow up to be trans and they did know it as a young child, don't shame them. I'm fine with them exploring that in themselves, but there's a big difference between saying, hey, whatever toys you want to play with, whatever friends you want to have, as long as you're safe, you're happy, that's fine. And being like, all right, we're changing your name. We're buying you different clothes. We're enrolling you in a special school, all of that stuff. That's where it crosses the line, in my opinion. And I think it is safe to say that 99% of these trans kids, probably it's a social factor thing, right? And I really do think so. There's a story that's pretty shocking and not surprising for where we are in society. The Sun reported, and we have the article here, parents revealed both of their children are transgender and decided to transition aged five and eight. Wow, two transgender kids in one family. That's a... I don't know what that father has, like radioactive next to his ball all the time because there's something wrong with that is the case. Those are some shocking statistics. Yes, and anomaly, incredible. What could be the case no one knows. Parents of two transgender children who were aged five and eight when they transitioned insist their kids are happier than ever. James was eight years old when he told his parents he wanted to transition from female to male. He was in second grade. Like, why would you could even know about this? That just improves to me. You don't know how to have age-appropriate conversations. Olivia was four when she said she was transgender, but didn't begin socially transitioning and using female pronouns until she was five and entering kindergarten. James is now waiting to begin testosterone, which would be the first permanent action he takes toward transitioning as the process would affect his fertility. Okay, he's eight years old. Unbelievable or at least he... I'm not sure if he still is, but either way, pretty crazy. Ben, who I think is the kid's father said, we are on the right side of history. I love that line. And we are not going to allow our kids to feel shame or fear based on other people. They deserve to feel loved and accepted. We're going about this because we are listening to our children and because we are doing a lot of research which has proven we are doing the right thing. Oh, the research that I've done has told me that I'm doing the right thing. So that's okay then. Hey, we have the name pseudo-intellectual. Yeah, that's our thing. Yeah, what the heck. But this is so funny. We are listening to our children. Did your eight-year-old tell you that he wants to start on testosterone? There's no prompting, no coaching. He just naturally was like, you know what? I want some testosterone as most eight-year-olds do ponder at some point. I want to compete in the Olympics with women. Yeah. We will love and accept them if they come to us tomorrow and say they've changed their minds, Sarah said, and we will love and accept them if they don't. Okay, that's great that you love your kids, but yeah, I don't care. You are obviously playing a role in this. And in my opinion, this is child abuse. And I know I tend to go really hard on topics involving children. If you've seen last week's episode with the whole pedophilia thing, you'll know that. But look, if I end up being smeared as the person who's against three-year-olds transitioning and pedophilia, I'm okay with that. I am comfortable with that being my reputation. Gosh, and we have one more little segment to add on to this because- Oh, this was funny. Yeah, this is confusing. So I just feel like in Hollywood, everyone's either trans or they have trans children now. Yeah, we're about to descend into the realm of tabloid gossip. That's a disclaimer. Like this is the- Well, this isn't gossip. I think this has actually happened. Yeah, sort of. Anyways, we'll get into the story. Okay, we'll get into it. Okay, so according to Closer, an outlet I've never heard of, Caitlyn Jenner's shock baby news. I can't wait to be a mom at 70. So there's a lot going on here. Their relationship, Closer Reports, has gone from strength to strength since they were first spotted together in 2017 with Caitlyn Jenner rarely being seen without Sophia Hutchins, who she's referred to as her partner despite neither of the transgender icons ever officially confirming their romance. And with Reports the pair are set to marry, insiders tell Closer how 69-year-old Caitlyn, who has six biological children and four step children, may soon celebrate an 11th child with the 22-year-old Sophia, who was also born a man. A source says Caitlyn and Sophia have spoken about starting a family together for the last year or so, and while Caitlyn's already got 10 children, she's never had the chance to bring up a child in the role of a mother, which she's always dreamed of doing. Sophia's also longing to become a mom and Cait knows how important that is to her. They've decided to hire a surrogate to carry their much-long Ford baby. So we have a 69-year-old trans woman in a relationship with a 22-year-old trans woman. You got that, yeah. And they are going to be parents. Yep. They got a rental womb and raised the children. I believe a nanny will be involved from what I was reading. But I mean the relationship in itself, I can't even imagine that kind of relationship existing. Well, because yeah, okay, there are several things here. All right. The age difference alone. Forty-seven years, that's impressive. That doesn't make me a trans folk to say that's weird. That's weird. Yeah. Okay. And then just like 69 and wanting to become a parent, like that's too- Oh, there's just so much about this sometimes. To be a mom, yeah. Defending Western societies is hard. Like it is hard. Yeah. Like I love freedom, but I mean it's hard sometimes. You know what? I get that image. Have you ever seen that family guy seen where Peter Griffin tries to breastfeed Stewie? Oh. In an episode, that's the imagery I'm getting right now. Yeah. No, that's not too far off. So yeah, this is the state of modern Hollywood. Too bad for Mario Lopez disappointed in him. And I wish Caitlyn Jenner and Mrs. Caitlyn Jenner all the best, I suppose. I don't even know anymore. All right. Tulsi's lawsuit. This is a little bit more of a happy story. Yeah, this one's good. Last week, you promised people that we were going to have a more upbeat story. And for me, this is our upbeat story. This makes me pretty happy. Well, we cover a lot of this kind of big tech news sort of stuff, because we're directly involved in it a lot of what has been independent media on YouTube, right? I mean, I have no shame in saying I care about this because it affects me personally. But also other people. Well, I think it's definitely us. I mean, we care about it, I guess, more because it is our livelihood. But it's actually like legitimately a massive, massive issue, nationally. This is why I love this news because we've been talking about text censorship for literally, I think, years now. It's at least over a year. Yeah. We've been making videos about this. I'm probably tired of hearing about it in some degree. I'm tired of talking about it. We need to. Yeah, frankly, I wish it was just done, but it's still happening. So we still need to talk about it. So Tulsi Gabbard, I'm a pretty big fan of her as a person. Just there's politically a lot I don't agree with her with. She's quite far left, especially in terms of domestic policy. But otherwise, I think she's a good public servant, an example of what it means to love your country. And she's, I think, been pretty unifying in her campaign so far. She's now suing Google. And here's what Fox News reports on it. Quote, Democratic presidential contender Tulsi Gabbard announced Thursday, she is suing Google for alleged election interference claiming the tech giant suspended her campaign's Google ads account just after the first Democratic presidential primary debate. Gabbard, a military veteran and Congresswoman from Hawaii is an outsider candidate who has often been at odds with her fellow progressives. Google's discriminatory actions against my campaign are reflective of how dangerous their complete dominance over internet search is and how the increasing dominance of big tech companies over our public discourse threatens our core American values. Gabbard said in a statement, this is a threat to free speech, fair elections, and to our democracy. And I intend to fight back on behalf of all Americans. Yes, queen. Slay. Okay, specifically, Gabbard claimed that multiple news reports indicated she was the most searched candidate on Google following the first Democratic primary debate on June 26. Then without any explanation, Google suspended Tulsi's Google ads account. Her office said in a statement that called the move arbitrary and capricious. Big tech's dominance represents a clear and present danger to our democracy, the team said. And in the statement to Fox News, Google acknowledged that Gabbard's account had been suspended by its internal system, but denied Gabbard's charges. We have automated systems that flag unusual activity on all advertisers, advertisers accounts, including large spending changes in order to prevent fraud and protect our customers. A Google spokesperson said, in this case, our system triggered a suspicious, a suspect, a suspension, sorry. And the account was reinstated shortly thereafter. We are proud to offer ad products that help campaigns connect directly with voters. And we do so without bias toward any party or political ideology. They said to nobody's belief. Yeah, they say that every time, right? Yeah. All the big techs that say, well, we we're telling you that we don't have any bias and you should believe us because we told you. Yeah, exactly. Despite all of these separate incidents, yeah, kind of indicating we have bias, a specific way. And that's the thing like, I think a lot of the independent media that have been talking about big tech censorship for a long time tend to be right leaning. And so I think there's this I instinct among a lot of left wing people that this is a right wing conspiracy theory. There's been enough evidence to say, I don't think so. This is actually happening. But I think people on the left really need to start paying attention to this more because they're going after not just conservatives, right? It doesn't matter if you're left wing or liberal, if you go against mainstream, progressive status quo, they're going, they're going to go after you. That's why we see people like Tulsi Gabbard having to deal with this far more moderate than all of her counterparts. And especially she's more anti-establishment when it comes to things like foreign wars and stuff like that. People like David Pakman have also had trouble with Google and Tim Poole. So this they're not just going after conservatives. I think it's fair to say that if you're conservative, you have a special target on your back, but this this affects more people. And I'm so glad that she's bringing attention to this. I don't think she's going to win. I don't know. But the more how about there is about all this kind of situation about Trump having events at the White House talking about all this technology and everything going on, I think that this is great news. Really? Yeah, no, it is. And the thing is she is totally justified in this because the amount of attention you get after those debates, it's huge. And the timing is just so it's so bad. Having those ads when people were searching for her about the debate, being able to target those people specifically, she could have gotten more donations. She could have gotten more supporters in general and directed them back to her site. Like there is an actual monetary cost that Google has inflicted upon her. And not just a cost, but a general public support she could have been able to muster. So this, I think she's absolutely correct in saying is election interference. And this isn't just an American issue. By the way, Google is an American company. Tulsi Gabbard is American. But if if you are someone who cares about free and fair elections, open information, doesn't matter where you are, you should care about this. All right. In Ireland, Google was accused of deranking and blacklisting pro life content leading up to Ireland's election on abortion. Okay. In the UK, just earlier this year, campaign accounts for Tommy Robinson and Carl Benjamin, Sargon of cod, which were not run by the individuals themselves, they were banned by Twitter. Okay, in Canada, Twitter has also recently suspended official PPC accounts that the People's Party of Canada, it's our right leaning libertarian party. So it doesn't matter where you're from. This is a problem for everybody. And what's so funny is that I get people who don't like me, sometimes saying stuff like, wow, if I talk about American politics, you're not a US citizen, shut up. And it's funny because I even get stuff like that when I talk about cultural issues. Yeah, you know, like I'll do a video about gender and they'll be like, you're not American, stop talking about American politics. And it's like, we have gender in Canada, too. I don't know. So everything bleeds over. We're so close. And the whole world, you know, world interconnected, but America is is the center of the world. Well, that's the thing, like the BBC, which is British state run news, RT, Russian news, CBC, Canada, Canadians, state run enterprise, they all talk about American politics, because news is news, it affects everybody, you'd be naive to think that it doesn't. And I mean, also people will talk about whatever they want. But if you're so protective of your political process that you don't even want non citizens to comment, voice their opinions about what's going on, how can you be okay with a multinational company like Google that has no allegiance to any country that is run by foreign nationals from all over the place, pays zero taxes on Ireland, exactly having this much control over elections worldwide. That will never make sense to me, nevermind. It's it's considered election interference for the Russians to buy Facebook ads. But it's not election interference for Facebook to just ban Trump supporters en masse. Yeah, makes no and play with the algorithm to do it even more under the cover. Exactly. So another thing that I like about Tulsi Gabbard is her willingness to talk to people who disagree with her. And speaking of that, she was actually recently on Tucker Carlson, not her first appearance on his show. But on their multiple times, even within the past week, I think, so she was on there recently to talk about this lawsuit, why she's doing it and what she thinks the implications are for the United States if Google continues on unchecked. Here's the bottom line. This is really about the unchecked power that these big tech monopolies have over our public discourse and how this is a real threat to our freedom of speech and to our fair election. So this really isn't about me. It's about taking action on behalf of the American people, because we've got to understand here that if Google can do this to me as a sitting member of Congress running for the highest office in the land, then that means they can do this to any candidate running for any office anywhere in this country and frankly to any person in this country. I really respect what Tulsi is doing here, but just in general, she reminds me of a quainer time where you could disagree with a politician on X, Y or Z, but still think that they're a good person. They love their country. They embody American values. I don't think we really see that anymore that often, which is why she's refreshing to me. One side's racist, the other side's socialist. Yeah. Nobody in between. So I've kind of found that even just watching different commentators across the board, the independent media figures that I follow, they seem to really be into Tulsi, even if they don't agree with her domestic policies, which she's quite far left. She was a Bernie supporter. But yeah, when she says things like she would put her life on the line essentially to defend someone else's free speech, that's not something we hear from other Democrats, which is too bad because this shouldn't be a left versus right issue. And so I mean, her saying that as a veteran, I think it carries like an a special amount of weight. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah, for sure. So I mean, I think actually her time for debate is actually tonight. Yeah, as we're having this show, 8 p.m. to 10 30 p.m. I think so. So maybe in next week's show, we'll have a little bit of rundown how she's performed. But that's right. But also stay tuned. We've got good stuff coming. You know, yeah, don't go don't go run away to go watch those debates quite yet. They don't really start until nine until nine. So so say here first, watch us first, especially considering our next segment is about age of consent laws. A little bit more of a touchy subject. Finally, somewhere where I'm libertarian. I'm joking. I'm joking. But yeah, well, that's the thing. I mean, age of consent laws are something that's come up kind of online pretty recently. I hear, you know, people talk about it from a libertarian perspective. I've seen threads on Reddit and fortune talking about this. This is one of those topics that the internet loves to discuss. I don't know if it's because it relates to sex. I think a lot of it is me too. I would hope it's a meme. Although to be fair, most of what I see people talking about isn't abolishing it entirely, but they think it should be moved around anyway. Alan Dershowitz, you may have heard of him before. I will explain exactly who he is in just a second, but he's under fire for tweeting out some questionable things about age of consent laws. And so anyone trying to substantially lower or get rid of age of consent laws, I'm going to be very, very suspicious of. Yeah. Definitely at the very least, not going to agree with you, but it's a little bit of a red flag for me. But what makes him saying this worse, Alan Dershowitz, is that he actually has connections to Epstein, who has, you know, has a little bit of a pong shaw for younger women, allegedly, I think. Yeah, I mean, that's not even a term I would use, but yeah. Yeah. So this is what Vox has to say about the issue. When Jeffrey Epstein found out in 2005 that he was being investigated by police for sexual abuse of underage girls, he called Alan Dershowitz, a Harvard law school professor and high profile defense lawyer, Dershowitz helped negotiate a non prosecution agreement. How was that even an option for being accused of sexually abusing underage girls? I do not understand money. I guess it must be under which Epstein served just 13 months in a county jail, much of it spent on work release in an office. Ever since details of that agreement were reported by Julie K Brown of the Miami Herald, Dershowitz and his role in the deal have been under added scrutiny. That only increased this week with the publication of a New Yorker story by reporter Connie Brooke detailing not just Dershowitz's role in defending Epstein, but also allegations by two women who say they were directed to have sex with Dershowitz while in Epstein's orbit. Dershowitz vehemently denies both allegations. Despite widespread attention to his role in the Epstein case and a defamation suit from one of his accusers, Dershowitz has no intention of laying low. For instance, he continues to publicly criticize age of consent laws, most recently on Twitter earlier this week. It continues, a former Harvard student told Brooke that in class he had convoluted ways of thinking about how men could misinterpret lack of consent. And it wasn't relegated to when we were speaking about a rape case. Wherever we were on the syllabus, he would bring it up. So just he sounds like a great guy, not at all sketchy. Another student said that at one point a female classmate raised her hand and said essentially, okay, enough rape examples. There are women in this class who have been raped, can we move on to something else? Dershowitz told Vox he taught about rape in exact proportion to the amount it came up in the casebook. He said that some former students described didn't happen. Like a student saying there was too much discussion of rape. However, he said there were always a small group of students who didn't like the way I taught rape because I didn't toe any lines. If students were- He had demonstrations and everything, it was crazy. If students were afraid to challenge or the doxies, he said he would have had to do it himself. He added that he also brought in prosecutors who handled rape cases to present their expertise. In 1997, Dershowitz argued against statutory rape laws saying the age of consent should be 15. Breck reports, there must be criminal sanctions against sex with very young children. Oh, just the very young one. Otherwise it's game. Yeah. But it is doubtful whether such sanctions should apply to teenagers above the age of puberty since voluntary sex is so common in their age group. Oh, so if if the kids are doing it amongst themselves, mine as well, invite the adults. Dershowitz stands by his argument today tweeting earlier this week that quote, if a 16 year old has the constitutional right to have an abortion without state or parental interference, that's already questionable. How could she not have the constitutional right to engage in consensual sex? Yeah, well, I mean, listen, I understand his line of logic and that last one, at least, but it's all about that first statement being true, the first premise. Yeah, but that's the thing. And it's like, even if that is the case, it shouldn't be the case. Yeah. So whether you're pro life or pro choice, you would have to have a very loose kind of liberal, I would say, metaphorical interpretation of the constitution to believe that it allows or guarantees 16 year olds the right to abortions without their parents knowledge. Again, like whether you're pro life or pro choice, Roe versus Wade, as a whole, was very, very poorly justified. It was not a good ruling. If you want to know more about it, like what it specifically says, the argumentation that was provided for that decision, I recommend Matt Christensen's video about it. He does a great job breaking everything down. So trying to apply Roe versus Wade to not just women having a constitutional guaranteed right to privacy for abortion, but then saying, oh, also 16 year olds and their parents can defeat like you are, you're taking some leaps, my friend, and then trying to apply that also they should also be able to have sex with adults. That's just, that's a lot. You're saying a lot of things. And yeah, it's, it would be one thing if you were just a random person, but that's what people on Twitter were replying to him when he tweeted this out. Like you are under a lot of scrutiny right now for your involvement with Jeffrey at or is this his first name, Jeffrey? Yeah. Yeah. This is probably not the best argument to be bringing up right now. It just it's it seems suspect. Let me forget some laws passed before. Yeah. Then, you know, we can do an expo spacto thing. Oh, what he did was an illegal I got your back. It's just it's just really strange. Yeah. More generally though, okay, let's talk about age of consent laws. I think 16 to 18, depending on the state is what it is in the US. I think it's similar here. Yeah. 16 in Canada. And I think a lot of places also have those Romeo and Juliet laws where, so yeah, if someone is 15, but they do it with a 17 year old, it's okay, which I personally, I think it should be no less than 18, but I do think those laws are important to like a 19, year old doing it with his 17 year old girlfriend or what that's like, yeah, like your birthday hits. Exactly. All sudden your criminal. I mean, yeah. I think those laws are important. But the point of age of consent laws is that children, minors, they don't have the mental faculties, right? They're not intellectually capable of contemplating the rational decision making that needs to go in to giving someone consent for sex. And to me, that premise makes perfect sense. You can't really consent if you're drunk under the influence of drugs. You can't consent if you're passed out. If you're mentally challenged, you can't consent either. So it stands to reason that if you have a 10 year old 11 year old 12 year old who doesn't understand all of the biological, social, emotional, just physical ramifications of sex that they wouldn't be able to consent to such a thing makes perfect sense to me. What do you think about the argument from authority as well? Yeah, someone that has power over you can exploit that and you can manipulate them and that's easier to do with someone younger than you. Do you also buy that with among adults? Well, I think one of the reasons why I think that argument is interesting because we've done a video a while ago about like kissing cousins. There was a doctor fill out that's right. People were trying to legalize marrying your cousin. I'm not talking about like second cousin, like no, your actual just cousin. I think the authority thing is a very important thing to talk about because in in families there are those, I guess, authoritarian leanings between like let's say a mom and a son or perhaps even an older family member and a younger family member where even if the parties are both adults that relationship dynamic is still not equal and therefore is still vulnerable to involve coercion. Yeah, absolutely. The only place where I think age of consent, this is not even really age of consent. I don't think but where I think the whole issue of children and sex needs to be examined from a maybe more liberal sense is that there are actually cases of teenagers sending nudes to their boyfriend or girlfriend and then being prosecuted with child pornography. Yeah, that seems so that I agree is a problem and I think that's an area where the law hasn't caught up to what kids are doing any kids if you're watching this, I'm not saying you should send news absolutely not that is not the moral of the story. I just think that you know if you are let's say a 16 year old and the girlfriend you have who is the same age sent you a bad picture alone, behold, you're a girl and you get sent like an unsolicited dick pick from a classmate who's also your age right not condoning any of this by the way bad behavior you kids shouldn't do that but I don't think you should be I don't know held on child pornography charges for that so absolutely that's the only place where I'm like maybe we can think about this a lot but 15 that is so young for an age of consent and I was actually looking worldwide about what the different laws are. It says young as 11 and 12 in some countries 12 I think Mexico is officially 12 but there's a lot of caveats. Yeah I think there are it depends on the I want to say province that the area that you're in could be could be higher but yeah so 12 that's just outrageously that's insane that's insanity I think the highest one that I saw was Bahrain which is 21 interesting that's and well what I think is interesting is that we have now a days I think the push is more and more to lower age of consent laws yeah but everything that we've seen in studying the development of the human brain because of your less developed exactly leads us to believe that human cognitive development actually finishes later than we thought yeah I think 18 is like an arbitrary number that we really haven't gotten rid of since we've used to enlist right yeah so I mean I think for all of these things I think that maybe there's an argument to be made that hey being able to vote and drive and drink they don't necessarily all have to have the same magical age that's true I think it's very reasonable to say like hey you know you can have a beer at this age but if you want to take out let's say hundreds a thousand dollars worth of debt maybe you wait to be a bit older I think it makes sense to have kind of examine things on a case by case basis but I think once you're able to vote you should be able you should have all your rights by then yeah because that's what I think voting is the biggest responsibility yeah because it doesn't affect just you it affects your entire country and you're also a full citizen at that point so you should yeah you should have all your faculties by then definitely so it should be kind of the graduation yeah so I mean like if anything I think age of consent like yeah like 16 knots young I'd say let's go a little higher he is no no I like that idea but but my only issue is that laws are only laws of people follow them and I don't know I'll be up in age of consent to 21 or something like that I see a lot of people probably just not not following along well I think what uh when I I think probably 18 is fine for a general age of consent but what I think should be higher and I feel actually very strongly about this is that in usually if you're able to consent to sex like at 18 you can be in pornography I think 18 is too young to be in pornography I recently watched a documentary called hot girls wanted and watching those girls it's just pornography it's forever right you can't delete it from the internet you're not consenting to just one person and in one point in time you're consenting to your image being out there forever so personally I think it might make sense to even have uh different laws regarding just uh regular sex and being involved in pornography because I mean I was watching those 18 year old girls and like oh like you are young and you are making a lot of choices that are gonna affect how your life plays out so and I'm only a few years older than 18 year olds but I do not think of them now as people that make fully rational decisions at all I'd like to be like a couple 18 year olds and I'm like oh you are a baby yeah absolutely so anyway um there's you what's not getting a lot of love on the internet lately I can absolutely explain it and I was actually kind of um comforted by the amount of scorn I saw him getting just like people realize like hey this is a creepy guy it seems very self-sorting to connect the dots going on yeah with the whole Epstein thing and uh a lot of people were also like we were just now kind of questioning his entire premise it's like well if a 16 year old can get an abortion with her parents and it's like but should she be able to do like you've made an assumption there anyway um gosh that just like a whole crap almost seems like a better argument against abortion than anything else right yeah it's like because then we'd have to allow them to also have sex yeah I don't know creepy creepy all right so the democrat debate or at least the they do them rounds now we are on the second round of debates and the first one was yesterday the second one is tonight so yesterday we had people like let's see Sanders was there Warren was there Klobuchar Marianne Willens Marianne Williamson um let's see gosh there was like a whole bunch of people I didn't recognize a good portion of them frankly they were I'm gonna be honest there were a lot of older white males who I was not very very familiar with who kind of blended in together yeah um so I mean obviously I am not inclined to support left-wing policies but I wanted to start off this conversation with stuff that I agreed with because I think that that you know crossing the aisle and stuff okay so I like that people were talking a lot about tackling lobbyists and you know trying to get Amazon to pay their fair share I am yeah I agree with both those things yeah exactly I'm good with that especially like Amazon I don't see them paying zero federal taxes as like a yeah this is capitalism that's crony capitalism right they should have to pay as much taxes as the mom and pop businesses they shouldn't get preferential treatment over people who are just trying to start out that's absolutely ridiculous I think it was Warren Buffett that said at one point that his secretary was paying higher tax rate than he was yeah that I think may have been debunked because I think he might have been talking about capital gains and capital gains are actually taxed anyway so that that's not sure but yeah I mean like I the reality is if you have a lot of money there's a lot of availability is for you to not get taxed tons of loopholes simplify the tax code at the end of the day that's what you're gonna do and I just hate the idea that big organizations who have more money to spend on lobbyists get special treatment not to mention these organizations have a lot of overlap with the with the tech industry which is basically you know trying to control this conversation a lot of ways exactly so you know people like Elizabeth Warren we're talking about that Sanders even talked about that a little bit I am yes let's do that support that 100 percent you also people were talking a lot about trying to fix health care I don't think there's anybody at all anywhere that looks at America's health care system and thinks yes perfect as and you see that like Republicans want to change it Democrats want to change it nobody is happy with the current system right now so yeah I I'm as a Canadian I'm quite happy with your system because I've got my socialize health care and if it's not fast enough we go down to the states and pay so it's like the benefits of both of them and not only that but you guys pay for all the pharmaceutical research yeah so which is all related right because insurance companies and what have you but so we're benefiting massively from your guys situation yeah but then they take all of our doctors that's also true you take all of our doctors to the point where I have to pay to see a private doctor because they're weightless or so dang long so we have doctors that get essentially socialize education you know we pay through it subsidize yeah subsidized and then they they have to I think be a doctor here for like a minimum of five years or something like that and then they pack up go to the state a lot of French last name doctors down there sort of thing um you jerks I resent that but in any case all right so there's a lot of trump hating in the debate last night like of course when you're running against someone you're going to go hard against them attack their policies that's normal that's any election but like between Bernie and Warren especially they went hard on Trump disgrace liar bigot sexist and it's it's shocking to me how mainstream and accepted it is to just say those things about of course you're your president because I mean I am very critical of someone like Justin Trudeau I'm not going to call him like a racist or anything like that I I even defended I think I'd call him some names to be honest I think I should call him some names I don't like him would would you call him that if you were running against him for political office I would definitely ban some out a little bit absolutely no absolutely I hope that I hope so shocking that the way that political discourse has gone and we actually we have yeah well there's a limit to it you got to be you got to be a little bit you know have some tact with it but you still go to you want to get him into one of those muttering moments right but I mean they're just straight out calling him a bigot liar sexist racist like where's the tact and that and actually we have this gem from Don Lemon who was doing a very good job being a neutral moderator a journalist yeah from CNN what do you say to those Trump voters who prioritize the economy over the president's bigotry I love that it's not even like is is Trump bigoted it's like no what do you think of the voters who overlook his objective bigotry I love that too even like and I frankly I think it's a bad argument first place if someone's a bigot that's really bad thing to be but I would definitely place the entire economy which everybody's life depends on over the president being like even yeah even if he was iffy with the POC right right which I don't think he is which I don't think he is objectively speaking black unemployment Hispanic unemployment Asian American unemployment those are at historic lows so we rather be poor or or poor just in general and have someone tell us that they're being nice to us yeah I'm on board with you then have someone who says ridiculous things but objectively we have money in the bank food on the table I have a job things are going well so that's yeah that I thought was kind of ridiculous you know I really can't wait for one of these people gets on a stage with Trump because if they're talking in the way that those two were talking he's gonna he's gonna crush them oh he is absolutely he's way better at that than they are yeah you know they're all trying to play his show Pocahontas actually you know he said he can't call her Pocahontas anymore because she's not actually that's true but what I thought was so interesting is that there was you know there were people who were up there people like Ryan Bullock and let's see Hickenlooper I think it is that Delaney I actually came away thinking like oh yeah you know you guys are your Democrats but you're not crazy you're just like regular but they were not gonna be applause no but they were not getting the applause and they can't even tell from the moderators they weren't getting as much speaking time yeah that Sanders and Warren really dominated the debate yes yeah either the moderator would cut them off very quickly very abruptly yeah well the other ones would be like okay Bernie and then Bernie would you continue on and then another little gentle prompting right actually that was something that I get stressed out watching those debates because nobody listens to the time limit or the moderators it's like it's anxiety central for me because it's like guys stop it's chaos and it's but it's such a horrible system I don't know how you do it better because you have so many Democratic candidates right now you kind of have to do this but just the idea that you have like these massive questions right these questions about like a huge ginormous policy that central to the 2020 candidate so how would you do health care you have one minute yeah forty-five other than they start getting out the watch and counting down you know which is and even um so Sean who runs the channel actual justice warrior on youtube he's Greg should check out his videos finger guns finger guns that's my finger yeah um towards Sean nice um so he did a video about this and he kind of brought up the point that the way the debates are started there's so many people but right now they have it where Sanders and Warren who are like number two and three in polls they're not in the same debate as Biden who's number one yeah and I think a lot of people would want to see how they interact with each other because Warren and Sanders are very similar on things like health care immigration whereas Biden's a bit more establishment um less progressive I guess like far left and I mean maybe it's that they don't want to feel like the other candidates are reluctant just it's a very it's such a saturated field um yeah let's let's talk a bit more about health care though and I by the way I we've gotten requests to do videos on things like health care but it's it's such a complex topic it's I'll make me research that please yeah I can't even imagine how you could like fit that into 10 or 15 minutes and also we get like 10,000 views yeah people don't really like those videos we like them sort of you know that's the funny thing I've had people say why don't you do more like policy heavy videos and it's because they take longer but they people don't watch them which we still will do them um the next policy video working on is immigration right um we're still gonna do them but you know from a cost benefit analysis people just aren't that interested but you know what's funny is that if you ask people they'll say they're more interested in the heavier videos yes and then and then they won't watch views don't lie you guys that's why I used to do polls like what videos would you prefer but then I stopped doing that because it's like I realize oh you guys are trying to seem smart but you want to hear about Bella Thorne's nudes I get you I understand it um okay so health care um what I thought was interesting is that pretty much every nominee out up there referred to health care as a human right yes and there's something so socialized medicine not a huge fan but I think you have to realize even if you do want a universal system single payer referring to something as a human right rather than just a government service puts you in a very specific position right um so let's say public transit public transit is something that at least in like most cities uh the government provides is not a it runs it's it's not a private company and it's taxpayer subsidized but it's not a right so you still have to pay for it at least a little bit and they have they reserve the right to refuse service to anyone they can kick you off if you're being rowdy not paying whatever when you call something a human right you aren't able to withhold it from people and I think this is important to mention in regard to immigration because people like Bernie have said they think that illegal immigrants should get health care a lot of Democrats have at this point and it's like well when you start talking about health care as a human right you you kind of have to be of that opinion because you legally cannot um withhold human rights from illegal immigrants right that's why even if an illegal immigrant is detained you can't just start waterboarding them or anything like that but they still have human rights yeah I mean I think that it's definitely a language thing when they're talking about human rights but the way that they write it into law will probably not be as such I I don't know if they do because even like it's problems I mean there are people who are like people like Bernie they're coming out and saying no illegal immigrants should be able to have access to health care and um I forget who it was but someone was it Tim Ryan said in regard to like Bernie's free health care for illegal that like hey hang on you know Americans still have to pay for their health care I don't think it's crazy to ask illegal immigrants to pay for health care zero class yeah nothing and what was frustrating for me watching this uh you know I've lived in Canada I've lived in the UK I've lived in Hong Kong these are all places that do have single pair systems I know a bit about how those systems work obviously I'm not an expert not neither of any of those people up on the stage I think anyway but um I think one of them said that he he actually used to work in the health care profession but Bernie talked a lot about how in Canada this in Canada this let's be more like Canada what he's suggesting is nothing like Canada so in Canada there's public health care like single-payer government but you can also buy private health insurance and there's a lot of things that aren't covered yeah absolutely a lot of dentals not covered is a big one if you know if you want to go see a nutritionist there are a lot of different things and it differs from province to province right each province is in charge of handling their own health care system so I look at Bernie Sanders saying no private health insurance federal system let's be like Canada oh you know what I found it is covered actually do you know what Canada's like sorry go ahead right I mean we did we did find out recently that Canada does cover transition uh transition uh transition uh surgery which I thought was uh interesting I mean at this point it only affects I'm guessing very few people so I don't yeah but you know he wants to be like us yeah he wants to be like us um yeah so that was I mean I feel like if you're going to be advocating to be like another country you should at least get it right what the other country functions like yeah and never mind that um the people like war and role so saying it seemed like they don't want any um private option if we look at the countries that have the most efficient health care systems places like Hong Kong Singapore both of which I've lived in um or even places like Japan ranks highly as well or Spain I was kind of looking at the comparisons all of them have a couple of things in common again I'm not a fan of socialized medicine single-payer systems but if you want something that at least functions and doesn't destroy your country I think you have to do a couple of things right you have to have borders right because the way that single-payer systems work is that people pay in for the people who can who can't right it's it's a redistributive system right so the the the people who say there are so many poor people in America who don't have health care we need a single-payer system I'm sorry but that is exactly why a single-payer system will not work America I think has too many poor people to make it work even Canada certain provinces the ones that do have a more diverse population they're the ones where the health care systems are struggling because there's not enough people paying in compared to how many people are taking it out yeah also places like Canada Hong Kong Singapore like even Spain these are all countries where you do have that private option and I think that's that's important for people who want to be able to have faster care I think that was a ruling in Canada that the wait times were too long so they had to give people the option but it also it also just encourages more I think competition among the hospitals and more efficiency to have that option and another thing is that decentralized systems so again having this I don't understand why Americans are talking about this really on a federal level yes because I can't think of another country that really does it this way so it's like if you're gonna go down the route of wanting a single-payer system I would think you would look at the countries where it's working and learn lessons from that but apparently they're just not they're just like whatever we'll just do whatever we feel will work right I need I don't think there's ever been an example of a country like America with with the variables that America has been a massive country yes massive country extremely diverse extremely diverse in terms of amount of income earned and education yeah and a porous border frankly and that's why even I think Dana Lash is the reporter she asked Bernie so you know you're offering free immigrates sorry free health care and free college for illegal immigrants won't that just incentivize people to come that's right yeah fair point I I think and his his only response was no it won't matter because we'll have strong border controls but then he doesn't list any of the strong border controls so it's like and then in right in the next sentence he goes on to criticize trump for being racist and it's like well how would you enforce the border which apparently you have to because you're attracting people like flies and I'm sorry but you can say you're gonna have a strong border if you're still saying to people but once you get here free health care and free college it's it's it's a challenge right it's it's not really a repelling people it's just like okay it's gonna be hard to get here but if you do oh it's gonna be good if you do one year of that education it might be worth your entire like especially since they like I think they're all pretty much in favor of a path to citizenship so it's like right exactly what possible I don't know border controls would you support that would override this so I think the overall theme that I saw at least was that the main candidates and you know like they're so so far left I mean they're talking about things Canada is a pretty left-wing country even our conservative party they're they're called the progressive conservative so that should tell you what you need to know yeah they're still like center left I would say yeah they're fiscally conservative more than anything and even then well relative to Canada I guess yeah I mean like you know center center left depending on the issue so to see democrats now at least the the ones who are getting all the airtime goes so far left it really I think makes me believe that the people who are in charge of these campaigns and debates like they're looking at who gets the most retweets who gets the most attention from the media and they're saying oh that's good let's play off of that but that doesn't necessarily mean that's what the average everyday person is is going to want to hear from their candidates I thank goodness for that yeah because if if everybody was like how twitter is like there would be civil war actually wouldn't be just something we're talking about like oh maybe it'll happen you know no it would absolutely happen and actually um Tim Poole he reports on this a lot and we have an article that references that but the people that we see on twitter the most that I think these politicians are taking cues from they they really are the fringe people we have this article from the Washington Post um who says that which says that people who consume news news media most of the time are almost three times as an accurate in their understanding of others views as those who consume news only now and then the study found so things like these people who are all plugged into the news watching everything CNN says they literally will think that Trump is like a racist and I mean I think the same can be said for me I I watch these CNN debates and it makes me think that every Democrat like you're okay you're literally a socialist but I know that like that's that's not true there are tons of Democrats who just maybe want them bit of a more robust safety net but they're not actually free health care for illegal immigrants yeah absolutely I think if you sat down and talk with 95 percent of people of the opposing political party you would agree on 95 percent of things and it's about that other five 10 percent of issues that you actually talk about yeah and uh the Washington Post article also continues that heavy social media use has the same negative effect on viewpoint accuracy and they're referring to how accurately you can define the other side's views the perception gap is about 10 percentage points higher for those who have shared political content on social media in the past year than those who haven't this isn't much of a shock consider for example that only about 22 percent of us adults are on Twitter and 80 percent of tweets come from just 10 percent of users I think I used to be part of that 10 percent but I've cut back a lot lately I'm in the bottom 1 percent I haven't sent out a real tweet yet now you're just one of those like lurkers who just scroll but you don't really scroll I go on Twitter like twice a week yeah but still basically tweet if you rely on Twitter for political information you are being informed by uh earth that's pundits and I don't know if I'm saying that right and propaganda bots residing within 2.2 percent of the politician oh sorry of the population politicians especially presidential candidates these days make the problem worse they play to stereotypes by saying or tweeting radical things to fire up fringe view supporters who are numerically small but powerful in primaries or they tell their supporters that the other side is all a bunch of extremist kooks and I think that's exactly what we're seeing right now and uh it's it's unfortunate for I think those moderate democrats people who you know are listening to Ryan or Delaney or Bullock and thinking yeah okay great someone who's gonna draw in the craziness yeah but you know these loud minorities they're gonna make it so that the party the candidates don't hear them and primary voters are a lot more likely I think to be on that fringe because who votes in primaries got it really care about this more likely to be a little bit on the borders so this was interesting it was uh fun to to watch Marianne Williamson in my opinion one I look forward to if if it would happen her talking to Trump it'd be a whole lot of crazy on one stage it'd be great um but I think that's all we have to say for now if you are watching this live then please stay on the stream because we are going to be back in just a few seconds with some exclusive Q&A but aside from that thank you guys so much for tuning in and we will see you next time."
