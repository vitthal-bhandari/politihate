We are getting The the the confusing part of this story is we know who they are we know where it started We know why it started it's a it's a Marxists group that were protesting the fact that their president had been You know ousted and and kicked out And so they've been trying to make all of these statements in the press and and get some attention And then somehow or another This party this group that is connected to Maduro and Castro Decide they want to come to America Why why now what are they looking for? and You're moving now 7200 people flagged with the Honduras flag at the front That's an invasion and I don't know about anybody else, but when we've invaded let's say Iraq I remember we couldn't go in right away because we needed to stage supplies How is how is it that this isn't a death march? They are now if they if they walk They are now With driving occasionally they are now 20 hours away from Mexico City I don't know about you, but we're in Texas. You have to fly to Mexico City. That's still a long way away How is this not a death march? How are you marching into a town and what you're stopping at the 7-11 so we can all get water? Where's the water coming from? Where are you going to the bathroom? Where's the food? Who's paying for the trucks that they all seem to get into and what the to me the story is? Why isn't the American press interested in this? How can this be? going this long and We don't know yet. The blaze just the blaze just committed to To hiring some people to go in and investigate It's finding out what could you say death mark? I mean because they logistically it would be impossible to pull off and you couldn't plan These these are death marches you don't you don't go from one place to another Without logistics without water and everything else people just die on the side of the road People can be healthy when they leave, but you're walking 2,500 miles yeah, and that's where I think I mean you want to talk about where the press should be picking up I get since they they're going to cover it from the angle of the left So where is this humanitarian piece? They're so concerned about these people. I just it's fascinating It's almost like they're they they want to cover one piece of it You know one eighth of the whole story not the humanitarian piece of it not the border security piece of it not the Legal I mean nothing but somehow the mission and but yet we don't know what the mission is right well They do they do yeah, they say they just want to come here for a job. That's not what they're marching for right at least not what they left Honduras no when I say they I mean the media that's what they want to cut they've defined that this is some kind of Crucet cause celeb that we all must be in support of but they want to cover nothing else of it in terms of the logistics the humanitarian piece of it The legal piece of this the border security piece to nothing else and they're also a signing a motive to the people We don't know what the motive is for the people. They're just designing it. They're not coming here for Sanctuary yeah as far as the media's mission goes and I don't know that there's anyone in America who would understand this better This is all about taking down done all about going after Donald Trump right like this is just a way for them to make The president and the Republican Party look mean yes all these people who are starving and they're trying to sacrifice for some Well better life and all he could do is say really nasty things about well The funny thing is they've assailed the president for talking about how that there could be some quote terrorists or bad people as part of the 7200 which you know seems somewhat interesting that the odds are pretty good than any group of 7200 But but nonetheless they've assailed his motives and the idea that he's describing this but yet They are a hundred percent right that all of these people are coming seeking asylum Have lived horrible lives that we know nothing about them And that's what we should be saying We know nothing as opposed to the media's view is we we have assigned all of these attributes to them And we are going to say that anybody who doubts that clearly doesn't know what's going on But we do so the governor of Texas Greg Abbott talked to him this morning He said I can't give you all the details, but I can tell you this there are members in leadership of MS 13 Okay, now what's MS 13? We know it's violent gang We know it's a gang that participates in gang rape now somehow or another It's wrong for me to say that these people have in their midst people who are gang rapists But with absolutely no proof I can call Kevin all that and it's perfectly fine It's amazing. I'd be interested to hear your opinion on this because we were talking about this on the air today and this let's say this goes as planned and these people Get to the border right so they get to the border because there was some talk with Greg Abbott as well that Mexico's trying to step in Maybe they're going to create some sort of humanitarian situation in Mexico So this doesn't get to that point where these guys just 7200 people at the border and there's this big conflict We we were talking about this earlier I don't know how you can manage this from a media perspective because They are going to the media is going to show all these people in the best light possible and our border guards and our national guard in the worst light possible if there is an incident God forbid where they have to use tear gas or Whatever it is it's going to look like a horrible riot that we cause I said this when I was at Fox The tactics that are being used with Israel and the Palestinians Code pink and everybody else is over there. They're going to use those same tactics on our border Well here it is. That's what it would look like. How do you message that if when they're showing those images? Oh I think it's not a question of messaging because doesn't matter what they say I mean the press is going to report it one way I think part of it is they need to go back to what Glenn saying a little bit Which is adopt their tactics talk about the humanity of this talk about the crisis and the logistics of the war You've got to fight kind with kind right? So they've got to start talking about how we're concerned about their well-being We've got to have protect our safety of our suit But argued from humanitarian safety on both sides of the border We've got to protect our border for the safety and security of our people And we've got to make sure that their safety and security is protected on their side and look at it from that same point because any other Way you're going to lose. It's just a question of it by how much do you think the average American would look at this even with the media spin and say It's ludicrous that we should just allow you know 75 This is where you know Glenn and I talked about this earlier Which is that the media I think in the case of Kavanaugh missed the boat here They overplayed their hand. I think they're doing the same here They think that somehow that most Americans are sympathetic and while we might be sympathetic as human beings to other people that are in economic plight or seeking refugee status because for political reasons or whatever that's That's different than 70 200 people rushing your border even if Honduras was being shelled and These people were leaving because they were marked for death and it was a war zone and They came to our border. I think Americans would say wait a minute. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. This is a different story Yes, let's let them in. Let's put them in a you know area None of that's happening these people just appeared We only know that they are mad because their Marxist dictator was thrown out Who are these people? What do they want? Why are they they're not they're not singing American songs and oh help us America? They're burning American. That's right. I mean that these aren't people coming to our country Like so many people from around the world because they want a better life. They're coming here to instill their values They they are not happy with us. I mean this it's amazing to me the way it's being covered because they are not here for Peaceful purposes not here because they want to be Americans and assimilate or you know Describe to the values in this country. They're here as a sign of protest almost its opposite. It's it's quite So when you look at this on and you see the president Honestly, you know where I stood on the president before because I didn't think he would actually do any of these things This guy is dirt strong on a lot of stuff Do you see him if if Mexico doesn't stop if they don't stop them before they get to the border Do you see him? willing to and and able to say something like No aid and I mean it it's I turn off the valve tomorrow. Yes stop this or I turn it off I don't even think it's a question. It's a hundred percent He's gonna have the military down on that board. He did but we can't let them get no no But I think that he is going to use every tool in the tool wall He will have the military down there. He will turn off all aid He will impose sanctions against Mexico. I mean this is not I think the one thing that Whether your supporter or detractor of this president do not test him. Yes And and I think that the idea that somehow he's gonna turn around and look at Mexican say I know you tried but you know I get it you try he he will hold them accountable He's given them fair warning. I actually felt it when he said do not test it I actually like that was really from the heart of you Watching you're only listening Clothes his eyes like a prayer Can I ask you this question? I really when I've had this theory for a while If the press would ignore him it would drive him nuts And if you wanted the president to do something you walk into as often say you know what Don the thing you should never do Is this and there's something inside of him that would go oh, I want to do that It depends on what it is But I think there's a little element of truth in both of those things I think the more you ignore him the more he would because you know he there's no question He relishes and being in the center of it. That's why he loves the rallies But you know he's a showman I mean I don't know that should come as a surprise And also I think that you're right. I mean the more you back do you never do the following? I'll touch this Alright before we get to all of this midterm talk let's take a break we'll be back All right, so I have Glenn back is coming live to talk about the right path forward and to make fun of the people standing in the way He might not be able to save the country But at least we can all go down laughing Glenn back live the addicted to outrage tour on tour this fall Before we get into a midterm pop pop want to thank our sponsor I target pro I have I target pro on the way. I'm so excited to try it. It's the best. It's really cool. Yes What it is Well, I'm a shooter are you shooter I? 19 years in the military so I've shot sure yeah a couple here there So you know trigger that you know the trigger pull that is you know trigger control is the most important thing and everybody was like dry fire Dry fire. I hate it Because I like to see what I'm actually doing so I target pro you put it It's like a little laser thing that you put inside as the bullet Your racket and you shoot at a thing cross the you know across the room yeah, here it is and you shoot it across the room and It will it registers right there on your iPhone so it's amazing and it's the best way you're not blowing through a whole bunch of ammunition You don't have to leave the comfort of your house You don't have to wear ear protection and you can do it in your living room and it scares your daughter's dates I Mean 10% right now with offer code news just go to I target pro calm save 10% with offer code news All right I want to get into the midterm talk and let's start with you Sean And I think that that will kind of be an easy transition over to to stews point so midterms are coming up 14 days Yes, but who's counting? Yeah, right? So what are you thinking? I? Think that this blue wave you've started to see this in the last 48 hours Everybody's now backpedaling in the media saying well it may not be as big as you want Paul came out today I'd camp down 19 points in Indiana North Dakota rather Indiana Donnelies now down for I think Race after race Missouri with McCouskell versus Holly over and over again these races continue to tighten Watching them post it a story today that shows that the house has the same thing and Pelosi goes out yesterday It says well, I've never used the phrase blue wave and she is calling for a blue son Right she never said blue And I think you're seeing this backpedaling as we get into these final days the election gets galvanized for a lot of reasons which you know we can go into but People are now realizing in a way that I don't think I've seen in my adult life The importance of these midterms and maintaining the policies and results that have happened over the past one so I think For me personally, I mean, you know before Kavanaugh. I wasn't like patty. You know I live in Texas Oh, you know what I mean? I right vote isn't that member that Beto O'Rourke cruise race? It's gonna be a nail-biter Yeah, right right right right up there with Wendy Davis. I never I never bought into that But anyway, so I was you know I would always go out and vote but I'm not I wasn't passionate There is nothing that would stop me from voting now and I actually have gotten to The point for the very first time I'm so sick of here. It's the most important election of your life shut up this time This time for the first time I'm actually feeling Because the masks have come off we know who they are they're saying end of capitalism End of all of this stuff end of you know innocent until proven guilty This is if this is a blue wave this could be a game changer that alters the course of the country forever I don't think there's any question about it They've laid their cards on the table They've talked about what they're gonna do and what they're not going to do right They want to repeal the tax cuts they want to a lot of them want to impeach the president They want to impeach Kavanaugh they want to have endless investigations I've joked before that C stands gonna need a fourth channel You're all you're gonna do is talk about investigations I mean that to them. They're not gonna name post offices and that's I mean Pelosi cannot there is nothing that she could agree to work With Trump on because she can't heading into 2020 they cannot give the president a win They cannot not because a good or bad But they cannot allow him the talking point of saying I work with the Democrats on X Do you think if the Democrats would have played this differently and not protested on the first weekend and Everybody would have just said Let's just see what he does. He's president now. He's all of our presidents All of our president let's let's just watch him see what he does If they would have played it differently Do you think Donald Trump could have been approached on certain issues by the left and Said you know what I'm gonna give I kind of agree with him on this one I'm gonna give him this and now they've overplayed it I wouldn't I wouldn't say that he would have given them anything I think he would have worked with them on things I think on tax reform in particular you could have picked up a mansion a donna Lee There's a couple of folks that you could have gotten on tax reform in particular I don't I'm one of the people that thinks that the infrastructure idea was a fool's errand to begin with for a variety of philosophical Issues never was going anywhere you had Beneath the surface too many problems, but I do think that there are a couple areas where they probably could have found some common ground now There's no way there's nothing literally you can't name a post office They will disagree on the name and the font and the color and and that's just I mean there's nothing that they can agree on I think the problem is Even Pelosi Understands pragmatically where they need to be governing wise the problem is is that they're base the vocal minority of their base Keeps dragging them so far to the left that they kind of have to keep Fumbling past each other to outdo each other to prove who's the most pure and that's the biggest problem that we have right now for the Democrats Is that the they have been the biggest helpers to the Republican Party Oh big because by going so far the left and trying to appease this this mob Which is what it really is they've lost the ability to talk about things on the Sun. I know They've they've for most pragmatic Traditional Democrats they feel like the party is so far left them. I Actually think you might have a turnout problem. You're talking about it with the Latino community now I think the Democrats is ironic as this may sound may actually lose the enthusiasm gap by a big margin heading into the Into the midterms because a lot of these folks are saying wow they they've now exposed to they really are this isn't about fighting for workers Rights or environmental causes that we've cared about for so long. This is about impeachment and investigations I don't know that I bought in on that if you're a traditional Democrat And I think that they look at the Republicans who have been focused on a pretty pragmatic agenda of economic growth low unemployment Deragulate tearing down the deregulatory state and they're you know, I'm not sure I'm a Republican But I kind of agree with that agenda. So when the dust settles how many Republican senators are there 55 55 Yeah, and you I think if you call me and go hi you are wrong. That's 56 Okay, but I think that the way it's going now. We got a 51 49 majority again I actually think Florida is gonna go Republican Nelson Governor Scott's gonna beat incumbent senator Nelson. I think there's no question in Indiana and North Dakota in the bag and then I think I mean North Points yeah, but in that lead but Indiana there's another story. I mean that's oh I think Indiana I it's up for but it's true look I've been in politics a long time the trend is what matters if you're fighting back if you've got the lead and it's coming over you That's not good right now when you look at Indiana It's continuing to move in the right direction. Donally keeps fading further and further back You don't pick up that momentum going and you don't reverse the trend in the last 14 days It just doesn't happen unless there's some kind of intervening Incident or allegation that changes the tide but that's a dramatic You know sea change that doesn't just occur so and then I think you look at Missouri with McCaskill I don't think I think mansions probably the safest of them all but you again you look at Morrissey in the last couple days He's gotten that thing down close. It's gonna be a question Is there enough time on the clock for Morrissey to come over but mansion should have been a lot safer these all of the four pickups The Democrats wanted Nevada. I think we keep that Heller continues to trend right Tennessee Marsha Blackburn's basically put this thing in the bag She's just outside the margin error, but that's been a big sea change in Arizona Mix out. I mean good Canada I was a good candidate in cinema has literally said as many insulting things that you could possibly say She's called them Lindsay Lohan. She's called them crazy. She's insulted single women. There's not a group She's I mean that she hasn't found a way to insult that one's out of the bag and then Texas Which was where all the networks have sent correspondence down here talking about how this is gonna be the watershed a moment And this is where politics is gonna change. I think Cruz wins well over ten points well over It well over and then the media so Desperately wanted this to be the race So we hold the four targets in the Senate that they thought they were gonna pick up and then I think we pick up between 30 and five races What do you think happens in the house in the house? I'm a little bit more concerned I think we can keep it but it's gonna be a one two or three seat majority But again the thing that's so fascinating there you look at Andy Barr and Kentucky look at Barbara Comstock Virginia 10th district All the races that they thought they had in the bag are continuing to trend back to the Republican side The latest internal poll has Barbara up one Andy Barr now outside the margin of error Minnesota sex is Trending away. That's a pickup for the Republicans not a hold I think Pennsylvania and California are two areas to concern me as far as where Republicans are Holding back the damn water And that's just a function of in California It's just a question of demographics in Pennsylvania. You had the state Supreme Court Not just we know that redistricting is what happened every decentennial where they mean this is a state Supreme Court intervening Yes, that's a vastly different dynamic than has occurred normally and constitutionally But there that's you know, there's only so much you can fight back against but still you're optimistic because I mean, yeah They say I am optimistic and I it's I think the history and the numbers are still against us You have 44 Members of the House of Representatives on the Republicans that retiring history is what it is the Democrats are spending a tremendous amount But I'm glad I'm happy where the trend is right now And it may not be pretty and we may not know on election night But I think we come out with one or two seat majority So can I ask you I know we have to come we have to break when we come back can I ask you? What does it mean to have a Democratic House? What does the next 12 to 24 months go to break And because I can't come up Up next enjoy bonus overtime content from the news and why matters Available exclusively for podcast listeners and blaze premium subscribers become a premium subscriber at the blaze.com slash subscribe before we get into everything we get into everything loopy down Want to thank our sponsor for overtime skin kick I talked about this yesterday I'm so excited that I finally get to talk about skin kick on air I've been using it for about six months and they've got a facial a daily facial cleanser They've got a blemish relief cream for any kind of annoying little blemishes that pop up and they have my favorite The anti-aging glow renewal serum because unfortunately, I've just reached that age where I was gonna tell you you were low on glow recently You were glad you started using this I've renewed my yes, I've renewed my glow I look in the mirror in the morning.

Here we go all right, so They take the house Which let's that's hypothetical hypothetical but you know pretty okay shot Here's what I see happening They subpoena trumps Is his tax records right away? They can't not impeach him because all of the left they've promised we were gonna impeach So let's say on the first day. They're just going for the tax records. They're not gonna actually impeach yet Trump says no Second day they go to the Supreme Court But they say we need a ruling on this does he have to do it, but Kavanagh's got to recuse himself He says no, so now they're going to impeach Kavanagh Then they come back he's got to produce these tax records. We're going to impeach him on that So now we have two impeachments going at the same time. We have the Supreme Court up in arms We have the house up in arms who we have the administration up in arms Everybody suing each other everybody's fighting against each other Then you have the media picking sides media is You're gonna see more and more From Facebook and and Twitter and Google censoring people it's gonna get worse and worse You got that all stirring people up and you have the people fighting at each other Sounds like a great two years where I think if we can get that down to like 30 seconds That's the trailer for the next NBC Coming this fall Am I wrong? I just don't know. It's gonna get picked up I think that look I think they're gonna do some if if and I'm still not Conceiving that to be clear on the house, but I think that The tax records there's no question about I'll give you that one I think they have hearings of some sort. Here's the issue as much as I Have a disagreement with with Pelosi and her politics and her policy She is true enough to understand if they jump the shark on Trump and impeachment They they could cost themselves any shot at the White House in 2020. I just I I think the impeachment talk is by their younger progressive Members, I don't see water. I get it But there's plenty of time Glenn you knows what I do how many Republicans have talked about things until they and so it's one thing to talk in Fear to that I get it revolutionaries are not but they're not The people that still control the the levers of the house are the Pelosi Clyburn's hoyers who are gonna say guys if we go over the top and maybe they throw them some crumbs and they get a hearing or two or Some kind of motion to recommit on the second question of the I mean right some way of pacifying them But they're not politically in some ways Republicans would benefit the more nuts they go But and they know that and that's the thing that I think is there They're sort of firewall that the old guard leadership says we need to take back the White House This will cost them that and they know it Because as much as people may disagree with the president or his policies or his style and left There's enough of them in that group that say constitutionally we fight this out of elections We don't impeach our enemies And there's I mean you'd have to make up the grounds so I Think they'll be talk. I think there might be hearing I Agree with you on the tax records and where I would take this one step further is they will subpoena Everybody and that's where I think that they will sort of try to placate their base and their progress is to say hold on We've just issued forty seven hundred particular subpoenas and until we have those hearings we can and they'll keep trying to buy By time with their base gonna say we have all these hearings we've issued this many subpoenas We're having this investigation and I'm not kidding They will just tie everybody up and knots which I still think is a big deal Yeah, and I think people have to understand that Because that is the agenda The agenda is to figure out on the left how to show that they are the the resistance on television Okay, well last question on this. Let's go the other way. Let's say they win Oh that the Republicans win the house. Okay, everything's great do the Democrats Go even more insane. Yes and double down on their democratic When you're in the minority you can do things like that And and that's that's the beauty of the minority is that you can say or do what you want because there's no accountability won't that hurt them because what they're growing now is more and more radical and All of the people that are starting to come out are I think scaring the average Democrat, right? What does that mean for 2020? The problem is is that I think that the as I mentioned on the previous question the the old guard gets it Right, but the problem is that when you're not in the majority and there's no sense of owning the governing Results that you're having to you can you can do this and so they get dragged away to the left because they're members Say what do you have to lose? Let us have this vote? Let us have the hearing let us have whatever because there's no accountability when you're in the minority So I think that they will continue to get dragged to the left They will say crazier and crazier and more progressive things because they can and The leadership in order to stay in power and let's be clear Nancy Pelosi will be their leader, right? But it'll be tenuous at best and she will make a deal She's now calling it a transformational Whatever that means which is you know a dog whistle to say Please let me give me one more time because I've got cool stuff hanging in the office and I don't want to take it down Yeah, I mean that's like just give me some time to wind this all down so she's kind of sending them the dog whistle that please just let me have two more years and and at that point She's gonna be willing to let them do whatever they need to do for her to stay in power for two more years I gotta say after hearing all this I think they should just hold the house the Republicans should just hold the house as much easier They should just hold the house. Why deal with this? Just stay just stay in the majority. It's much easier I don't know if the Republicans have thought of that. I don't know I don't know I think it's a good idea Right, is he off the hot seat now? Yeah, might come up with another one Well, okay. Well for now we're talking about the midterms Want to talk about the effect that the Me Too movement has had on this It's kind of an interesting one and it's you know off the beaten path of the House and the Senate But Keith Ellison who is a guy we all know who Keith Ellison is And you know he's running in Minnesota for Attorney General This is going to be an easy win for him Then he has this situation where his ex-girlfriend comes out and accuses him of all these terrible things And just like Brett Kavanaugh just like everybody You know in America he deserves the presumption of innocence at least to me You know sometimes relationships break up and it gets ugly and people say things that aren't true We don't know. I don't know. I can't tell you there's a lot more evidence with this accusation than there was with Brett Kavanaugh And there's a lot more There was ongoing and things like you know you're not lying to your doctor and your doctor's not writing Hey, I'm treating for injuries. Yeah. Yeah, and so you know again He deserves the presumption of innocence But what's been interesting to me is to see the reaction from Democrats here where they're saying well we know Exactly. I mean we know Brett Kavanaugh's guilty. How can you possibly side with him? You're just accusing these horrible accusations and you don't care about women But by the way, we're going to completely ignore Keith Ellison who's currently running with a woman who is has evidence Who was we all know had a relationship? She's got texts. She's got notes from the doctors We're going to completely ignore that one. What's really interesting here is it doesn't seem like the people of Minnesota are ignoring it This is the September poll where Ellison led by five points Which is not really he should have been leading probably by a lot more than that in Minnesota you could argue However the update to this poll this is completely flipped now Now Ellison trails by seven since these accusations have come out and you know, I think people look at him They say there is some credibility here You know he was already not a great candidate He was already way more left than I think that people of Minnesota are and that's not a conservative state And you know that now that they're seeing that these accusations are out there the way he's handled it The way Democrats have reacted to it and I think Minnesota's stepping back understanding I don't think we want to go down this road Yeah, I mean I think there's two issues there one is the campaign he's running and the way that people of Minnesota are viewing Which I think you're absolutely right on but the second one and I think it's more important is the first point you made which is Unbelievable the hypocrisy the way the left views his case and his situation in the allegations against him I agree with you wholeheartedly and that's to me the fascinating difference in the dynamic that exists right now The right most of us in this table say he deserves the presumption of innocence The left would say in the left in this case because it's a Democrat kind of just they don't necessarily say anything They just say nothing whereas if it's the Republican they go, you know, let's crucify crucify You know, it's interesting too is To me this one is more important than even Kavanaugh they made a big deal about Kavanaugh He's gonna be on the he's gonna be on the Supreme Court He sees gonna be you know, but he's not gonna be making you know rulings on things Those are big scope ideas not your guilty your innocent still one of nine yeah, and still one of nine He's the attorney general So he's going to be directing the police force he's gonna be directing The law in in Minnesota That That should scare the hell out of you if this guy is guilty You don't want to put a guy like that Into a position where you're the chief law enforcement officer. That's not that's that's not wise Well, let's remember beyond running for being a current congressman running for attorney general of Minnesota He is still to this day the deputy chairman of the Democratic Party Correct, I mean that which I think it's lost in the discussion because rightly so we talk about the current office He wants and the one he hopes to and aspires to have but look this is their party Mmm, this is the number two person in their elected party leadership They say this is and oh by the way forget all of this We're gonna talk about this importance of me too of women's rights a bag of accusers all of this stuff And yet no one seems to care from the media standpoint from the Democratic standpoint Where is the calls for him to resign? Where are all the folks in Hollywood? They're outraged that stood around those Kavanaugh hearings talked about saying you need to resign Where's the outrage? Yeah, not there. Yeah Glen we have a there's a gin problem right here. Oh, this is bad No, this is bad. This is bad. Do we have the videotape? Okay. I want you to watch this and please Please this has happened to me and it could happen in your house Watch Then don't forget that there are other creations besides men There are men who are going to look at you But at the same time a gin may fall in love with you And this is something very very common I had a case where a gin had possessed a sister She was waiting at the bus stop and the gin fell in love with her She was walking through a park and the gin followed her She was waiting at the bus stop and the gin fell in love with her and it actually possessed her And when they fall in love they're very very difficult to remove Because their love is like almost a blind type of love It's like I would rather die than leave this individual Well, Jin's, Jin's, genie's, you know, things like that Now, nope, don't actually know that now So, look, I believe in a faith where the guy was crucified and rose from the dead Okay, so we all, if you're not in the religion it can sound crazy Okay, I got to I tweeted this this morning and said I've had this problem, I've come home after a long day of work And I've had to chase the gin out of my wife, you know Which can we just say really quickly, this is, he's stating this as a case for why women should wear hijabs Hijabs, yes, and he says It's the hijabless woman That is most susceptible to the gin Because the gin will fall in love and go right straight to your brain So the hijab is the protection Well, he also calls it a cloth device So it can go through your skull, your hair, your skin, into your brain But not cloth Okay, again, we all believe crazy things in our religion But what's the craziest is Come on, if this was, if my faith had come out and said And I got to tell you, there was a woman at the bus stop And an angel came down and fell in love with her And she wasn't wearing the, you know, the special hat And now she's possessed by an angel, we would all say And chances are Pat Robertson said that the media would have been listening to her The media would have been crazy, crazy Here we are at a time when we have I do not, whatever you want to believe, you believe That's fine, I have no problem with it But here is a misogynistic Sharia law is misogynistic and bad It's bad The way you can treat women under Sharia law is bad We have all these people in the country that just excuse that Well, look at that, oh look at that, oh look at that That's not bad, that's not crazy And yet, they think all Christians are dangerous and crazy Because what we believe in angels This guy thinks a gin can get into your wife's head at the bus stop The lesson is don't, don't, don't write buses No, it's supposed to be wrap yourself up Keep your keeper clock devices Wrap yourself up because it took a different lesson I had a disagreement, that's all, I don't want to write a bus Anti-bus And I don't know how you get the gin out of you I know how you get the gin in you I thought that's what the second started I was actually excited that we were going in a different drag Sorry to disappoint Yeah Glenn, I have poll results for you from yesterday Oh, thank you, I did So the question was, do you support the Trump administration's plans to use the scientific definition of gender When it comes to federal programs? Can we guess? Yes This audience? Yes 90% 96 Yeah, I could just go ahead Just write rules and regular rules Regular rules I'm going 92 Okay Do you write on the money, 96% Yes It is the definition, 4% Let's ask you, this is an honest question We have a doctor on tomorrow that's going to ask this question Stu and I were having an argument today And I actually responded, well I know three weeks ago it was this But it might have changed, okay? The gender and sex Gender is now, they're saying, is all up in your head Okay, even the New York Times According to New York Times, it's nothing to do with it All up in your head And sex is your body parts I gotta be honest with you, I just learned something then I did not, I wondered about that when I heard it yesterday, which is I understand how you can identify or how people, okay, I get that But I didn't think there was a real controversy over birth No, that's our question Because it says, in the definition, your sex assigned at birth Well nobody's assigning it, it's... No, no, that's what I'm saying, like I didn't realize, and maybe I just haven't been busy But I didn't realize it For sex is misogynistic, if you think it is Thank you I just, I didn't realize that that was actually where the debate was I mean I thought you were, and it was like, okay, you, this is a male, this is a female Yeah, that was an amazing story And they just choose to identify later on as something else is what you're saying That's what I understood to be able to do That's what I understood to be And then I saw these reports yesterday I will get into this tomorrow, because I mean the Times seems to make the argument that really that's, it's, gender is something that is just a thought in your head And like that is a... To me, like, that is, I'm not leaving arguing Like that's not a notable idea I do realize it was an argument Yeah, I mean I... Right, but, but, but conservatives have been saying, yeah, okay, you're born this sex, okay? And you want to say gender is fluid Well, I don't agree with you that you can just decide But if you want to decide you're a woman, okay, but that doesn't change who you are, you're sex It doesn't change you physically, it might change you here Well, that's what the New York Times is saying today And we're like, wait, that's our argument So how is this... it's come around now to where the... yes, I agree with that And it used to be called gender dysphoria And it was a bad thing, just like, just like, um, you know, anorexia Gender dysphoria, you're 60 pounds, but you look in the mirror and you see a fat person Well, fundamentally, like, this goes back to the potential decision of using, on government forms, right? Like, are you going to use the sex you were born as? Or is it going to be what you are defined as now? But like, the reason we ask on government forms isn't to ask you about your feeling, right? Like, there are reasons why, like, for example, an insurance form, right? Like, you want to know if it's a male or female, they're covered for different things And I don't mean to... like, I'm not trying to open up a can of worms, but I don't understand when it stops Right, so, like, we have... you... with race, you can't... like, we have this discussion all the time People get caught making up a race or... or... they're heritage of some sort Can you think of any examples that I have anything off the top of your head? I have to Google this, okay, alright But I don't... that's where I just don't understand, like, I think there's such a disconnect Which is at some point, if you just want to say that at x age you get to redefine yourself I mean, that's... right, okay? But... why... what else is now subjective to deciding what you decide you are? So, like, if you are a different gender, if you're a different ethnicity, where's that line? And then why does it matter? If I can be white, black, you know, whatever, why does it matter? When you worship at the end? Well, that's what I'm saying, is it like... that's what I don't understand, because at some point the left wants to have all these discussions about ethnicity and talk about, okay, and then... and yet, when it comes to sex, they go, yeah, but that doesn't matter, so, okay, well, why does this matter and that not? It comes down to identity politics, right? No, that's actually... but that's the point, is that it's only the identities that they want to be. It's postmodernism. And postmodernism, when you understand postmodernism and intersectionality and the hierarchy, all it is is turning the whole pyramid upside down. So, the most oppressed, the ones who have been intersected the most by people of power, I'm a female in a wheelchair, and I'm a native American. And a Browns fan. And a Browns fan, okay? You're at the top of the pyramid now, where before in the traditional hierarchy, you're at the bottom, okay? That's the way they look at it. So, anything that... Anything that will turn that system upside down is good. So, you, if you're a white man and you happen to believe that the pyramid needs to be turned upside down, you can say, you know what I identify as black. And they'll say... Bill Clinton, our first black president. What? Okay? Okay? Because he's part of the turning it around. The minute you violate any of their goals of turning this upside down and inside out, you're no longer part of the crew. You're down at the bottom again. Lots of introspection going on here at the Blaze today. Today's poll question, how concerned are you with about the approaching caravan of immigrants? We've got several different choices. Let us know on the Blaze's Twitter that is at the Blaze. Sean, before we go, you came out with a book several months ago. Can you tell everyone about it? Just in case I haven't picked the book. Yeah, thank you. If you go to SeanSpicer.com, you can order it. You can find out where it's available or see anything. It's called the briefing, politics, the press, and the president. It's a... I think there's two pieces to it. One, it's a little bit of who I am beyond the podium, the character. And the second is just... Wait, that was Melissa McCarthy's view? Wasn't you? You can't let it go. You're like, oh, you've got to get me for as long as I'm here. And the second is just sort of the behind the scenes of the campaign, the transition, the first six, seven months of the White House. A little bit of behind the scenes as to what really was going on and why certain things happened the way they did. I will tell you this. And I'll say this, you know, I don't want to say things behind people's backs, so I'll say it to your face. I wasn't sure we even wanted you as a guest the first time because I thought, thank you. What are you going to say? No, no, no, seriously, on radio. What are you going to say? Read the book, really honest, and soul searching, soul searching. Had him on the... So I said, yes, let's put him on the air. Put him on the air. He was even better. We just did 90 minutes of world's largest, longest interview. Yeah. And again, just really thoughtful with a lot to say. It's a great book. You should do it. Donspicer.com. Yes, thank you. Thank you so much. You bet. Thanks for having me and welcome. Yes, absolutely. And we will see you guys tomorrow. Oh my gosh, look, it's Melissa McCarthy. Was he welcoming to you? Is that what happened to us? Let him get that. That was a trigger of it. That was a trigger of it.
