    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show podcast welcome and everybody to the Tuesday edition of the clay Travis and Buck Sexton show we have a lot to get to with you today Obviously, we now know the identity and a whole lot more information about the Nashville school shooter from yesterday it was a transgender individual Pick the school out had a manifesto the manifesto has not been released At least I believe as we speak to you right this moment Although it could come out during the show and if so, we will read through it quickly to see But we have analysis on what happened there and also um on the Nashville metro police side of things body camera footage is out that shows from at least two officers Perspectives officers Rex Engelbert and Michael Kalatsu How they engage the target and they move to it right away heroic actions by Nashville police that Almost certainly saved lives in the process and did stop the threat and did bring this a horrific mass shooting in Nashville to a conclusion. We've also got the Discussion already underway about how to how to deal with this on the political side Joe Biden calling for an assault rifle ban. We heard that yesterday right at the end of our program uh, the primary focus of all the democrat aligned media is on guns, of course very little discussion about uh, the mental health issues the obvious mental health issues that were Involved here in this mass casualty uh domestic terror attack and I want to explain why this is a domestic terror attack by All of the definitions and and our expectations about how we discuss these things and how we how we analyze them And then we'll get into some politics. We we've got some other stories. We want to bring to your attention really interesting to see clay the Biden administration Uh trying to pose already from biden's twitter account Uh and and in other places tough on crime and trying to secure the border and actually calling out republicans for being Weak on those issues if you want to see how much of an inversion of reality They're willing to engage in when it comes to the 2024 election and how they're going to get people to vote for all right. Let's Um, we we went off area stray and a lot more information came out about the shooter. I want to get to that um second because first that the breaking news and it just came out in the last hour and a half or so is that uh Nashville metro police On a number of levels. I think here is showing you textbook execution uh of the You know what you should do in a uh Mass shooter incident like this And also textbook transparency, which is really important getting information out right away updating it right away You could really tell in that press conference. Yes or even when the chief of police came out That they were just telling everybody what they had and as they had new information. They told them new information This is really in many ways. It seems like the opposite of the You've all they police response, which was very confused Withholding and then we know in the end cowardly is what happened there This is the opposite of that these officers were heroes and we'll actually play some of the body camera footage and assess what happened here in a second Yeah, no doubt and I would encourage everybody out there listening to us right now To seek out the body camera footage. We're gonna play you some audio But I think you need to see it and and frankly I think you need to share it with people Maybe in your own lives who've been critical of police because we all know That every time a police officer makes a mistake the video goes viral of that body camera mistake of that uh of that incident This is a what appears to me to be a clinical Response by the Nashville police department from there's a six-minute video buck of the police officer pulling up Uh getting out opening up the trunk of his car unloading his rifle being informed by a Employee of the school. Hey, here's where we think the shooter is the kids are locked down Here's what you need to know and then to be able to follow both of the uh hero cops who who eventually brought down this killer To be able to follow them in real time and see as they are searching the school and attempting to find their way towards the shots to protect Those kids it's everything we didn't see in uvalda and I think every single police department in the country In the same way that they may have looked at uvalda and said we can never do this again They failed on so many different levels. They need to be using this nashville footage as tape of how to handle A school shooting buck from the moment they entered that school to the moment they took down that shooter Was a little bit over three minutes from the moment that one of the Police officers who took down the shooter literally pulled up in his car to taking down that shooter with six minutes For everybody out there who wants to micromanage attack and try to defund the police This is a clip that needs to be spread widely. It is violent It is graphic to some extent, but I think it's important for people to experience what the real life moments to moment life of a cop is like And I think when you watch that footage actually here, let's let's play We have the end of it the the moment where these officers you have to after remember They're going in they don't know who this person is in terms of the level of training and proficiency They don't know if this person has uh set up an ambush for them They don't know what the firing angles are they're walking into they don't know if this person has incendiary or explosive devices I mean, they're just going into a school shooting. They have very little information Every room that they walk into I mean for a lot of uh our folks listening who are former military You know, they know it was like clearing rooms in a rock clearing rooms in afghanistan going into these compounds in afghanistan Every room you walk into you could take an ak-47 round Well in this case every room they walked into these officers. They could have been they could have been mowed down by Barricaded shooter. So the fact that it came off the way that it did Um, they did this with precision Professionalism and courage and here is how the the final moment the confrontation with that shooter sounded play it I Stop moving stop moving What's left what's left? Just take down I want to say clay We have body camera footage from officers rex angelbert and michael colazzo who both took shots to take down the shooter In that footage there were other officers present there as well I was if we know their names will read them on air as well. I haven't I haven't seen the other officers named yet Um, we should we should pull them up because they took the same risks They were in that effectively. They didn't really move in a stack, but they were moving in the same uh cover formation and um, all those officers showed us exactly what cops are supposed to do what we Uh, praise them for doing and and what the expectations of the american people for their law enforcement are and I think for a lot of people this was Uh, you know, this was a lot of people in the law enforcement community and I can speak for them to the degree that they've told me this You know, they were all furious after you've all day Every law enforcement officer in the country can watch what happened here in national in terms of this response and say that's who we are And that's how we save lives I think they did better than social workers would have buck For everybody out there who tried to make this ridiculous argument to defund the police and that in moments of violence What we really needed to do was bring in social workers to talk to people who are contemplating issues of violence These guys are badasses and you I can't impress upon you enough How much I would encourage you to go watch the video you can hear the audio the the alarm going off in the background The default to training buck in a situation like this I it is as a as a layperson It is a flawlessly executed it appears to me six minute video That almost feels like it could be a training exercise Because they were so perfect in the way that they performed when you watch it and they're going room to room. They're communicating You know, you've got to remember these officers I mean their hearts are beating out of their chests Which affects their particularly fine motor skills, but you know everything you could hear that noise You could hear the situation they're going into it's chaotic there they blur them in the video There are bodies that you see some of the at least one or two of the individuals who were killed Civilians who were killed in this So they're seeing dead bodies. They know they've got an active shooter. It's very loud They have no idea where this shooter is they've got no intel on that at all And like I said every room they walk into they could be walking into you know They could be walking into rifle fire a close distance, which even with even with played veson I mean, you know, you're you're very likely not going to be able to make it through that Um, and they did it you could tell there was no hesitation. There was no. Oh, I don't know Maybe we should wait for even more backup Maybe we need an armored vehicle to come in here for us or something. I mean it was just we're going There are kids at risk. There are adults at risk. We are taking action right now to save lives and You know it They they did it very well and under the circumstances when you think back to what they were walking into Took takes tremendous bravery. Any one of those officers could have been killed in that situation that circumstance Honestly, all of them could have been and they moved like they were doing it to save other people's lives They all want to go home to their families at the end of the night You know people got to remember that that's kind of entering into their heads too They walk into that building. It's you know, I've got a wife and three kids at home or I've got a you know A wife and uh, you know a child on the way or whatever it may be And they know every room they walk into could be their last and they moved without hesitation I just want any critic of the police to watch this video And and and I would encourage and look we've been critical on this show I mean many of you out there critical of you've all day. I said it was cowardly and by the way, that was true It was the response and you've all they was cowardice And we said it and sometimes that upsets people when you when you say something like that But you've got to be honest And what I would say is if you are someone out there who is a critic of the police And you will share every single negative video involving a police officer I would encourage you to go watch that video The six-minute version of that video in particular where you'd literally see the officer pull up Uh and think about the circumstances that those guys are in buck because as you watch them have to go into these different classrooms In an active shooter situation And they don't know where the shooter is and they're trying to clear the rooms as they are working their way up They're trying to find their way to stairwells. They've never been a building before they have no real idea where they're headed And there are shots being fired and there's kids being killed There's innocent teachers being killed and they got there from the moment that they enter that school Until the shooter is down is a little over three minutes from the moment they pull up in their police cruiser To the moment that shooter is down is six minutes. It's almost impossible to do better now We come back. I do think it's worth having a discussion Not only about who the shooter was in their background everything else same conversation We had after you've all day buck. I've got three kids that were in national schools three different ones All of them have armed security guards in them Why can we give a hundred billion dollars to Ukraine and we can't protect every kid in a school in america? I think that's a reporting conversation The reporting is still out there that the shooter Shows this school instead of another school Because of the higher security at the other school now. I know that the shooter went to this school as a student But there was another school. I don't believe they've named with what the other school is I would assume that school probably had a resource officer I think every person in america who would ever consider going to a school needs to understand There's going to be an armed person there that they're going to have to get through because I think that could change in many ways The decision making there we'll talk about that and more as we continue to break it down Appreciate all of you hanging out with us and thanks to all the brave men and women of the Nashville police department And thanks to that police department for getting out that footage with which I think is going to go a long way Towards combating anti-cop sentiment in this country If you're a customer of Verizon t-mobile at and t don't fall for their free phone deals There's no such thing as a free without a hook attached like locking into a long-term contract It's going to cost you a fortune every month instead Looked up pure talk get a brand new iphone 12 from pure talk for just 12 bucks a month at 0% interest no contract You can cancel or leave at any time.

We roll through The Tuesday edition of the program always got to get the day right I'm up in washington dc by the way appreciate the heritage foundation hosting me here I'm speaking at an event tonight in dc be back in ashville tomorrow but buck I I drop off my kid At elementary school pretty much every day And when I do that there is a school resource officer that is an armed where I live Williamson county deputy who is assigned to the school that my kid goes to I have a middle school kid In Nashville. There's also an armed Officer there as well and there are armed security at my high schoolers school as well One of the lessons that I think we have to keep hammering home here and I don't see this as remotely partisan Every single school in america needs an armed security guard Every single one and that is important because when you have these lunatic wounds like this crazy transgender murderer She needs to or he needs to or whoever the people out there are thinking about doing this need to think Before I can get to those kids who are innocent and unprotected I'm going to have to go through a badass to get there and that person will probably wipe me out And buck there's got to be a lot of people out there even if it's not people who want to be police officers that are retired military That are you know in their late 30s early 40s that want to have a job like this I think it's important because again The kids in my school Learn to interact with police. They learn that they are there to help them that they are trustworthy I think it's an important lesson for every kid to learn But I don't understand why it isn't uniform everywhere every kid should have an armed security force inside of their school I mean think of this honestly from a from a budgetary perspective How many how many schools have and i'm not trying to make this a yeah a dei? Discussion or a cr Understand though, we were wasting a lot of money on education Yeah, you know additional administrators and people wonder what is the the the the growth in administrator Positions at schools across the nation is like seven times the growth of actual teachers. Yes So if we got a lot of we have all this money for administrators I do think you know security procedures. It makes it makes sense. I don't see You know, I wonder why you know the democrats are so some of them I will say this is where you can get some you can get some bipartisan Somewhat bipartisan, but to me this is an easy Non-political related fix that should occur everywhere to make this less likely We're gonna come back though. Talk about motive and the medius coverage of this in just a moment More small business owners than ever have benefited from applying for a tax refund with the IRS in their little-known program called the employee retention Credit or eRC not easy to apply for but the payoff is healthy if you qualify Go online to get refunds dot com to get started in less than eight minutes See if your business qualifies for eRC assistance Your business may be eligible for a payroll tax refund of up to twenty six thousand dollars per employee kept on payroll during covid 19 Get refunds dot com has already helped clients claim over three billion dollars in payroll tax refunds through the eRC Let's see if they may be able to help your business too. There is no upfront charge They don't get paid until your business gets its refund Look, there are businesses that think they won't qualify, but they actually do so you got to check it out for yourself Go to get refunds dot com that website again is get refunds dot com Welcome back to clay and buck and we're talking now about the Aftermath of the horrific shooting and of course our thoughts and prayers go out to the national community and and specifically the families of those who Lost their loved ones in this in this evil act of mass murder We've also been to bring you the most up-to-date information and and everything that is known at this point about this shooter Because if we're going to prevent things we have to understand these evil incidents and understand not only The security clay was just talking about arm guards in arm guards in schools Um and even just having one arm guard even just the prospect that a school shooter knows there may very well be there probably is somewhere on the premises in arm guard it could affect the calculation and make sure that schools are less Uh soft targets than they currently are I think that's a completely Realistic and and sensible approach and that's meant to save lives. It's not about politics It's not about who's going to win the next election Saving lives is the only impetus for uh putting more armed resource officers in in schools across the country and That so that's one component of this as well the response and we played it for you Um earlier we probably will come back to in the third hour of the program Response from Nashville police officers Um and if we find the other names team let me know but officers rex angle bert and michael kalatsu Their body camera footage already released textbook. I've had I've had former um former police Reaching out here by the way if you want to weigh in and you are uh former swadd or involved in in police on the uh or or military on the on the tactical room clearing side and you saw that video You want to add your analysis to it? Please do call in 800-282-282. I know we have swatt commanders who listen to this long time Swatt. We have green berry's and we got everybody delta seals. They all listen to this show Um, but i've already clay had people who are special operations and people who are the equivalent of special operations within the law enforcement community You know swatt it's called esu and the m ypd emergency services unit. They've said Very well done by these officers, um, obviously the outcome stopping the threat first and foremost But even just moving through the rooms the way they did this will be taught This will be video footage that law enforcement officers in training for situations like this will likely be seeing okay There's also the motive component of this. We don't have the manifesto yet. We know there is a manifesto We know the shooter is a biological female or a female who was living a life as a Man in so far as demanding he him pronouns and changed the name I changed the individual's name. Um interesting to see that news media was generally referring to Uh, this person as a she and then usa today. I'm sure some of you saw this started to get into oh We didn't mean to misgender the mass murderer Who is also and I want to be clear if any you know, it's amazing clay people You know when I tweeted this out yesterday, I sure this is a this is a trans domestic terrorist That is. Yeah, this is a person who is transgender who is almost certainly at this point acting out in part tied to The belief that either it's the christian school or the state of tennessee with the ban on surgeries There's clearly an ideological component of transgenderism that was at work here It is a trans domestic terrorist and it's amazing. See all these people coming out clay And they attack me either personally or my analysis Who are who are you to say such a thing? And I see here say I don't know five years in the cia counter terrorism center briefing the president twice about counter terrorism operations overseas and working for the NYPD intelligence division on counter terror like I think I know what a terrorist is And if you look at dillin roof And you look at some of the other mass shooting events the media immediately starts talking about domestic terrorism by the way, I don't disagree with that assessment But here you wouldn't even know that there could be an ideological component of what happened if you read most of the headlines And saw most of the coverage That's right and buck. I mean to take people behind the scenes What did I say off air? Almost as soon as some of these details started coming out I said that based on the elementary school being targeted based on this being a woman It seemed and being armed with three different guns Something wasn't adding up here, right? This wasn't some sort of domestic dispute I found it unlikely that it was going to be somebody's mom Who suddenly flipped out and went in with three different guns to try to murder kids I said almost immediately off the air because I didn't want to speculate on the air That given what the transgender temperature has been in the state of tennessee over this so-called gender affirming care being banned and also the The ridiculous Shows right these drag shows being banned for young children that there was a high temperature Particularly in Nashville over this and it didn't surprise me that it tipped out. Now. Here's the truth. Okay We should be if we had an honest media and an impartial media People would be asking the question Was this girl on transgender medications, right this killer testosterone hormones, etc Is there any study About what that can do to your behavior and the choices that you make? Individuals are responsible for the choices they make as we all know but Whenever one of these situations arises we have an immediate analysis, right? If this were a white guy who had voted for donald trump that had done this shooting in nashville This would be domestic terrorism Merrick garland would have already had you guys all know this merit garland would have already had a press conference He probably would have flown to nashville already and say white men trump supporters This is extension of january 6th domestic terrorism is the biggest threat Is joe biden going to get on a plane and come to nashville so far he hasn't i believe we have the audio in fact buck Of joe biden yesterday. We played this live on the air Because we were so confused that it was going on joe biden before he came out and actually addressed the kids that had been murdered in nashville Actually talked about how much he likes ice cream listen to cut 14 This is what was going on when joe biden came down and started addressing the white house and the crowd this aired live on fox news listen my name is joe biden i'm dr. joe biden's husband And ih in his ice cream chocolate chip I came down because i heard there was chocolate chip ice cream By the way, I have a whole refrigerator full upstairs. I think i'm kidding i'm not Okay super weird buck. I mean Look you and I this news was breaking yesterday Uh treat our audience with respect. Hey, here are the details. Here's what we know. Here's where we think this story is going Here's what you all need to know We didn't come on and say hey, let's make a joke about how much we like ice cream and then try to pivot in fact buck as you Well, no yesterday off air. We had conversations. It's hard to talk about anything else because this is such a emotional in the moment event that has just occurred The president can't come down and address what's going on in a sober and serious way He comes down and starts making jokes about ice cream And it's it's very strange Can i can i point out you know yesterday? I said right as this happened and they said it was it remember originally Into the law enforcement's credit here This this needs to be this there are a couple of standard setting aspects of what happened in the law enforcement response in national yesterday Obviously most importantly the stop the threat the officers on the scene ran in To the I mean there to the sound of the gunfire Or to the degree they could looking anywhere they could for whoever they could stop the threat But also the flow of information to the public. This is important people need to know When the information there's no reason for law enforcement to hold back on this stuff generally unless they're trying to do a secondary arrest They think there's a coke and spirit or anything else right there's a reason to to delay And what you generally see in a lot of in a lot of departments And you know the obviously the mayor or the governor's getting involved that this kind of an incident is the delay of facts being released in certain cases And the delay of facts depending on what the narrative may be and you start to hear this We may never know the motive The only time they say we may never know the motive of a terrorist attack Which is what this was or any mass casualty incident is when the perpetrator and the ideology involved Is something that the democrat left does not want to hear about Yesterday when they told us that there was a teenage it was a teenage girl who did the shooting They updated said a woman. What did we say right away? very rare very rare for there to be a female mass shooter not unprecedented but there are I think less you can count them on one hand for the last 30 or 40 years And then though the conversation becomes later on we found out this was a transgender individual Well, that recently is Less rare Um, you know when you look at for example the Colorado Springs shooting in 2022 Does anyone even remember this at this point think about how really go by your memory and what the media focuses on Do you remember that there were five people who were murdered in an lgbt lgbtq nightclub in Colorado Springs? You may vaguely remember this even though it was a horrific mass shooting event and clay it was the individual involved was trans And they claimed that he was not actually trans in the media and then made the story go away Because it didn't fit the narrative what we saw in Nashville was We'll see you in full, you know fully in the manifesto. It was clearly a domestic terrorist act It was ideological you could argue it was a hate crime as well those things are not mutually exclusive But the media is not talking about it like that at all The media is trying to make this story much of the media should say the democrat aligned media make it go away quickly In fact when we come back we'll play you a clip from cnn of a person saying I don't even know what we need to talk about it being a trans killer That's not the real story here. The guns are we'll play that for you when we come back I want to give you a word from our sponsor here chalk because if you go through the day wishing you had a little more energy and focus Let me tell you about one of our long time sponsors here chalk choc This texas based company makes natural supplements that give you that extra oomph you need without relying on additional cups of coffee or high Energy sugar drinks They also create bundles to help men and women with their unique needs For the guys there's something called the male vitality stack which replenishes testosterone levels a leading source of energy Studies show that three months of regular daily consumption will restore 20 of the missing testosterone levels for the ladies They have a female vitality stack which focuses on hormone health and stress relief Both bundles contain herbal ingredients each one carefully researched and all meant to provide natural energy infusions into your busy day You'll find these products and others at chalk calm that's c h o q dot com.

We've got several different people who want to weigh in uh beginning with george in mazuri george, what did you think of the video? What do you think of the nashville police department's response And I think the nashville police department did a great job. Hey, thanks for taking my call um The only problem is they're a little slow because they're 14 minutes away Uh, that's what I thought yesterday. That's what I said. I thought that yeah, it was 14 minutes problem would be the only two The neutralization of the threat. So what would you say as a former special forces guy? Do you like the idea of having armed security in every school? Does that make sense to you? Yeah, I briefed the lieutenant governor in north carolina um dan forest a few years ago when he was still the lieutenant governor On a plan to secure all the school And my number one priority was arm any of the faculty that wished to be trained in arms Which wouldn't cost that much money and and then Put signage up around the school saying hey, our our faculty is armed That would stop probably 90 of people coming in to shoot up that school And then I understand but sorry to cut you off. I understand that idea I think some people will say well if you put more guns in scum just playing devil's advocate here If you don't have people who are well trained with guns and they're around kids like could there be more incidents that arise of shootings But a trained security guard to me is a no brainer buck I understand people like if you're a former marine and you want to have a gun i'm fine with it But I don't know necessarily that I want your average teacher to sell it Let me add a couple things one is that there's a and john lot with more guns less crime and also his analysis on this is is the foremost Individual on the data. What does the data actually tell us and conceal carry permits for example? Bring down violent crime wherever they adopt conceal carry permits and they wonder well Why is that you would think there's more guns on the streets? Why would there be fewer violent crimes because it's not and this is like so I will say I'm in a member of my family is concealed carries all the time all the time. Okay, obviously legally Um down here in florida concealed carries and here we says he doesn't just conceal carry for him He concealed carries for everybody around him. Yeah, and also for anybody Out there who is thinking about doing bad things they got to know that there are good guys out there They have to take that calculation mind. So let's say you have 10 schools Not every school is going to want to have an arm resource officer fun. It should be a choice I don't think it should necessarily be a mandate for the school though Some people may disagree with that but if five of the schools have resource officers and two of the schools have Um somebody who is a concealed carry permit holder on the premises The bad guys, you know They have to assume they don't know who that is right? So the the concealed carry component of this added to the resource officer component Can create different calculations for somebody who would try to use this as a soft target effectively clay it's like If the guy if someone doesn't know if you have a gun or I have a gun but one of us has a gun Robbing either of us is a bad idea Yeah, by the way, I don't even think it's gonna be a school choice I think like states should individually mandate We're going to have arm security in every school My kids have it. I want every kid to have it in my state I want every kid in the nation to have it Something that I think is interesting concealed carry permit holders are Um By the numbers not just more law abiding than everyday folks They are more law abiding by per capita than law enforcement Think about that for a second. That's a great stat. Uh charlie in minnesota charlie. What do you think? I think uh, thank you for taking my call and I think national pd did exactly what they've been trained a long time And now retired firefighter and have participated in a lot of training with our law enforcement Brothers and sisters on this and when we and there's really two Programs that we train and have trained on they're called alert and three echo and both of those programs Teach officers to move and engage the shooter as quickly as possible and you saw that with their Uh switch when they were doing their room clearing searches, which were fantastic And then they switched to go to the gunshots and that's what uh, that's retained They're trying to do and they did a fantastic job and and also You saw them put the officer in the front with the uh lpvo you heard them call that out on the on the body cam and And made sure their precision marksman was in the lead and on point on interdicting the shooters. So It was it was a really Uh, it was a really good response from those officers and um, you know, you could see it for yourself So I didn't want any of everyone to know exactly what they went through I mean doing a a, you know, bounding overwatch frill In the past. I'm sure these officers had trained up on this It was good. It was the way way officers need to do it Anyway, um, we want to talk motive a little bit the politics of this biden calling for an assault rifle ban And then um, we've also got trump had a sit down with our french john hannity last night. We'll discuss that coming up"
