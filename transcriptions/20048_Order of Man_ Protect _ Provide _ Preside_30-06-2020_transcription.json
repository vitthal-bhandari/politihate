    "text": " If you didn't believe in the inherent value in masculinity, I don't think you'd be listening to this podcast, but you are. So I know that you believe in the message to reclaim in your store of masculinity in a world that has constantly been distorting what it means to be a man, undermining the value that men bring to society and signing masculinity off as some socially constructed and antiquated behavior of men. That's why the conversation I have with repeat guest Stephen Mansfield today is so crucial. He's been championing noble manhood for years and I could not be more honored to call him a friend. Today we talk about the culture of men, the critical importance of a man's legacy, the fire of heritage, rituals, a man's warrior spirit, and why we must all fight to forge noble manhood. You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest, embrace your fears, and boldly charge your own path when life knocks you down. You get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated, rugged, resilient, strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? My name is Ryan Micler and I am your host and the founder of this podcast and the movement that is Order of Man. I want to welcome you here and welcome you back. As I said in the intro, it's my job to restore and reclaim masculinity to its former glory. And it is a mantle of masculinity. It's something that we need to earn. It's something we need to fight for. It's something that I think much of society has been continually dismissive of. That is, of course, until society needs what men offer. And it's my job to give you the tools and resources and conversations like this one with Stephen Mansfield today that you need to thrive and succeed as a father and a husband, a business owner, a community leader. And so we're doing that via this podcast and courses and programs and events and everything else that we have going on. Specifically with this podcast, we interview incredible men like Stephen, like Jocko, David Goggins, Grant Cardone, Andy Fersilla, Matt Fraser, the lineup of men that have joined us is phenomenal and a testament to the value and the belief that most men have that we want to step up and we want to be capable and we want to provide for our families and we want to be the type of men that we're called to be. So I'm excited to be introducing you once again to my friend, Stephen Mansfield. Before I get into that, I do want to make a mention of our collaboration with Warrior Poet Society Network. I know I've talked with you about this over the past several weeks. If you haven't signed up yet, I would encourage you to go check it out. It's Warrior Poet Society Network. And if you go to OrderOfMan.com slash WPSN, you'll be able to check it out and you'll be able to use the code OrderOfMan, all one word for discount, but you're going to get access to Order of Man show, which is exclusive content. It's not anything else that I put anywhere else. You're also going to get access to other shows like War Poet with John Level, Tony, Sentmonaut's Real World Tactical, and many others. So the network continues to become more robust and more offerings. I know, I know beyond a shadow of a doubt, you guys are going to be interested and excited about what's being offered over there. Again, check it out, OrderOfMan.com slash WPSN, use the code OrderOfMan. All right, guys, let me introduce you to Steven. He's a good friend, again, and repeat guest. As I said previously, he has been a champion of noble manhood for years, and he's been a huge support and advocate for what we're doing here at Order of Man. In fact, he was gracious enough to write a very powerful testimony from my book, Sovereignty, The Battle for the Hearts and Minds of Men. Steven is a political commentator. He's the founder of greatmen.tv, and he's also a New York Times best-selling author and has written many incredible books. A lot of you guys have read, including Mansfield's book of Manly Men, Building Your Band of Brothers, and his latest book, which he is here to talk with us about today, Men on Fire. Steven, it's great to see you again, my friend. Good to see you, buddy. It's been too long. I know, I meant to look and see when the last time we talked. Well, you know, actually, I think the last time we officially talked was probably about the time my book came out, because you wrote and you were gracious enough to leave us a testimonial for that book, and that was two years ago, a little over two years ago now. Wow. Wow. Timesfield. I mean, nothing's been happening in our world since then, so I don't know why you and I didn't connect. Yeah, I mean, what is there to catch up and connect about, right? Exactly. Exactly. Well, I'm glad you reached out to me, though, when you wrote your new book, Men on Fire. You know, actually, I don't know. What's the relay state on this? I think this is an advanced copy. It is an advanced copy. June 1 is the day you should get a final copy here pretty soon, but June 1 is just a release date. Great. Yeah. No, I've read through it, and really like what you have to say. I wasn't surprised that I would enjoy it, that it would resonate with what what I talk a lot about and what I believe about manhood and masculinity. We seem to be so much aligned in a lot of the ways we view masculinity and what it means to be a man. Yeah, there's no question. I mean, I wrote that book because I felt like there were some things I hadn't said in the previous two books that needed to be brought home. And by the way, one of the things I really love about it, thankful to my publisher, is that we decided not to do a hardback aversion, we're just doing a paperback version, which makes it cheaper, more accessible, almost a knee guy, I can afford to buy another 10 verse friends, that kind of stuff. So I'm really looking at it as a movement book, and that's exciting. Yeah, I also like that you wrote it in a way that encourages men to band together and talk about it and discuss because in each one of the chapters, you talk about the battle plan, which is a term that we actually use as well. So I was excited to see that. But yeah, you talk about it in the context of how are you going to band with other men and address some of these issues, which I don't think a whole lot of men are doing. Women tend to be pretty communal, just by default, but men don't seem to be that way, at least in modern times. Yeah, I couldn't agree more. And I'll tell you what, with what's happening recently in our world, I was so grateful that this book had the themes that it did and is coming out when it does, because I think if we're not careful, in addition to what was already the downward spiral of manhood in our in the Western world, this the kind of virus and all that's happening in the economic upheaval could really douse the fires and then so on. So I'm just grateful for the way it's all coming together, in fact, at the end of the time. You said that there was a couple of things, specifically in this book that you felt needed to be shared that weren't in your previous two books. I'm assuming you're referring, because you've wrote more than two, you're referring to building your band of brothers and Mansfield's book of Manly Men. Is that correct? That's right. That's right. Okay. I'm grateful for those two books. They've had a lot of impact. I mean, you and I talked about them before, but still there was something missing. I could call men to noble manhood. I could show them models of noble manhood. I could teach them the four maxims I've talked about Mansfield's book of Bandly Men. I could teach them how to build bands of brothers, but still there was something that needed to be ignited in their souls at a very personal level. And that's what this book does. Yeah. Well, it's fascinating that you came from it from the approach of the seven fires, I think, is what you termed it as. And as I was going through each of those quote, unquote fires, man, every single one of them resonated with me. And I think most of them, if not all of them, that's probably why you identify these is they are on the decline in modern culture. But these have been historically masculine practices and virtues. But it seems like modern times have kind of stripped a little bit away from us as men. Yeah. And you know that I don't like to spend a lot of time cursing the darkness, but the fact is that if we all had perfect families and perfect fathers, these virtues, these fires would have been ignited in our souls by fathers and uncles and abandoned brothers in a tribe that we grew up in. But when they're not, someone's got to come along and say, you've got to be intentional about this. You've got to go after this yourself. You know, my, for example, one of the fires is heritage. And I'm sure we'll talk about it. But you know, I tell men, dig up what's good and noble in your heritage, both ethnically and in terms of your family, and let it take up residence in your soul. Well, let me assure you that my children don't have to do any digging. They got a father who's a PhD in history. A guy who keeps the family heritage alive at Thanksgiving meal. They would hear about their family heritage on my on my wall over my shoulder. Let's see what I'm here is a picture of my, you know, high ranking officer, US Army officer father, you know, my kids into that environment. So sometimes it's just automatically there and just embedded and passed on. But where it's not, man, you got to go after it because it's essential. And so that's what this is going to do. Be a road map for that that hunt. Yeah. And I think that's increasingly common. There's some great work that I'm sure you're familiar with by Dr. Leonard Sacks. Why? And I think you actually mentioned him later in the book and some of his work. And then Dr. Warren Farrell with the boy crisis and both of them refer heavily to the lack of masculine presence in young men's lives. It's funny because occasionally more often than I should, I get messages from men who will say things like quote on quote real men don't need other men to tell them how to be men. And I'm like, that's the furthest thing from the truth. That's actually the exact opposite of what you should think about this. That is exactly right. It's exactly right. It's our absence of a tribe of men around us. You know, I'm going to say something that's a little bit radical. Obviously, I believe in the traditional family. Obviously, I believe in fathering. But the, but the studies show that where there wasn't a father in the home, that if a band of men will come around a young man, they can make as much as 80 to 85% of the difference of a father. That's exciting to me. Because that means that if I, that if I'm born into a family where the father's abandoned the home or he dies early or whatever the circumstances might be, if the force doesn't mean that I'm just ruined. It means that other men men admit in my church, men in my community, men in my tribe, whatever it is, can pull around and make a difference. Well, that's the way it's always been in history. You know, fathers got killed by natives on the front, when the frontiers and, you know, died on the ships coming over. People died far more freely at midlife previously. But the other men of the community pulled around and made a difference. So yeah, that, that, that, what you've just quoted, of course, is you and I both know, it's complete month. A man, it's the problem we have in our generation is men walking alone. I, I have a group of guys who say it differently. A man who is self-defined is defined by a fool. And that's, you got to have other eyes on you got to have other men, you got to have other coaches. I didn't get better at football, better at baseball, whatever else I was going to got better at it by myself. I had other guys around you said, what the heck are you doing? And, you know, coach, we threw you. So that's, that's the way it's got to be in this life. Yeah, I think, I think it is really important that, that you make that, that statement about, you know, men stepping up. And I also think it leads us to believe that we as men who have the capacity to do so have an obligation to step up in community leadership. You know, that might be boys in the neighborhood, your, your, your sons and daughters, friends, I think of competitive sports, if you can coach or step up in a youth organization through your church or through some other community organization, like we have an obligation and responsibility to step up. I know there were men in my life in the absence of a permanent father figure who stepped up for me and made a huge, huge difference in the way that I turned out as a man. Yeah, and I was very fortunate to grow up in a military environment. So my father was a very, very busy, awful army officer, but there were other men on the post who were coaching me in football, who were keeping an eye on me and my behavior, who were, you know, men in the school, it's that all those kinds of things. And so, you got to have, you got to have that broader tribe. And I'll tell you, you put your finger on something very, very important. I use a kind of a humorous illustration from the Andy Griffith Show. You know, there's, there's this episode where Andy's out of town, the sheriff, and so Barney and Gomer are the two deputies. And they're walking around and they finally see some guys who are ready to rob the bank and all that. And what Gomer says to Barney, we got to call the police. And Barney says, we are the police. And that's the big laugh line, you know. But the fact is, you know, quite frankly, a lot of guys listening to this podcast, they may not feel like they're meant to be mentors or that their father is, whether their father figures in the life of a young man who's not in their home. But I'll tell you what, it's almost like if you know five truths of noble manhood, baby, you're better off than most men get to it, you know, get on with with with mentoring other people and bringing them in your life. So we have a kind of a, what they call them theology of perfectionism. It has to be perfect before we get started. And I don't believe that. I think if you're in it in the pursuit, you know, some stuff, turn and teach those who don't know what you know, and we'll all teach each other. But we are the police, so speaking of this thing's going to get fixed. It's going to have to get fixed by us taking, in my opinion, with one hand on God, the other hand on each other. Yeah, I can appreciate that. You know, it's, I've often said that we don't, we don't get to decide if we're influential, you know, what, what, whether we want to or not, and however we're showing up, we are influencing other people. And it seems to me, most of us aren't very intentional about that. It just happens to be that the way we act and the way we behave is what rubs off on other people. We don't give it much of a second thought. But, man, how powerful would it be if more and more men, millions of men across the planet, decided that if I'm going to be influential, why don't I be a little bit more intentional about it and think about the way I want to lead my life and then lead others' lives as well, which ties into one of the fires you talk about, which is legacy as well. Yes, yes. And I'll tell you, buddy, you know, one of the things that really hinders guys from being the mentors they're called to be is that we have this overly formal view of what it means to be a mentor. You say the word mentor to most guys. They get some kind of ancient Greek image, you know, guys in Toga sitting under a tree contemplating the apple or something, you know, some kind of strange, you know, Roman-esque, Greek-esque kind of thing. But the fact is that most coaching, most mentoring, most nurturing of men happens just informally, you know. Yeah, you know, I never, I never in my life went to a baseball clinic or had a formal coaching arrangement where a guy was privately paid. One of my buddies just turned to me and said, choke up on the bat. What's wrong with you, you know, or like, what are you doing? Men don't do that. No, you got to go to second. Every time that happens, it's a force play. You know, it wasn't like it was gentle. It's just the way guys talk to each other. So the mentoring doesn't happen in Greece under a tree with a Toga. The mentoring happens over a burger. The mentoring happens while you're mowing the yard of the widow. The mentoring happens in fun ways. You know how this goes? Yeah. Two teams play in four on four pick up basketball. They don't even know each other's names and they're coaching each other. Look for me down under I'm open. You know, that kind of stuff. They just start coaching each other and making each other better. That's just the culture of men. So part of what's going on is guys think it's got to be a formal. You got to have a license. You got to have a certificate. You got to have a PhD. The fact is, we mentor each other from all to our lives and it starts as soon as we can speak English. You know, the three year old coaches, the two year old. That's just how it goes. So we got to pull down the formalities about this and get busy. It's funny because I was every night, every other night or so we've got little wrestling and jiu-jitsu mats here in the house and I've got three boys and little girl and all of them love to wrestle and roll around with me. And I was watching my oldest son who's 12 now. And he was rolling with his younger brother who's nine and there's a significant size difference. And it was funny because the older brother was pretty harsh on him. And I was like, gosh, they step in. I'm like, no, you know, actually, this is kind of how it's supposed to be for men. We live in this really interesting society where it's over-feminized. And if anything comes out harshly, then you're doing it wrong or it's toxic. And maybe some of that to a degree and it can certainly get taken out of hand. But for the most part, let the boys be boys and let them self-regulate in a way, not to the point where they're destructive or dangerous, but to the point where they can check each other the way that we've done for thousands and thousands of years. Exactly. Exactly. You know, you know, because we, you and I both pay attention to the culture of boys and the crisis of boys in our generation. But we know for here's the classic example. A guy walks in the school, he sees one of his friends, his friends at a locker. And so what is the guy walking in do? He'll just push him into the locker. Right. And the female public school teacher freaks out and thinks she's got a rioter. You and I both know that it's just nurture. It's an insane way of saying hello. You know, when I played football in high school, I got transferred to the middle of my high school career to a gigantic high school in Iowa. When those guys walked in and said hello, man, they'd hurt. Yeah. Yeah. They just, they didn't mean to hurt me, but they just walked in. I'd have my arms raised up like, let's say, putting something in my locker and they just smack me in the ribs while they walk by and say, morning man's field or hey, dude or hey, idiot or whatever. Right. And I'm not saying it's God knows they don't want to treat their wives that way later in life. But at that point, it was just nurture. And you've got to let it happen. Now, if he gets abusive or harsh or draws blood or like in the case of your sons, you know, it's just, it's not productive. You can always whisper into the older child leaders and say, don't you think if you would general up a little bit, that might work better? But, but for the most part, I don't want to turn off the rough nurturing I've had in my life. It's what's made me who I am. And by the way, I grew up around drill sergeants and those guys, those guys aren't jacking around, man, those guys, well, they don't say please. They just go up in your face. And what is wrong with you, man, I talked to you how to do this yesterday. I expect you to do it today. You know, that was not a good. So I didn't teach you they still expect you to do it. They expect you to pull it out of the air. That's right. So I'm not, I'm not licensing rudeness. I'm not licensing harshness. But there is that culture of men, which by the way, if I can jump in and make a point real quick, we need to remember, that's why a lot of the culture of men needs to happen away from women. I'm not crazy about the women in my life and love them dearly. But now when I go shoot with my buddies or we go mess around or we do a pick up game or whatever, you know, when women show up, they're like, Oh my gosh, you guys are so mean to each other. What are you doing? You stop that. You know, that kind of stuff. And we all know it's just it's just the stuff that goes on. It's really not meant for their eyes. They need to go on and go do that. What they're going to do and let us have time with each other. So this is this is part of what you and I are talking about right now is part of the lore of manhood that we've got to keep alive and teach the next generation. Yeah, I mean, I'm just so glad you're talking about that because it isn't it isn't popular doctrine, right? It is is to hear about the you know, I think about to talk about, you know, football stories when I was a freshman before practice, everybody would line up on the field before practice or kind of sit around around the pads or whatever. And the seniors would just torment us. I mean, torment us with the not hurt us, but just torment us with the bags and they'd throw them at us and throw our helmet. So we'd have to go chase them and push us through the bags and everything else. And you know, it was miserable, but at the same time, like I never thought it was bullying or anything like that. And then when I was a senior, I did it to the freshmen. And it was a little bit of a rite of passage in a way. And you know, it's funny because I'm reading Gates of Fire by Stephen Pressfield now. Oh, yes. Great book. Great book. He's going to be joining us on the podcast as well. But it's so interesting to hear stories of these Spartans and how they trained the Egoge and how they pushed on each other. And the reason they did it is because they need to make sure that they were hardening each other because when it counted in battle, they needed to ensure that the man to their left and their right was worthy and capable of standing next to them and defending and protecting like they would themselves. And we just don't have those opportunities in modern times, which I think eliminates some perceived idea of like having somebody who's battle tested next to you. Well, you're absolutely right. And I'll tell you, part of what we need to do is teach each other how to nurture other guys in this kind of rough way. It doesn't need to get sexual. It doesn't need to get brutal. Quite frankly, I'll tell you that a lot of the bullying that goes on and so in fraternities and things like that, a lot of the bullying that happens that we hear about on, you know, COVID's 14 sports teams, in my opinion, that's happening because we didn't have men passing on the law of initiation rights and the law of positive, I call it nurturing, that happens that way. I remember a game we used to play on the football field. I'd get in the middle of a circle and they called it, if you can't believe how politically correct it is today, but smear the queer. Smear the queer, of course. Yeah. You remember it? We all played it. I got to tell you that. That drill made me a better football player because I was big and strong when I was a little slow. So to get hit from a blind side and then have to jump up and get ready for the next guy to hit me where I didn't know where he was coming from and move my feet and play around in the circle of what you look for, that drill, I used to jump into it every time I could because I knew it was making me better. But now you get arrested for doing that. No, for sure. Or you even say it, you can't even say the word anymore. I know, I don't care what you call it, call it an apple pie for all I care. But you're going to be a better football player. Yeah. And I remember the first time a guy taught me how to shoot, he said, stop, stop, stop, stop. You're going to be using the right eye. You say, this guy was a drill sergeant. He was working young men on a military post off time. And he said, you're so stupid. You're not even closing the right eye. Well, it just so happens that I'm opposite hand. My eye and my hand are opposite. You know that situation is shooting. And so I have to close it where I normally I would close my left eye to shoot with my right hand. I should, I have to close my right eye. Well, yeah, thank God he told me I don't care if he drew it in blood on my chest. My point is that he taught me. And I've been a pretty decent shot ever since and had a lot of fun hunting and a lot of man time. Anyway, all this to say, men talk to each other. You know, the other night I was with a bunch of guys for a Stogieffest and a guy walked in and said, ladies, it's so good to be with you. Well, now if a woman had been sitting there, she just said, what an insulting SOB this guy is. Why do you let him attend the meeting? You know, right? Well, we know what's going on. You know what's going on. Every man listening to this knows what's going on. He's having fun. He's picking on us. He's saying hello. He doesn't really think we're ladies. And by the way, most of the guys in that room could have looked his backside. He's it's just a way then nurture each other. But my point is that it's part of the lore of this. And I remember my father saying, well, put up with this because that's nurture. That's guys hanging and smacking each other. But when it crosses that line right there, I don't put up with it. And if it goes further, come tell me. Well, I feel so secure. I felt like I had a roadmap for man culture. And that's that's what we have to start handing the next generation. Yeah, agreed. You know, I take I take that comment. You're talking ladies. How's it going? You know, obviously he doesn't think you guys are ladies. And also, he is not demeaning ladies. And that's one of the things that I think we get into into this thing is like, Oh, I'm offended and you're insulting me. Not everything needs to be taken so personally. And it's just funny to see that it's unfortunate, actually. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. You use a word, Steven, you use the word nurturing, which is very interesting because when I think of that word, just kind of on the surface, my knee jerk reaction is soft, effeminate. That's what comes to mind. But you're using it in a different context. And it's really interesting to think about it that way. Yeah, we can we can use a whole lot of other terms for it. I'm growing you. I'm teaching you. I'm training you. I'm bringing you up, you know, and so I like the word nurture, just because it's the way the psychological community speaks. A lot of people will understand but I know it can evoke statues with women with bare breasts from the Greek area, you know, nurturing the world and nipples to the wind and all that kind of thing. And I'm not trying to be craft or nasty. I'm saying, that's what's going on. Guys are helping each other. Guys are growing each other. I mean, I remember in high school, I lived in Germany in high school and there was something I was doing that looked the end danger. And some of my friends came and said, Mansfield, what these are guys, by the way, I'd only known three months because I had just moved there. You keep doing this. You're going to get your butt whooped. What is wrong with you? And I said, what are you talking about? Yes. They said, you cannot go over to this section of the city and do such an, I wasn't doing anything immoral by the way, I was just actually walking there with a bunch of girls is what they were trying to tell me. You're going to take four or five of us with you, man. And you got to be a man up because they will absolutely come for you. Well, it was so good for me. It made me situation aware, as they say in the military. It made me on to help me understand the threat that was there and help me understand my role in safeguarding women, which I can't do if there's one of me and five girls, that kind of thing. And so anyway, it was so good for me, but it wasn't said gently, it wasn't on an engraved invitation, it wasn't said, now my friend, let me talk to you for me. No, they just backed in and because they didn't want me to get whooped. And so that's how men talk to each other. And it's also, by the way, why we pick up nurturing, not in systematic lectures like in college or university, but we pick it up in bits and pieces. I picked up, I remember my father at a half time of a football game on New Year's Day said, I love it when a man improves on himself. And my dad was not the kind of guy who sat around spouting Shakespeare or spouting Maxims of manhood. But you just listened long enough, you'd catch a lot of manhood, he was a real man's man. And so you just had to listen, you just had to be around to catch a gauge. Like he would talk about how he handled the situation or what he liked to see in a certain football player or how he disciplined a soldier because he did something wrong. And you'd learn lessons of manhood. So we live in a very academic kind of world, a lot of professors, a lot of university life, it shapes us. But the fact is that most of man lore is dropped in crumbs. It's dropped in little bits and pieces and in formal times and you just have to pay attention. And you know, I think it's not only dropped there, but it's also dropped just in the moment in action. I think this is one of the biggest pieces missing in the educational system. And I also happen to think it's a big reason for the decline in organized religion. I really don't think that men want to be sat down and preached to from some pulpit without experiencing some sort of action that accompanies it. I think there's times where it's valuable. You know, we've been sitting around, for example, the campfire for millions of years, right? And so that's valuable. But also it's found in applying the lessons and getting the feedback of moving your back in your hands and working and laboring and toiling. And we don't get that in a classroom. And for the most part, we don't get that in the religious organization either. You know, so I think that's part of the decline. I don't know what you have to say about that. No, I couldn't agree with you more. And I'll tell you what, one of the chapters in my book, Men on Fire, is about God and about the fire of God and our souls. And I treated a very non-religious way. And one of the things I do is I say that we have drained the manly content out of religion. We have forced churches and religious institutions to lean feminine, which is great when you're feminine, but it's not great when you're a man. You know, I mean, my wife was sitting right here, she'd say, absolutely. What's great for women is not great for men in every case. And as a result, men who are obviously created the image of God meant to be connected to God and perfect noble manhood without God, need to need to be brought back, not into a feminized church, but brought back to the power and the manhood of religion. And one of the things I do, because I've got a background in religious studies and history, is I take time to talk through the life of Jesus real quick. Well, that sounds real preachy because that's about the only time you hear about the life of Jesus. But I do a manhood riff on the life of Jesus. What he went through, what he did is Father died early as brothers resented him, you know, he was hunted every day of his life, etc, etc, etc, etc. And before long, you got a manly image, it's only a couple of pages, but you've got a manly image of Jesus that is not denoted by the Jesus in a bathrobe with a sheep under his arm image that we see in a lot of churches, even in our art. So I couldn't agree with you more. I think that we absolutely have feminized religious institutions, the church in particular. And I don't want to revolt. I don't want the women being diminished or anything like that. But I'll tell you one of my favorite churches in this country is a church called Manate Church, just outside of Fort Bragg in North Carolina. And the pastor years ago said, I want to build a church that really reaches to men. And I think if I do that, that we'll bring in more people and serve women even better. So rather than, you know, the old saw us that 80% of church jobs go to women, he reversed it and did 80% of the church jobs for men. And then had women come on board. Well, first of all, the church has grown far beyond what it ever would have otherwise. And so many, many thousands of women are served, who had never been served otherwise. And also, he builds a culture of noble manhood that serves those women so well that they are delighted. They considered a privileged even go there. But by the way, from Fort Bragg, you got a lot of special forces and military and stuff. So these guys know what they're doing. It's unbelievable that it's because he decides to lean towards men in the building of the church, so to speak. And it made a massive difference. So that's, that's, that's what we're going to have to do, not like you say to the diminishment of women, but because we want to serve both well. Guys, let me hit the pause button on the conversation with Stephen real quick. This one is specifically for fathers, this message on September 3rd through the 6th of this year 2020. We're going to be hosting our first ever legacy experience in Maine. This is our third legacy experience, the first one in Maine. And you and your son between the ages of eight to 15 are going to come to my property to be pushed to the max physically, mentally, emotionally. And all of this is designed to equip you and your boy with the tools needed to thrive in the crazy world that we live. If you're anything like me ensuring that your son becomes the man he's capable of becoming is something that keeps you up at night, probably more so than anything else. And when you come to the legacy experience, again, on September 3rd through the 6th, you're going to be working alongside me and my boys and 19 other fathers and sons to ensure that you have everything that you need to help your boy become a man. If you want to learn more and lock in one of these last remaining spots, then head to order of man.com slash legacy. Again, order of man.com slash legacy. You can learn what is included in the experience. You can watch a quick video from our past legacy experience. And this one is going to be like, unlike I should say, any event that you have ever seen or experienced. Again, check it out order of man.com slash legacy. I really do hope to see you there. All right, guys, back to it with Stephen. Yeah. And you touch on a point in the book as well, which is definitely not politically correct. And you talk about male authority through through this fire of God, which was a fascinating discussion point, something that I happen to agree with, but something that you're not quote unquote supposed to talk about, right? Because somehow people believe that that does diminish the role of women and how they show up and what they mean to us and how we can serve our women best. Absolutely. I'm not going to just take off and preach here, but Paul said twice in his letters to the Corinthians, I have authority for building you up, not for tearing you down. That was the nature of authority he had. Well, I think we should take a light of fire from that that we keep with us. And that is, my wife is a very strong personality, very gifted. She's, I think, you know, that she's a producer. She, you know, I had those big old tours rock and roll tours and Christmas. When there's a 16 semis going down the highway, she's, she produces all that stuff. But she's tough. She's strong. She's good. She's delighted to have a husband who has authority and insight for building her, protecting her, caring for her, nurturing her, and not tearing her down. It's not a competition. It's not me ruling the roost. It's not saying, get me my beer woman or, you know, that kind of snappy, mortery, turning into it, turning her barefoot foot and pregnant. In the kitchen, it's authority for helping her. It's authority for coaching her, just like she has in my life to a large extent. And so she's delighted because she's in charge of things everywhere. Well, who's watching out for her, her husband? And so that's that, I think we've got to have a little bit of a rewriting of the understanding of authority, especially when that sense of authority comes from scripture, because so often it's been misunderstood. It's not domination. It's an authority to build you up. And my wife revels in that she will tell you that she is a better woman because Steven has an authority in her life than she would be otherwise in the same way that I'm a better man because she speaks into my life. And that's how we're going to have to start thinking of it. Yeah, I think that's why podcasting and writing books and giving context to some of these discussion points is so important because, yeah, that could be taken out of context and be taken negatively and create some criticism for men who believe that they are, for example, the patriarch of their family, which I believe I am. But heaven forbid, I say the word patriarch, right? Because of the negative connotation that it's that it's that espouses or that it's been given. But I take honor in that like I take honor in knowing that I'm the leader of my family, that I have authority to lead my family. And I want to do that in a way that doesn't prop me up, but in a way that helps me lift up my wife and my children. Like I think most men are on board with that. Well, and I'll tell you, I've seen this happen time and time again. When a man starts being what he's supposed to be, when a man starts, I don't mean just stepping out and leading about although that's important, but just on his own terms and his own life being what he's meant to be, being together, having abandoned brothers, improving, growing, investing in the lives and his family and so on. I'll tell you what submission, if that's what we want to call it, is no problem. My wife has no problem coming under, so to speak. My authority to speak into her life, my authority to coach her, my authority to guide her. And while we make most decisions as a team, final authority always rest with me. That sounds real bigoted than people just need to change their understanding because I'm telling you, this is the greatest safeguard for both of us. It's powerful. But that's, I think this is one of the things that's got to be restored. I did not go to my wife and say, I want you to submit to me, I want you to do what I tell you, that's our arrangement. No, I was just a man that she could respect and who cared for her and invested in her. And she was happy to open her life and lay out before me and trust me to speak into any area of her life from weight to work to whatever. Not because I'm smarter than she is, I'm not, not because I'm a better human being, but because I have authority for her life. She, in other words, you went, you draw people into that coaching leadership relationship you're meant to have when you are who you're meant to be. Yeah, I think where people get hung up is they start to conflate the idea of, well, we're using the word submission. Maybe there's a different word we'd use, but they conflate it with a lesser worth, right? That if somebody submits, like a wife submits to the authority of her husband, for example, then somehow she's of less worth or less importance, which certainly is not true. But I think that's what a lot of people believe that it means. Yeah, and that's, that, you know, we probably need to look at professional sports. I mean, the guy coaching the team is not the best player. In almost every case, Phil Jackson is not a better player than Kobe Bryant was or, you know, all the great stars that he coached. He's not a better player. He wasn't even a better player when he was young and playing in the NBA, because he did not. But he is a better coach. And so the idea that the coach is someone who's better, best on top, perfect and exemplary. No, not at all. In fact, I have older men around me who are smaller, weaker than I am. Maybe they don't earn as much money. I don't know. But they have wisdom for life that I want to hear. And so I set myself at their knee. I come under them, so to speak. I listen to what they have to say. And not because they're better than I am in, in any area. I mean, they might be, but that's not the criteria I'm using. But they have wisdom I don't have. They can mentor me. They can coach me. They can nurture me. They can lead me into the next level. And so this idea that you're in competition with your coach, this idea that the only people who can coach you are people who are better than you are at what you do. That's, that's going to cause you to miss a lot of the input you need to have in your life to be a success in every area of life. Definitely. Definitely. That's why I think humility is so, so important. Because if we run around and we all want to be the alpha, well, while I can appreciate your desire to lead and be out front and get things done, it leaves a lot on the table that you could otherwise learn from and grow from and produce better results in your relationship. And with your career aspirations and financial situation, if you would just stop trying to be that quote unquote alpha all the time and just humble yourself before men who might know a little more than you about some things. That's very, very well said, but, and I'll tell you something else, one of the things that's really helped me is what what is, is what the experts call modulism or mentoring. And what that means is I don't just put on a toga move into your backyard and tell please, please mentor me and lead me in all things. I just, I turned to a friend who's better at one thing than I am. I, for example, I don't mind saying this right on the air. I'm very good with languages, philosophy, ideas, history, literary things. I'm not very good with numbers. Thank God my wife has a master's in higher math. Numbers are not my primary language. I can do all the basics that everybody can do. But if you're wanting me to compute more foot for a remodeling project, or if you're wanting me to figure out compound interest over a period of time, stuff like that, I'm going to have to have that check. Somebody's going to check that. So years ago, when I was just a young guy just starting to step out in the world, I went to an older friend who was a financial genius. And I said, look, I'm going to buy the lunch. Would you mind sitting with me and just talking me through some things that would help me as I try to, you know, prosper and take good care of my money and be wise? So how do you save? How do you do this stuff? What about credit cards? Would you just talk with some things? And so I bought it and ended up, I bought three lunches. And he talked to me very gracious, saying very gently turned out the guy was a PhD in higher finance. So what was he doing sitting with me? Well, he was happy to mentor a younger guy. But my point is that I didn't, I never asked myself, am I better than him in every area? You know what I'm saying? I don't have any clue. I mean, maybe he's not that good of a father to his daughter, or maybe he's not any good at racable. I don't know. Frankly, at the time, I didn't care. There was a guy I liked. He had wisdom for my life. I wanted him to speak in one portion of my life. So part of what you do when you're all Mr. Macho Mail and don't want to take any coaching is you've got to only miss the big life coaching, the big broad coaching that you need in your life. You also miss the opportunities to improve in certain areas. How can I play better? Whatever. Racquetball golf. How can I, you know, you seem to have a great relationship with your daughter and she's got special needs. Talk to me about that. You know, whatever it is that you need, you know, I know guys who have been to the just absolutely messed up and yet won their wives back. I stand around scratching my head shocked. Now, I didn't lose a wife or any misdeeds on my part, but some of these guys were just dogs, but they kept their marriage together and they won their families back in their exemplary today. Well, don't you want to learn from that? So my point is I'm willing to buy a due to steak if he'll teach me, but I've got to submit to him for lack of a better term. Come under it, be willing to be coached, shut up for a minute, whatever you want to say for a little while. And I urge men to master that heart. I mean, a lot of the mentoring you need, like I say, it's not sitting in a toga under a tree. A lot of it is just talking to a guy in the steam room or talking to a guy over a burger at lunch or going, you know, going for a jog and saying, how do you, how do you do that so well? That's the mentoring we need. And we're going to have to be intentional about it. Yeah, I found that the virtue of curiosity has really helped me in this department. You know, when I started podcasting early five, five years ago, in fact, you're one of my early guests. I just, I wasn't obviously I wasn't as effective as I am now with with the medium and the skill of podcasting and interviewing and conversing part of that just comes through time. But I think a big shift for me was just being curious. Like I'm always amazed at the people that I have opportunities to have conversations with, whether it's something like this or on the plane or at a conference, like you never know who you're talking with or who or what they know about life. If you just were a little bit more curious about who that person is, what they know, what might translate into something that you may be dealing with, I think we all just being a such a better spot. Yeah, I don't think there's any question. I'll tell you another big difference with me that fits into what you're saying. Early in my life, an older guy said to me, I had a good father, but he was very busy with with war. He was very busy in the military and he didn't teach me a lot of practical stuff. And that actually caused me to go out into the world when I turned 18 and went off to college, a bit insecure. But in college, a guy said, look, don't let what you don't know drive you to insecurity, let it drive you to answers. And so rather than sitting there, huddled up in my dorm room going, shoot, I don't know how to do that. I mean, I literally didn't know how to shave when I went to college. I had used an electric razor and had never used a straight razor. When my electric razor broke, I didn't know how to shave. I had to ask a guy in college to teach me how to shave. Well, how much more for change in the oil? How much more for the best way to date? How much more for 50,000 other things we need to know? But the best advice I got was don't let what you don't know make you insecure, let it drive you to answers. And that made a huge, huge difference to me because my while my father was a good man, he did not teach me basic stuff. He ought he should have taught me frankly. And I mean, he and I talked about that later. He should have. He assumed my mother was teaching it or my coaches were teaching me. But you know, so you so you have to be careful enough to let it drive you in security. If you put 10 guys in a room in this generation, there's a lot of stuff each of them does not know that other guys in that room will teach them if they could just if they just be bold to ask. And that's one of the arts of manhood. Yeah, I like that. I think the problem that a lot of guys have in this department, and I've certainly been here, is this this fear of mockery or ridicule being embarrassed because we don't need you were talking about shooting, for example, I learned to shoot younger, but but older than probably I should have been. And it was funny, my my father-in-law was taking me out with with my hunting rifle. I shot AR and stuff was in the military. And he took me out with a hunting rifle, and I scoped myself, you know, like got the bite, right? Because I was too too close to the scope. And it was funny because I was walking around the neighborhood and all the guys were like, Oh, I know what you did there. They were just giving me like a really hard time. And at first, I was embarrassed. And I'm like, wait, they knew what happened before I even said anything about it, which means that at some point it probably happened to them. And now it's like welcome to the club. It's not mockery. It's like, Hey, welcome. We've all been there. Congratulations. You're part of the club now. Well, aren't you aren't you glad that you you allowed a situation embarrassment? So you could learn. Exactly. How else do we learn? So if I'm so proud that I never want to show any weakness, and that's the kind of insecurity I had when I first went off to college, you know, I wouldn't let anybody know what I didn't know because I didn't want to come under ridicule. Well, after a while, I started to enjoy the ridicule because in the process, I was getting better. And I won't I won't get I'm not trying to compliment myself. But in a number of really, really important situations, I was awarded most improved. Well, most improved sometimes sounds like a, you know, booby prize or something. It's like the joke prize, but not for me. I went from zero to 100 and less time than anybody else did because I was willing to be ridiculed. I was willing to learn. I was willing to be hassled. I was willing to be teased. I was willing to walk around with a black eye from a scope or a burn mark or I can't tell you any time somebody's come up and who knew what was going on and said, I know what you did. Exactly. I sure know what you did. You held that thing the wrong way. That's that's our advice. You know, you can't believe it. And so but the issue is that I learn now. I yeah, ideally we all learned everything we need to know before we're 18 in terms of manhood, Laura, and we go out in the world. It never works that way. It doesn't matter how great your parents were, no matter what kind of home you came from. The issue is are you willing to grow. And I now I now know a lot of people in the military and stay close to military culture. So I've talked to a lot of drill sergeants and trainers behind the scenes and they'll say what they're often looking for is a guy who can grow through his mistakes. Not a guy who doesn't make mistakes. Well, the young recruit of course is trying not to make mistakes, but the drill sergeant knows he everybody's going to make mistakes. It's how you deal with your mistakes. And I just learned early. Thank God that I could endure any kind of ridicule. I just want to learn how to do this thing on the other side. I mean, I ruined cars engines because I didn't change the oil. I mean, I did stupid stuff. But I learned. I learned and I grew and then I had stuck to each other people. So you got to get over yourself and the will and take on the ridicule because everybody grows and everybody grows with an element of ridicule involved. You just have to do it. Tom Brady's out there somewhere learning new stuff and being canceled by his teammates. And by the way, he wasn't always Tom Brady. The way we did. He sat the bench. He got ridiculed. He got this. He got that. I mean, that's just how it goes. Well, I like that you're talking about not only being willing to put yourself in that situation, but then doing it over and over and over again. Because even if you're willing to do it once and you get burned, literally or figuratively, a lot of guys will be like, Oh, yep, not for me. I'm not doing that again. Right. You need to get yourself picked up, dusted off, and then reengage in the fight, reengage in the battle with the new found information and lesson that you have and that is now available to you. That feedback is crucial, but you got to get back in the fight. Otherwise, it doesn't matter. Yeah. And let's just consider for a moment the alternative. The alternative is that you don't want to look stupid. You don't want to look clumsy. You don't want to be criticized in public. Well, what are you going to do? You're only going to choose to go into situations where that you can handle and look good. Well, that's going to keep you shallow. That's going to keep you not growing. I want to throw myself into the deep end of the pool. I want to throw myself. There are times I've decided to join something and be part of something and people just looked at me and said, What are you thinking? You know nothing about that. But I learned. See, I want to grow. I want to learn. So it's amazing. The number of things that I've done for the first time by myself. But my point is that if we're preoccupied with cool and looks and not being quote unquote awkward, which is the big word that my kids use to express anything that is terrible is awkward. Well, I understand I don't want to look stupid 24 seven, but I'm willing to be awkward to grow even yet. I'm willing to be awkward to grow. And so that's something I really want your listeners to think about because if some guys are sitting back never wanting their hair must never wanting to look bad, never wanting to be criticized, then you'll just stay at the shallow end of the pool all the time as it takes no skill to stay there. And we want you to get into the deep water of what you're made to be. Well, I think this hits on something that you go in depth as well with with one of the fires, which is the fire of battle, right? And being a warrior, being willing to get in there and get dirty and messy and bloody. And but I wonder about the word warrior because it's one of those words that's been picked up by marketers. And so like everything is you're now a warrior, right? Just because you showed up, it's like, it doesn't really make you a warrior. So help me understand when you say warrior, like, what are the virtues that a warrior espouses that would make somebody actually step into this role rather than just it being a buzzword? Yeah, I appreciate that. First of all, war happens at all kinds of levels that can happen sure physically. But it can also just happen when you're battling for a friend, when you're battling for the sanctity of your home, when you're battling for your own psychological health. So for me, the actual form of war will be decided by the battles that are forced on you. It's that you have the skills of personal battle, both internal and external, that's important to me. So what I, what a man to do is have the heart of a warrior, a man who will step up a metal, this kind of whatever doesn't matter, I won't really rise up and fight about anything kind of attitude that pervades our generation is unmanly. And also is going to a lot of evil arise. Now I'm not talking about evil like, I'm going to go shoot somebody for them doing something politically, I don't agree with. I'm talking about evil in my own soul. I'm talking about evil in my own house. I'm talking about the darkness that comes to take my kids at night. I'm talking about helping my son battle through depression. I'm talking about all those things. So for me, are you willing, first of all, to mount up and do what's necessary to go to the war? Then second of all, you've got to develop the skills of war. And that for me is everything from yes, knowing how to defend myself physically and defend my family and shoot a gun and make sure my perimeter is solid at the most physical level. I'm speaking actually in terms of my home. But at the same time, how do you encourage a man? How do you help him overcome the darkness? How do you help him battle back? If one of your friends is being sued and it's just threatening to absolutely bankrupt him? How do you stand with him? How do you encourage him? How do you help battle back? How do you help maybe pull in other people who can stand with him and help him? How do you fight? And having been around the military a lot, one of the things that I am aware of is that you tend to fight with people who are cross disciplined. So I have certain skills in the fight, but I'm not going to have all the abilities. My father was Green Barret and they worked of course in these teams where one guy might be the medical officer and handle communications. The other guy was Demolition, but the other guy was the linguistics and intelligence of the region. And the other guy who knows what was small arms. And they all were cross trained. They all had three or four different kinds of training. And when they parachute behind enemy lines, they could get the job done. So I've got my certain skills in a battle of any kind. But I know how to pull other people in. I know how to call in reinforcements. So I'm speaking through it quickly. But for me, the core issue is that I recognize that part of my role as a man is to fight. That doesn't mean be contentious and be a brawler and be picking fights at a bar. That's a cheap version of the greater fights we're meant to fight. I'm talking about battle for my wife spiritually, physically, in every way. I battle for my children. I'm talking about everything from prayer to actually financial investment to actual encouragement to actually teaching them. You know, yeah, will I show up physically if I have to to protect them? Absolutely. But that's not the majority of it in our generation. Fortunately, in our American society, I don't have to go pushing people around all the time to protect my daughter. She can she lives in New York. She will walk the streets of New York unmolested for the most part. No problem. So that's not where the fight is. The fight instead is to encourage her. The fight instead is to help her get through coronavirus. This fight instead is to help the financial. The fight instead is to help her to be a virtuous woman in the midst of a generation that tells her not to be, et cetera, et cetera. So there are fights at every single level. And the main thing I go for is that men are willing to battle for each other. Right now, I pick up the phone call a couple of guys and tell them I'm in a real fight. I'm really fighting some whatever. Let's just say I don't have a problem with depression, but I'm happy to use it as an illustration. I'm fighting some depression. I'm afraid I might hurt myself. I'll tell you what, this can be four or five huge guys coming into my house. They're not going to knock either, by the way. They're going to find me. They're going to help me. They're going to stand with me. They're going to walk with me. They're going to get me help. They're going to take every weapon out of my home. They're going to talk to my wife. That's the kind of band of brothers I have. And that's calling in reinforcements. That's getting the help that you need. So it's more of a general attitude than it is putting on camo. It's not a strap on a And if you're doing that, you may be looking at it inappropriately and doing things that aren't really relevant or helpful to you. You use a quote in the book from John Eldridge, who is one of my favorite authors. I can't remember exactly the quote you used, but the one that really stands out to me is deep in his heart, every man longs for a battle to fight, an adventure to live, and a beauty to rescue. If that doesn't espouse, I think what you're talking about here, the willingness to battle for your romantic relationship, an adventure taking risk, and just being capable of handling everything that comes your way. I don't know what does. Well, and I think that's the core issue. I do a lot on college campuses, and so I sometimes have fun messing with young guys when I'm trying to help him. So I was at an event once, and a young guy brought his date. And he basically, when I started talking about the need of a man to be able to battle and have it in his soul and have that fire and battle going in his soul, and then yeah, bringing the skills along later, he was like, he was being cool and showing off a little bit, and he was anti. I can't think of anything I've really fight for really. So I reached over, took the hand of his girlfriend and pulled her over next to me and pushed him back in his chair. And I put my arm around, I wasn't making a program, I put my arm around his girl and said, she's mine now. He got up, I pushed him back in his chair. Now, everybody was giggling, but this guy was starting to get frustrated. And worse, he got some real fire in his eyes, and I thought he's just at the brink. And that's when I stopped doing the illustration. I said, you see that? If you and I had been alone, you probably would have pushed me. You probably would have come at me, because I was taking something that's rightfully yours. And for all you know, it was going to do harm. I said, are you telling me that that's what you felt was inappropriate, that you should never feel it, that you should just sit back and some kind of Zen mode, and let me take your girl, your wallet, your car, who knows what else. And it really was interesting, because even though he was trying to be culturally cool and anti all violent and masculine, the fact is he wasn't, he was living in conflict with that. And all it took me was he knew full well I wasn't going to take his girlfriend and take her home. I mean, I'm a full grown man with my wife sitting on the other side of the room, but it got him lit up enough to start to come at me a little bit. And that's a lot of this is the, I was called the duplicity, the tension that a lot of guys are living in. The fact is they know they've got to have the fire or a fight, but they don't know what to do. So rather than admit that, they just talk like they don't need to have it or like it's somehow culturally inappropriate. Well, every man needs to know how to fight at every level. And I got to tell you, there's a lot of the best in men comes out when they're preparing for a battle. Again, I'm not talking about physically primarily, because most of us will not fight major physical battles in our lives. We just won't. But the principles of physical matter battle need to be alive in our souls and need to be able to move us towards the fight that we need to have. And a lot of guys in our generation have just sort of shut that down because they don't know what to do. But there are guys around who can teach them. You can fight financially. You can fight for the psychological health of your family. You can fight spiritual battles. You can fight against cultural forces. A lot I tell guys to be the culture keepers in their home. Imagine what some men have had to fight during this coronavirus quarantine season where they sense depression or dissolution that are despair arising in the lives of those in their home. You got to fight against it. You got to know how to fight. So it's one of the great arts of manhood. Yeah, I just think that culture tells men not to fight. That if they feel this fire or that testosterone, that energy coursing through their veins, then they're wrong. And we've been conditioned that way through through the educational system, like we were talking about earlier, boys without father figures in the home or in their community. And so primarily a lot of these young men who are becoming the age of men have not really learned how to harness the fire. And they think because they feel rage or aggression or potential violence in appropriate situations that somehow they're wrong or they're toxic or they're displaying characteristics that they shouldn't be. And so rather than learning to harness the fire, they completely turn it off. They're like, oh, I got to turn that off. And they subdue it, which I think poses its own set of problems when you completely subdue it. No, there's no question about it. And I'll tell you something else. As men try to diminish the role of fight in their lives, fight may leave their personal lives, but it increasingly becomes a matter of popular entertainment. And it is interesting that while the average guy on the street is turning down the fire or fight in his soul, he's also watching MMA. I mean, he's also watching pro sports. He's also admiring violence. So it looked back at the Roman era and they're all out to study a lot. It became an increasingly effeminate culture when it came to the men. But at the same time, you had guys fighting for the death and the arena and all these effeminate men sitting around cheering them on. My point is that what happens is we keep an element of fight in our lives as a matter of entertainment, but we have no skills of our own. And correspondingly, when a culture has a good manly martial culture in it, where guys are carrying weapons, where guys know how to fight when they know how to fight for noble and righteous composers and protect one another, you don't find fighting very much as entertainment because it's really been in the life in a healthy way. In fact, there's episode of the American West where a promoter tried to bring some boxing to a town. And the men said, we don't want that, we don't need that around. And fighting is an entertainment, fighting is what you just say a lot. We don't want that to be reduced to entertainment. And in every man carried a gun, every man had fought in the frontier, every man had fought against evil guys, every man had fought against bandits. They carved out a community of the wilderness. And what they didn't want, what they found repulsive, was suddenly turning the fighting, they had to know how to do day to day into some kind of entertainment. And so they asked the guy, they wouldn't let the this fight promoter bring his stuff into the city. And I've always thought that was very, very interesting. Guys who had actually shot weapons, guys who had actually been in the fights, guys who had actually been in knife fights, guys who had actually had to carve a home out of the frontier didn't want that same form of violence to the entertainment because it was a respected and noble lore that was woven into life. And that's what we're going to see as we turn this ship. Yeah, that's interesting. I never considered that. I can see where you're coming from. I, you know, I do watch MMA and I enjoy it. And I think part of the reason is obviously men enjoy violence and have a propensity for it. But I think the other element of it that is valuable is being inspired by somebody's dedication to a craft by facing their own fears by having an adversary that they're quite literally fighting against and then using that. I mean, that's the key is use that as fuel to improve your own life. If you're using it to detach or escape from your own reality, I think that could be a problem. But if you're using it as fuel to move you in the right direction to become more of a fighter, literally and figuratively, then I think it could be a very positive thing. Yeah, I mean, I'm not down on that at all. I study, I tend to study war. I like more realistic historical war movies. I study the theory of war, read the Great War manuals and so on. And I do that a lot, not just because I'm a historian, but also, but because I like to apply those principles to my own life and what I'm fighting for in my own soul. And so, you know, I'll sit with my band brothers and we'll talk about a certain strategy and classmates or whatever, you know, just from fun and show to go dang, or sons to love Sue and so on and a son Sue. And we'll say, well, man, we need to be using that kind of tactic in our battles here. You know, we need to listen to that helps us. You know, so we, in a sense, we study war so that we can be more effective in war of every kind. So it's, you know, every guy's got his own level of familiarity with battle, but all of us need to up that game. And I'll just say at a minimum, a guy at least needs to know how to fight for his own internal health. He needs to know how to protect himself physically and those who are with him physically. And he needs to know how to battle for the well-being of a friend. At that level, at a minimum, it's got to happen. I mean, you got to have a great big lock or a gun. I don't care whether you like guns or not. That's not my, that's not my agenda. But my agenda is that a man has basic fight in his soul and knows what he would do. If someone comes up and grabs his wife, girlfriend's purse and, you know, taunts him and all that kind of stuff. He just doesn't just tell you, that's just how it goes in our generation. Also in our generation, you pretty much at least in your head need to know what you would do if there was sudden a shooter on a campus or in a store or in a mall where you were. That's happening a lot in our society. So what would you do? You have a basic plan. So my kids grew up with that basic understanding, not terror, not fear, not nervousness about everybody. But here's what would happen. It was part of life that bad things might occur because we live in a fallen world. That was my understanding. My kids understanding. But they're happy and secure and fine. But I don't think you want to go and grab my son's wallet, you know, right? Because he knows what to do. Right? He knows that handle ourselves. He knows how to handle himself. But it didn't turn our home into some kind of skinhead camp. You know what I'm saying? We weren't crazy. We weren't survivalists. We weren't nuts. But he can handle a gun, handle himself physically, take care of his family and also knows how to show up at the lives of his friends. That's all I'm looking for. Yeah, it makes sense. You know, I think there's a battle that a lot of people don't really address all too often. And the way that I've chosen to look at it is the battle with my weaker self. I call him the natural man, right? He's lazy. He's immediate gratification. He wants the result without the effort. He's always looking for the path of least resistance. I experienced him yesterday when I didn't want to go and do my training session. And I choose to look at that as a battle. Like that is a battle between him and the potential that I have not yet unlocked in myself. And yesterday I won. And some days, as much as I hate to admit, I don't always win. But having that fighting spirit between who I am and who I could default to versus who I have the potential to become has been very powerful in me doing the right things, the things that I've committed to doing for myself. Well, that's why we need abandoned brothers. The assumption of abandoned brothers is that I don't have all the resources I need in my own soul. So I don't know what situation you live in up there, Ryan. But I'd like to, I've got guys who are going to write me today and say, do you work out? And that's because I'm not inherently lazy. But I have a very busy, very busy days these days. And what tends to get squeezed out is the workout. Well, you've met me. I'm 64, 270, 280 pounds. Wouldn't take much to put me in that 300-pound mark if I'm lazy. And now I've got all kinds of biological problems. Plus, not only do I want to look decent in front of crowds, but I actually want to be healthy. I'm 62. So it's an important time for me to not let that go. So these guys are on it. Why? Because I'm uniquely lazy now, because they just know my tendencies. I'm more likely to come five o'clock, have a Manhattan, then get up and go for that job. And they know that. So on another guy, we got to bug him about, I don't know what, laying aside enough money and savings or finishing the projects he doesn't start. He starts and doesn't finish or whatever. But that's why you need other men around you, keeping their eyes on you, coaching you, helping you. Because ideally, we don't want you to be motivated to have the only motivation coming out of your own soul. We want you to have other guys motivating you as well and threaten to whoop you if you don't work out today kind of thing. And that's what makes a difference in my life that I've got other eyes on me. Not spying on me, not nagging me, not picking on me, but aware of my tendencies and wanting me to be the best man I can be. Yeah, it's very powerful. I mean, you go into length about the concept of a brotherhood in building your band of brothers, which is another great read. Well, Stephen, I want to be respectful of your time. We've covered a lot. I have more notes that we could talk about. Maybe we need we need to do that at a later point. Or maybe I just need to encourage the guys to go pick up a copy of the book. That's probably the best thing. Just go pick up a copy of the book and read it for yourself and apply to stuff with you and your band of brothers as well. I want to ask you a couple of questions. Stephen, as we wind down, the first one I've asked you a couple of times now, since this is, I believe, a three P for the podcast. Yes. And that question is, what does it mean to be a man? To be a man is to own your God given design and step into the full power of manhood masculinity, what it means for the glory of God and the sake of those around you. To understand how to nurture yourself as a man in private, so to speak, so that you step up onto the stage of your role in your family, your role in society. And you are the walking in the full power of God, what God has made you to be. It's powerful. It's powerful. I like that. Well, how do we connect with you and learn more about what you're doing? And then of course, pick up a copy of the book. Thanks for asking my website, Stephen Mansfield.tv. All of my social media is Mansfield writes. So Twitter is at Mansfield writes, et cetera. Just Mansfield, my last name and writes, WRITES. And also I have a podcast and a website from in greatman.tv, the greatman podcast. And I'm really excited about this new book, Midon Fire. I want you guys to get it, get extra copies, pass it around. Let's make a difference in some lives. Right on. Well, I have a test of a testament for this book. I've read it myself. It's a good book. And also your podcast, which I listen to every single week. So it's so both are great resources. Stephen, I just want to tell you, I really appreciate you. I appreciate your your mentorship direct and indirect, you know, mentorship, counsel, guidance. You've been a you've been a good friend. You've been a good ally.
