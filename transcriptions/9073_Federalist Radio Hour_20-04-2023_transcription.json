    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Jaczynski, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Make sure to subscribe to the premium version of our website, too. We're joined today by the one and only Liz Wheeler, who's here in person at the Federalist side, Core, there's Liz, host of the Liz Wheeler Show, of course. Thank you for joining us. Thank you for having me. You guys have a cool setup here. Cool is one word for it. Ram Shackle might be another. You have a crazy situation unfolding right now, not surprising, not unpredictable, but crazy nonetheless, because you're slated to speak at James Madison University on the 26th of April. As you just mentioned, already, not just like the day before, which is typical of campus lectures, but already a week before, as we're talking today, things are getting really, really heated. The speech is titled The Ideology of Transgenderism. In disclosure, I think it is sponsored by Young America's Foundation, where I work part of time and they just do such a fantastic job with these events. Liz, what is already happening? A week before, you're supposed to come to campus and give a perfectly reasonable speech with a dissenting viewpoint from the campus consensus on what transgenderism is. This is going to be a really fun event. There is a lot of discussion. There's a lot of protests that are already cropping up. We will be streaming it live online, just for anybody who is not able to be there in person, so it will be next Wednesday, April 26th at 6pm. I did just get a strike against my YouTube channel, so TBD, where this will be live stream, but you can go to YAF TV, that their YouTube channel to watch it live streaming. Yeah, this speech is so funny to hear the response from the transgender activists on campus. We have the James Madison University debate team issued a statement condemning me and condemning this conversation. That was my particular favorite because it's the debate team. It's the debate team. I read their whole statement. It was very long. If I'm the coach of their debate team, I would not have been proud of the statement. The reason that they don't want me to come to campus is because they say I'm not a good to faith. I'm not taking a good faith position here. I'm really, truly interested. I hope they show up to the speech. I'm really, truly interested to ask them what they mean by that. There's of course a lot of transgender activists who are saying that I'm hateful. I don't hate anyone. I don't hate transgender people or people who identify as transgender. I don't hate people who suffer from gender dysphoria. I actually cared deeply about these people. That's why I want to go and talk to them. There was a state representative actually from Connecticut who is an alumni of JMU, I believe, who accused me of saying that I want to eradicate transgender people or I want them not to exist. This is my question for all the people who are going to be outside. I think there's going to be this quote unquote queer safe space with maybe with some transgender people there. I don't know if it's exactly a drag show. I'm not super clear on what that protest is going to be. But there's clearly going to be some protests. But my question for the students, especially given the lies that are being told, I of course never said any such thing, is this woman is willing to tell you this lie. It's demonstrably false. If she's willing to tell you this lie, what else has she lied to you about? What else has the left lied to you about? What else is queer theory lying to you about? You and I know that the transgender ideology is a lie. We know that men are men and women are women and a man can't be a woman just because he feels like one and a woman can't be a man just because she wants to identify as a man. That's not based in reality. It's not real. And so when you step back from this, you realize, okay, well, somebody's telling a lie here. I'm sitting here and saying, I don't hate transgender people. Of course I don't. I'm saying I actually care deeply about you. I love you as fellow children of God. The transgender ideology, the activists are saying the same thing to these people. They're saying, we love you. We want to take care of you. We have the best interest. Both things can't be true because what we want for these people are radically different. They're an opposite ends of the spectrum. So what that leaves is a situation where one of us is lying. It's either me or it's them. And what I want to talk to these students, both the students that already are going to agree with me, these wonderful students from the Young America's Foundation who have courageously put on this event, despite the intense backlash from their fellow students. And also all of those people who are so upset, who feel that my presence on their campus is a form of quote unquote violence, which of course, I say this laughing ladies, of course it's not, of course it's not violence at all. It's of course free speech, but it's more than that. I'm there because I care about, I care about you. I'm there because I want the best for your life. And if you're given this situation where one of us is lying to you, I want to make the case that the people lying to the students are the queer theorists. And that case of course between you and I know is a very easy case to make. But I want, I want to reach the hearts of these students. I want to reach the minds of these students who are being exploited by queer theorists. Queer theory, as we know, is not just the idea of tolerance and inclusion and equality under the law. We all agree with that. People want equal rights for all people. We don't want people discriminated against and deprived basic human rights based on their lifestyle choices. But queer theory is not inclusion and tolerance and equality. Queer theory is a Marxist ideology. Some people listening may be like, well, that's a little bit extreme. It's not queer theory. If you look into the origins, it poses this idea that LGBTQIA people are so marginalized that they need to revolt against their so-called oppressors. This is the classic Marxist dialectic. And the oppressors in this situation are painted to be the white, straight, cis, Christian people. And so when we see this agitation on campus, these transgender activists that are claiming that my words are violence and claiming that they need to do something to stop my hate speech, this is exactly what queer theory is calling for. And that's why I'm going to campus to tell them the truth. It's so important when people accuse you of being hateful to say, no, you're thinking of Michael Knulls. I'm kidding. Of course. Michael did a great job in the ISI debate this week between him and the people. Yeah, that stuff was crazy, huh? Fantastic. I actually was going to ask you about queer theory next because you've been talking about it a lot recently, which is helpful because I think if people haven't been on a college campus in the last 10, 15 years, they may have never encountered queer theory by that name. It's seeped into pop culture, of course. But queer theory is you've been looking into it. Tell us more about the kind of cultural Marxism that's behind it and tell us more about where we have seen it start to take over popular culture, academia, and the way that we approach each other as human beings, basically. Yes. Yeah. So Emily, I got to tell you, this is such a black hole, like this black hole of nastyness to go down. I've read the founding documents. I've read the quote unquote academic, academic dissertations on queer theory. And what I would explain it to people, how I would explain to the people that we're talking to today is five years ago, maybe not even five years ago, two years ago, three years ago, when critical race theory started to become prominent, we didn't know what critical race theory was, right? We understood that this poisonous idea that was being taught to our children, that white children are racist just inherently based on the fact that they're white and black children are oppressed based just on their skin color, that we understood that this was bad, that this was wrong. This is to be taught to our children. And meanwhile, as we were recognizing that this was bad and asking, well, where did this come from? What is this? And how did it become so pervasive in our schools and in our corporations and in our culture? At the same time, the left was telling us that critical race theory was just teaching history accurately. You know, they said, Oh, if critical race theory is nothing more than making sure that students are educated and knowing that some things that happened in the United States around race before the civil rights movement and obviously slavery, the founding of our country were not good things to happen. And so you had this, this confusing ball of a narrative that needed to be untangled. And eventually we were able to completely disentangle truth from falsehood. And we were able to establish that note that that the principle that was being taught to children that white kids are racist and black kids are oppressed, that's critical race theory. It's not history. Critical race theory is a neo Marxist ideology that's actually intent. The intent of it, the goal of it is the same thing as queer theory. The goal of it is to pit one demographic of people, black people against another demographic, white people in order to create this revolution. So queer theory is the same thing. It is a neo Marxist critical theory. And if you read the founding document, it's called thinking sex. It's written by a big fat lesbian named Gail Rubin. It's the most disturbing document queer theory posits. All of the things that children are being taught about gender identity, it contends that there is no such thing as biological sex, that gender is a spectrum, that it is how you identify all of these things that are associated. We see this in schools now too, and parents are like, wait a second, we don't want children taught about this stuff. We don't want neo pronouns. They, them, Z's, or none of that stuff. And we're at the exact same point with queer theory as we were with critical race theory, where parents are like, that's bad, that's wrong, we don't want it with our children. And we're untangling where it came from. So where it came from, like critical race theory, the fund, the ideological underpinning of the transgender ideology is queer theory. But queer theory doesn't just stop at the destructive narratives around the reality of sex and gender. Queer theory advocates for the sexualization of children. Queer theory advocates, defends the, the authoress of this founding document of queer theory, defends child pornography, defends outright pedophilia, expresses sympathy for pedophiles who are put in prison and says that we as a culture, 20 years down the road, are going to regret imprisoning men who quote unquote love underage youth. Like, does that just make your stomach turn? It's absolutely disgusting. And the point of this, the point of this queer, of this queer theory is not what the left says. Just like the left says, oh, critical race theory is teaching about slavery, teaching history. The left says queer theory is about inclusion and tolerance and equality. It is not. It is about creating one demographic, agitating one demographic, telling them that they're so marginalized. We saw this trans day of visibility, the trans day of vengeance. They're telling them that they're on the verge of a genocide. They're telling them that they, they're not safe in spaces. They're putting the fear of an existential extinction in their, in their bodies and their hearts and their minds. And we all know what that feels like to feel that fear. It's, it's awful. And it does. It creates desperation. And that's exactly what queer theorists want. They want that fear, that, that, that exploitation of a vulnerability of the mental health issues that these children and young people feel. And they want those people to revolt. They want those LGBTQ identifying people to revolt against our, our conventional narrative. And I say conventional narrative because that's a prevailing narrative is the, the Marxist term for it against the prevailing narrative on sex and gender, which is reality, it's biology. It's oriented in Judeo-Christian values. It is what our society is built on. Right. The goal, the ultimate goal of queer theory, like critical race theory is the destruction of our society. Mm hmm. And this is a really important point. And why I really liked the title of your speech, the ideology of transgenderism because there is an ideology behind it. Now tell us how it's, I think this is crucial. They get from point A to point B when it comes, it comes to sex and gender and then child pornography, normalizing pedophilia. And then, logically, take us on that train that they go down to get from point A to point B because that I think is at the heart of everything here. It is. That's why we're seeing the drag queen story hours at public libraries where men dressed up as women and not just as normal women in these sexualized caricatures of women often scantily clad are reading and performing for toddlers and preschoolers. That's why we see the drag shows for children. I mean, everyone has seen this. This is a, this is the controversy of the day. It's across the country even like banning these, banning these drag shows for children because it's inappropriate. You wouldn't take your child to a strip club. You're not allowed. You wouldn't take your child into a, into a, into a bar. You're not allowed. You wouldn't take your child to a casino. You're not allowed. Why are you allowed to take your child to this? Well, queer theory hinges on the complete destruction of all social sexual mores, right? And so they specifically target the sexual innocence of children, the innocence overall of children. They understand that in order to, in order to transform children, transform children from what they are right now, which is a part of a family unit, a nuclear family unit. And they are being, they are being taught and formed and shaped by their parents and their parents values in order to separate children from parents, which is a communist Marxist thing, right? That's a tenant of communism and Marxism is the collective rearing of children. It's the destruction of the nuclear family. They understand that in order to do that, they first have to tell children that their identity is inherently bad. This is what they do with critical race theory. They tell children, listen, you're white and it's not because of anything you've done, anything you've said, anything you feel. It's just because the sins of other white people who lived hundreds of years before you and you benefit from the privilege of the oppression that they inflicted on black people, they're, you're irredeemable. There's nothing you can do to escape the privilege that, that you experience and the privilege, meaning what they mean when they say privilege is that you're perpetuating that oppression to this day on other people, but there's nothing you can do about it because the institutional structures are in place. So they come in and they create this literal identity crisis in children, right? Children have this self loathing and they turn against their parents. They hate their parents for this because who made them in this bad identity? Their parents did. Their parents made them in this bad identity. So then queer theory comes in and offers them redemption, offers to pick these children up off the floor after their identity has been destroyed. And it says, listen, you don't have to be an oppressor. You don't have to be a bad person. You can choose to be part of the marginalized, which as we know, for a long time in our culture, victims have been elevated. The left is celebrated victimhood. They've made that a badge of honor. It's not something that you overcome. It's not something that you are proud to have abandoned. It becomes part of your identity in leftist ideology. Queer theory comes in and tells these young children if you just choose to be queer. If you reject the institutional norms that your parents and your grandparents have handed down these same people that the children are told have been oppressing people throughout the ages, then you can actually be redeemed. And in the course of doing this, the only thing that you have, the only thing that children have to give up is fealty to their family, to their God and to their country. And so through, I call it a one, two punch. First comes critical race theory, then comes queer theory. And it is an incredibly effective grooming tactic to transform children into Marxist revolutionaries. And so the destruction of the innocence of children is a key part of this. So can we talk about why moral relativism and the destruction of truth that comes with moral relativism is absolutely the key block. It was like the first domino to fall that led us to right now because it seems like when you really probe queer theory, you end up at that same spot that there is no one truth. Yeah. Well, I mean, and this has been something that we've seen in our culture for decades, for a couple of decades, moral relativism. I mean, in the early 2000s, that was the culture war, right? Like, that's morally relativistic. Like that was the worst insult that you could get. But that's just a precursor. They were paving the way for the destruction of truth. Without destruction of truth, critical race theory wouldn't be possible. Queer theory wouldn't be possible and Marxism wouldn't be possible. That's why you can go all the way back to Marx and Engels, the original Marxists, to look at what they wanted to do. They knew they had to destroy objective reality. They knew they had to destroy. I mean, Marxism is at its core an atheistic ideology. And it's maybe even worse than atheistic ideology because it's not just a repudiation of Christianity and of God. It's a repudiate. It's in some ways a satanic ideology because it has to be, right? It has to be in order to reject natural law. Our nation, and I know this is really unpopular with libertarians and full disclosure, I have had such a transformation from my previously libertarian roots. I think we all write embrace libertarianism in our early 20s when we were like, yeah, don't do anything. Get off my lawn. And I realize that that's a historical in our country, right? Historically in our country, yes, the Declaration of Independence might have been based in a more libertarian idea that the government should be as absolutely as limited as possible and less. And their role is only to protect our country from foreign threat and to protect people's rights. But truthfully, the Constitution is not based on libertarianism at all. It's based more in an Edmund Burke philosophy. And Edmund Burke's philosophy was that liberty, ordered liberty, he defined liberty as not absolute liberty, but as justice, that a society rooted in ordered liberty is a society that pursues justice. And so the natural question there is to ask, okay, but what is justice then? Well, Edmund Burke defined justice as uppercase original justice, justice that just derives from the author of original justice, which is an acknowledgement that natural law exists within us all. So our nation was actually founded. Our Constitution is rooted in the idea that we as a people, you don't have to worship God. If you don't want your free to do that, we're not a theocracy, but our nation was rooted in the acknowledgement of natural law, the acknowledgement in the reality of a creator and the reality that the creator created for us. And so I know this is a long, a long circle, but bringing it back to moral relativism, moral relativism. When I say it's atheistic, when I say it's satanic, when when you have an ideology that has in its, in its object, the destruction of reality that that ideology is actually trying to destroy natural law. And the only, the only thing that tries to destroy natural law, knowing that it is of God, is the one who hates God. And so our country, I mean, this, I know this is heavy stuff. I know people a lot of times don't want to mix religion and politics. They want to say like, yeah, great, let's protect religious liberty, but politics should be as secular as possible. I just don't, I don't believe in that anymore. I don't believe that that's possible to have a thriving, prosperous nation where we've completely, we've completely rejected reality because when you reject reality, this is what you get. You get queer theory, you get critical race theory. And the only actual way to build a society around reality is to examine what is reality. And when you examine it without bias, you find that the answer to what reality is, is natural law, which is from God. Yeah, there's no consensus in a morally relativistic world. There's either a consensus that there is no consensus in anarchy or the government has a monopoly on everything. Exactly. And then it's kind of... And what is that? Right. And I always call that if politicians, just through voting, have the power to redefine words, then they're, they become the arbiters of truth. And if they're the arbiters of truth, if that is even, if that is such a thing, then that's authoritarian. Yeah. And that's exactly what they want. Right. Right. Exactly. And this is really interesting because I think there's something to be said about taking a message like this onto a college campus that is different than the way that I think maybe conservatives of generation before us were communicating. And that's not to say some people were doing... I mean, there are a lot of people that were doing this very well, but coming in and saying, I don't hate you. This ideology hates you. Yes. And this is bad for you. Yeah. This is not compassionate. That I think is really powerful right now. And I want to ask you about your experience, not just on campus, but as someone who's super popular online, talking in stark bold terms about these problems. Is that drawing? You think more people, more people's curiosity and more people who maybe have been saturated in this secular culture to say, you know, there's like a truth shaped hole inside of me, not just a God shaped hole, but also truth shaped hole. Come on. I need someone to write. Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yeah. I think, listen, there are a lot of people and I don't necessarily mean this, me, this negatively, but there are a lot of people in politics who are sensationalists. They say things just to be bombastic, just to get clicks. And this is true on both sides of the aisle. And I have always, from the beginning of my career, committed to letting the truth be sensational and not not to engage in sensationalism or bombastic behavior, because I don't think that that's an honest way to I don't think that that's the way that I want to behave in, in what I'm doing. That being said, I am very blunt. That's how I am in my regular life, right? Like outside of politics. You can just ask my husband, ask my sisters. She just corrected Chris Bedford on some tenets of Catholicism before we started taping. And Bedford is an audience favorite. So listeners will be glad to know that. We'll have to do an episode on that because I'm pretty sure he's wrong. And I'm Catholic too, by the way. We were arguing about confession. This is going to go off on a tangent real quick. It was awesome. I love to watch him be wrong. He could be right. He could be right, but that remains to be seen. Da, da, da, pregnant pause. But yeah, that's the. Oh, the boldness. The boldness of the bluntness and the bombastic. Yes. It's more compassionate. It is. But I think it's worth doing at the same time because it's true, right? I talk about this often. Like when we were talking about this speech, when we were preparing for this speech, my team and I preparing for this speech, what we do is we talk about what's the purpose of us being there? What do we, what do we, you know, these these wonderful students that invite us from YAF? What do they want to hear? What do they want from their campus? Why are they fighting this fight? Who is the opposition? And what are they opposed to? Where is their misunderstanding? Where is their pain? Where is their trauma? The left has been very effective at harnessing and weaponizing emotion and pain in people to point people towards, towards political policies, politicians and personal ideology that's ultimately self-destructive. And I mean, I know that this is an age old tactic to exploit people's emotions, but these young people are hurting. You don't engage in queer theory. You don't mutilate your body in the name of the transgender ideology. You don't reject the basis of who you are if you haven't already been violated. If you haven't already been traumatized. I mean, my heart breaks for these, for these young people because often they're suffering from other comorbidities, right? They're suffering from anxiety and depression and bipolar and maybe schizophrenia and gender disorders, disassociative disorders. I can't imagine that. I do try to put myself in the shoes of people who are suffering and people who have embraced a different ideology because I want to understand why they did that, why they embraced that. And the more I look into it, it makes me feel emotional actually because the more I look into it, oftentimes these young people who take on these new identities have been horribly abused. They've been sexually abused. They've been physically abused. And what often happens in those situations is that creates, and this is like a post-traumatic reaction is that creates this self-loathing. They hate this body that betrayed them. They hate this body that was abused by someone else because it was violated and rejected by someone else and they feel gross. They feel used. They feel damaged. And what ends up happening as a coping mechanism is they try to disassociate from that body. If only they could escape this body, they wouldn't have been violated. If only they could escape this body, they wouldn't have been abused. Someone else did it. That means it makes them feel dirty. It makes them feel bad. It breaks my heart to think of these young people feeling like this. And so what they do is they're vulnerable because they're already wanting to disassociate from this trauma that's been inflicted on them. And here comes this evil ideology, these evil people propagating queer theory, telling them that the answer to their trauma is to actually reject their body and to mutilate their body with pharmaceuticals and surgery. And that's so evil. It's so evil to use those children that have been hurting. And so I'm not just saying that I care about these students because I want to surprise them by saying that. I'm not just saying, oh, someone's lying to you because I'm trying to win a political debate. I care deeply about these young people. I care deeply about their bodies and their minds and their souls and they're being used. They're being harmed. They're being irrevocably damaged. And the truth of the matter is it's never going to make them feel physically better. It's never going to make them feel emotionally better. It's never going to make them spiritually better. What's going to happen is the left is going to use them. As essentially cultural kamikazees and discard them. Discard them. We see this with the young people who have transitioned and regret the D transitioners. Queer theorists just abandoned them. They don't care about the feelings that they're feeling now. They don't care about this identity crisis they're suffering. Now they already use them and abuse them and discard at them. And that's so evil. I can't stand by and let that happen. I want to talk directly to these students who have been hurt and tell them that there's a better way. This reminds me of a point you've also been making about the Bud Light boycotts because the media has treated this as a silly side show. Conservatives fermenting the culture war. Of course, completely missing that conservatives are in response. We're on our heels. We're responding to something that the left at Bud Light did. The left at this massive corporation did. But on that note, why is it so important from your perspective for conservatives to take this seriously, even though it's as unserious as an actual man in a dress pretending to be a woman in a very offensive way sponsored, of course, by a major corporation, many major corporations in fact, what in this particular case when it comes to Bud Light is important for conservatives to understand. Yeah. And this is a really interesting one. I'm glad you brought this up because this is another area that I've changed my mind in the last 10 years. I used to think that when conservatives boycotted businesses and corporations, I used to think it was kind of a waste of time. I actually tell this story that when I was, this might have been when I was in late high school or early college, when I kind of just started dipping my toe in political activism, there was this list that went around of corporations and companies that were donating to Planned Parenthood, like behind the scenes. And this is going to maybe sound like such a dork, but I shopped at Coles a lot back then. And Coles was one of the companies that donated to Planned Parenthood. The first political activism I did was pro-life activism. That's like the, you know, what, what right is more important than you write to life. And I remember thinking, well, I'm not going to boycott Coles, not just because I was like in love with their stuff, but just because the amount of time that it would have taken me to establish like brands that fit and stores that I liked, because I'm not like a natural shopper. So that wasn't something enjoyable for me. The amount of time that it would have taken for me to actually boycott them and to find and research, which businesses didn't do that stuff, I was like, the opportunity cost doesn't make sense to me because I could spend that much time and more doing direct political activism for pro-life causes that would be more effective. And so I generally thought that that was true for a lot of this stuff, right? I generally thought like, I don't know if your time is being well spent trying to boycott a grocery store, having to go to five or six different grocery stores. And you could actually spend those three hours at a crisis pregnancy center or work and donate that money to something that would be a little bit more direct change. That's my old view. And I've discarded it for the most book for her. Because I no longer think that it's just this fractional part of these corporations. We are at a very serious pivotal point in our culture right now where these large corporations like Ann Heiser Bush, the parent company of Budweiser of Bud Light, are choosing to propagate this neo-Marxist ideology that we talked about. And we as the American people can sit back and we can say, well, they're doing this because they care more about their ESG rating than they do about their bottom line. But there is a certain point that you can acknowledge that, well, yes, they do care about their ESG rating and they may be willing to sacrifice some of their bottom line. But we have not gone over the edge to ESG so far that businesses don't care at all about their ESG rating. I mean, look at Disney, right? Like they obviously care about their ESG rating. They obviously care about their corporate equality index or whatever that I think that's the specific metric for trans activism. But they wouldn't have changed their CEO, right? Disney if they didn't care at all about the actual business part, they wouldn't care it. Like they cared when they lost 2 million subscribers from Disney plus like they cared. Even if they also care about the other stuff, they still care. That's the same with Ann Heiser Bush. Like this is an important moment not to change Ann Heiser Bush's mind. They're already entrenched in this and they would just take unbelievable cultural pummeling from the left if they walked it back. But what this is going to do is it's going to tell every other corporation in this country, listen, if you embrace a neo-Marxist ideology, if you put an actual dude wearing a sports bra and pretending he's a girl, taking that opportunity away from a woman who could have gotten that job, if you do that, you can. It's a free country, but we're not going to buy your stuff and you're going to see your stock price plummet. What was it? $6 billion. It was a lot of money. A lot of money. And so other corporations are going to be a little bit slower to do that because how are you going to justify that? How's the CEO going to justify that to the board? When walking into it, you know what it costs your business. That would have to be a specific calculation, a risk analysis, a risk benefit analysis. And I think it's sort of just to keep it up. Like what are we willing to sell these children's bodies for a small amount of money that Ann Heiser Bush gives to Republican politicians? They don't even donate exclusively to Republicans. It's like 60% to Republicans, 40% to Democrats. Yeah. And it was like $500,000 in one election cycle. Yeah. Like I'm sorry that's not that much money for an election. I am not willing to sell children's bodies and our country to Marxism for half a million dollars. Please. And also by the way, an important point. This is in response to some people on the right who have said Ann Heiser Bush is one of the good guys because they do give to Republicans and they have somewhat resisted the temptation to dive head first into the pool of Wokism. First of all, I don't think that's true. They have been sponsoring Pride stuff for a really long time. Secondly, that's how corporations advertise now. It's how they get you is they do this stuff superficially and then they complete like they'll give money to Republicans and then completely undermine Republican ideas precisely so that you defend them in moments like this one. It's how they it's how they do business. It's like the commercial that they release right in the right after Dylan Mulvaney. You see their pro America commercial. It was beautiful. By the way, cinematic masterpiece of an advertisement. Very moving, very touching, but I just felt grossed out after I was like, don't pander to me. Don't pretend that you actually appreciate American values when what you're doing on a much larger scale by hiring the most prominent transgender activists in our country who actually went to the White House to ask the president whether states should be allowed to ban surgical or bodily mutilation, the transgender surgeries on children. Like this is a political activist. We're talking about a powerful influential political activist. Don't hire that person and make them in the face of your company and then pretend that you embrace American values. That's not true. It's also by the way, if you want to like zoom out and be philosophical about it, it doesn't matter if you have a history in your life as an individual or history as a corporation of acting one way. Like every day is a new choice, right? So maybe they were a little bit more Republican or a little bit more conservative in the past, but it doesn't mean that that's what they're doing now. They've made a bad choice now. They shouldn't ignore that just because they give a little bit of money to Republican candidates or just because they made good choices in the past. And they have a marketing VP who's out there on the circuit talking about how important it is to be inclusive or whatever. She just sounded like completely ridiculous. She's like a college professor, like a queer theory professor. Oh, there you go. Maybe that could be your next job. Yes. Well, on that note, Liz, I just want to sort of close out this conversation by asking if you're hopeful, because what you mentioned about how many of us have undergone this transformation from sort of live and left, live and left, let live libertarianism. That's the best way to sort of protect our family, protect our community is to get the federal government out of our business, et cetera, et cetera, to an understanding that there are some truths. We need to have consensus. We need to have legal consensus and we need to have constitutional protections for. Does that lead you to a point where you feel like the tide is turning? There's plenty of reason for optimism or is it the case that these Budweiser examples that crop up every single day, it seems like, there's a new corporation sponsoring Dylan Mulvaney or whatever else. Does that, are you feeling in the aggregate optimistic or pessimistic? Well, if I were too pessimistic, I wouldn't be doing what I was doing, right? Like this is it. I wouldn't be fighting a fight if I thought it was a losing battle. So I think we can win, but I don't think it's as easy as a lot of people assume. I don't think it's as easy as a lot of conservatives and Republicans assume it is. It's not when we saw, by the way, this we saw an example of this in the 2022 midterms, where we won conservatives and Republicans won public opinion against Joe Biden, right? Because of inflation, gas prices, what he'd done in Afghanistan, everything. People didn't like Joe Biden. There was a high level of dissatisfaction, even among gunemocrats, when they went to the polls. And yet Republicans did not accomplish the red tsunami that we were anticipating and that we were hopeful that we would that we would experience. And the reason for that is because people are no longer making decisions based on just their immediate day to day day to day experiences. They're not saying, well, I guess Joe Biden failed man gas prices. It's costing me more for my family. I'm going to vote Republican because the Republican brand has been so vilified politically and culturally that we have a huge, we have a huge deficit to fill. We have a huge disadvantage there that if we don't address, if we don't address the branding and the messaging of the Republican Party, then we're not going to get very far regardless of how bad the Democrats make our daily lives. And in order to address that messaging, in order to rebrand Republicanism, we have to sit down and ask ourselves the question, well, what is conservatism? What is republicanism? Are we standing for libertarian ideology or are we standing for true conservative ideology? Are we the intellectual descendants of John Locke or are we the intellectual descendants of Edmund Burke? And if we don't have that discussion, if we don't have the discussion that you and I had a couple minutes ago about what is liberty? Being either absolute liberty is close to the wild of nature as possible that you can have in a civilized society. It's more libertarian or an ordered society with liberty based on the definition of justice, deriving from natural life. We don't sit down and have this quite literal come to Jesus moment for our country, then no, we're not going to be able to defeat the left because libertarianism cannot defeat the left. The Republican Party that abandons cultural issues and is too afraid to fight the social issue battles, we're not going to defeat Marxism because Marxism is committed. Marxism is unrelenting and the only bulwark against that is a society that embraces reality to its core. And this is not going to be an easy thing for Republicans to do because you do have to understand that there's a crossover then between religious truth and politics. If we want to win, if we want to defeat the left, if we want to restore our country to what it was when it was the greatest country that the world has ever known, then we have to do it the right way. If we do it, we'll win. If we don't, if we're too lazy, if we're too cowardly, then I don't know if we can. And I do have one more question because you just mentioned a lot of building blocks that should be the foundation of our society, but it has to be tough to even make the argument the case you just made that most Americans would have agreed on 30 years ago when people don't even know what you're talking about when you say things like ordered liberty. Yeah, I know. I know. And that's why on my show, I talk about, I oftentimes try to structure these types of conversations into two-part conversations where first we're talking about the what it is. If we're talking about queer theory, we say, well, listen, we don't want kids at drag shows. It's like, it's okay to say that. It's also okay to say that men aren't women and can't be even if they identify as that. And first talk about those things and then unpack the ideology behind it because there is a tremendous amount of education. I'm very fortunate that this is my job. This is what I do for a living. So I get to spend my days researching these things. And what I do is I try to synthesize the information that I learn into these 45-minute podcast that air every day so that people who are out raising their families and building their futures and working hard in their jobs and enjoying life can also understand what can understand the ideology behind it. Because it is. These phrases are new, right? Edmund Burke and John Locke. Well, what do they believe? You probably couldn't define it. Sometimes we even have a hard time defining what wokeism is, even if we recognize it. And that's okay. That's okay. It doesn't mean that it's unknowable. It doesn't mean that it's insurmountable. It does mean that it requires a little bit more of us as conservatives and Republicans to become educated in these areas so that we can properly not just diagnose the problem of society. We've already done that, but prescribe a solution. So what I try to do is after we've acknowledged the reality of the political enemy that we face and we have to first diagnose that, then we prescribe the solution and part of that solution is understanding some of the, I hate to use this phrase because I think that it's coined actually by leftist, but the political science of the thing. Yes. Right. The ideology. I cannot stand that phrase. It's a very scientific world of politics. Yes. Yes. Kind of. They love to call everything political science. They do. But it's more political philosophy, I suppose that's a better way to phrase it. I think Hillsdale calls their degree politics and not political science because this instinct is to quantify things that are not quantifiable. Yeah. And I don't want to, I don't want to say this because I'm only 98% sure here, but I'm pretty sure the guy who coined the term political science was a techn, like, was an actual proponent of technocracy. Yeah. I think that's correct. But who knows? We're just, we're just talking here. Yeah. Two things I have to fact check. I have to fact check Chris Bedford on his confession. Yes. On his list of mortal sins. Yeah. And then the guy trying to think who it was. But that's normal. That's normal for the show's fact checking back for it. We have to do it after every episode. That is not every week. So this is not unusual for us at all. Well, we can't recommend the Liz Wheeler show enough here because exactly everything you just said was you really break things down for people. So make sure to check out the Liz Wheeler show. If you're in the area, Liz is going to be at James Madison University on April 26th, giving the speech called the ideology of transgenderism. Super, super interesting. We can't wait to see how it goes down and we hope you stay safe, Liz. Thank you. Thank you. It's going to be a great time. I hope everyone who's in the area can come. If you're not in the area, please watch. We're going to livestream it. You can go to youtube.com slash YAF TV. It'll be 6 p.m. Eastern at James Madison University on Wednesday, April 26th. It's going to be a good time. Thanks for joining the show, Liz. Thanks, Emily. All right. You've been listening to another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Duchinsky, culture editor here at The Federalist. We'll be back soon with more. Until then, be lovers of freedom and anxious for the fray."
