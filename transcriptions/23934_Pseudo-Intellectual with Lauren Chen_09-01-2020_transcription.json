    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show today. We are going to be talking. Hey guys, welcome back to the show. My name is Lauren and this is Liam. Hello. Thank you so much for joining us for our first live show in like a month. I can't believe it's been a long time. Yeah. So we have a lot to talk about today. First off, Ricky Gervais roasted celebrities, journalists are mad because of course then around in US, I have quite a bit to say about that. Then we're going to be talking about representation in games, apparently not enough female shooters out there. And then finally, we're going to be finishing off the show with exposing antifa, which I'm excited for. It's going to be fun.

Not only you get a great product, but you also get to support the show. If you guys haven't checked them out yet, please do that. All right. So Ricky Gervais, I'm a fan of Ricky Gervais, his special, I think it's called humanity on Netflix. You've been trying to get me to watch. I have been trying to get you to watch. I might do it at some point. It's funny. Yeah, it's funny. We're going to get into this. It used to be very cringy, like atheist cringe. You know, there's still some atheist cringe there. And that's what I'm going to. I don't agree with everything he says, but even when I don't, it's he's still a funny person. And I feel like there are some journalists, which we will get to who apparently that's not possible for like unless someone's towing the line that they like, they're incapable of laughing, which is too bad. This past Sunday was the Golden Globe Awards. If you're anything like me and most people out there, you did not watch this. Or were you even aware of it as the question? I was not aware of it until I saw it trending on Twitter. I had no idea. Yeah. And apparently this is like one of the lowest rate. I feel like every new award show is one of the lowest rated award shows that we have. But what I did enjoy watching, I think a lot of people did was the clips of Ricky Gervais, who hosted just tearing, shredding into all the celebrities that were in attendance. It was so good. So there are so many clips that have gone viral on Twitter, especially people were sharing them. If you haven't seen his monologue and I guess some of him presenting, you can find stuff on social media or even YouTube. We have some short clips here that we're going to play just if you haven't seen it. I still recommend you check out the whole thing though. And we're going to cross our fingers that we don't get copyright claim because wouldn't that just be a nice welcome back to your live show? But here we go. Please YouTube. I mean, nice. You could binge watch the entire first season of afterlife instead of watching this show. That that's a show about a man who wants to kill himself because his wife dies of cancer and it's still more fun than this. Okay? Spoiler alert, season two is on the way. So in the end, he obviously didn't kill himself, just like Jeffrey Epstein. Shout out. I know he's your friend, but I don't care. So I thought that was hilarious. I don't think the celebrities in the room thought as much, but I thought that was good. And also, by the way, before I forget, because apparently it's been a while since we did this, if you are a live viewer, we will be getting to your super chats about an hour into the show. So stay on the stream. We're going to be going over your comments, questions, concerns, and all of that. And that is also a great way to support the show. If you care to do that. Also like, share, subscribe, hopefully by now you guys know the drill. So yeah, the next clip is the one that I think got the most attention. Again, it's hard because it's it's about a minute thing. We can include all of it, but this is where he really tore into the virtue signaling that celebrities like to do during their acceptance speeches. Apple roared into the TV game with a morning show, a superb drama. Yeah. A superb drama about the importance of dignity and doing the right thing made by a company that runs sweatshops in China. So what you say you woke, but the companies you work for, I mean, unbelievable. Apple, Amazon, Disney, if ISIS started a streaming service, you'd call your agent, wouldn't you? So if you do win an award tonight, don't use it as a platform to make a political speech, right? You're in no position to lecture the public about anything. You know nothing about the real world. So everybody loved his material. Like everybody. I mean, on Twitter, this stuff has millions of views at the clips on YouTube, just enormous ratio of thumbs up to the thumbs down. I think he gained something like 300 Twitter followers after these clips began circulating. Yeah, sorry, 300,000 followers, 300 big numbers. No, but 300,000 new Twitter followers. Once these clips began circulating, everyone online was saying how funny and how refreshing it was how this is so needed. Like people are tired of all the, I don't know, the holier than thou celebrity speeches. And he just calls them out. And it's great. There was a lot of, I think, forced laughter in that room and uncomfortable, flapping and like smiling that they didn't really mean it. Well, I mean, but it was fun to see you and you have to remember, right? He's presenting the Golden Globes, but there, his audience, the people he had in mind, were not the celebrities that were in the room. No, right. And that's something that I heard some journalists criticize. It's like, he didn't really get any last. He got a ton of laughs at home for the people who was actually, I think, targeting. He wasn't telling these jokes to those celebrities. He was talking to all the people at home who I think the evidence goes to show overwhelmingly loved it. You know what makes me sad though, is that Tom Hanks is like the guy that they have all the photos of him doing. And I don't know. I don't know anything about Tom Hanks's personal views, but I by default love him. Yeah, he's Tom Hanks. Right. He's just the best. So he wasn't impressed like that. Yeah, but I liked Adam Driver seemed like he was laughing pretty hard. Leonardo DiCaprio, who Ricky Gervais took shots at specifically for dating. He's like 50. He dates like 20 year olds. He was at least laughing at that, which is good. He's starting to look like Jack Nicholson a little bit. Yeah, he's not as cute as he was during his Titanic days. No, I mean, still obviously not an ugly guy, but he peaked anyway. So we have a bunch of journalists here who were not happy with Ricky Gervais, which I was kind of one feeling to understand why I saw people even trying to call him right wing. It's like, no, making fun of celebrities does not make you right or left wing. That's just that that's not a thing that exists. But I think ultimately Ricky Gervais, he was making fun of rich out of touch elites who don't know what they're talking about and love to virtue signal to like regular people about issues they actually contribute to. And I think the reason why some journalists reacted badly to that is because that also describes them. So I feel like they took it personally because pretty much everything he was saying about celebrities could also apply to the like kind of blue check mark lefty journalist Twitter class. Yeah, no, I agree. And it's also exactly their message that they're hoping to see propagated by these celebrities at every one of these events. Yeah, they support these messages. Okay, so we have this here from Bob Chipman. The fake slef self-flagellating let's have Gervais roast people LOL thing has turned into the grossest faux populist spectacle outside the razis and razis are bad. Posh Brit reheating leftover for 10 dunks on marginalized people whose wealth is supposed to make it okay. Okay, so there's nothing marginalized about the celebrities who get invited to the golden globe. Like let's just clarify this. I'm not one who kind of buys into the hole. You have privilege by virtue of like race or gender or anything like that. But if you are a celebrity at the golden, like you're not you're not marginalized. I think the whole wealth thing is one of the few places where it's like privilege is real. You guys are millionaires. You're wearing clothes that probably cost more than most people's cars. These people are not marginalized. We also have a particularly salty piece by the LA Times. Politics reigned at the Golden Globes. Too bad Ricky Gervais didn't notice. I think he did notice actually. And I think that's what you guys weren't happy with. But this writer says, the hosts a Serbic wit was nothing new. He'd certainly offended in the past from the award stage and ads for Sunday's telecast played on the idea that anything could happen, including Gervais being a jerk. His knack for ripping on Hollywood and offending the glitterati is well known among the thin skinned in the industry. But at the Beverly Hilton where the three hour plus ceremony took place, the mood was already sober thanks to an impeachment, the threat of war with Iran and devastating bushfires in Australia. The last thing anyone needed was for the smirking master of ceremonies to reprimand them for having hope or taught the room for trying to use their influence to change things for the better. Like that's that's all these Hollywood celebrities are trying. They were just trying to have hope that things would be better and just like, there was a dark depressing room. Yeah. And they were just there to try to like put forward a positive message. It was like London nerds in the subway station. Yeah, it's the same during World War II. These poor celebrities. I mean, I will say I am kind of torn with Bickey's message in one sense because I do feel like every citizen like the political life should be important to every citizen. Yeah. But the same time, he's right. These people don't have any kind of authority to lecture people on these kinds of topics. So like, I think politics are important for everybody to get involved in. Yeah. But at the same time, there's something to be said about. Well, and that's like I've had to kind of correct myself because I've before kind of really bash celebrities for having political opinions, but you're right, everybody deserves to have an opinion about politics. But I think what people have an issue with is that you have these celebrities who use these award ceremonies, which are supposed to recognize their acting abilities or their screenwriting abilities, right? And they bring politics into it, which is something totally different. It'd be like if you're dentists started lecturing you about impeachment as you're there having your teeth clean. That's happened to me actually, but not about impeachment. Yeah. It's like, I can't. You're trapped. Yeah. You can't say anything. But I think there's the question of, okay, is this even appropriate? If we if we appreciate you for your art, can we just do that? So there's the question of setting. And then on top of it, if you listen to these speeches, they're not just, you know, these are my opinions, blah, blah, blah, like they hold themselves as like gold star examples of expertise and virtue. It's so condescending. So I think there's something to be said of, just keep your mouth shut for the stupid award ceremony. And I think most people agree with the stance your base took, which is that like, just come up here, get your word, say thank you and go, we're not tuned in to hear your political views. Like, they have the right to still do it, but they can't then complain when no one wants to watch them. And you know, he's making fun of hypocrites here is the thing like, yes, he's making fun of these celebrities because they do things like virtue signal about the environment, then right on private jets, right? If you listen to his jokes, he's mad about the fact that they lecture about gender equality, then hang out with the Epstein's and the Weinstein's of the world, right? So this is not him looking down on people for trying to have hope. Okay, this is him calling out hypocrites in a delicious way. We also have the independent Rick. This is my favorite one. Ricky Dervais cheapened the Golden Globes, but worse, he overshadowed vital political statements, these vital celebrity opinions. Ricky Dervais's performance last night, the Golden Globes was enough to make Jean Kelly turn in his grave. Once upon a time Hollywood was synonymous with elegance and class, but Dervais's tirade of nasty and smudgy jokes. Oh yeah, because otherwise Hollywood is never about this much. Prove that tabloid culture has leaked its way into even the highest tier of entertainment. Call me approved, but a joke about Judy Dench licking her but hardly screams high society. Okay. Yeah, what era are we in again? Yeah, and also like he's making a joke about stuff that actually happened in the film. So what's what's bad? The joke about the thing that actually happened or the thing that actually happened, right? I would be more mad at cats for ruining Hollywood's reputation than Ricky Dervais. Yeah, that's the thing. I mean, back in the day, yeah, sure, like 50 years ago, Hollywood was kind of classy, you know, the stuff that my dad watches nowadays, yeah, lamenting about what it's become. But it's not like anymore. This is the source of degeneracy for most of Western society. Yeah, it's the bottom of the barrel. No, for sure. The article continues, if there's a place for cheap humor, it's at Friday night work drinks after one too many. An episode of South Park, where an investment's risk case speech, it's certainly not on the stage that birth the hashtag Me Too movement, one that should respect its power for mass influence. Like, you're congratulating yourselves for birthing the Me Too movement. Hollywood is the place where everyone's rapey, though. Like you can't congratulate. It's so great. We're finally calling out our own rapists. Like, no, you don't get to congratulate yourself for that. They continue last night. Gervais related come across as an idiotic clapping monkey, grabbing your attention, but for what you're not really sure presenting Gervais like a teenager acting up to shock his parents is a step in totally the wrong direction. It sends out the message that Hollywood is a place with norm morals or respect. Yes, that's what I would agree 100%. Where true talent can be exchanged for a few expletives and where the big issues hide in the corner while the village idiot dances under the big bright spot. Like what? How out of touch are these people that they this is how they view Hollywood as like this moral force for positive social change, these like moral clas- like no, that's not Hollywood at all. They peddle degeneracy. They're a bunch of beautiful idiots with substance abuse projects, sorry, substance abuse issues who, you know, once in a while take a break from raping each other to give each other pat on the backs like these are. And moral advice to masses. Outrageous. So long story short, if you haven't checked out Riki Gervais's special humanity on Netflix, I recommend you do. It's very funny. And there were people after this special saying, well, you know, he's not right wing, he's not pro-Trump, he doesn't agree with you. No one who was like laughing along to his jokes about celebrities was thinking it's great that he actually supports Trump. No, that's not what this is about. Riki Gervais is a liberal atheist and that's fine. But he's a funny liberal atheist and it's too bad these journalists seem to have forgotten how to laugh. And I can understand why the celebrities themselves weren't laughing because I get it. But it's like these journals like, come on, how much of a, that's ridiculous. How much sucking up could you possibly do? Now, do you think that he's following the recent trend of like comedians kind of talking back against this popular world culture? Well, Ricky Gervais, if there is a trend, Ricky Gervais has always been at the front of it. Because he did stuff like this at previous award shows that he's hosted. I'm shocked each time they invite him back. And if you watch humanity, meaning he did things like he deadnamed Caitlyn Jenner, he got in trouble for this. Like his anti-PC comedy special was out before Dave Chappelle's was out before Bill Burr. So this really just is his personality. This is him. Right. And he's funny. I guess part of it, they probably knew what they were getting into and they wanted the attention. And you know, even bad attention is good attention. Great. Like, why else would we be talking about the Golden Globes? Exactly. Yeah. And I think maybe similar, in similar news, it was just announced that the Oscars again would have no host. Oh, yeah. Apparently they're not as I'm not sure who like who exactly organizes the Oscars. But apparently they don't have the balls that the what is it the Hollywood Foreign Press Association or whatever does because they keep inviting Gervais back. But yeah, so the least cynical interpretation of the speeches that were given, you had Patricia Arquette talking about just, I don't know, some sort of social justice thing. Michelle Williams thanked her abortion for her award. Great message there. What's that elegance in class? Elegance in class. Yeah. So the least cynical interpretation I have with those speeches is that you're trying to get attention by parroting the correct popular opinion among your peers in your industry. That's like the most generous I can be for them. So before we get into this segment, I have a quick message from our awesome sponsor, MyBelly.

I'm sure you guys are aware of wondering whether war would break out between the US and Iran. So this comes after a lot of aggressive behavior from Iran in 2019. You know, they brought down drones, continued to be a state sponsor of terror. There are military conflicts they had with US and UK forces. Most recently, an American embassy was attacked, which prompted the killing of the general Suamani. And to that point, that a lot of people, apparently all of these foreign policy experts online that I didn't even know they were experts, began announcing World War Three, actually not just announcing simultaneously announcing and surrendering World War Three, which I thought was impressive. But most recently, Iran in retaliation launched some missiles at some American bases in Iraq. No casualties have been reported. After that, Trump did give a speech that seemed to signal that the US wouldn't be taking any further military action and will also be increasing sanctions. We have clips from that. The entire speech is available online, but here's some highlights. As we continue to evaluate options in response to Iranian aggression, the United States will immediately impose additional punishing economic sanctions on the Iranian regime. These powerful sanctions will remain until Iran changes its behavior. We suffered no casualties. All of our soldiers are safe, and only minimal damage was sustained at our military bases. Our great American forces are prepared for anything. Iran appears to be standing down, which is a good thing for all parties concerned and a very good thing for the world. No American or Iraqi lives were lost. Okay. So since that speech, it has been reported that missiles were fired at Baghdad's green zone. No casualties from that either at least not yet. And this actually just happened earlier today, like a more missiles being launched. I am not even sure if Iran has officially claimed that that was from them or one of their syndicates. I'm not even sure we're still this is an ongoing situation. So apologies if by the time some of you are watching that, it's not the most up to date. But it does look like World War three isn't happening. Thank goodness. And by the way, I do want to say even if heaven forbid the US and Iran went into like full on military conflict, that doesn't mean World War three. Right. So I think everybody with this, I understand why people are tense. There are a lot of lives at stake. It's important, but we should calm down a little bit, right? Because even if US and Iran went to war, doesn't mean World War three, right? You can't simultaneously claim that Trump is a Putin puppet while at the same time, believe that they're going to go to war with each other over this. So just everybody calm down. And we don't often talk about the Middle East on this show. I was really interested in that when I was in college. It's what I studied. But for the past, like, honestly, like five or six years, I just haven't been interested in foreign policy all that much. And yeah, the conversation surrounding the situation between different people has been very tense. A lot of people are afraid of an all at war, which I think is fair. A lot of people are now calling Trump a war monger saying he's been influenced by the neocons. Other people are saying he doesn't want more. He just wants around to understand that there are consequences for attacks against Americans or American interests. If you follow me on social media, you'll know that I'm not a neocons. I'm pretty anti interventionists in the Middle East. I do think that a lot of the disapproval over the administration's actions are reasonable. Like I think it's perfectly fine to question whether killing Soleimani would be too much of an escalation and would prompt severe retaliation from Iran. I think it's perfectly fine to question whether the US should even be in the Middle East in the first place, which is what my opinion is. But what is not fine, and what I would like to talk a little bit about, is what's just not a legitimate criticism of the Trump administration at all, is the idea that actually Iran are the good guys, right? Of all the opinions that are floating around out there and I understand the situation is complicated, that is one where it's like, no, no, no, no, let's just cross that out of the list of things that it's okay to say. And this view, that's a viewpoint that's, I've seen a shocking amount online and like, don't get me wrong, I still don't support all the neocons who are kind of like, at the edge of their seats, almost frothing at the mouth. Oh my God, it's sickening. Right. There's some people out there who want war, right? But there are people like you have the neocons who just never met a war in the Middle East, they didn't like, and then you have the people, some of them on the left who I think want war for the different reason of then being able to say, look how awful Trump is. Those are both just funny because they were totally pro-Hillary at the start who was definitely much more hawkish, much more hawkish towards Russia to not like, yeah, like something much more powerful. I remember thinking on the debate stage, there's almost one point where I was like, wait, did she just declare war on Russia? Because it kind of seemed like she did. So, yeah, I mean, with this, again, like, we're going to need to see how things unfold, but you can disagree with the killing of Soleimani while still like acknowledging that he was a terrorist who had British American and Iraqi Iranian Yemeni blood on his hands, but disagree with the act of killing him. That's fine. You can not want war with Iran while still acknowledging that the Iranian regime is terrible, like objectively terrible, you know, huge violator of human rights. But it seems like there are people who are so deep into just Trump derangement that they're actually defending Iran in this situation. And I don't just mean defending the people of Iran because there are a lot of Iranians who don't support the government. And we've been hearing some of these voices on social media. There's a huge protest movement in that country, but no, there are people legitimately going out there to bat for the Iranian regime, which is so crazy. We've seen it with the media. They've been downplaying just who exactly Soleimani is, what his history was downplaying. Dear religious scholar, yeah, that kind of thing. Downplaying or completely emitting Iran's attacks against Western forces. For the rest of the segment, I would like to show you some of the most egregious things we've been seeing. So there's this one tweet that kind of went viral, has 67,000 likes. And it says we stand Iran and it has a clip which we're about to play for you guys. And I just want to say that going through the replies to this and again, 67,000 people were like, yes, go Iran. And we're going to show you this clip of why apparently Iran is just great, the super cool country because they don't like Trump and Trump is also bad. Here's this clip. Like I get some people don't like Trump. I get that some people are critical of American involvement in the Middle East. I am. I don't support American forces being there. But at the same time, I don't think people who hear that and think, oh, yeah, that's fine then. Understand the kind of things that go on that the government of Iran does. They actually sponsor terrorists. Very, very anti-gay. There are women who get in trouble with the government for taking off their hijabs. They dance in the streets and protest because you're not allowed to do that. There there was actually just a huge bunch of protesters, some as young as 15 who were killed by the government. Like, this is not a good regime. No, and let's be honest, what he was talking about with the death to America stuff, it's that's covering your butt. Exactly. That's just the saying, I don't want to escalate this further to include all the American public. But the thing is that's Sios and it's working with these people. Oh, yeah, it's working very well. And someone who I think has totally gone off the deep end with regard to this situation is Michael Moore. If you guys follow him on social media, he is essentially all but pledged allegiance to Iran. Very, very strange. We have one of the tweets here, which actually, keep in mind, this is actually originally posted in Persian by him. We just have the translation up here. That's right. This was after Suumana. He says, I'm guessing talking to the Ayatollah. Sir, I deeply regret the violence on our behalf by a man that most Americans have never voted for. Avoid power. A sincere man, Michael Moore, an American citizen. And I think you had something that. Oh, yeah. It was a mom, Tahiti, I believe, that said that the translation for the word sir there can also be translated as a master. Yeah, it was perfect because this guy is this guy's a loser. Yeah, no, it is. And they're like, you don't have to support what Trump did. That's their legitimate reasons for that. But that doesn't mean you all of a sudden start sucking up to Iran. And he put out this tweet. Maybe his last name's a hint, though. He's a Moore. Yeah. Just totally. I don't even know what he's trying to say here. This was included. This originally was a picture of the, I guess, memorial service they had for Suumani. He says, just wondering, is there an American general for who millions of us would turn out for his funeral? Mad Dog, Kelly, Colin Powell, can anyone even name the chair of the Joint Chiefs? We all support those who serve. But would we pour into the streets like this? Like, what are you trying to say here? Like, what is the point you're trying to make that he was such a great guy? He had the love of the people because there are a lot of Iranians were going on social media to say, no, a lot of us are glad. I mean, you have a million people show up. That's like a small percentage of the overall population who actually does not support what Suumani was doing. Why you're trying to canonize him now? I don't understand. And it's also like the America is not in a warring state. Like, like the countries in that area often are, right? Like generals, hopefully, aren't that important to your nation. Yeah. Hopefully, don't want to have to use generals. Hopefully, you don't really know many other names because, well, the Canadian military doesn't do anything. Yeah, it's like, are you trying to encourage jingoistic military allegiance now? Like, I don't understand. I don't get a deal there. What are you doing there? Some kind of nationalism, too. What's going on, Michael Moore, confusing me. You know, what the problem is that the United States doesn't have the same amount of nationalist theocracy that Iran does, which apparently now is a good thing. And I just want to say on a side note, Michael Moore is like everything that a man should not be. I would agree. Like, he's just he's just like, why are you offering me any advice? You're just like, yeah, your ugly, your obese, you have you're just sour. It just drives me nuts. Oh, and he's a racist apparently, too. If you follow what he was saying about awful white voters, but you also had people like Rose McGowan, she had some cringy tweets. I didn't she was a bit too far. I didn't include her. But I don't think these people understand that you are the reason why Iran hates America so much. Like you you're progressive, whatever liberal sensibilities like they don't like Trump because he's the leader of their enemy. He doesn't like people like the Ayotollah wouldn't like people like Michael Moore, Rose McGowan, because of their beliefs, everything they stand for as these liberal elitists, the Iranian regime hates for who they are just so we're clear. So Bette Middleer, this was just like this. I don't even know if this is sucking up or racist. She says, this tap on the wrist. Does the word faint mean anything to you? Or do you actually think this is the end of it? Iran is thousands of years old and was the first empire in history. Okay, no, but surviving because they are cunning, crafty, and have lots of what we do not patience. Like, what does that even mean? That was so cringy. Let's be honest. That was I don't even know. But is that like, can you call an entire people cunning and crafty? Sounds anti-Semitic already. I know. But also your pro them as it's just weird takes have been going on social media because of this whole thing. And we have Ilana Omar, who was very upset when Sulemani was killed. And she also, after the the Trump administration came out and say, okay, we're going to do sanctions, which a lot of people would say, okay, that's good. That's kind of soft power. It's a way to apply pressure without escalating a military conflict. She apparently is not for that. She says this makes no sense. Sanctions are economic warfare. They've already caused medical shortages and countless deaths in Iran. A lot of people might say that those shortages and deaths were the responsibility of the regime, who is being outwardly hostile. But okay, she says you cannot claim to want the escalation and then announce new sanctions with no clear goal. This is not a measured response. So a lot of people have pointed out that this is a little bit strange to hear from her, considering she is a firm supporter of the BDS movement in regard to Israel. As most people know, boy caught divest sanction. Okay, she supports sanctions or what she calls economic warfare against Israel. Now, if you've watched this show before, you'll know that on this channel, we treat Israel like any other country, which is a foreign concept, I think among a lot of Americans who either really hate Israel or really love Israel. I've been called a Zionist shill, and I've also been called not a real conservative because I don't understand why Israel gets all of this foreign aid. So they're like any other country, in my opinion. So, but it just, this is some bold hypocrisy, right? When it comes to Israel, heck yeah, let's sanction them. Iran, how could how could you dare say you would sanction Iran? So it's also criticized Jewish people for having dual allegiances. Yeah, wasn't that her? Yeah. And then here she is supporting Iran and like this kind of outward way. Yeah, this is very strange. So you're double hypocrite at this point. Again, like this is an ongoing situation. I'm hoping that you by the time we're like finishing this show, we're not finding out that a bunch more missiles were launched. I hope not. I hope things can a little detente can begin, but it's just been it's very confusing to me watching all of these people. I don't know. Yeah, go to bat for what is objectively a murderous regime. We can let's have a conversation about what the appropriate response should be. Of course, but through all of that, let's not forget that this is a hostile regime. It's like, you don't need to say that Kim Jong-un is a good guy to say that, Hey, let's not go to war with North Korea. And I feel like that's being forgotten in this conversation right now. Okay, so moving on, representation in games. Awesome. I love representation. It's an issue we've talked a lot about before on this show, the idea that there need to be more trans lesbian, disabled people of color in TV shows, movies and books, of course, or else it's white supremacy. That to me has been one of the more annoying byproducts of social justice. But recently, developers behind the game Escape from Tarkov came under fire for not having playable female characters in the game. And I guess, apparently they don't have any plans to add any you haven't played the game. But would you mind just telling us a bit about it? Yeah, I know what it's about it. It's now my understanding this is kind of like a a pub G or what are they called to where the first person shooter? No, well, it is a first person shooter, but it's like there's a whole bunch of people on this one server and you're trying to live or escape. And yeah, so it's just a shooting game where you play as a character and you get some loot and you get out basically. It's very popular now. It's had a resurgence. Yeah. So this is the article that PC game are released about this. It says escape from Tarkov dev says the military shooter will not be getting playable female characters due to the game's current popularity on Twitch, a 2016 2016 interview with WCCF tech has resurfaced where a representative of escape from Tarkov explains the developer's decision to not have playable female characters is that women can't handle that amount of stress and that the battlefield of escape from Tarkov was a place only for hard and men. Battle state games has addressed these comments in a Twitter statement explaining that the comments made were misinterpreted and that the employee was subsequently reprimanded. Battle state then followed up with two more tweets explaining that it still stands by the decision of not including playable female characters due to lore and animation reasons. First, there are women in EFT already traders, some future key storyline quests will have women as main characters, but there will be no playable female characters because of game lore and more importantly, the huge amount of work needed with animations, gear fitting, etc. So I've said it before and I'll say it again. I don't think it's necessary or even a good idea or realistic to try to make sure that every group possible is shoehorned and represented in every situation and every piece of media. That to me is just it's not realistic. It's not necessary. That's not how the world works. Certain groups are more or less represented in certain situations and certain periods of history and well, whatever. And I think that's fine. If you're having a game based on anything like these shootouts appear to be, I think it is totally reasonable to assume that if it were a real situation, no, there would not be female characters or female characters. It's in Russia too, as far as I'm aware, she was probably an overwhelming amount of white people in it. So racist. Other problems like that. I think the devs can do what they want. I mean, I will say that the statement where I was like, women can't handle stress. I can see why people were mad at that. That's a little bit cringy. That's what's going on there. You don't need to... I can see why people were mad at that, but it seems like that was just one person who worked there who's been talked to. Maybe he was taking out of contacts, whatever. I don't think that it needs to kind of escalate into people just being mad at this game as a whole. And we have some responses to that article here that I thought were very interesting. Responses to that article were kind of mixed. Here we have someone saying, finally, someone who doesn't bend to the mob, but this person says, yeah, because everyone knows only dudes deserve to play something they can relate to. That to me is very strange because you're playing as this person who's probably going to be killing hundreds of people if you play the game in some Russian former Soviet state is the fact that you can't relate to this really just because there are no... If there are a woman, you'd be like, oh, now I can picture myself there. Now, mentally, I can insert myself. And it's also strange because these are people who I'm guessing would defend the idea that no, Rey is not a Mary Sue. But if people don't know, Mary Sue's are... That's what people call characters who are kind of just inserts where you're supposed to be able to put yourself into their position. They don't really have any maybe defining personalities. So you can just imagine yourself in their shoes and they're perfect and everything goes well. It's kind of like wish fulfillment. That's what people call Rey from Star Wars. And people are like, oh, no, how could you say that? But here we literally have people saying, no, I want to be able to see myself in it. Yeah, I'm on the fence here myself because I have like that grug brain. I don't really play as female characters ever. And that means you're sexist. It does, I guess. Yeah, unless you identify with the female characters, you're clearly just... So I've never played Tomb Raider games. Never played like there was a recent one, Horizon Zero Dawn. A lot of people liked. I've never gotten into them. I can't put my mind there. So to some level, I can relate. That's just because I guess my hind brain is the only thing that's active when I'm gaming. There's no forethought in any of it. But even then, like you're not going to Tomb Raider and saying have a male playable character. No. No, exactly. I mean... It's a different game. Just don't play that game. Even the regular women, most of them don't have triangular breasts. Like they have Tomb Raider, right? I mean, but they can still play as them. Yeah. I mean, so part of me is like, yeah, I kind of understand wanting to have a character like that. But most of the time for me, it's just because when I'm playing like a first person shooter, and next thing you know, like I was talking about Gears of War with you earlier, you have these guys that are like juiced up monsters whose like arms are the size of my entire torso. And then they introduce women, I think of the third game. And seeing these like Lauren-sized women, like melee, the grug, like this monster guy, and then the guy just flies off in the distance, like the same damage, same physics, everything. It's just, I was like, all right, I... You don't think that's the realistic? I can't do it. I can't do it. I just can't. Yeah. So I kind of support, like if you want to put a female characters in your game, like in Halo and have them kind of beat up on guys, even though it's not the most realistic, I don't have a problem with that. I also don't have a problem with that in movies. Do it you want. Yeah, do what you want. But also, if that's not there, it shouldn't be this, I don't know, expectation on expectation on every writer or game developer or author that you have to have that, especially when you are trying to kind of maybe create a sense of realism. I think it's reasonable to say, hey, this isn't even, this doesn't even make sense. And I think these, these people also need to realize that I would tell them, it's a first person shooter. You can't even see yourself when you're playing. And apparently in this game, you don't have your, like, your characters insane anything anyway. So it's like, does it really matter that much? I don't think so. Yeah, there was a whole, about a year ago, there was a whole debate with another game about race. Called Kingdom Come Deliverance. That was based in, basically, they took a map of an area in the Czech Republic today and they made a historical game about it. And then everybody was angry because there weren't enough black people in it. And it's like even modern day Czech Republic. Not a lot of black people there. Many of the time Czech Republic, let's be honest, yes, there's none. But people were still mad about it. And so I get the realism thing. I definitely like, to me, there's, there's a company there that's carving out a market, maybe, maybe some of these people are right and they are trying to sell the game to people that are conservative. I don't know. But who cares? That's their market choice decision to sell it to them. And the other people who want to have like Blizzard, that want to have like, I don't know, a trans soldier and all the stuff, it's like, well, yeah, battlefield five is there for you guys. They're selling it to you. Yeah, exactly. Another person says in response to the PC gamer article, good, the only people asking for it are annoying journals with too much free time. Let people make the games they want to make. It's a form of expression and a form of art. And it's time to stop sinking our dirty claws in others hard work, to which someone replied, if they're comfortable losing potential players, that's on them. It's one of the reasons I never picked up the game. You always hear a bunch of people say this like, Oh, well, not enough representation. I'm not going to watch by whatever support I always wonder, but were you ever going to really it'd be like, I could threaten to boycott. Slate, I could threaten to boycott a teen vogue, but let's be real. The articles are not intended for me. I'm not really consuming them in the first place. It's like when liberals try to boycott Tucker Carlson. It's like, how many of you, be honest, we're watching Tucker Carlson in the first place. I do kind of feel like a lot of the these people don't have actual power to exert market forces on the game. So they try to substitute that with exerting like social media outrage, which actually they can do because something that I thought was interesting, I went on to the tweets that the game developers actually tweeted out. And on those, I guess they've been publicized, they are kind of getting reamed by these social justice activists and being shamed for not including characters who are female and playable in their games. We have some of those lovely people's responses here. This person who has, I feel like if you see, if you're listening on an audio platform, I'm sure you'll be able to imagine it, this kind of animated avatar, I don't need to read the tweet. I know what the opinion express will be. It's kind of like that Cal Arts simplifies like, I know, I know immediately what you're going to say. This guy does not disappoint. He says there will be a lot of players who won't buy your game because of this because of this decision like me. If your lore excludes women from being able to play as a character like them, then your lore sucks. It's bad and you should feel bad. Unless your game has women in the battlefield, 50 50 parody with men, then your lore is bad. So I guess reality is also bad. No, I joke about that. They would likely think that we have more. Someone else said these excuses don't work on anyone anymore. It's Fing 2020. Good all current year. It's current year. So therefore thank you for that. Thank you. This person says if making video games that aren't sexist because you're lazy or sexist is too hard, don't make video games anymore. I'm sure your staff might be better off with a recommendation letter and a thumbs up. And what's so funny about this is that I've been kind of this, the whole issue of female character's representation in games. It's one that's been around for a while. I've watched videos about people complaining about things like breast motion, physics, mechanics or whatever when people play complaining that developers didn't get it right. So it kind of does lend credence to the idea that animating women and kind of putting in those female characters actually would be a good amount more work for these developers. Oh yeah, it changes a lot of things. Yeah. And like the way the gear fits everything people were saying. Competitively, a lot of people play as women because theoretically they have smaller hitboxes. One time the developers will go around that. They'll try to do but that's why a lot of people play as female characters because they have a smaller profile. We have one friend who always says he plays as a female character. I always thought it was because he's looking at the butt of the character. That's also a thing that some guys like. It's not for me. But you know. Yeah. So I just kind of, I mean, I'm kind of an impartial observer to this because I've never played this game. It's been years since I've played the play the game. Aside from something like plague English, I've probably played too much. But I do feel bad for these developers because I feel like a lot of people don't want anything to do with something like politics or all of these social issues. They just want to make video games. They just want to write. They just want to draw. They just want to make art. But you can't escape these people because they will come for you. You might be on the side trying to do your own thing doesn't matter. They will find you and they will complain. Yeah. So let's be honest. If you could pick a fan base that you want someone to sell a game to I'd much rather sell it to the conservative group of gamers or whatever the gamergate folk. Yeah. And we weren't even just an even conservative. I don't even want to conflate that. No, no, no, you're right. You're right. But whatever. They're just regular people. Yeah. Just a non progressive folk because we know that if you do have a lot of progressive folk in your game, managing it is going to be a nightmare. And they're never going to be happy. They're never going to be satisfied. It's like, I mean, the Witcher we recently kind of did a little bit of a video kind of on it talking about people being upset with nudity exploitation in the Mary Sue. They were upset because it handled race poorly, which is funny because when I was watching the Witcher, I was noting, wow, there's a lot of people of African descent in this like Polish-based fantasy world, whatever. I don't care. But apparently some progressives at least were mad because they didn't deal with race. They just took the, like, I guess colorblind approach and inserted people of different races, but then acted as if race wasn't an issue among them. So it's like, these are people who are never going to be satisfied with whatever you try to do. So it's not a good idea to have them as your remark. You shouldn't tell them you should have just made it like the video game. That's one thing that's that's nice about video game culture is like, look at if you play the Witcher 3, which is kind of what made Witcher books and game and the Netflix series famous in its own way. I think the Witcher 3 was just so popular. If you play that game, it's like basically racially homogenous except for like DLC and a few other areas and of course, in humans. But the point is like nobody even blinked at it. But as soon as I knew what would happen when it comes to mainstream culture, mainstream issues, but part of me is like glad that some games are not privied to that kind of just like the wilt culture. The other part of me is like, I wish they would have it already so that people could stop playing video games because they're fun and I don't want to enjoy playing them because they're giant waste of time, right? So, yeah, well, I mean, but don't forget, these are people who I recently read an article about how Toy Story, the most recent one I think for something was too racially homogenous and they were complaining that one of the characters who was a spork was white because it's like a white plastic spork, which makes it a white character. It's like when people were mad about cats, the main character had white fur, which is like a wiper anyway. These people are never going to be happy, never going to be satisfied. Consider this maybe even a little bit of endorsement for this game. Escape from Tarkov, is it? Yeah, apparently these game developers. That's the word I was looking for earlier that I forgot about. Apparently these game developers don't care so good for them. And I honestly doubt this will affect their sales or amount of people playing this in the slightest. These people probably were never going to play. Okay, so to finish off the show, final segment, we're going to be looking at exposing Antifa. So, Andy No, he's a journalist. He's done extensive coverage of Antifa. He's even been very seriously attacked by Antifa. His whole family has been docked by Antifa. If you don't follow him on Twitter, you should. It's at Mr. Andy No, No is spelled N-G-O. He's also on Instagram. Most recently, we've had the pleasure of meeting him a few times, gotten to speak at events with him. He does good work. He recently posted a collection of mugshots and descriptions of the crimes some Antifa members were arrested for. And I want to go through them together because, and this is going to sound mean, they look exactly what you would imagine Antifa members would look like. So we're going to go through these photos and these mug shots. And there are a couple things that I want to talk about. If you are listening again on the audio platform, you're going to want to come over to one of the video platforms because you're going to want to want to see these. Okay, so here's some of the tweets. There are much more we didn't include. We've blurred out their names. I don't think going through police mugshots is doxing, but at the same time, the reason why we're doing this right now on the show is not to draw any attention to these people's personal lives. That's not the point of this. We just kind of want to make fun of them. Yeah, essentially. I just I just want to talk about them as as a whole. I did want to talk about that though. What do you think Andy was doing there? Obviously, Andy was brutally beaten by Antifa at one of the Portland riots that he was covering. Well, I think this is just a vendetta or is this doxing? What do you think? Well, I don't think doxing people have accused Andy of doxing Antifa. These are people who were arrested by the police. Their mugshots were taken because of crimes they have committed. I don't think that is doxing. And to me, when you're talking about someone who has committed violent acts upon another person, my sympathy for, oh, you were dox again, it's it's going to be lower. I'm not saying that we should go after these people's jobs, try to find their families. Nothing like that. Don't do that. You know, these people have been honest. They don't have jobs. Some of them do. We're going to get into the another thing, but we don't need to do that. These are people who have been kind of dealt with with the police at the proper channels have been taken. Thankfully, I think the reason why Andy does things on Antifa is because he feels like these people aren't being held accountable. And I know he has shared images of the people who were responsible for assaulting him when he ended up having like a brain hemorrhage, because he wants them to be identified and found and you kind of brought to justice. And I think with these people, he feels like there are threat people just like him. People aren't making a big enough deal about Antifa. He recently had a talk scheduled at UBC in Canada about the violence that Antifa inflicts. And it was actually canceled due to violent threats from Antifa. So I think when it comes to Andy, he's like, we need to talk about this problem. These are real people that are out there. No one's doing enough about it. So I'm going to talk about it. So here, this person is a 35 year old transsexual Antifa militant has been arrested numerous times in Portland at riots and violent protests. In March 2017, she was charged for strangling a man during a BLM protest in downtown. Like, and I kind of chose these specific ones because these are like, anytime I talk about Antifa, I have people on the last saying, but what about the right-wing extremists? And of course, like people like the Christchurch shooter awful, condemn, condemn, disavow. No one's making excuses for them or trying to justify what they did. But I feel like when it comes to Antifa, a lot of people, especially the mainstream media, they kind of downplay what they've done. Like, oh, you can't compare. Some kind of justice warriors. Yeah. And it's like, no, these are violent thugs. A lot of people myself included think they should be qualified as domestic terrorists. They're using violence and the threat of violence to make people scared. Like, she was strangling someone. That's not okay. That's a serious problem. And the thing with Antifa is they're organized and they're in pretty much every major city in Western countries, whether that's the US, we saw them in Canada, they're in the UK, they're, you know, you've black, black and Germany and stuff like that. It's not okay. This lovely individual 38 was convicted for her role in the Antifa Mayday riot in 2017 in Portland that saw parts of downtown set on fire. Antifa threw rocks and incendiary devices at police. This person pled guilty to felony charges of arson and rioting. She only got probation. And that's like a lot of these things. Like, on the one hand, I'm glad that at least they're arrested. But a lot of these charges feel very, very minimal. And I'm someone who I support criminal justice reform. I think, you know, if you've not done something violent, I think the idea of just throwing you in prison for years on end doesn't make sense to me. That's not, it's not proportion. It just also doesn't have anything to do with rehabilitation. But it's like, okay, arson and riot, like arson. And you only get probation. That to me sounds maybe. Also, she looks like a character out of fallout. Yes. Yeah, I got some lovely face tattoos. That's how you know that they're probably gainly, gainfully employed is the face tattoos. Yes. And like, if you were to tell me that someone was setting something on fire and I would look around and see this individual out, be like, guilty. Yeah, it's like probably you at least had some idea about it. Although I will say like the, she got tattoos like on the, like, that's kind of cool. Like if we were ever in some sort of like Mad Max scenario and I had to get face tattoos, I might get face tattoos like that. It's like a go teal or no, it wouldn't happen. I don't know. Well, maybe not exactly like that. But it looks, it looks kind of cool. Oh, here we have my favorite one. This versus Seattle area, transsexual and Tifa militant who was arrested yesterday and charged with reckless endangerment. She also has a criminal record in Idaho where this booking photo is from. I feel like there's a disproportionate amount of trans individuals in Antifa. Very strange. And also like, this is not to be mean. I'm actually like putting this forward as a legitimate hypothesis. Yeah, I feel like the rate of individuals with irregular facial characteristics, let's say, is higher in Antifa because like these people have felt legitimately marginalized by our society, which some might say has a, you know, preference for faces that look different than theirs do. Yes. Yeah. I got a word you're going. I'm going to get it. Yeah. There's something to that. And yeah, I can't deny it. I mean, this is not someone that I'd be like, I'm not going to get it. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I mean, this is not someone that I'd be like. I don't think I would be. Oh, I don't think it's. Yeah. I can't. Yeah, I'm not. I mean, I know. I mean, I don't think there's not. I think there's not. Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's. Yeah, I mean, I'm not. I don't think I'm. I don't think I'm. I don't think I'm, I don't Yes, that's what I want. Yeah. So I feel like, I don't know, maybe these are a bunch of people who are angry because they were in the popular kids in school and so now they feel like they need to try to burn out the whole system. I don't even want to go that far, but what I'm saying is that it would be a steer to be people that benefit from some kind of communism within the romantic world. Yeah, yes, that is a good way to put it. Okay, this person, 23 year old Antifa militant sentenced to five years in prison. That's a long time. Related to a violent Mayday riot in 2017 in Portland. He tried to set a police cruiser on fire by throwing flares inside. He also started a fire inside a downtown target. There's a lot of arson going on with Antifa. I feel like people don't understand the amount of property damage these people commit. It's pretty crazy. Also something that I want to mention. You noticed any patterns racially with these people. They're looking very much on the Caucasian side of thing, which I think is interesting to know because they claim to be standing up for the oppressed groups. They very much look like a bunch of middle class white people. I think that's obviously, if you look at voting blocks, people who are non-white are more likely to vote Democrat. If you look at people who would gravitate toward Antifa, I.e. far leftist, radical socialist, I'm sorry, but that is a white person ideology. That is pure. You're more likely to be white. You're more likely to be from an upper middle class background. Actually, there's a video I might do. There have been several leftists who have complained about how white left YouTube is. It's because you're all white progressives. It's like how they had to cancel the woman's march in this one town because they were too white and it's like, yes, your ideology is very, very white. These are white people problems that you have imagined in your mind. This is my favorite. This person is a 42-year-old transsexual fortune teller. That's quite good at that. That tattoo in the middle of the forehead is making me itchy right there. Also, we've got the lip liner thing going on. It was arrested in Portland, Oregon at a riot in September 2017. She was charged with interfering with a police officer and disorderly conduct in the second degree, 42-year-old transsexual fortune teller. Yeah. Yeah. There we go. Antifa got another one. 37 was charged with disorderly conduct in second degree during a violent Antifa riot on Mayday 2017 in Portland. Businesses were smashed and militants started fires. This person was convicted on another offense and fined $265, which he has failed to pay. That's big money. Yeah. I'm still not able to pay it. I don't know. I feel like if the crimes that are being described, I had never even heard of these things. I feel like I try to keep up to date on Antifa happening if it had been a right-wing group or even a group. Oh, yeah. Every single little thing. You know, whatever. This is national news. Yeah. This would have been a much bigger deal. It's perfectly fair to say that there is a huge double standard in reporting on crimes committed by left-wing groups and crimes committed by right-wing groups. It's like we had that Antifa supporter who was trying to fire bomb an ICE facility. No one talked about it at all where it's like every little thing that someone on the right does is completely catapulted into the national stage. This is a double standard. I think it's fair to bring attention to it. Okay. We have another story here and it's by the postmillennial. Postmillennial is by the way the, I guess like online publication that I think Andy is the editor in chief of or something. I believe that's the case. Yeah, he is affiliated with them. So here we have a story about another Antifa member who apparently is being accused of racism and predatory behavior. They say by day Christian Michael X.U. is a 38-year-old library supervisor at St. Lawrence University in Canton, New York. However, online he uses the moniker anti-Fash Gordon. I think that's a play on Flash Gordon. Yes. Yeah. Clever. He has gained a large following in left wing networks for his activism with Antifa and by releasing docs, this or personal information of his ideological opponents to his 25,000 followers on Twitter. Exo proudly boasts on his Twitter biography that he has gotten people fired from jobs, removed from schools and kicked out of homes. But a recent medium post by Sora MC who claims to be an ex-house made of ex-Sue accuses him of frequently using a slew of racial slurs in the course of his investigative work and general predatory behavior. So I wanted to bring up this person and I know the person who's accusing him of predatory behavior, racist behavior is anonymous and is telling you to say, but it doesn't sound like this individual would care if things were reversed. And I think it's ironic how much doxxing Antifa likes to do of the right wing for people who do hide behind these anonymous profiles and who wear masks to all of these events, right? Because that's something that I've heard Antifa supporters or sympathizers say, well, you know, if these fascists didn't have such disgusting views, they wouldn't be afraid of being docs. And they say this as they like find out where like people who post right wing things on Facebook where they work, who their family members are. And it's like, okay, a I don't think these people are ashamed of their views. I think they just don't want to be targeted by violent extremists, which is fair. And like be you docs, you docs people all the time. But when anyone like mentions one of your mug shots, you get upset. It's like it doesn't. Yeah, you start screeching. It doesn't really make sense. Going into 2020, I hope that Antifa doesn't continue to be as as much of a problem as they've been in the past. And the thing is like we've been at events where there has have been Antifa and Lauren wants to go to more and I'm like, listen, I don't want to go to more. We're talking about the DNC. Okay. Well, I will mention we are going to be at the better discourse event in Milwaukee this coming July. Yeah. And you can I think find tickets at better discourse event.com. And it's going to be the same weekend as the DNC convention. And I want to go to some of the DNC events and film. That's not the same thing as saying I want to go. Fair enough. Fair. Yeah. But I don't even know because it's a DNC event. Yeah, but they're not far left enough. Yeah, that's true. They're pretty much fascist. Yeah. Right. Yeah. But I think I should be able to like go to events without worrying about being. That's the thing though. I think that there's great evidence that that's not the case. Yeah. A lot of people that have been nearly killed and severely injured by these people that are violent. Yeah. I'm sure that once they know someone like like Andy know, for example, is actually there, they tend to target them. Yeah. I'm sure that many of the people that are watching share my concern. Yeah. And no one wants me to be in any danger, at least of all me. But I mean, we've at the Hamilton event with Max and Bernier and Dave Rubin, there were and Tifa members there. Yeah. I was very pleased to see police take swift action against them. I saw that they took down a guy and I was like, it was actually felt bad because in the footage, I'm like, yeah, good for them. And I was like, it was happening two feet in front of me. Yeah. And when we were in New Jersey at the Mines are relevant, there were people there protesting who apparently in New Jersey and Tifa has been designated. I don't know if it's a terrorist group, but there was something about how the people there couldn't call themselves and Tifa for some reason, but they were operating under some other group. And I mean, those people were, thank goodness, super low energy. They didn't do anything. My goodness. I didn't even know that they were angry at us till we passed them. Yeah. Because they got tired of chanting. So they eventually only, like they just chanted when people were actually coming by, but they weren't very quick on the uptake when people were passing by. So there was a delay. It was brutal. Like I remember locking eyes with one of them and they were smiling at me and it looked kind of like a devilish smile. Yeah. And I was like, are they a fan or are they in a Tifa? I don't even know at this point. Yeah. And then when we got like 20 feet away, then they started getting angry. I was like, man, that's, and of course it was like a, it was a woman that led the chant. And I was like, too, I was like, the testosterone in this group is just what's happening. Yeah. And I felt sorry for them. I know I felt sorry for them too. And again, all white people there. Right. They were like, it's funny because the event that they were protesting was more racially diverse, diverse politically diverse, everything diverse than they made women drop out of that event. Yeah. Anybody, but you know, women of color and LGBT women drop out of that event. The truth is every demographic group has an in-group preference except white liberals. They have an, they have a negative in-group preference. They prefer other groups than their own. Yeah. Which is, they ultimately, they hate themselves. Yeah. Which is funny because they still congregate with only themselves. Oh, I know. It's just a miserable lot. Yeah. So anyway, that's our little expose on them. Some insight into who exactly these Antifa members are. Long story short, exactly, apparently who you would think they are. I, like you said, I feel bad for these people. I hope that, you know, we have some live events coming up. I hope that they don't come around and I am very disappointed that Andy's speech at UBC was canceled because of people. It's interesting because it's like in a fair fight, you know, these people would not stand any chance, but they resort to things like intimidation, dirty tactics. I mean, they do, they do things like put the locks in the socks. Like these people are just, they have no honor. And it's, it's disgusting how they're not being held accountable. They're, they should be held more accountable. And in any case, I think that's pretty much all we have to say for tonight. Thank you guys so much for tuning in. If you're watching live, be sure to stay on the stream because we're going to be back in just a few seconds with some exclusive Q and A with your super chats. And we will see you next time. Bye."
