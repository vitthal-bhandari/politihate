Also, we look at stews numbers his power rankings which are quite different in some ways than just the pole numbers Yeah, I mean we try to look at more factors than just poles Pulls are a part of the package for sure, but you know, they're earlier you are in a in an election season The less they actually matter. It's about bigger things, you know, campaign infrastructure and all this other stuff that we look at and come up with final rankings And I will tell you that his rankings are different than the pole numbers And I think he's right on it and he also will predict on today's podcast who the candidate is of significance It will be the first to drop out and I think he's right on that you don't want to miss it today's podcast You're listening to the best of the men back during 243 years, you know in 2026 we're going to have our 250th birthday I Remember what it was like in 1976 Now it's our 250th birthday and For 243 years we have been the hope for freedom We have been the place that people who feel oppressed have come and we have welcomed them They they've come here because they know their system doesn't work They know the system that they've been living under has oppressed them has has stopped them from pursuing their own happiness And now that promise is Fading We may not make it to our 250th birthday America Is a melting pot now? What does that mean we don't talk about that anymore that all these people have come together from different places with different backgrounds and different languages and cultures and and traditions and they come here because they want to be a part of it not the place The idea and They melt into each other they don't lose their distinctiveness because we're all equal, but we're all different for society for society to survive It has to come to that understanding that we are all equal yet we are all different As I was driving to Idaho with my son over the weekend I drove from Texas and the first thing I learned was Geez Texas just doesn't end It was a full day of driving just to get out of Texas And even Texas is different Dallas is different than Amarillo and New Mexico is different than Colorado and Boulder is Different than some of the small towns along the way We're all different and and what's happened is Many people don't understand the people in the cities. They don't understand and I know this to be true because I have Here in my in my house I have these three lights and I bought them in Dallas and they're they were expensive in Dallas But they're all beat up old lights and I was hanging them in my kitchen and the guy from town that helps on the ranch He he came in and he said you're you're putting those where and I said I put it in the kitchen. Are they great and he said uh-huh and I said Why he said with those that I mean how much you pay for those and I told him and he said huh, you know we could have just gone to one of the dairy farms and pulled those out of the barn I swear to you it was a revelation to me that we could make a lot of money. Come on guys Let's get together Let's go out to the farms and just say hey, what's the old crap? We'll give you brand new lights What's the old crap that the people in the cities are gonna want and why do they want it? Why do you want it? You want it because you want something that feels authentic feels authentic may not be authentic I've never been to Dix bar and grill in Florida or in ken kun, but I can damn well bet you I can buy a t-shirt that says that and one that looks like I've worn it for years We want something Authentic we want something we want to show that we've lived We what we want is we want the simple life Well not actually having to do all the work that is required for the simple life So the cities don't understand the people who go to church the people who milk cows every day They haven't had had to help a neighbor They don't understand why why will park the old tractor or the old truck behind or beside the barn? They don't understand that Why don't they clean that up? They don't understand that we're actually very happy positive people in our own lives But then again remember those people who live out in the country do not understand avocado toast We don't get it What are you doing? How is this suddenly popular? I swear to you you want a cripple California Ban avocados they'll go crazy We're headed for something and I don't know what it is But as I was driving the country I realized there's no way these people are going to give up their guns And there's no way these people in the cities understand that that that that idea The reason why we're headed for something is because we no longer have a center There is no center anymore. What was our center really? Why want you to think about this? Our center used to be Summed up in the phrase truth justice and the American way And people started making fun of that now think of this who started making fun of that It's the same people who are leading us down this road today and what did they first come for? With a tip of the hat to Nemo or first they came for the American way And I didn't say anything because I don't know Who cares? But we no longer know what the American way even means anymore What did the American way mean? Never perfect but always striving Never giving up Helping your neighbor being good to one another Trying to be better never perfect Sometimes not even close to perfect But learning from the lessons of the past and trying to be better That's really what the American way was But they took that away. Let's just focus on truth and justice really what came next? What truth? What is truth? Whose truth? There is no truth and now we're here at a place where there is no truth You can't say that there's only two genders. How dare you? There is an unlimited number of genders I could be a purple feather chicken right now if I decide to be and that's my truth So we got rid of the American way we got rid of truth And now we're quickly getting rid of justice Justice doesn't exist blind justice the idea behind justice is don't look at who I am Don't look it. I'm white. I'm black. Don't look at my wealth or my poverty Look at the facts Judge me by the content of my character and the facts of the case If blind justice is truly blind there has to be many times that a judge will say I don't want to rule this way I don't want to doesn't make me happy. I think you're a perfectly wonderful guy But here's what happened you screwed up dude You screwed up Over and over you screwed up. I don't know what's gonna stop you But until you figure that out I've got to keep you off the streets But now we're ruling on feelings Justice without any rules justice without any jury Trust justice without a trial justice without even a hearing. That's not justice We play by the rules And they changed the game We play by the rules and they say well you didn't violate any of those rules, but We have this feeling that you're upsetting the community A feeling Yeah, just doesn't feel good what you're doing Well, can I just get the name of the people I need to make feel good then? Because if you're not going to judge by the rules I need some measuring stick Give me the names of the people I need to make feel good Now that seems really wrong But at least it would be something Do we dare ask who needs to feel good? Because because the guidelines the rules the language Changes all the time We can't have a conversation I was listening to the daily the New York Times This morning and they've done a series on Europe and I swear to you it is fun Just to listen to you have to listen to it because they're shocked at what they find People and people in Italy They didn't like all these migrants just showing up in the middle of the night And now I feel like we're surrounded by these people Oh racism is alive No, no, say the Italians We just we just wanted to know Who they are where they came from Are they interested in being Italian? Because we feel like we're losing our way of life Oh Says the New York Times So they're cloaking their racism. Oh dear god It's hysterical If it wasn't so tragically sad and so tragically Obviously leading to another war in Europe It would be amazing. It would be amazing. It would be a comedy show But we can't talk about it because they don't understand it. They don't have any interest in understanding it They think that they're smarter than all of us because they don't keep an old truck next to their barn They don't have a barn And if they did they would surely just get rid of it Right now the media will not even admit that there's a problem on our border that doesn't start with Donald and end with Trump They won't talk about any of it let alone the radicals and the communists who are now masquerading as democratic socialist as if that's any better Who are actually planning facilitating and funding groups from all over the world to storm our border. Did you know that just a few weeks ago a large group of men from the Congo Spoke neither English nor Spanish Suddenly got over here from the Congo went to Mexico and Somehow or another were smuggled into our country and now are living on the streets in San Antonio They speak French San Antonio government is saying does anybody speak French because we have to understand these guys? They only spoke French and somehow or another from the Congo they got there Now just so you know the Congo is the number one spot in the world. It's a hot spot For Ebola now completely unrelated ISIS recently was in the Congo recruiting or doing something in the Congo. We don't know what? They're just working on a new project. I'm sure it's gonna be great Now God forbid a truly sinister group like ISIS decided to weaponize people and Ebola well while While we sit here and still fail to recognize that there's even a problem on the border That's a real possibility Nobody seems to care Nobody wants to talk about it. We can't talk about it Yesterday they banned live action. Live action is Lila Rose's group on For pro life they banned her on Pinterest on Pinterest Pinterest now says can't talk about abortion here But I could share any kind of picture. I want just not pictures of babies that haven't been born yet How that happened? How is David Duke and Richard Spencer? still on YouTube If they really care about their community and meanwhile here we sit in the in a in an election year and we have Joe Biden ripping off Evanetti's The slogan Now you remember who he is He's the discredited attorney that everyone on the left loved because he was representing a porn star But I want you to hear Mr. plagiarism himself Joe Biden Use the same slogan that Avenatti did listen I think it's time to uh you know he says let's make America great again Let's make America America America again That's make America America America again. Who's America? What America? Who's America even ever America? Was America great at some time? How dare you say that Joe Biden No one even knows what that is anymore Let's make America America America again. What is America? The America that I knew growing up died sometime in 2002 Those who were born on September 11th 2001 are now in college and ready to vote for the first time They don't know what America was They don't know what America is that promise is long gone We've replaced equal justice with social justice. We have abolished truth And godly knows what the American way is But America is not a place America is an idea And this is what should give us hope America the idea Never finished never perfect but always striving The best of the blend back program Like listening to this podcast if you're not a subscriber become one now on iTunes But while you're there do us a favor and rate the show I think it's time to uh, you know, he says let's make America great again Let's make America America America again Yeah Like anybody knows what that means anymore. What does that mean anymore? To make America America again doesn't require a new president A different president. It doesn't require a single new law It doesn't require a dime of new spending. No new programs nor socialism Is going to make America America again You don't even have to vote this way or that way. Here's what making America America again requires That you begin to believe and understand and find self evident That all men are created equal and they have a right a group of rights And nobody can take away and they have a right to live the way they wish follow God or not follow God Raise their children By the dictates of their conscience and their spirit They get to keep the fruits of their own labor They live by the document That provides for the common defense That's all you have to do is live by this document that provides for the common defense Promotes not provides general welfare, but promotes general welfare and domestic tranquility Establishes justice not social justice blind justice All we have to do is start protecting our rights as human beings all of our rights Not the guy that we like and forget about the guy we don't like all of our rights And you know not even not even one group When they have control and they have power And then the opposite group when the opposite group has power That doesn't promote the general welfare It doesn't promote domestic tranquility It's in the belief of the idea of America And this a pretty grand idea nobody had ever tried it before And no one including us has ever perfected it nobody's ever reached it So should we just give up because this is what we have to say to ourselves? I give up we cannot do that The country that put a man on the moon has to say that's a bridge too far We can't live and self govern ourselves We can't live side by side with people we disagree with that's a bridge too far We can't do it Now let's stop and lower our goals See it's always a race to the bottom It's always a race to the bottom Our founder said let's reach beyond what we are now What we're being taught is to reach lower Forget about that idea that all men are created equal and each one of them have Unchangeable rights And that they can govern themselves through a document that explains exactly what the government can and cannot Ever do that's our hope that's our answer Quite honestly that's our war that's our world war two It's our duty And for the sake of our children It's not only our duty, but it it should be our sacred honor as well All right Pat Gray joins us now from the Pat Gray radio roundup, which is heard on the blaze and also On iTunes wherever you get your podcast. Hello Pat Hi Glenn. Let's make America America again. Can we do that? Let's do that by starting with a socialized medicine program and Constitutional right to continue the slaughter of children. That's what America's all about. That's what we're trying to create here That's what our founders wanted. I hate it when he gets into that whisper voice Oh, that drives me out of my mind. Although I love the exchange yesterday You know a couple years ago. We started talking about this Wouldn't it be fun to see a Donald Trump Joe Biden Match up in the general election Did we not predict how fun that was gonna be? It would be fun yesterday We got a little taste of how fun that's good. We're in it. We're a year and a half away From the general election and already in one day president Trump called Biden a dummy a loser and mentally weak You know, bless his heart. I love it. I mean, I shouldn't I know that's bad of me I'm probably a bad person, but I loved it. I can't imagine Ronald Reagan saying well You know that Joe Biden is a dummy Only Person in the world who is president of the United States would call somebody now It's only fun if Joe Biden swipes back with something justice ridiculously Unpresidential yes, and well we have we have some of that here's here's a little exchange back and forth Yesterday Tonight a split-screen moment and a possible preview of the general election. You know he says let's make America great again Let's make America America again sleepy Joe beautiful He's a sleepy guy former vice president Joe Biden Corning voters in the country's first caucus state looking past his more than 20 Democratic opponents and setting his sights squarely on the current commander in chief I believe that the president is literally an existential threat to America Today the president taking shots just before leaving on his own trip to Iowa a state he won in 2016 When a man has to mention my name 76 times in the speech that means he's in trouble Are you elevating Joe Biden by continually attacking him? No, I'd rather run against I think Biden than anybody I think he's the weakest mentally and I like running against people that are weak mentally I love this I just some fun right there isn't it right I think Biden I think he's got something with the sleepy It's gonna turn into some does because Biden Biden is making down Trump look like he's 20 years old Yeah, he is yeah, and Biden is kind of taking advantage of the fact that that I mean a Trump is taking advantage of the fact that Biden is so old Even though he's only four years younger and But I think it's working. I think it's working. It is because he is he is And I've never noticed this before about Joe But I think you know when you start to slip it can go fast and I think he's starting to be like You remember when when Ronald Reagan first got into office. He wasn't like that. Yeah by the time he got out of office You could see the toll it had taken and his age had started to it to kick in and it wasn't that he was senile It it was just that it was a little uncomfortable at times. He'd go well and Then he would have a great line, but you could see that he was aging Joe Biden is to me looks like he's just starting to fall apart I think too I mean Biden has always done this quiet voice thing no matter how much energy he's had It's always been like one of his sticks where he'll just get really quiet as if he's saying something Really profound when it's really not much of anything. Yeah, and I think he's doing it. I just May I just interject it and nothing is ever profound when it's followed by man, right? That is the way it's in a that's his plane talking sort of middle class yeah, middle class middle class people use the word man Right, and he thinks that if he says it yeah, he's middle class Like if he just stepped out of the Scooby-Doo mystery van 1972 middle class man, but it's he's doing it more I think because he he wants to contrast himself He wants to see everybody in that race is trying to show themselves as this with exception of maybe Sanders It's trying to show themselves as this super balanced calm intellectual because they think it Yeah, you know it just is a good contrast with Trump and we're Biden I think probably his strength is to be more like Trump right like he's the type of person that will come out and he can maybe Throw some insults at you and he does that stuff a lot He's supposed to be the likable guy, right? I don't know that he is but that's supposed to be a stick and he's trying to do this Other weird dramatic thing and you're right so far. I don't think it's working at all and how dare you when you're part of the team That started the fundamental transformation of the United States of America How dare you say we're gonna make America America again? You're the ones you're the You're part of the team that started tearing that apart. Yeah, I mean there's a new story out today that Biden is saying that Trump wants to rewrite the limits of the presidency Who are you? You just spent eight years doing that Joe Biden is gonna tell he's gonna lecture us on too much presidential power are you kidding me? And then they also said he was gonna cure cancer, which is I Mean if you get a little bizarre one, isn't it? Yeah, if you get selected Joe Biden is we're gonna cure cancer That's gonna be the big takeaway of his presidency really which I would say he's a good promise. Yeah I I used to do that as a joke Remember we were run fake candidates like Ernie velveida and Harold flamelowski and they would all promise to cure cancer now Joe Biden's really doing it I Mean it's like they'll never Donald Trump will never build that wall. I Don't know that's pretty simple compared to curing cancer You get that one done. I'm not so sure Joe Biden and what is Joe? He's you got it like new chemistry said he's gonna set up on the on the Resolute desk Quiet quiet. I'm close. I'm close. I just have to pour this be here into this other It's like basically what it is. I mean we really died I want to say we have to go back and find this now One of those guys whether it was Harold flamelowski or Ernie velveida said if you elect him He will he will cure cancer, but he won't tell you how until you elect him which was his big strategy I think That's what we need is we need to start that he's gonna That Joe Biden is gonna cure cancer. He's already cured it really you just have to elect him before he'll tell you how he's gonna We used to joke about it. He's now doing speeches This is a led the front runner in the race is doing speeches about if you elect him He'll cure cancer. That's a real thing happening right now That's amazing. Do you think that's does he have some information from scientists that they're a year away? But that wouldn't have anything to do with him being elected scientists. I know I'm not working unless Biden wins Like that's not a thing scientists do to my knowledge. I don't think so. I think he's probably saying I'm gonna dump a bunch of money into the research right. I guess he's promising maybe that's what actors say they're gonna do I'm not working unless you change this law I mean there are actors and scientists any different. I mean I certainly hope so, but I'm not so sure This is the best of the Glenn Beck program I Hi, it's Glenn if you're a subscriber to the podcast can you do his favor and rate us on iTunes? If you're not a subscriber become one today and listen on your own time you can subscribe on iTunes Thanks, so the one thing I really like about stew and there is only one is That he's a stat geek he is he's a guy who is is really numbers-minded and Can always tell you everything about every poll and which polls to dismiss and which ones not to dismiss and he's usually right He was pretty close on the election last time if I'm not mistaken and This time he has really put about a year's worth of work into developing a system that takes into consideration 30 different metrics can you go through any of those stoot to so we understand sure like I mean you think everything from polling we use even some prediction market stuff we go through endorsements and The organization the campaigns are building You know the debates the media coverage You know fun-draising. I mean really you know it's a couple of a few dozen and they actually grow we change We change the formula as it goes on so for example now polling is going to be less important Then something then you know a lot of these that indicate potential right potential is going to be more important now Then a week before an election when You know the polling is going to take into account all those things There's a lot of these candidates that people don't even know so you have to you There's a little bit of art inside of there But overall it's a good way of like looking at the entire field and seeing who's going up who's going down who you know Over a long period of time you can kind of follow the race and make sense out of it because it's freaking chaotic I mean there's 24 people in here and how do you how do you even understand the entire field? So I'm not really interested in the 24 people. I'm interested in the ones that actually have a chance So can you tell me you know give me the ones that are really the movers and shakers? Okay, few things from this one. What should I thought were pretty interesting? One was the biggest drop of any candidates since we started doing this And you may instinctively know that was a better work who Fell seven point four points the way we do this is all this giant formula basically spits out a number zero 100 So 100 would be in theory the perfect candidate that couldn't lose zero would be the worst candidate He is still kind of an oddly still the top tier of the race I mean people look at O'Rourke and say this guy's failed however He's still beating about 18 candidates in polls like he I mean a lot of these cans I think the answer I think it's 17 candidates are at zero or 1% of the 24 so to your point like you're right a lot of these guys Really seem to have no chance to Well the Blazio says he's just getting started. He is he's at zero, but he's just getting started He should start just getting finished But as of right now he is just getting started But I mean there are examples of this for example, I mean people to judge is one who was at zero and 1% for months And now is not you know people these things do change over time Elizabeth Warren looked done at one point during this campaign and and she's another big story in this She had a big rise and she's having a little bit of a moment I mean she's pulling better and better and her approach seems to oddly be working with people Which is essentially going out and churning out a new a new policy proposal Every week or so that's going to get involved in another aspect of your life I want to get into this possibly at the bottom of the hour that she seems to have an answer for everything now not cancer Now Joe Biden is the answer for cancer Literally play that audio in this case. You missed it. It's amazing I promise you If I'm elective president you're gonna see the single most important thing that's changes in America's we're gonna cure cancer Uh That's incredible Incredible so she doesn't have that answer, but she does seem to have an answer for everything else That is her that's her stick and it's what people really want we can get into her a little bit more but I mean she was the biggest Riser in the entire You know this addition of the power rankings that we do. I mean rank them all from one to 24 and There's it just takes too long because there's two dozen freaking people and you have to find something interesting about all of them That's not easy Uh, but Buttigieg is another guy who I find really interesting here and that like I kind of thought You know, I don't know the bump had kind of faded a little bit And I think that's somewhat true You see in the polling that Buttigieg is sort of fallen back He had a really good poll in Iowa this week Which that was before or this was after we did all these calculations But that you know, he's that's where he's focused most of his attention It's where he's polling best obviously if anyone who who wins Iowa is a real factor in the race sort of Automatically so the fact that he's right in there, you know, this is Biden's probably weakest early early state You know Sanders does okay there Warren does pretty well there and so does Buttigieg right now I mean if if Biden loses it'll mean something but if he's five eight ten points ahead It's not gonna mean it is this the number two will mean something because The media doesn't I don't think the media really wants Joe Biden to win but You still I mean the chances of of anybody else beating a ten point lead coming out of Iowa Well, I mean we had to step back here though. It's very early We haven't had one debate yet if you I mean Joe Biden yesterday came out and Promise that if he was elected he would cure cancer We all realized that Joe Biden is going to have 20 to 30 complete foot in mouth you know Face to rake sort of moments in this campaign The idea that he's gonna win by 20 points. I mean it is it's possible. He's winning I love the fact I love the fact that with Joe Biden it would it should be Raked face, but would Joe Biden he's so incompetent it's face to rake That's a good point The rake is still laying on the ground. He just falls down and smashes his face into it This is like the rake is just like I gotta hit that guy. I gotta hit that guy It's it's fascinating to I mean because look it would be ridiculous to To say that Biden is not only the leader in this race But really in a tear by himself I mean you cannot even put Sanders in his tear right now. I mean Biden absolutely This is his race to lose But he's really good at losing races. I mean he's done this in his entire career He's run for president like 107 times and he's won approximately zero times So no, I mean 108 is the jar. Yeah, I it's it I will say this though for Biden Number one he is running a different campaign than almost everybody else in this race Yes, he's hanging back from the cameras, which is obviously smart considering he's a gaff machine But in addition to that he is the one of the only candidates in the race and the only one I can think of that's above You know eighth or tenth in this race That is not folding to the sort of hardcore socialist messaging You know, he's a guy who's come out and said I'm not giving everybody free college We're gonna have free community college. We don't really want Medicare for all that's not gonna work You know what we sure we want a vorsion to be progressive But the high demandment should stay these are things He's the only one doing it and there's a reason why he's winning with a field that is not entirely socialist The Democratic voter the average person living in Iowa the average person living You know in these states that is gonna vote before a Democrat is not Alexandria, Kazio Cortez and every other candidate is trying to be her She seems to he seems to be the only one who's recognized that there's there's a day after The first primary there's a day after you win you have to go up against Donald Trump and try to win voters from the Midwest Who don't want Medicare for all who don't want socialism? So there's a there's a difference here too a similarity and a difference with 2016 in 2016 you had the same thing Donald Trump was not towing the line of the traditional Republican right he's not saying all those things he said I'm I'm you know now it's like Well, he just answers to anybody who is no he doesn't he doesn't he carved his own path and he held that But he is his own man I'm not sure Biden is his own man Maybe he is not sure he'll hold this path for very long At least after an election if he became president of the United States so he is he is sensing that these parties are not reflective of America as a whole because it leaves out the independent and I think there's a lot of people in America that are tired of the hard line The hard party line because they don't see the parties is doing anything Yeah, and so if somebody is an independent thinker or appears to be an independent yeah Americans I think are attracted by that I totally agree and that it's really important to point out Joe Biden is not a moderate Not at all He was one of the most I mean the one he was either him or Obama was the number one most liberal senator when Obama ran for president I believe it was Biden won in Obama too as the most progressive senator the guy is he no moderate He but he's messaging in that way which is smart because no one's addressing those people But he's not a revolutionary No, see I think that's the difference now We have we have a cosy ocortes and all of these people who are truly Revolutionaries and they want to burn the whole system down That's not Joe Biden he wants to carve out a nice little comfortable place for him and his cronies in the world that has already been created He's he's the kind of guy he's the kind of progressive that never delivers to the left You know what I mean? Not enough even though they I mean he felt like Obama even he passed you know Biggest massive expansions of government. We've probably ever seen my lifetime yet He's still seen as a disappointment somehow to progressive You know, I think that's true I mean Sanders I think is a real revolutionary Right like that he is he has lived this I mean a guy who went to for the Soviet Union on his honeymoon famously this guy is it is someone who is a real Revolutionary I think it's something to some extent Warren really is too There's a lot of them that are playing the role and I don't know how revolutionary they are But Biden is I think you're right a Democrat Far left Democrat a guy who represented the state of Delaware Remember for all of those years. This is not a guy who he likes to say he was from you know Pennsylvania and he likes to kind of portray that those midwest values That's not what this guy ran on and the only reason people get confused with Biden and they think well Maybe he's sort of moderate is because he's old He he was taking liberal positions in 1978 that seemed conservative today because the country has massively moved to the left and so they go back and like well You said this in 1980 well in 1980 was like basically socialism What he was recommending right right and so he's constantly been on the progressive edge this entire time and if he becomes president He will be at least Obama and who knows may go even further But he'll be he will be a very Liberal president that will try to change things up he might not be Sanders he might not be Warren But he's gonna be he don't don't let him fool you There's this idea that and there's several candidates that are attempting this in the race Which is moderation with a wink Right like basically they're saying I'm a moderate wink wink Hey Democrats. I want you to know I'm not a moderate And you know that is something that Biden is attempting There's a bunch of candidates at the bottom of the field who are attempting as well and successfully But that's largely because Biden so far has been successful you have to imagine there's some lane for people who want a normal Biden sort of Democrat here as they see it and That lane is not going to be taken by Elizabeth Warner Bernie Sanders This is the Glenn Beck program. We're looking at the power rankings that Stu puts out once a week. Stu what is the Where are the strengths and the weaknesses of Biden Well, I mean Biden look is is the name recognition is is is very very high I mean as much as we talk about how there's so much power with the socialist out there People really generally speaking remember Biden fondly as Democrats again I'm not talking about him going up against Donald Trump It's this is just a Democratic contest and people like him. I mean, you know, he's got a you know a favorability rating of 77% 77 to 15 is this favorable in the Democrats in the Democratic Party so that's I mean that is a You know, that's a nice thing to run on I mean Bernie Sanders has a high one as well Of course every Democratic candidate with the exception of Bill de Blasio is is viewed Relatively fairly Bill de Blasio is has the worst approval ratings in the entire field and he just got into the field Like if you just said he's you know the whole field is rated fairly I think they're rating him fairly too. Oh, yeah. That's true. It's not not well I would say but look at certain candidates on here and a couple that I would highlight would be Kamala Harris and Pete Buttigieg who have still massive gaps in their familiarity I mean like it's about a third of Democrats have never heard the name Pete Buttigieg before I Mean that is like we you know, we talk about this stuff every day So to to us this guy's been you know invading our lives for several months But I mean he is basically As far as candidates go pretty unknown I mean he's in the area of you know Julian Castro as far as name recognition And he performs much better than Castro does as far as favorability when I was in music radio I used to pick the music for radio and I remember I look at research and you would look at the familiarity and there was a tipping point But if you had a pop song that was very very popular and people loved it but it was unknown to the mass You had a pretty good shot that once it was exposed it was going to It would take off So that's the thing with Buttigieg Once people know who he is if his numbers out. What are his likes and hates and Really really love kind of numbers. Do you look into that at all? Yeah, that's that's part of this You know, he's at 42 11 right now one important thing to understand though is Basically every candidate in this race has about 10% of people who will say they don't like them And it goes up from there like you know Bernie Sanders is almost 20 But you know Buttigieg is at that floor basically it's at 11% And he has 42% so a four to one ratio plus he has a third of the audience that has not even heard of him yet So if he can continue those sorts of ratios He's in a really nice position and that's the thing about Buttigieg and why he performs so well on the power rankings is because he's got tons of room to grow Right and if he has deep passion not people who are like I like that Pete guy but deep passion And that much room to grow. He is a real contender. Yeah, I think the thing His big concern I would say just watching him as a candidate is He needs to he's one of these people and there's a few in this race I would say Cory Booker's kind of in this position I would say Chris Cuomo on CNN is this type of person who thinks they're a lot smarter than everyone else on earth and He definitely shows that from time to time He thinks an awful lot of himself and it comes through In his speeches and that will say good hurt him that will think the blaze radio network On Demand"
