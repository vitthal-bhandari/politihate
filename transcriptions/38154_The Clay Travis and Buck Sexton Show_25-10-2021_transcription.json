    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast Welcome back to the clay Travis and bucksxton show. This is buck I am coming to you live from Las Vegas, Nevada my man clay Travis coming to you live from Nashville, Tennessee and Got much to discuss with you this hour including the Biden agenda if possible wealth tax from Janet yellow ball she's saying that it will be a wealth tax but Attacks on the wealthy is how she wants to phrase it. We'll talk about it Behind a agenda hanging in the balance right now some last-minute negotiations underway 1.5 1.7 trillion, you know, whatever it ends up being it's going to be a lot of money and they're hoping that this will save a Floundering Biden presidency thus far so we'll be getting into all that but first we have the continued fight against covid madness as I said, I'm here in Las Vegas, Nevada and there are Mask mandates in place in the casinos which just seems to me to be Beyond belief in everyone. So they're harassing you to mask up Even though these places are vast or cavernous And you're sitting there smoking gambling drinking but you better put your mask on even if you're vaccinated. They don't care Uh, which is a shame but it just goes to show you that there are these lingering these lingering covid Theater that I would call it. I mean, it's nonsense. What's going on and you also have dr. Fauci Who has come under some real scrutiny recently he Has gotten away with openly lying to the american people he lied to us about masks By one way or the other I think he actually lied when he said that he believed masks to work because there are dozens of studies Peer reviewed with control groups stretching back for decades showing that surgical masks against respiratory viruses do basically nothing But okay, we're supposed to forget all of that because it's a security blanket and a control mechanism and democrats embraced it As part of their campaign against trump and then it was something they could never get rid of afterwards But then fauci said maybe no holidays then fauci said maybe uh, you were gonna have No ability to or you shouldn't have any ability to um Uh, go to football games this Summer if you were college football games at least that was going to be a super spreader event people started to realize A lot of politicized decision-making from this guy And then clay there's this this study that I understand it doesn't involve humans and it has nothing to do with covid Yes, but the niaid National institute of algene and flexus disease nayad which is directly under fauci's purview It's a subset of the nih the national institute of health Spend millions of dollars on a Research project if you can call it that In tinesia where they took beagle puppies and they removed their vocal cords and they let sandflies eat their faces while they were alive I mean, it's so horrific and i've got people texting me saying it this is monstrous Thousand i mean sorry millions of dollars of us taxpayer dollars under fauci's Ages of nayad go into this is this finally too far like our is this going to be the thing that makes people think differently at least about fauci I would love to see Reliable polling on fauci over the past several months because I think what we have seen is Now without trump there People are starting to recognize that fauci is a disaster Who wouldn't have said that if trump were still there? I mean buck think about what the media would be saying About the covet vaccine if donald trump were still the president of the united states Think about what the democrats would be saying about the covet vaccine if donald trump were still the president of the united states this thing And what we have been told the selling points are for the covet vaccine Has exploded in a negative way, right? Because you just have to track what dr. Fauci himself was saying in may All of the mask requirements are gone if you get vaccinated you can live a totally normal life A couple of months later they walk all that back and they continue to put new implementations of regulations in place and I think it's important to note That florida Which has been the state where they have tried to go after ron de santis over covet more than any state in the country florida right now buck has the lowest covet infection rate Of any state in the country. It is half the rate is florida right now Half what is going on in california for instance according to the new york And half new york And those two states have got covet vaccine passports They got people wearing masks indoors like crazy And yet they have double the covet infection rate right now a florida because what de santis brought to bear And I think we got to keep hammering this for our audience But also for all those reasonable people that are listening to us you talked about bucket your uh one of your weddings You went to guy who doesn't align with you politically said hey i've been listening to the show. I hear a lot of that people This show it's his it's his rationality bath for the mimes There you go And I think there are a lot of people out there that are so frustrated by the media They want to pull their hair out when they see the way that stories are covered And they may not agree with us on every political subject and by the way if you agree with anybody else on every political suspect Subject you need to think a little bit more Uh, you need to you know like the idea that you're going to agree with anybody 100 percent of the time is pretty boring We don't want you to turn into a into a communist like the people were arguing against uh, but rational reasonable thought here Is turning against fauci and ironically buck it may be Something that has nothing to do with covid because there's no political angle at all on a lot of people saying man I don't know if I agree with Experimenting on animals not just puppies but also different uh other animals in so vile of a way with american taxpayer dollars Right and now when you add to this that there was NIH funding of the wuhan In dispute lab and it was doing gain of function research this plays into a broader Abrottor issue of do we just have bureaucrats in the health services in this country who at places like cdc and ih Who are funding things that are awful and reckless and a danger to us in the case of wuhan Without any really accountability or oversight and that's what seems to be the case This is what people are starting to wake up to and this is why having honest and open debate This is why the betrayal of free speech that has gone on in this country Not just by big tech but by much of the scientific community who will go along with this stuff because they're scared Because they're indoctrinated because a lot of them unfortunately are cowards And then there are the doctors who I think are just feeling like if they speak out They won't be able to see their patients they'll lose their license. They have a duty to them I'm very sympathetic toward that. I understand there's a lot of different ways That open debate and discussion has been shut down during the covid pandemic It has made all of this worse and governor ronda santis Standing up again clay. We we've been saying I mean if you did a word search and everything we say is catalogued archived online so people can always see so when we say Oh, we said you can go check by the way go to clan buck.com. You can see transcripts of the show But we've been saying that it is it is completely unscientific really Anti-scientific to have vaccine mandates that don't take into account natural immunity Right because now you're just now you're forcing people to get a shot And there's absolutely no reason for them to be getting the shot and you think you're the good guy so to speak for doing this Here's ronda santis sounding a lot like somebody who listens to this show play too Well, first I think it's hard to point out on a scientific basis Most of those first responders have had covid and have recovered So they have strong protection And so I think that influences their decision on a lot of this that they have already had it recovered And so they're they're making no accommodations for that. They're still pretending like that doesn't even exist And so that's really really troubling Natural immunity to political reasons Yeah I mean and buck this is I believe One of the big challenges is going to be And and I and and it's important to have this conversation. How does normalcy return? How do we land the plane? and finally jettison all the people who have been Screaming about needing to have masks on about kids needing to be vaccinated all these things like how do we get back? To a normal existence and that's why i've kept hammering College football and nfl stadiums being full. I was at one on sunday I'm going to the world series On tuesday and wednesday down in houston Be at the world's largest outdoor cocktail party the floor to georgia game. I got a heck of a week coming up for me By the way, it's pretty awesome But that being surrounded by all these people that are saying Hey, we're getting back to normal and I know a lot of you out there right now parents and grandparents with halloween coming up on sunday You're going to be going door to door with your kids. They're going to be dressed up. You're going to be knocking on doors You're going to be getting candy. It's going to feel normal And I think that's the way right the path away back Is not by some governmental authority making a decision Buckets by you and me and everybody out there listening to us Just refusing to cow tow and live in fear anymore Embrace normalcy in your own life and other people Start to see that normalcy and slowly it spreads there We say like a virus itself a virus of normalcy in a world where they continue to want to treat us at abnormally You could you could think of it like reverse incrementalism, but incrementalism in favor of freedom instead of in favor of yes authoritarianism and that's the way it's by not Snitching on the person next to you on the plane not that this happened to me for not having their mask up or whatever It's by being the person who's supposed to enforce it You know on the on the floor of the casino who says you know what? I'm just gonna let this guy enjoy walking past me without harassing him If everybody stops with the madness then the madness can actually stop I think that's one way to one way to view this but clay I know you've got some thoughts for us on owning a home and financing it. No doubt a lot of homeowners out there Don't believe a refi can save the money, but the reality is trust me It's true. You can save a bundle especially with these incredibly low rates Still near historic lows and they can save you a ton on a month-to-month basis up to $12,000 a year. That's a thousand dollars a month. How much different could that be for you as long as you go with the right linder? That's american financing the only lender we recommend call american financing at 800-777-8109 that's 800-777-8109 or visit american financing net american financing animal s 1 8 2 3 3 4 animal s consumer access dot org Welcome back in clay travis bucks accident show encourage you to check out the podcast search out my name clay travis Search out bucks sexton go give us five stars make sure you don't miss a single minute We're gonna have a fun week of shows for you bucks starting off the week in vegas By the way, have you played any table games yet? Have you gambled at all since you got there? Oh, I will definitely go and throw away some money at the blackjack table very little bit of money because you know Still got to save up for that house, but uh, yeah, no, I I'm some of dude I don't I don't understand the appeal of A lot of these different gambling games just gonna say i'm weird that way I don't know what to say I like to play blackjack with buddies sitting around the table and also with what drinks cost in a vegas casino At least i'm thinking to myself. Hey, i'm gonna make out, you know at least probably break even on the drinks by themselves Uh, I think that is part of the cowboys because they keep those drinks flowing to folks No doubt. Um and the smoking and everything else as we were talking about um and uh We we haven't really discussed this but it's been a monster story for what like the last three days or so buck Um, allic bald when while filming a movie in new mexico Shot and killed a I believe it's the director of cinematography also shot Uh and wounded another man who was involved in the filming There and now there's a lot of discussion about what is going to happen to allic bald when how the shooting took place Whether there might be any criminal charges certainly This is me putting my lawyer hat on there will be many civil lawsuits before all is said and done Uh relating to the wrongful death and lots of money will be paid out I would imagine to the woman uh and her family. I believe she has a young child But buck you are pretty well versed in firearms. You've been paying a lot of attention to this story What happened? I think that's the question that a lot of people are asking So there there are a number of factors that make this look Really bad in terms of recklessness. I don't think anyone believes that allic bald when wanted to do this That's crazy, but it was an accident but an accident with recklessness can still be a huge civil problem and and and obviously there's ethical considerations That one has to take into account here with everything going on. So so some basics Uh the armor on this particular production I think was 24 years old and was known to be Just reckless and not somebody who understands guns was she was a young female armor Who did not understand firearms very well? Uh and that was known and there had been other problems with with safety on set and other production she had already been a part of So why was she chosen for this? That's one issue. There's reporting that there was a Walk off the set for safety reasons earlier on in the production So it seems like this had already been plagued by issues And then when you look at this the fact that two people were hit obviously he only fired this once and saw what happened It was a bullet. I mean initially there was all this. Oh, look what happened to Brandon Lee the son of bruce Yes, who has killed filming the movie the crow back in uh in the 90s in north carolina Um, that was a shard of a previous bullet. I believe that was in the chamber and came out So a really a freak accident. This seems to be a hot round This seems to be actually a gun that was loaded with a bullet because they had been using the gun For target practice offset for fun out in the new mexico does so so now you've got people that are using a weapon sometimes live around sometimes not I mean that is Highly highly problematic and then when you add to it The most basic gun safety stuff. I mean I remember clavin we did uh when I was with the with the federal government We did firearms training if you even if you were in a classroom and you were using Uh guns that were essentially either squib guns or things that it's impossible for them to fire around If you swept somebody with your gun they would send you home They would say are you can come back in a few weeks when you learn guns save me They were so strict about it all the time for exactly this reason on all guns are always loaded You have to be ready to destroy whatever you're pointing the gun at You know, know where your finger is on the trigger keep your finger off until you've made the decision to shoot these things are In you know, they're they're seared into your brain for a reason to avoid a situation like this It it seems like this was recklessness. It was a you know a tragic Accident but an accident along the lines of you know distracted driver who? You know runs a few people over on the sidewalk. You didn't mean to run them over But you should have been looking at your cell phone. You know what I mean? That's that's where I think This is going to get into a a serious legal issue and legal battle Obviously you got one person killed another by the way the fact that two of them were hit with one round It was clearly a bullet. I mean this wasn't the wadding from a blank Uh, so that was I think that was obvious in the beginning a lot of people were writing about that Incorrectly because they didn't know any better. So we'll see but Alec Baldwin look then there's the part of this Alec Baldwin is a left-wing bomb thrower a lot of people hate this guy. He said horrible things about trump He's a nasty nasty person to his political opponents All that said, you know, I you know, there's a woman who's dead here. She was a mother a wife You know, I I'm I don't I don't get into the Politics if you're being honest in this situation. Alec Baldwin for whatever his political beliefs may be Certainly we're gonna give him a level of Generosity and coverage probably that he wouldn't give to others right? I mean if this had been correct A republican who would somehow been doing he would be mocking if you were I had been in this situation He would be mocking us openly, but that doesn't mean that we should be who he is And we'll see what ends up happening from a criminal perspective again The civil lawsuits certainly are going to be going on for years and years to come I would imagine but the criminal nature here Was it so negligent that there could be a manslaughter charge brought that'll be a real challenge to figure out exactly Uh that storyline we got a bunch more to get to including How is this? Large expansion of the federal government going to be funded We got an idea Janet Yellen and others weighing in but I want to tell you about tunnel the towers They're providing 200 mortgage-free homes to many different families out there with fallen soldiers or first responders in need including Sergeant nelson we told you about mario nelson signed up to be a member of the national guard in 2001 Just a couple of months before 9-11 his nature to volunteer not long after he enlisted Well, he and his wife had a newborn daughter and they all left for germany months later to the middle east And unfortunately tragically Mario never came back when he went to the middle east tunnel towers didn't forget about her or her plight They provided her a mortgage-free home to raise their daughter in your donations made that possible You need to donate 11 dollars a month to tunnel the towers at t2t.org. That's t the number two t dot or do it today I What's going to be in the huge biden bill that congress may be passing here soon we have Some indications of what's going to be in it. I'm going to talk to you about the welcome back to the clay and buck show You have senator joe mansion who has been one of two Bull works against the insane spending of their fellow democrats now keep in mind We're still talking about a whole lot of additional spending over the next 10 years after you already had a 1.9 trillion dollar democrat Rescue package passed earlier this year trillions and trillions of spending going on during covid inflation getting to be the kind of problem that not even The democrats can ignore it's real people see it. They feel it. They know plus you've got supply chains snarls millions of Unfilled jobs and a lot of anxiety particularly in major cities Across the country about what the winter is going to be like with covid Continuing to have pretty heavy numbers now mansion is closer to the 1.1 trillion Pat 1.5 trillion dollar top line viden had a meeting with him recently trying to pitch him on let's get it up to $2 trillion so as we've known all along they're haggling over the price And it's going to be between 1.5 and 2 trillion dollars and the democrats will I believe pass something here very soon And then they'll be talking about what a huge success it is and how Biden's amazing and all the rest of it So get ready for that. But what's some of the stuff that's actually in this Well, they are talking about a tax on The wealthiest individuals in the country that will go after Their holdings in the stock market. So this should be unrealized So it's not stock you've sold that stock you have And for the very very wealthiest not clear exactly how they would implement this and As we know the devil is in the details, but here is treasury secretary jannick yellen Speaking about this proposed tax that would allegedly Pay for the build back better act play 12. I wouldn't call that a wealth tax but It would help get at capital gains which are an extraordinarily large part of the incomes of the wealthiest individuals and right now Escape taxation Until they're realized and often they're unrealized and the death benefit from So-called step-up of basis. So it's not a wealth tax but a tax on unrealized capital gains of exceptionally wealthy individuals It's not a wealth tax play just a tax on really really wealthy people's stock transactions or not even transactions stock holdings Here's my problem with it. Okay Let me start with the the big picture problem Once you start taxing wealthy people's unrealized capital gains Eventually you open the door to taxing a lot of people out there who aren't anywhere near as wealthy's unrealized capital gains. Let's not uh exaggerate here This is a radical change in the way that we are taxing people And so the idea that we're suddenly going to implement this Is I think a problem because what have we found out about anything that the government implements that allows them to get more money? Eventually they need more money and they expand Uh the overall number of people that can be impacted by this. It's in that's that's problem number one. Problem number two is this is incredibly complicated It's in general focused on the 700 wealthiest americans Okay, so and for people out there a lot of you may not even spend much time thinking about capital gains A capital gain. Let's say that you bought a stock for $10 Right. Let's say you bought a stock for $10 and that stock then increases to $20 You would owe a tax on the 10 to $20 When you sell that stock If you have not sold that stock then technically you have not realized a capital gain It is only what's called a paper profit So effectively what the government is doing is they are saying they are going to tax paper profits That is unrealized dollars that are essentially sitting in your stockholder accounts. Okay. So here's the complicating factor with this Only the 700 richest people are being impacted by this buck We are designing a tax plan on the fly in short order Biden wants it done before he leaves the country in the next few days six days from now Who would you rather bet on buck? The 700 wealthiest americans being advised by the greatest tax attorney and accountants that exist anywhere in the world being able to find loopholes to avoid taxation or The federal government bureaucrats operating on a strict timetable Trying to come up with a radical and has yet never implemented before Policy to tax the wealthiest among us I am betting buck on The cadre of brilliant people that are going to be advising the billionaires This tax is not going to work. It's going to be a mess We're going to spend years in litigation over whether it's even constitutional to tax unrealized capital gains And in the meantime, we're already going to have spent that money Likely driving up substantially more deficits This is not a zero cost basis as joe biden continues to argue I think we are buying a lawsuit and I think we are buying a mess here as the american public And I think we are setting a awful precedent by trying to tax unrealized paper profits Even if it's among the wealthiest because eventually it's going to trickle down to a lot more of us Well, they've also done this overseas clay. They've tried a wealth tax until to your point about what happens The the super rich evade it. They find a way They or they just start people say oh no, they can't because it'll be so straightforward You have to pay this fee Well, then they'll just invest in they'll invest in real estate And now what are you gonna do you're gonna force someone to sell The property that they own you're gonna force them to sell the apartment building They're an investor in because of the unrealized upside gains They will move their money around as they can because they have the truth the super rich Which is what they're really talking about here Have not only the greatest army of accountants and lawyers imaginable But also have the most options for where to put their money here in the states and all over the world The europeans tried this. I mean the french Had a wealth tax it had a it was between 1.5 and 1.8 percent of fortunes over 13 million euros And guess what it never got to be about more than 1 of tax revenue in france people Repatriated they left they moved to other countries. They moved their money to other countries So as a socialist wealth redistribution scheme It was just a lot of hot air essentially But what's even more concerning in this country is if you look at the history and this is really instructive Look at the history of income tax in america everybody It started out as this is just on super rich people That was how they sold it in the beginning of the 20th century This is just for the super rich It's never going to come after you we'll use duties and exercises and customs and other things to fund the federal government Oh no Now you get that nice chunk taken out of your bi-weekly paycheck All based on the it'll just be on the ultra rich Promise from about a hundred years ago by the way a little over a hundred years ago now So that's what's and that's what's happened. So this is why opening the the spigot for the government Of yet another mechanism of taxation I think is is really concerning But you know that they may be able to get this one through because class warfare sells right class warfare works That's why democrats do it all the time And I think you raised a really good point buck because it's relatively easy at least to look at a stock price because we know every single Day what the value of a property is on the stock market But if you invest in real estate if you invest in I don't know and a Major league baseball franchise If you invest in artwork things that are not as tangibly easy to value and oh by the way What happens if our stock market tanks and these guys lose billions of dollars? Are we going to somehow allow them to have massive tax credits based on their unrealized capital gains losses?

That's me Uh, and i'll be headed down to houston for game one and game two of the world series I was just texting Uh with a variety of people down in the houston market who are uh excited about the world series being there So i'm looking forward to to hanging out with a a bunch of those people be in the studio wednesday i will be Um, but you know all of this insanity, you know abama accused The right of getting fired up about made up culture wars Meanwhile, we're in two weeks of the dave shapelle comedy special continuing to be a controversy Where people are protesting and demanding that dave shapelle's comedy special be pulled off the air Those are not right wingers that are demanding that that take place and social media continues to ban people for saying truthful comments Representative jim banks banned by twitter for pointing out that rachel leveen now a four star admiral Is not in fact the first woman four star admiral because she was born a man and decided to change her gender and that Just sharing that fact Got representative jim banks banned by twitter that is an unacceptable fact to share on social media Which is crazy and this also ties in with the attacks being leveled upon dave shapelle Here's activist ashley preston on netflix Uh talking about the dave shapelle special so to be clear this conversation is about equity and entertainment And we see that there is a lack of equity With trans content versus content such as dave shapelle's we know that netflix paid him 23.6 million But the sticks and stones special in 2019 and for the closer he was paid 24.1 million Making transphobic content in the middle of one of the deadliest years on record for the trans community And so this is about the emergence of a hate economy that incentivizes media that marginalizes This is insane. This is insane. I mean this is but this is what the activists do And clay if they had a real argument to make that wasn't rooted in hysteria that wasn't rooted in Uh, you know the deadliest what what exactly I would like to see the numbers or the deadliest year for for trans individuals So we're supposed to think that that's because of dave dave shapelle's netflix special Obviously not but this is the justification for the censorship And the totalitarian thought policing that people always have there they always say there's some Good reason for why we can't allow you to have your thoughts And this is the speech equals violence paradigm the left have been running with for a long time, which is just You know, you're seeing things now They're trying to hammer through and force people to bend the knee to fundamental untruths to lies They want you to live by lies. They want you to say that a man is a woman They want you to say that speech equals violence because if they can get you to do that There's no limit to their control if they can disorient all of us into thinking or into believing or even just going along with Obviously on true things. What limitation do they have clay on controlling us in any respect? Well, and buck we watched this comedy special And my wife turned to me after we finished the comedy special and she said did any transgender people who are protesting actually watch this special I I mean because What shaepel was doing was ridiculing Much of the modern language that exists across a variety of spectrums, right? And one of the lines that stood out to me was he was talking about katelyn jinner Was named woman of the year in the first year that she had ever become a woman and the analogy he made is like Hey, if the bt awards gave Gave m&m black person of the year award people would be like, oh, this is an outrage, right? Like this is crazy So the first year that katelyn jinner decides she's a woman She's the woman of the year and the idea look and I think I I can't speak exactly for you because i'm not sure your exact perspective I don't think most people care what gender you want to identify as right If it makes you happier and you are a fully grown adult. I really just don't care at all I don't think we ought to be giving hormones to kids who are five years old to try to change their gender I think that's great. Do you think we should call uh, do you think you should be forced to call a? Uh, he is she no, I'm saying I but if you make that choice in your own life That's fine But expecting that the entire world is going to bend to define you And use the pronouns that you choose and all of these other things to me This is about power right and I don't feel like the marginalized group Is the one that has all the media behind them that has all the major corporations behind them That has all of the might of the intellectual left behind them That's and you're demanding that someone can't make a joke about you. These are what authoritarians do. I always used to talk about Terrorists aren't probably very funny, right? Because absolutism is the enemy of humor Maybe i'm wrong and they sit around and torah bora back in the day and they're telling also Kind of jokes back in the day. They're not they're not funny and so there's so there's that uh But I can also say that when you're looking at the you're right about the power dynamics here the power You know the the the paradigms of who's actually calling the shots They're telling they're straighten this the trans activist community is trying to establish a you cannot We cannot take a joke and you cannot make jokes Yes as the rule and if you try to break this they will ruin you they will destroy your career They will run you out of town and then they turn on say that we're so oppressed Yes, and that's remarkable that we are still having this conversation dave shapelle is perhaps the most successful There are a few names that put in there comedian period certainly among the most successful african-american comedians of his generation but probably just comedian you know across all categories as well And he still has to deal with this and he has to kind of apologize and all the rest of it Who has the power here? Not only that book just leave you with this thought and I always think it's a really Massive way to think about it if you choose your gender like rachel doh was all did It's super racist if you choose your your race if you choose your gender you're a hero Isn't it harder to choose a gender shouldn't it be then to choose a race yet one is racist the other one is heroic Just want to tell everybody we have zomay khalil zod speaking of afghanistan what's going on there He was the chief negotiator and ambassador for the us with the taliban under both trump and biden That's going to be huge interview tomorrow on the show be sure to tune in for it You're listening to clay travis and buck sexton on the eib network"
