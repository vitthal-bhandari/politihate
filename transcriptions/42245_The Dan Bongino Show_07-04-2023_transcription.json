Good Friday. Yes. Yes, Joe. Good Friday. Yes, Joe. Yes, Joe. I love library. You know what it is about live programming? I love live programming because I need to operate under pressure all the time. I can't function any other way. Okay, wouldn't you agree? A much better life. And by the way, thank you to Jimmy G. He says that there was a four-monthly event. An episode was in 1173 and there may have been another one. We will be researching that. We'll get back to you next week. Folks, serious stuff to get to though. The alleged trans-serial killer in Tennessee appears to have been a great resource for many murdered six people, including three nine-year-olds, three nine-year-olds and three adults. And now you're getting what I hope is a clear look at the political battles you're fighting because they're not political. They manifest as political, but they are in fact rooted in the mustard seed here of evil. Be very careful. The fights in front of us now are really serious. That liberals have leapt by instinct, by instinct, to the defense of this alleged trans serial killer in Tennessee. And their first instinct was not to say, hey, is something going wrong here with this battle on sexuality using gender identity with kids? Are we doing something wrong that their first instinct wasn't to do that? But to then disarm you and get kids to not have to take away armed guards in kids' schools or to not have them put in kids' schools and to make you victims should tell you we are dealing with pure unadulterated evil. The political fight is just a manifestation of it. The real fight is a moral and ethical one. It is you versus evil, period. Now remember when Donald Trump on January 6th and go march at the Capitol peacefully and patriotically, you are not going to get a more clearer non-insitement of violence than that. Go to the Capitol peacefully and patriotically. It doesn't get any clearer than that. Here's the strange thing. Six people were murdered, three nine-year-olds, mowed down by a deranged lunatic. Green Jumpy Airs at the White House yesterday. You think she'd be concerned about the murder victims? Nope. Nope. No, sorry. Green Jumpy Air appears to be by the Democrats' own rules inciting violence from the Brady Press Room talking about a trans people. They fight back and their fears by their own rules. This is inciting violence, no? Take a listen yourself. More than 50% of transgender youth in the US, which is estimated to be more than 150,000 kids, live in states in which transgender youth have lost access to or at risk of losing access to gender affirming care. Look, this is awful news. Will it be very clear about that? LGBTQI plus kids are resilient. They are fierce. They fight back. They're not going anywhere. And we have their back. This administration has their back. I want you to understand what you're fighting here, folks. You are fighting pure, unadulterated evil. They're not hiding it. They're not putting lipstick on it. You are fighting evil. The sexualization of kids, the mutilation of their bodies, the defense, the instinctive defense of trans ideology, the instinctive defense of this, despite any questions whatsoever, despite six body bags. And another, by the way, alleged potential attacker who was just locked up the other day for planning some kind of an attack. There is no, there's no looking in the mirror. There's no analysis of what's going on because they don't care. They're using this ideology as a vehicle to empower themselves, period. So yesterday in Tennessee, Republican lawmakers, they finally showed some guts. I wish they would have expelled the third loser too. So three loser lawmakers who decided to engage and encourage an insurrection into Tennessee Capitol, Tennessee, obviously where the shooting happened. Liberals are like, I don't know, man, you Nashville's in Tennessee, folks, for the libs listening, right? Here's some video of the insurrection if you can play that. So this happened last week. A bunch of students stormed the Capitol, of course, a bunch of adults who are careless losers, incentivize them to assault police to try to force their way into the chamber. So it was an insurrection that's not open for debate, libs, that's not open for debate. You told us that's an insurrection. If you commit these crimes to try to stop a legal proceeding, it's an insurrection. Shut your freaking mouth. I'm not interested in your opinion. Your words shut up. Take the syrup of Ipaca. Got it? Get it? Got it? Good. Move along. So here's one of the insurrectionists, a lawmaker who decided to interrupt a legislative proceeding. My Justin Jones decides to grab a bullhorn bullhorn. That's interesting. Bullhorns brings back some bad memories there. So bullhorn on the Capitol law floor decides he's just going to take over and usurper authority. One of the insurrectionists right here. Here's Justin Jones. You can see it with the bullhorn with his partner there. And of course, you had the other lawmaker as well. Thought it would be a good idea to grab a bullhorn and try to take over. So of course, they are insurrectionists. So the penalty for insurrection in the chamber there is to be expelled, which they were, which is great. Love it. I had a bunch of people on Twitter yesterday. So Dan, you support the expulsion of lawmakers for free speech, wasn't free speech, wasn't free speech, dip wads. Don't be stupid all the time. They had every opportunity be recognized by the chair as his procedure in Tennessee. They decided to grab a bullhorn, which is fascinating. Because you said when people broke into the Capitol and did the same thing in Washington DC, it was in its direction. So you can kiss my ass and get the double barreled non-family friendly made a finger. You got it? I care so little about what you idiots say that I sent back the Kleenex gift fee yesterday from Billy Crystal. Cry more. Don't care. By the way, they're perfectly entitled to run again for their seats. If they win, the people want them. That's how democracy works. But if you're going to swear in as a representative, they've got rules on the floor. They don't want to follow them. Bye now. Bye bye. See you later. Oh, you don't feel that? No, no, not at all. No, bye. Bye should have got rid of the third one too. The other loser. Here's the other loser. Another representative. She was the only one who survived. She happens to be white. The other two lawmakers who actually had the bullhorn happen to be black. She survived by one vote. Shouldn't have. So of course, guys, she's white there, black. Wait, I mean, where do you think this one? I know you're trying to. You haven't unmuted, right? I'm kidding. I know Joe's struggling. I'll give you a hint, Joe. The Democrats believe it or not. This is crazy. The lady said it definitely had to be racist. I know you're stunned by this. But yeah, I know. I know you're stunned. You're listening to yourself. Here she is. She's like, well, I wasn't expelled clearly because I'm white. Take a listen. Gloria, why do you feel like there was a difference in the outcome between you and your colleague? You want I will answer your question. It might have to do with the color of our skin. She acts like there was like some unanimous effort to keep her. She survived by one vote. Everybody else wanted you out and didn't care that by your own words, you were a 60 year old, what white lady? Nobody cared. Now, when they bring up the race thing, here's my recommendation. Oh, what? Argue with none. I don't argue with it. It's it's so ridiculous and stupid. Don't even waste your time. No, don't. Don't I just laugh. Laugh in their faces, laugh loudly, laugh boldly, humiliate them and mock them like I did yesterday. On social media, to some goon who tried to challenge me on it. Just mock them. Just mock them. Don't even don't answer because it's not a question. You're not answering. Will you understand that? It's the when did you stop beating your wife thing? They're waiting to get into a racial argument with you. It doesn't exist. So just openly mock them for being as dumb and ignorant as they are. That's it. That's it. Now, of course, Biden, who at the same time the Biden administration is pushing to have people charge for treason insurrection, the worst insurrection in American history up at the US Capitol, when the exact same thing happens in the Tennessee Capitol, Biden, of course, supports it. Political Biden condemns Tennessee House vote to expel Dems over the gun protests. This is fascinating because they've always taken on this and it was done via the proper democratic process. You break the rules. You do that. You're subjected to expulsion. They were expelled by now by anybody here feel bad for him. Anyone is to take a quick vote. Get out Joe. Anyone? No, I don't. See. Yeah, they should have got all three. Yeah, that's my only regret. The other one's not gone too. Remember, they can run again. They can even be appointed to their own seats. And you may say, what, you support that? No, I don't. I don't support or not support the process. And yes, absolutely. The people should be able to pick their own representatives. They want these three losers back, put them back. They do it again, expel them again. See, unlike liberals, I actually have principles unlike the dipwads we're dealing with on the other side. Onward folks, onward. I don't want any lectures from Biden either who has stayed awful quiet about the first police state presidential prisoner we've ever had in Donald Trump. You have zero credibility. I take everything you say and I laugh at it. I throw it instantaneously in the garbage. That's how little respect I have for you losers in the White House. I just want to then you sound a little hostile today. Not really. I'm actually in a really good mood. I slept like a champion last night. Like I haven't. I don't know what happened. I took a little theanine right out, right out. I just get I'm getting tired of weak need, wuss bag Republicans. Oh my gosh, it looks bad if we expel folks. You're still fighting yesterday's fights. Number one, nobody's going to remember this after tomorrow. Number two, the greatest trick they ever pulled on the left was getting Republicans to believe that the exercise of their legislative power is abusive. What they did yesterday was a standard use of legislative power and the power to do it. And they exercise it when the Democrats usurped their power and charged people with crimes that don't exist like they did to Trump. The media doesn't care. When the Republicans actually execute legislative responsibilities, it's abusive power and dumbass swamp Republicans play into it. Oh my gosh, it looks bad done with the look bad. There are new rules out there. You got it? Get the hell into the fight here. There's police's political trench warfare. If you're not ready for it, take your toys and get the guy to hear because we don't need you. This video was sent to me yesterday. I hadn't seen this before. It's about five plus years old. Videos of Camille Paulia. She is a card carrying liberal feminist. She is she's not even remotely a conservative. However, one thing she is and has been is in many respects, someone not afraid to speak the truth even to her own political ideology when she thinks there's a breakdown. I rarely use three cuts from a video, especially if they're a minute, minute 30. Usually you can sum it up in one or two. I have three cuts from this because you need to see it. This is Camille Paulia. Again, a leftist can't say that enough. Breaking down this recent surge in trans radicalism. Keep in mind, it's five years ago. It's yet applies right now. And talking about the existential threat it exposes. She also makes a very bold claim. This is a must listen here that when you look at the history of societies, I'm a student of history. I'm not a historian. I don't pretend to be. I don't pretend to know what people who studied this for six and seven years between college and graduate school do. However, I enjoy history a lot. Why? Because as I said, often it may not repeat itself, but it certainly rhymes. You can learn lessons from great men of the past and you can even learn more lessons from failed men of the past. We repeat our mistakes over and over. She makes a bold claim that this trans ideology and the demasculinization of men is the sign of the end of times. Let's get to this part first. Here's the first clip from this, where she talks about this trans radicalism and how there's a huge cultural peer pressure component to this, which seems likely given the recent explosion out of nowhere of men who think they're women, boys who think they're girls and vice versa. It makes zero sense at all. Take a listen. Sex change operation opens one door but closes many others. I personally believe that anyone who who collaborates in an intrusion into a developing child's body and mind is guilty of child abuse, a crime against humanity because that child is not prepared to make such a decision. I think that such decisions about sex reassignment surgery must wait one attains a majority, which would be, it seems, a minimum of age 18. I'm very concerned with this with, I think that it's become a fashion. Okay. That the transgender definition has become a kind of convenient label for young people who may simply feel alienated, okay, culturally for many other reasons. The alienation portion of that is so critical, folks. I did a segment on the radio show on the podcast yesterday. If you missed it, please go back and watch it. It was all over Twitter, not pumping sunshine up my own caboose here. I'm just telling you, we follow what happens on Twitter to see what you guys like and what you don't. We got a near viral response from it yesterday. I explained to you trans ideology in the role of, in the role it plays in communism and socialists. The role it plays is alienation. Telling a group of kids who are clearly confused and feel alienated and alone, which is a real problem. You've, Joe, you're a little older than me. You grew up with kids. Everybody had that kid in their grammar school in high school. Did they not? Yes. You had the punk rockers. You had the kids who were the loners. You had the kids who's, why are they shooting up schools right now? And then why are some of these kids saying, oh, I'm not a boy. I'm a girl, or I'm not a girl. I'm a boy. Because folks, we haven't changed, human beings. The culture around people has changed. And what the left wanted to do is present the vehicle to them. Oh, you're confused. Joe, what do these kids have in common? They're confused. They're looking for meaning. Some of them find it in music. Thank you, brother. I'm sorry. I was struggling for the word perfect. They're misunderstood. Yes, perfect. I guess it's what I dumbass. Why I was just sitting right in the tip of my tongue. That's exactly what I was thinking. They're misunderstood. They feel like the world doesn't get them. So they hold up. I'm not trying to get all sigmund Freud on you. Although psychology's my background. It doesn't matter. It's common sense. They feel like nobody gets them. They even feel like their parents don't get them. That wedge works for communists. If you don't have the kids, you don't have the communists. They don't want them to find meaning in things that matter. They don't want them to be understood by religious leaders, by community, by faith groups, by their parents. They want them to be understood by the state. That's where the trans ideology fits in. It creates and furthers the sense of alienation. Nobody understands who you are. But your union teacher, who's awarded the state, they get it. Oh, by the way, they have the pride flag in their classroom. Come to us. Don't tell your parents, by the way. This. Listen to me, folks. This is not by accident. This popped up out of nowhere. This trans ideology, because everything else is failing. CRT environmental radicalism. They need a new outlet, and this is it. She's describing a risk of liberal telling you, oh, this sense of alienation. It's a cultural thing. I got two more clips from this, both of them extremely important. She doubles down in this point about alienation being the point. Let me get to this first. I appreciate your patience. Sponsors are here to talk to you. Folks, it's hard to trust anyone or anything these days. A lot of our essential institutions are collapsing before our eyes. Are you prepared for the worst? Because you know what's going to happen, and it's going to happen soon. Don't get caught unprepared. True freedom comes from self reliance.

It's Camille Pallea for the 10th time, a leftist feminist explaining the dangers of this trans ideology and the alienation it creates. Take a listen to this. In the 1950s, they might have become a beatnik. In the 1960s, they might have become a hippie and taken mind expanding drugs. Today, your courage to think that your alienation is because you're not totally identifying with your particular inheritance and gender definition. I'm very concerned about this. I think that a lot of it, I think that the collaboration of the bureaucratic machinery with it has to do with the assault and masculinity. Gender doesn't really exist. It's not really polarity. Everything's all about expanding women's but also terminating men, okay, and defining men out of existence. And masculinity is by definition toxic. Messyling doesn't exist. You see, this is the proof of that. I'm horrified in a shame that I've not brought this clip to you sooner. It's my fault. I mean it. I'm not being silly. It's my fault. My job, my only job is to get you the best material out there for you all to see it and expose it. The Yuri Besmanoff video, Thomas Sowell videos that I haven't seen this before. I'm ashamed. This is a leftist who was around these people all the time and nobody understands them better. Just look up her bonafides. And she's telling you that not just as the trans ideology fit with this socialist ethos because it creates alienation, but it also works to attack masculinity in and of itself. I might get to think something through. Think this through hard. What is the biggest Loretta to the totalitarian state on a force equation if they were to use force and brutally try to suppress a population using fascist totalitarian tactics? What is it? Strong men who will fight back. Totalitarian festers in a pool of weakness and weak men. Do you think the war on masculinity and the war on boys is a freaking accident? There is nothing the socialist loves more than a population obsessed with weak non masculine men not willing to defend their country, their families and their kids. There is nothing they crave more. This is not an accident. That's why she mentions this at the end. I'm extrapolating for my, I don't want to put words in her mouth. I'm extrapolating that at the other ideas. She may or may not disagree with it. Let me just be clear on that. But I'm telling you what she's saying here is absolutely correct. Here's the most important part. Pay very close attention bookmark this. This clip spread it around. Put this in the clips today. The third part's the most important. She describes, she is a student of history. She describes the collapse of great societies. Greece, the Roman Empire and how towards the end you look at the statues which Joe had celebrated vibrant robust masculinity. And now even the statues in the art change and you see the feminization of men and then you see nothing because it collapses. Listen to everywhere. Historically, the movement toward Androgyny occurs in late phases of culture. As a civilization is starting to unravel. You can find it again and again through history in the Greek art. You can see it happening. All of a sudden, there's a kind of, the sculptures of handsome, nude young men athletes that used to be very robust. In the archaic period, suddenly began to seem like wet noodles toward the end. And that the people who live in such periods, a late phase of culture, whether it's the Hellenistic era, whether it's the Roman Empire, whether it's the move decade of Oscar Wilde in the 1890s, whether it's the Weimar Germany, people who live such times, feel that they're very sophisticated, they're very cosmopolitan. Homosexuality, heterosexuality, so what anything goes and so on. From the perspective of historical distance, you can see that it's a culture that no longer believes in itself. Folks, past is prologue. Do we really believe that this specific generation of homo sapiens, sapiens, human beings? Do we really believe we've been blessed with some special X-Men like Marvel comic book superheroes? Because I've got news for you folks. Our gene code has changed very little. We are the exact same people. Now, with the chronological passing of time, civilization itself, collective intelligence, if that is a thing, or access to it is, as grown through the library of information as the passage of time has allowed human beings to hopefully learn. We're not learning. We are repeating the same freaking mistakes over and over and over again. Police state tyranny with the attack on Donald Trump this past weekend. The demasculinization of strong men. She brings up a critical point though that should make you smile a little bit at the end. Did you catch it? She talks about how this creates a rebound effect. And I remind you of the hopped quote from the other day. Strong men create good times. Good times create weak men. Weak men create bad times or hard times. Those hard times and create strong men again. Folks, the hyper-feminization of men and the demasculinization of men and the attack and the war on boys is breeding a counterculture revolution of people who are respecting the gender binary and getting back to traditional values. You are going to see a rebound effect where people are going to start to respect again a strong military. A constitutional police force that enforces the law. Why are you long in the United States? Because I'm not stupid. You have a liberal telling you this that listen, this stuff is dangerous because in the past at least it's it's breeded groups of people who became hyper-masculin. I don't think that's going to be the result here. I think it's going to be a return to strong men who are getting sick of the weak corrupted hard times, weak men created. I am sure of it. That's why I'm long in the United States. What are guys in the live chat? Wanted to know if we were going to address the war on the US dollar. Folks, it's a critical story. I'm only bringing that up because we did a little bit the other day, but I'm back on my Fox show tomorrow night, 9 p.m. Eastern time. That is my monologue. I'm going to lay out how the biggest story you're not hearing about right now is the near coordinated international strike on our economy in the war in the US. Please don't miss it. Set your DVR if you can't make it live. All right, let me get to my next sponsor and I want to get to a just horrible story out of Miami showing you the power again of this hack goon media, the power they have to get people to believe things that are absolute total bull totally made up.

The liberals are part of a show too. They live in the world of K-Fabe, where everything is done with the belief that it's real violence being, you know, on other people. They live in a fake world. Now, if you're a reader of the Miami Herald before they change this headline, you're like, Oh my gosh, Ron DeSantis is a tie. Did you hear this? Joe King DeSantis arrested a formal whistleblower against some kid, a 13 year old? What a savage. Get that to say. Oh my gosh, DeSantis, he's like the emperor from by the way. Is it, did you see this thing? He's a new Star Wars coming out. Is a new Star Wars movie coming out? They're not. Did you see this? He's like a big Star Wars nut. No, no, I said a show that the woman's back. Daisy Ridley or something like that. That's it is. I said that that was movies suck. They were so terrible. He loves me. He thinks they're great. Those movies were horrible. Some of the worst movies. I'm ashamed. I was a Star Wars fan growing up embarrassing what they did to that franchise. Horrible. But you read this. You think he's the emperor from start with DeSantis. Oh my gosh, had a 13 year old arrested. You would think Joe DeSantis personally knocked on this woman's door. The woman's Rebecca Jones. She's a fake whistleblower. I don't know if you guys remember her. She claimed to have some evidence that data was being manipulated on COVID turned out to be one big hoax that was eviscerated. And she was humiliated. So because the media and the Miami help Miami Herald was isn't I mean an embarrassment. The Miami Herald makes the New York Times the conservative. It's a joke of a newspaper. Everybody down here laughs at it. But whatever, they still, for some reason, liberals love being lied to. They don't care about the kids. This is absolutely evil. What if I told you what really happened here? And these are all allegations again, everybody's innocent of proving guilty. And I'm always hesitant to report on these stories, especially when they involve young kids who are confused and do a lot of dumb things and are misunderstood. But if you hear this, you believe a bunch of nonsense. Here's Rebecca Jones tweeting, no matter if I just to add to the story that her family's not safe, Joe. That her son's been taken on the governor's orders. The governor's orders. I've had to send my husband and daughter out of the state for their safety. Oh my gosh, Rebecca, I'm really starting to feel her. This is the reality of living in DeSantis, Florida. There's no freedom here. Only retaliatory rule by a fascist who wishes to be king. Keep in mind, dumb ass stupid liberals spread this thing around and they're like, we got DeSantis now. DeSantis sent his shock troops to go, they'll get him. That's weird. Because if you look at this video here, check it out. If you listen on audio, please watch us rumble.com slash Bongino. You'll see in the video that that's Rebecca Jones turning the sun in. Where's the sand? You see the sand this game? Sorry, man. Joe, you've cut this. Is the sand this in there? He played again? He was a no show, man. He's he was a no show. Oh, wait, why would he be a no show? It's his own. He ordered this kid, the 13 year old put into the gula. I mean, why wouldn't he want to be there? No, look, I'm looking you in the eye. And when you want like a mob moment, like I did this to you. So weird how DeSantis wasn't there. And the mom actually turned the kid in and no one went and got him. Oh, here's a way, wait, there's a, oh, the news story's a little different than Rebecca Jones said. Rebecca Jones, son arrested in Florida after allegedly threatening to shoot up school and stab student. Oh, oh, oh, so the story's a little different. Joe, a little bit. It just a little different. Just so it turns out investigators interviewed multiple students who spoke with the team. And they saw messages he posted on social media. Yeah. In the messages to his friends, the team made the following statements among others. I want to shoot up the school. If I get a gun, I'm going to shoot up H N M S middle school L O L. I'm getting a wrath and natural selection shirt. So maybe I don't think many people know what the Columbine shooters look like. He says, okay, it's been like three or four weeks since I got on my new antidepressants. And they aren't working, but they're supposed to by now. So I have no hope in getting better. So why not kill the losers at school? The teenager they note in the Pensacola news journal, which shockingly told the real story. The teenager told one of the friends that he planned to shoot up the school the Thursday before spring break. But there were too many things going on. So he postponed it until March 31st. Folks, everyone's innocent to approve and guilty. I'm not a leftist fraud. However, wait, he hate to do is he go back to the Miami Herald headline? I know we're live. It's more of a pain in the ass. But go back to the extension. Now read this headline again. 13 year old son of Rebecca Jones, whistleblower, she's not who class with the sand is arrested over memes. Now, now you're confusing and why your liberal neighbors are so freaking stupid all the time. Because they read idiots like these two reporters, Carol Marbin Miller and Sarah Blasky, who actually had the nuts to put their name on a stupid byline. It's since been changed. Unbelievable. By the way, the Biden team's doubling down on their aggressive trans agenda. This story was painted as some kind of like fake victory, by the way, this free beacon story. Oh, the Biden administration saying now, oh, look, they're not forcing every student to engage in these, you know, trans rules where men get to play on women's teams and otherwise. That's nonsense. The Biden administration avails new rules requiring inclusion of transgender athletes. They're doubling down on this. They're only giving limited exceptions to this. They're doubling down on all this craziness. And as you see, I didn't have this one, the show so busy today. You see Riley Gaines, the female swimmer who's been speaking out against men competing against her. She's a female. She went to what was it? A university out in California. And she was brutally attacked by a bunch of trans activists. Listen to me very seriously here right now. Keep your head on a swivel around these deranged, crazy, violent leftists. I will condemn and I will continue to condemn any violence that breaks out on our side and any other side of the political space. It is not a means to an end. It is a means to destruction. But I'm telling you, the left, the difference is we abhor violence and hate it. Any good conservative respects the civil liberties of others. The left worship citizen tool, keep your head on a swivel around these people. They are crazy. Let me get to my last sponsor. And then I want to show you the citizens of Chicago.

To the citizens of Chicago, don't need to relitigate it. I told you yesterday and day before I lived through it in New York City, Giuliani ran for office on an anti crime agenda. 1900 people were murdered in New York City, what in 10 years? No, in one 1989 Giuliani lost. Why did he lose? Because it wasn't bad enough yet. Four more years of nearly 2000 people killed a year. And it got bad enough. And Giuliani won and cleaned it up. I've lived through this before, folks. I said to you before with the Camille pyathing history may not repeat itself, but it damn well certainly rhymes. And the citizens of Chicago, you're in for a bloodbath. Your new mayor elect right here is asked the question about policing. What he's going to do about policing and crime. Listen to this, this nonsense word salad of garbage and social justice crap. You are in for a bloodbath in Chicago. And I feel really bad for you. Take a listen. Let's talk about your plans and of course crime being the biggest issue perhaps in most major cities, but front and foremost in Chicago. Why is crime so bad? Well, first of all, unfortunately for too long, the people of Chicago and quite frankly, people all over the country have been given a false, a false choice on how we actually deal with public safety. What our campaign proved is that you can actually demonstrate in a real way how critical investments are the necessary dynamics in order to prevent crime. Holy Moses, Joe, I get so tired. He's like, can they just speak plainly? Can you just speak plainly? We're gonna make critical of that. That doesn't mean anything. What he's trying to tell you is we're going to pull money away from the police department and he has a good chance a lot of you are going to get mugged, raped, murdered or killed. That's really it. That's really it. Now I'm going to play something for him and talk over it. Forgive me for the audio only, folks, but this is really horrible and it's tough to watch. I didn't want to play the whole thing because it's really, really difficult to watch even for a kind of hardened soul like me who's seen a lot of this from the police perspective watching people die. This is Cash App founder Bob Lee who was stabbed to death in San Francisco, a closed-circuit television camera. He plays the last seconds of his life as he's bleeding out, begging people for help. Folks, to the citizens of Chicago, we're on one of the biggest radio stations over there. It doesn't matter if we are our aren'ts, but I have a special attachment to them from talking to them every day from 12 to 3 in the radio. Get a lot of calls from there, a lot of emails from there. I really feel for you, especially the large number of people that either didn't vote or didn't vote for Brandon Johnson because you didn't support this and the bloodbath is coming your way. Folks, listen. Sadly, remember the date. Remember the name. Remember the time. Criminals are celebrating today. You are in for an absolute bloodbath in Chicago. There are going to be hundreds of people who will die as a result of selections made in a political voting booth. I really feel for you. I got a lot more to get to questions, a couple other things to. Just quickly, this was John Kirby yesterday, White House spokesperson again, losing all of his dignity, claiming that sensitive thing for Joe here too, but claiming that none, he didn't see any of the chaos as we just pulled our people out of Afghanistan on a whim and got 13 of our heroes killed in the military after a bombing. Take a listen to this. Get planes coming in and getting them loaded, have medical screening, have security vetting, have diplomatic presence on the ground to make sure that we're putting the right people on planes, but also defend that airport from external threats. That's pretty remarkable. And so for all this talk of chaos, I just didn't see it, not from my perch. I miss this stuff. Yeah, I made I know for you this is an extra annoying, I mean, I might be annoying, maybe the worst word for that. But I saw my business to talk about that. I'll leave that out, but you can probably put two and two together. It's what happens when you put people who have forfeited their souls away to evil inside the White House. He didn't have to say that, folks. You know, John Kirby, a lot of people I know said they used to respect him. You didn't have to say that. He could have just said, listen, there were a lot of problems, no doubt, you're not wrong. And we're going to look into it. And the report that came out was just an embarrassing joke. They blame Donald Trump. But it happened under Biden. I know folks, that's why I might even go into it. It's a total waste of your time. It's nothing but Biden bull. So it's not even it's not even worth your time. It really isn't. All right, we're going to do something a little different today. We're going to do the questions before the end of the show, we just got a few this week, because I want to it's good Friday. And I just want to address something with you because and it may be a little tough to hear. But listen, anyway, good Friday, we can celebrate the resurrection of Christ on Sunday, but good Friday is a solemn day. And it's worth addressing. But let's do questions for Dan. Look, actually, it is. How did Alvin Bragg get the nickname Twinkies at Steven Snyder? You know, Alvin Bragg obviously has a folks system. It's going to sound horrible, but I have a really difficult time respecting people who don't respect themselves. Well, look, a promo from my show. I was a little heavier back then. Maybe right now. And I just don't. The guy clearly doesn't respect himself. And the first thing I thought of my daughter the day before was buying some desserts for school. And we were walking down to grocery house, you pick something out. And I said, you ever tried Twinkies? And she's like, oh, that's disgusting. So that's what I was doing. That was in my head when first time we started talking about Alvin Bragg. So there you go. Steven, there's the story. Hey, Dan, my parents are libs. I tried to explain to them what's going wrong and how it's screwing us over. Basically, I love my parents who they are, but it makes it hard to be around them when politics come into play got the advice at Carney, KMO three. I do, folks, your principles matter. And I'm sorry, but I'm not sacrificing my principles for anyone, not my wife, not my kids, not anyone else. I received a text yesterday from a woman who shall remain nameless. She's a friend. We know her from a business we're involved in. And she said, I can't believe it. My daughter goes to the University of Alabama, a place relatively conservative in the college ecosystem at least. And she came back from college, a radical pro abortion advocate. She's like, I don't know what this show won't even talk to me. Well, a lot of pain, folks. There's a lot of pain in that. But there are universal principles that you should really, really stick to no matter what. And even if your family doesn't buy into it, love them, love them for, you know, love them with everything you got. Don't sacrifice your principles for anything. At Jock's Gal, I know you don't comment a lot on international stuff. Tons have been going on to distract us, but it seems the inclusion of Finland, to NATO is a rather big deal. What say you? It's a huge deal because they share a massive land border with Russia. Why does that matter? Because God forbid, please God forbid, you know, I don't use his name in vain. There is an outbreak of World War three. China invades Taiwan, a nuclear weapon gets detonated. We now have a trained professional army on the Russian border right there. That's a huge threat. Think about that. I mean, why is that a threat? Imagine Russia in like a new Warsaw Pact, having Mexico and Canada as a part of it. Kind of a problem, right? Sometimes it's better when you flip the script at Mary Ann. Hey, Dan, can you explain more about EMPs? How it affects us? Blessed Easter to you and the family, likewise. An electromagnetic pulse detonation is an upper atmosphere detonation of an electromagnetic pulse, usually a nuclear weapon, which should admit it. The resulting pulse, electromagnetic pulse, will wipe out anything with a circuit, whether it's on or not. If you don't have it protected with the proper Faraday cage and elements to absorb the surge, EMP protection in your home, I've got news for you. You're finished. Nothing you turn on will work, not your car, not your computer, not your phone, nothing. It'll all be effectively fried. That's why I keep telling everyone, get EMP protection for your house and make sure you have a generator. Make sure you have a generator, make sure you have the ability. Yeah, make sure you have some of your stuff protected. This is important. And we should be pushing our local officials to harden the grid too. It's a lot of money, but it's worth it. At Telfer, Telfer, it's Telfer may have the record for questions. Many shows you say something about the talking points going out for the libs. Where do they get these talking points? The White House big tech, the media chiefs, or maybe all the above? A good question. Political playbook, big tech, things that circulate on Twitter. They just, I don't know. They just kind of, I don't know. I shouldn't say I do know. They just kind of know where to go. They follow the blue check marks who instinct by instinct. I might say blue check marks. I mean, the media people know the narrative they're supposed to put out there. In other words, it didn't, here's a perfect, you should put meat on the bone. When the alleged trans serial killer wiped out those six lives and there's three nine year olds, right? The media didn't have to go to the White House to be coached on what to say. Does that make sense? The game, I explained this right. They knew right away that, oh, it's a white person. Oh, good, good, good. We've got a narrative. Racial violence, crazed white supremacy. And then when it came out, oh, it's actually a woman. And she's trans. All of a sudden, it's like hit the brakes. Now we got to frame a different gun control, gun control, right to gun control. They just know because they've done it a lot. They just know and then people pick up on it, Twitter and spread it around. Exactly. He said it right. They live in their own bubble. They live in so it's all they see is each other stuff like the Miami Herald article. There are people today who are going to tell you, Rhonda Sant, they showed up at a 13 year old house, 13 year old's house, whose mother was a whistleblower and who locked them up. In fact, none of that actually happened is totally irrelevant. It's the hive mind, man. It's the board. So it is good Friday. And I listen, I don't eat. This is it's almost I'm really hesitant to even mention it this way. But I was doing some stretching of maybe three weeks ago in the gym. You know, my arm that thank you, Dr. Flores, by the way, saw him yesterday and now arms going great. But I was trying to stretch out my own what I was doing is I was hanging from a pull up bar, but the pull up bar was low. So my toes like tippy toes kind of were on the ground. So I was kind of arked forward because I don't think about I'm holding on and I might so I'm pushed forward. So the thing about when you're pushed forward, extended forward in an arc this way, like chest out and lungs out is your diaphragm gets stretched and you can't breathe out. And it was weird because I had only done it for about 10 seconds. I'm like, gosh, this really hurts. Not because my arm hurt, but because I couldn't expel any air because my diaphragm was being constrained. It feels like you're suffocating because you are. And I thought back to high school, one of my religion classes in Archbishop Malloy, when the instructor in the class, it was a very faith filled religious guy and a good man. He said, I just want you to understand that Jesus chose crucifixion for a couple of reasons. Number one, it was probably the most painful way to die. There may be as painful, but there's not more. I'll get to that in a second. But second, it was humiliation. The only people crucified, as I said in the beginning of the show, were people who were considered at the lower rungs of society. The worst kind of criminals, people guilty of treason against the crown, whatever it may be, they were crucified publicly to humiliate. Look, look at them. That's why they were put up on the hell on that cross elevator. Look at those losers right there. So it's so heroic that Christians afterwards who chose to follow Jesus, that they would show the cross a symbol of humiliation in the past. They would show the cross as their symbol of dedication to their new faith. I have one tattooed on me. I don't know if you've ever seen that or not, but to remind myself, it's old. It's kind of when I was young, but that's the one I don't regret. Even how it's old and used to be black and now it's losing all its color. But that cross, that cross, we'd show it to each other. But folks, it is probably the most painful way to die. I want you to read this article, if you can today. It's short. It's by Kaylene Schreier, she's a PhD. The science of crucifixion. I want you to listen what happens when you're crucified. If you have it in you, you don't understand. It says the difficulty surrounding exhaling leads to a slow form of suffocation. Carbon dioxide builds up in the blood, resulting in a high level of carbonic acid. The body responds instinctively, triggering the desire to breathe. At the same time, the heart beats faster to circulate available oxygen. The decreased oxygen due to the difficulty of exhaling because you're arced forward on the cross. You're pushed forward as you're hanging forward, causes damage to the tissues and capillaries begin leaking watery fluid from the blood into the tissue. The result is a buildup of fluid around the heart and lungs. The collapsing lungs failing heart dehydration and inability to get sufficient oxygen to the tissues essentially suffocates the victim. The decreased oxygen damages the heart itself, which leads to cardiac arrest. In severe cases of cardiac stress, the heart can even burst, a process known as cardiac rupture. Jesus most likely died of a heart attack. Now, folks, he didn't die quickly. And what happens is as you try to, you're suffocated at your legs, you will straighten your legs to try to breathe and you'll get a second maybe of breath in, which is the worst thing. That's why they used to break their legs. They break their legs so they couldn't push up off the cross where their feet were nailed in. So they would suffocate like that. But this is the most fascinating part. In order to speak, I must pass over the vocal cords during exhalation. The gospels note that Jesus spoke seven times from the cross. It's amazing that despite his pain, he pushes up with his legs to say, forgive them. Have a happy Easter, folks. I'll see you back here on Monday. Good day, sir. You just heard Dan Bongino."
