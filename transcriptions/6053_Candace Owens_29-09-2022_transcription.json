    "text": " All right, guys, another question of the day, and the question today is, are you holy with a W? That's an important question because World War III is upon us, except this time, it's psychological. Plus, later on, we have Dylan Mulvaney, who haven't heard of him. He's a man who began publicly identifying as a female just 191 days ago. And despite that, he's been invited to speak at the 2022 Forbes Power Women's Summit. And Cardi B has released a new song recently, and I'm going to read you some of the lyrics, so apologies in advance. All that and more today on Candace Owens. All right, guys, I want to take a moment to talk to you about good ranchers.

It is all fresh caught and then flash frozen and vacuum sealed to lock in the freshness until you're ready to eat it. So get yours today by going to goodwantchers.com slash Candace and use code Canis at checkout. You'll get $30 off your first order of American meat delivered plus free shipping. That's goodwantchers.com slash Candace and use code Canis at checkout. All right, so I asked you guys, are you holy with a W? I'm talking are you a wholesome person? And the reason I'm asking that question is because I was on this walk with my husband. We like to do these weekly walks, so we just sort of unpack our entire weeks. And we discussed what we're working on at the office and I talked to him about what I covered on the podcast. And I was really struck if you listened to episode 10, we talked about the mental illnesses that social media is creating. And they know that they're creating these social media issues. And because I was so struck, I told my husband about it and he came back to me and told me about an economist whose name is Lou Gavcal. His name is Lou Gavcal and he had written early on about COVID being the first social media contagion. So I'm talking basically, despite the fact that the illness has a virtual 100% survival rate with 97 98% of people who get COVID will survive. It didn't matter, right? We talked about this yesterday. People were masking six feet apart. People were angry to see people, other people breathing freely would see a child and go, you need to mask this child if they're over two years old, completely arbitrary, but somehow people were invested in this. And that is because what Lou Gavcal speculates, a social media contagion. And I offer back that we have seen these sorts of contagions before. George Floyd was a social media global contagion. Every single person in the entire world knew nothing about the facts surrounding the case. They saw just a video and yet they felt that they had to make a statement, get involved, maybe post a black square on Instagram to prove that they weren't racist, because obviously if you post a black square on Instagram, that means that you're not a racist. It's 2022, get with it or whatever. And yes, that seems to be a psychological contagion and that happens because of what people are describing as a psychological immune system becoming infested, so much is coming at you that it begins to depress your psychological immune system. That at least is what was speculated in the article last week in which we covered, again, episode 10, if you have not listened to it, go back and listen to episode 10. But we covered the article written in the New York Post by a doctor entitled, How Social Media is Literally Making Teens Mentally Ill. And why I love this article and a portion of it, which we didn't read in last week's episode, is that it describes digital toxins. So it's correlating our social media use to drinking. You keep drinking and alcohol just keeps consuming and keeps consuming, even though they know that it's bad for them, it's bad for their biological health. They can't stop because they become addicted. Well, imagine the world that we live in today, people are addicted to social media. They know it's not good for their mental health, but they can't stop consuming all of these digital toxins. The article says, quote, the weaker and more compromised our psychological immune system becomes, as we consume these digital toxins, making us even more vulnerable for further consumption, manipulation, and behavior modification. It also goes through these three steps that take place, that big tech is using to create these addicts. The first step is to create habituation, use the most sophisticated algorithm-fueled behavior, mod techniques to create dependencies, so that's making sure that you are going back to social media. In fact, that is part of the reason, by the way, you'll notice on social media apps that you pull down, right? You have to swipe down and then it loads up more content for you, right? With your fingers, pull down and then more content is created for you. More frequent content is created for you, the most recent content, rather, is being created for you. That behavior is meant to mimic slot machines. I read that in a different article that they thought about that and people are addicted to gambling and they keep pulling down the slot machines, and that's what they want you to do, that you want more and more. The second step that they have highlighted in this article, it says, once addicted, the person's psychological immune system begins to erode. As in any addiction, this is the realm of depression, hopelessness, and a sense of emptiness, an emptiness that can only be temporarily filled by more of a toxin, right? So you just keep pulling down, okay, I need more and more and more social media, and you're on the inside, it's not feeling good, but you feel that you can temporarily patch that emptiness by getting more content. Step three, once weakened and addicted, a person is now susceptible to any number of manipulations. These include further addiction, ideological brainwashing, identity shaping, and sadly, an encroachment into the once hallowed ground of our thoughts, free no more. So as me and my husband were discussing this article and the implications therein, I began thinking back to another thing that we covered on a past episode, which were these assistants that I was going through one year, and I was very shocked to see that their behavior, these younger kids that are coming up in this generation, they almost believe that they are these luxurious individuals. I almost call it Kardashian syndrome, right? They need to live in swanky apartments, despite the fact that they're in debt, they've got student loans, but they need to make sure they're living in the swankiest apartments in the city, and that they're posting pictures of their lifestyles. You know what I'm talking about, these people that put a wine glass, they're cheering to show that, look at my glamorous lifestyle that I have, even though we know that these individuals don't actually have much money, they're actually just pretending to have it for social media likes, right? And I thought about that former assistant that I detailed to you in an earlier episode that wound up stealing from me and my husband, and I thought about it in the retrospect because she was obsessed with Instagram. Not when we first hired her, she'd worked for us for a year, but then we started realizing that she was spending hours and hours and hours on Instagram. In fact, there was one particular flight that I remember where I was getting a bunch of work done, I was answering emails, and that entire flight, three and a half hours, she was on Instagram. And I actually, I turned her and I said, have you brought an Instagram this entire time? And she was like, yeah, you know, and I just in my head thought, that's really weird. How could you be on a social media app like Instagram for three and a half hours straight? I didn't realize that she had developed a dependency on Instagram, dependency on social media. And it was corroding her from the inside out quite literally, she was consuming these digital toxins. And where did that lead her life? Well, she became more and more extreme in her behavior. I detailed to you earlier how despite the fact that she had been put in London in a very nice hotel, she told us that she was leaving that hotel to go stay in an even more glamorous hotel, even though she was in debt, she was actually in debt. She had credit card debt. And she would speak about how stressed she was about that debt. And yet she upgraded herself to a nice five star fancy hotel in London. Of course, as I told you guys, months later, we would find out that in fact, we had paid personally for that, that she was stealing from us. And one of the ways that she stole from us was to put herself into that hotel room right under our noses. And what did she do when she was in that hotel room? She posted a photo of her sitting in a bathtub in this glamorous hotel room. I'm laughing, but I shouldn't be laughing because it actually makes me feel sad for her. That because I didn't know what she was going through. I didn't realize that this was the suffering. She had been completely invaded by social media. She was weakened. And what did she begin to do as this article stipulates? She began to emulate the behavior of others. So she's consuming Kardashian content. She's consuming glamorous lifestyles. Maybe she's consuming the real housewives of Beverly Hills. All of this being thrown at her and a piece of her wanted to become those individuals. The article talks about how they're seeing all of these pseudo conditions. People that are pseudo-transgendered, people that are suffering from pseudo-bipolar disorder, from pseudo-depression. Because what's really happening is they just want to find a community online. They're looking to be loved, they're going online and they're saying, okay, these people are living glamorous. So I'm going to pretend that I have it like that, even though I actually don't. What's actually happening is I'm emulating their behavior. And the antidote to that, as this article describes in the psychologist that participated in this article describes, is something as simple as shutting off your social media accounts and engaging in the real world. Again, not something that people are capable of because they are so addicted to it. So I started asking my husband, I said, why are some people not susceptible to that? Why is it that I don't suffer from this? I never feel that I need to sit in a room and be on social media for three and a half hours. I don't feel addicted. I feel almost immune. I've developed a very strong psychological immune system. What is the difference? And we sort of came up with some ideas of how you can protect yourself and you can protect the people that you love from being attacked from this digital toxins, these digital toxins that we're talking about. I think the first thing is to ask yourself or to ask somebody else whether or not they are, number one, if they're wholly enough in this world before they take on the online world, that's a precursor to social media. Are you actually a full person, right? Because if you're not a full person, if you're not a whole individual and you engage in the digital world, it's going to consume you. It is going to make you think that you should be aspiring to something when in fact you're not even doing anything. You're actually sitting idle and looking at other people that are having success in their life. You're not doing anything in your real life. So the first thing is to make sure that in your real world, you are a whole person and I extend this to children that are coming up in the social media world, right? Let them grow up. They don't need Instagram. They don't need TikTok. My children simply will not be allowed to have it. I cringe when I see young kids, nine years old, 10 years old, on TikTok, doing things for likes. These people don't even have these young children. Their brains are not even developed. How do you not expect that to impact them down the line? The second thing, and it's a really important thing, and this came from my husband, is to tap in and to ask yourself what you are building your treasure toward, right? What are you building your treasure toward? And I'll explain what I mean by that. How are you engaging in the online world? Who do you follow when you're on Instagram? Why are you following them? Take a second and say, why am I following this individual? Are they adding value? Is there any benefits to why I'm following them? And when we have this conversation, I went and I looked at my accounts because I follow very few people and sometimes people get angry at me. Can I just, why don't you follow your fans or follow back and do these things? And actually, the people that I like to follow are people that I feel contribute value to my life, right? I like to follow farm accounts. You guys know that I'm into learning how to farm my backyard. I like to follow aesthetic accounts. I'm very into home design. It's a passion of my state. It's a hobby of mine, really, because it's not a job that I have. But I like to follow things that are aesthetic and things that are beautiful and things that feel whole. I've never in my entire life online, if you will, have I ever followed the Kardashians or follow people that are just pretending that their lifestyles are normal because it's not what I aspire to. I like following people that have families. I love when people post their holiday cards and people that are posting a more wholesome lifestyle. And then I actually do this thing where I follow people that I know, right? People that are in my life, I'm interested to keep up with their lifestyles. I'm not following things that feel unattainable. And I think that that's important for people. Think about that. What are you building treasure toward? You might be following a Fox News account. Good. You want to actually know what's going on the world. That's a good thing. But are you following people that are just in your mind, making you think that you don't have enough? Is that a good thing for your psychology? Is that a good thing for your psychological immune system? Are you going to look back in your life on your deathbed and you're going to think that any of that stuff actually mattered? It's a good thing to think about when you engage in the online world. And the last thing that I want to say that I think is really important and is something that I do and I always pause to make sure I do it is to make sure that you're not creating an avatar of yourself, meaning that you say things that you don't mean online. Avoid hyperbole is what I mean to say. Don't say these extreme things that you know you don't mean. Like for example, a lot of people say when somebody goes online and talks about a crisis happening, they're like they say, praying for you, prayer hands, praying for you. Are you actually praying for them? I had that moment when I was texting a girlfriend of mine last week. They are losing her father-in-law. He's dying and I said, I texted her and I said, what we're praying for you guys. And the second I sent that text, I said, I should not just write that. I need to go do that. And I paused and I actually set a prayer for them. It's important to say what you mean to realize that the person that you are in the online world is going to impact the person that you are in the real world. And that's all I have to say about that. Okay, before we continue, I want to take a quick pause to talk to you about the app Hello. You all know that my faith is super important to me. My relationship with God is how I find my strength and peace in this crazy world. But with all of the insane anti-religious ideologies that are being pushed by the left on a daily basis, it can be hard to tune out the noise. Remember what we know is good and true. Which is why I love Hello. Hello is a number one Christian prayer app in the United States and the number one Catholic app in the world. It's rooted in the Catholic tradition, but an amazing resource for any Christian looking to dive deeper into their prayer life. This is perfect for my family because as most of you know, I am in a mixed faith household. My husband is devout Catholic and I am Protestant. Hello has prayers and meditations to guide you throughout your entire day. Morning tonight, some of the most popular prayers include the daily rosary gospel reading and daily psalm with Bishop Barron. Plus there are minute meditations, meditations for sleep and kids prayers and meditations. Hello helps me sleep better, lower my anxiety levels and find peace and calm throughout the day. And I think it will do the same for you. So try it for three months free at hallow.com slash Candace. That's hallow.com slash Candace. We claim your peace and download hallow today. Okay, now it's time for some topic visual. First up, we have this guy, as I mentioned in the opening his name is Dylan Mulvaney. It's a man who began publicly identifying as a female just 191 days ago. And despite this fact, he has recently been invited to speak at the 2022 Forbes Power Women's Summit. Now that is interesting that he has gathered an extensive social media following. He did this after he began documenting his creepy fetishized version of what it means to be a girl. And so I want you to take a listen to this video that he posted. Now, by the way, when you hear this, you're going to think it's satire. It seems like he's making a joke. But I guess he wasn't. Take a listen. Love him. Coconut water. Love it. Not mad. Just love it. Wind turbine. Love it. Meadows. Love him. I'm scared of getting Lyme disease. Love ya. Did you see that? Did you see that? This is driving him. Oh my God. Never again. Get me out of here. Love ya. So this sounds like it looks like satire, as I said. You would think that if you saw this video, this was a comedian trying to be funny mocking women, right? This idea that women just frolic in a field wearing heels and then go, ah, I'm scared of a dragonfly. It's so scary. Obviously, that's not what, that's not representative of what women are. But if you were a male comedian mocking women, you might be able to get a laugh. Well, no. Actually, apparently, this person is now going to be invited to speak at a power women summit because Forbes is taking this person seriously. And here's what's more bizarre. This person virtually had no followers and then suddenly was being heavily promoted by TikTok. There is this idea, you know, TikTok is a Chinese-owned app, owned app, Chinese is the China, the China part in. China is obviously a competitor of America and it seems like they are constantly promoting filth upon our youth. I think that TikTok is the most extreme app. When you talk about protecting your psychological immune system, you can hardly utter that phrase without thinking that children should not be on TikTok. It is absolute garbage. It is shortening our attention span. But beyond that, it is promoting filth like this, right? Now, why would the algorithms want you to be taking a look at this? Why would the algorithms provide steroids to an account like this? Obviously, because they want to promote debauchery, they want to make sure the American youth that are coming up think this is a good thing that they should aspire to. Look how many likes you'll get if you are acting like a freak, right? There's not even a woman that would be frolicking in heels wearing what looks to be a bikini, almost a bikini and then screaming about a dragonfly. It's stupid. It's an insult to intelligence and yet they made this person so big in such a short timeframe that this person's now being invited and awarded by Forbes, right? How aspirational is that? If you act like this, if you act like a total wimp, if you're bending your gender and you think this is cool, look what could happen to you. You can get sponsorships. You can get invited to Forbes. This is what the youth should be focusing on. Meanwhile, of course, we know that TikTok in China is being used to make sure their youth is smarter, right? They're getting math equations, science equations. They're not getting this. This, of course, would be banned in China. They recently announced, I think I covered this at the end of last year, that they were going to pull down any accounts that looked like this because they do not want their youth to be poisoned with this sort of ideology. But in America, it's totally fine because the media will reinforce this narrative and it is a good thing. It begs the question, who is controlling our media? Why would any media want their youth to be impacted by these sorts of ideas? I will leave that as a question for you to consider. Moving on in talking about psychological immune system, you, of course, have to take a look at the complete and utter corrosion of our culture. I often talk about Cardi B, the reason for that is because she is emblematic of exactly that. And I think about black culture in particular, but it's everywhere, right? But black culture, they seem to always want to emphasize, right? As soon as there is an artist that comes up in black America, they basically encourage that artist to lean into bad stereotypes, right? To lean into things that are harmful. So if you're a rapper, they want you to lean in to ghetto culture, right? They want you to be talking about gangs. If you're a singer, which we're going to get to a little bit later, Lizzo, they want you to lean into being fat, all of these things that obviously is just digital toxins for black America, right? What you put in on your ears, what you're listening to, these are all digital toxins. They're making you think that you should aspire toward this lifestyle because they will reward you. No, the majority of you, if you lived like this, you'll probably end up in either prison, dead if we're talking about being clinically obese. But no, it's okay. They're going to award a couple of people if we're living like this and encourage a bunch of other people to ruin their lives by aspiring to this. So Cardi B released a song recently with the artist, Glowrilla. I believe actually it's Glowrilla's song in which Cardi is featured on, which is called Tomorrow 2. And I'm just going to read you some of these lyrics because I think digital toxins should be spoken about. Just one portion, I don't speak dog ho wolf. I don't care what no bitch say. No, I stay on her mind. I got condos in that bitch head. She says she don't F with me who who said you can ho never that N word a munch and he gone eat me like a mango long as we it be tickling my ass crack. Okay. Okay. Followed by wonder what I'll do tomorrow that these hoes will be mad at. Oh, pick me Cardi. I can tell you what I will be mad at. And it's the fact that despite the fact that you made it out, which is commendable, that is a good thing that you started from a position where you had virtually nothing, you got an opportunity on Love and Hip Hop. And now you are in a place where you have some status despite all of those things rather than saying I'm going to use my position for good and I'm going to encourage people to do good. You think that you can only stay authentic to yourself by preaching poison. You know this is poison. You know that the majority of the girls that are listening to this are not ever going to make it out of the hood. You know that the majority of the young boys and the young girls that are listening to this are going to think that it's cool to have this sort of drama in their life and they're going to think it's cool to turn to the streets and they may be harmed. But you don't care about that because you I guess think that this is all you can be. It's not true. You can be more. You could definitely be more. I don't mind where you started. What I mind is that you are intentionally denying growth and you think that that keeps you real. It doesn't. It keeps you really stupid and it keeps people that are much smarter than you continually using you like a puppet to further poison the youth. In that same vein we should discuss Lizzo who had an opportunity. I don't know why they gave her this opportunity but they gave her the opportunity to play a 200 year old glass loot that was given to James Madison. So that is a historical relic obviously. They're giving her something that means a lot. The way in the manner in which they gave it to her and the way in the manner in which she used it offends me. I'm not going to lie. Here is a video of her playing that flute. Take a listen. I just want to play James Madison because it's huge for the 80s. We just made history tonight. So I twerked and played James Madison's flute and I made history tonight. Okay. We'll just see a little bit about that flute. The antique crystal flute belonged to President James Madison. It was likely rescued by Dolly Madison when British soldiers set the White House on fire during the war of 1812. So no she's not making history here. She's defiling history. It's like spraying graffiti on a historical building and going, oh it's art. No it's not art. We're not going to call it art. We're not going to call it making history. But she doesn't see that. Right. She thinks that when these companies reached out to these organizations, reached out to these opportunities, it's because they love her. And in reality the reason it's because they hate and want to corrupt the people that follow her. Right. They don't want more people to make it out like Lizzo did. Again, I've said this on previous episodes. I'm going to say it again. I like Lizzo's music. I think she's talented. I think she's tremendously talented. I like that she can play the flute. I like that she plays other instruments and I love that she contributes to music. I just wish that she would contribute positively. I wish that she would understand that there are people with more nefarious goals that recognize her as a talented individual. And they are using her to sell bad ideas to the rest of society because what they're actually after is to enslave the rest of you. Right. They do not want everybody to be productive. They do not want everybody to wake up every day and go to work and to make a lot of money because that is not how it works. Right. The haves want to ensure there is a constant pool of have-nots. That's not a conspiracy. That's a fact. Right. It is not a conspiracy to think that there are people that want you to consume garbage. There's not a conspiracy to think that there are people that want to impact your psychological immune system negatively, that wants you to constantly live in the state of fear, that wants you to constantly live with your handout. And the way that they get you to become that sort of an individual, that sort of an individual that will need handouts, that sort of individual that will rely on government to give you solutions for the rest of your life is through artistry. It is through Hollywood. It is through people like Cardi B and Lizzo who don't understand that they are pawns in a game of chess that they don't even know that they're playing. That's all I have to say about that. As a final topic of a day that I want to get into, it's actually a daily wire article, a bunch of companies are currently removing their advertisements from Twitter over child pornography allegations. Now, I love talking about Twitter because it amazes me what is allowed to stay on Twitter and what gets pulled off. Remember Donald Trump gloriously taking off of Twitter? I don't know because they make you think that he tweeted something that was violent. He never did. Ask the person who says, well, you know, you had to be pulled down for violence. Ask them to produce Donald Trump's last tweets. They're not violent at all. I'm giving kind of violent. In fact, they assessed that it was his offline behavior that determined that he needed to be pulled off online. They needed to pull his account online because of what he was doing and saying offline, which by the way was also not violent. This was just censorship. Another example, of course, is me. I recently had my account locked on Twitter for four months because I didn't want to take down the tweets. Here is what my tweets actually said. An adult man that wants to dress up like a female is a glaring symbol of mental disease. A society driven by cowardice prevents this topic from being discussed honestly and openly. All of our children are at risk because we refuse to acknowledge and instead encourage mental illness. Twitter locks down my account for that tweet talking about mental illness and the signs of it. Like, I don't know, Dylan Mulvaney skipping through a forest wearing heels. Like, we discussed earlier, that would be an example of glaring mental illness. And we are, we've become a society of coward who don't want to discuss that openly for fear of being called transphobic. You think I'm transphobic? You think I have a phobia, an unrealistic fear of that? Do you think that if I saw Dylan Mulvaney frolicking through a forest that I would be scared? You think that's scary to me? No, it's sad to me. Okay? It is sad to me that we have a society that encourages that. So, Twitter saw that tweet for me, pulled it down, locked my account instantly. But apparently, according to a Reuters report, tweets that solicited child sex and abuse material are appearing alongside the profile pages of at least 30 major advertisers on Twitter. And so, these companies are now pulling down their ads, they're pulling down their ad services off of the social media platform entirely because they are realizing that for whatever reason, child sex abuse online is totally fine for Twitter, right? They allow these, this material to stay online, they allow these accounts to stay online. I mean, you can go on Twitter right now and you can find hardcore porn that is not problematic at all. Not at all. And finally, some companies are saying, you know what, this is getting a little strange. Why does Candace Owens have to be frozen on the internet and not allowed to use her account for talking about glaring signs of mental disease in an eloquent manner? No one was called a name. I didn't use a picture of a person and say, this person has mental disease, that's got to go. But for whatever reason, these pedophilic accounts can stay. People that are looking for children to have sex with are allowed to stay. So, companies like Dyson, Ecolab and Mazda are either pausing or pulling down their ads entirely from the platform. Mazda now prohibits its ads from appearing on Twitter profile pages. And apparently, according to the report, there are more than 500 accounts that openly share or request child sex abuse material for 20 days during September alone. So, during this month, 500 accounts that were just openly requesting to see child pornography and desolicited child sex abuse material. None of them are pulled down. But me, I got to go, guys. I don't know. I just, I have this knack for understanding that there is a more sinister agenda that is happening on social media. I want you to think about that. I want you to know that when you engage in social media that there are people that want to harm you. There are people that want to harm your children.
