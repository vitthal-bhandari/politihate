    "text": " I'm Jeff Broke's host and showrunner of Survivor. We are back for a new season of On Fire, the official Survivor podcast. And this time we are thrilled to announce a new member of the tribe from Edge of Extinction, Rick Devins. Thanks Jeff and each week our producer Jay and I will take you through the turning points of Survivor 45. You'll get it all from the fan player and producers POV. Listen to On Fire, the official Survivor podcast on Apple Podcast or wherever you get your podcast. You're listening to Comedy Central. Thank you so much for tuning in. Thank you for coming out and watching. I appreciate you. I appreciate you. Thank you so much everybody. We've got a great show for you tonight. Take a seat. Let's get into it. So many things to talk about. The CDC is facing an outbreak of low self-esteem. Dulce Sloan gives Republicans a makeover and guess who's going to prison? Donald Trump's former CFO. So let's do this people. Let's jump straight into today's headlines. All right. All right people. I'm going to be honest with all the news that happened today. I don't think we have enough space for it in today's show. And I've tried everything. I've tried everything. I even stuffed the whole show in Spanx but it just bulged out over the sides. So it just looks like we don't have enough time for it all. Fortunately, not enough time is just enough time for a segment we call. And nobody got time for that. All right. Let's kick things off with the Centers for Disease Control, the government agency that spent the first two years of the pandemic saying, ah, we're all going to get COVID. And the last six months like, ah, we're all going to get COVID. Chill. And if you want one of those people who thinks the CDC has handled the pandemic badly, well, it turns out the CDC agrees with you. This morning, the CDC director promising a major overhaul after a scathing, internally initiated review found the agency repeatedly botched its response to the pandemic. In a statement, Dr. Rochelle Walensky putting it bluntly, our performance did not reliably meet expectations. Walensky herself calling for that review. It found the CDC's recommendations throughout the crisis from masking to vaccines, confusing and overwhelming. Oh, I guess the CDC finally checked their Twitter mentions. But she's right. The CDC really dropped the ball. People depended on them for clear advice. And when they didn't get it, they started looking elsewhere for answers. I mean, say what you want about goop. Their advice was consistent. I mean, yes, the advice was to buy a $4,000 crystal butt plug, but it was consistent. Meanwhile, the CDC was all over the place. They said, don't wear masks. They said, no, do wear masks, but don't because we need them. Okay, now you can wear masks. Any mask, even clock. Wait, cloth is the worst. What are you doing? Now you got COVID. Stay inside for five days. No 10 days, no two days. The point is trust the science. Now, if we had more time, we could talk about whether or not the CDC learned the right lessons from COVID to prevent the next outbreak. Well, not the next outbreak because the next outbreak is monkeypox and they're already messing that up. But the one after that, but we just don't have the time for that because while the CDC is struggling with multiple outbreaks, the Trump organization is overrun with an outbreak of crime. Now to breaking news, Alan Weisselberg, the Trump Organization Chief Financial Officer pleaded guilty today to a wide ranging tax scheme. As part of the deal, he'll need to testify against the Trump Organization in the coming months. The company is accused of helping Weisselberg and other execs avoid income taxes by failing to accurately report their full compensation. Yeah, that's right. Trump's number two guy for the last 40 years has pled guilty to tax fraud. And can we just take a moment to appreciate how many people associated with Donald Trump have ended up in prison? Huh? His lawyer, his campaign manager, his deputy campaign chairman, now the chief financial officer of his organization. Usually, you've got to want to drug cartel to have this many friends doing hard time. Because at this point, it's basically El Chapo and Donald Trump. That's it. You know what they actually need to do? They need to send all these Trump felons to school assemblies to scare kids away from Trump. Just be like, you think hanging out with the 45th president is cool? That's what I thought. Now I'm drinking wine out of a toilet. That's my state of the union, kids. Now, I know what you're thinking right now. You're wondering to yourself, surely if Trump's second in command was committing financial crimes with Trump's company, then Trump must also be involved in these crimes. Well, actually no. Because apparently the story is that he had no idea what was happening in his organization at all levels for decades. He had no clue. And that, my friends, is the kind of leadership that makes him fit to be the next president of the United States. Truly powerful. No clue at all. Now, look, if we had more time, we could talk about how Trump pretends to be the candidate of law and order. Meanwhile, his friends can fill up an entire prison wing, but we just don't have the time for that. Because while Trump world is at war with the law, some of the music's biggest legends are at war over Christmas. Mariah Carey does not want a lot for Christmas. There's just one thing she says she needs. A trademark for the title, Queen of Christmas. Now, Carey is seeking to solidify her brand with a legal filing that would give her exclusive rights to use the title on everything from clothes to alcohol, dog products, and more. But not everyone agrees she deserves it. Singer Darlene Love fighting back. The songstress known for her hit, Christmas baby, please come home, which she performed annually on the David Letterman show as a holiday tradition. Telling ABC News in a statement, I adore Mariah Carey as an artist and songwriter, but Queen of Christmas should not be exclusive to anyone except for Mary, Mother of Jesus. Yeah, that's right. The real Queen of Christmas is Mary, Mother of Jesus. She should get the trademarks to sell alcohol and dog toys. It's about time. It's about time Mary got some of the financial benefits. The only thing she got out of this whole thing were gifts from those three wise men. One of those gifts was Mer. What the hell is that all about? Oh, I just gave birth in a bond. But yeah, thanks for the Mer. Real helpful. Yeah, when I was in labor with the Son of God, the whole time I was thinking, oh, I could really use some mer right about now. Get out of here. Gold guy, you can stay with the gold. And by the way, by the way, I thought Mariah told us that all she wants for Christmas is me. But now she also wants trademarks, which isn't Mariah. Next, you're going to tell me that I won't always be your baby due to do now. Now look, we had more time. We could talk about whether anyone should have the right to trademark anything about Christmas or we could talk about how the commercialization of Christmas has taken us away from the true meaning of the holiday, which is giving a jolly old man diabetes. But we just don't have the time for that because over in Russia, Vladimir Putin, the exact opposite of Santa is handing out gifts of his own. Russia's population has been rapidly declining thanks to low birth rates and an exodus of citizens since the invasion of Ukraine. And now Vladimir Putin is taking action. This week, he announced the revival of the Soviet era Mother Harrowin Award. Any Russian woman who gives birth to 10 children will be given a one time payment of one million rubles or $16,500. Wow, $16,000 and all you have to do is have $4 million worth of kids. It's a steal. Look at you, Vlad. Wow. Huh? You hear that Russian ladies? You get 16 grand for 10 kids. Vladimir Putin making it drizzle. Huh? This makes no sense. $16,000 for 10 kids makes zero cents unless that money is for you to buy a plane ticket to escape to a life without all those damn children. And I know right now you're probably thinking, but Trevor, it's Russia. They can store the 10 kids inside each other. That's not how kids work, you idiot. Can you imagine being the 10th kid, you're going to spend your whole life wondering if your parents really wanted you or if they just wanted a smart fridge? Listen, Putin. You don't need to go to these lengths. There's an easier way to repopulate your country. All right? Just give Nick Cannon citizenship. Problem solved. Done. Spasiba. Now, if we had the time, we could talk about whether it's even a good idea to stuff more people into a planet that's already more crowded than a port-a-party at Coachella. But we just don't have the time because while Russia's leader is trying to pump up his population, Finland's leader is getting in trouble for trying to pump up the jam. The Prime Minister of Finland, Sana Marin, has faced backlash after a leaked video showed her partying. She's faced criticism from opposition parties with one leader demanding she take a drugs test. Ms. Marin denied taking drugs and said she only drank alcohol. Okay. Okay. I know that clip is extremely confusing for Americans, so let me try and explain. Some countries have leaders who don't have osteoporosis. Yeah. And they party. You see? And I know it may seem different or weird, but we should be respectful of their cultures. Nice for the story itself. I don't think the leader of Finland did anything that any other leader in the world hasn't done. All right? Almost every other leader in the world drinks and parties. The only difference is they're not young enough to have friends who know how to use a phone. All right? Yeah. Have you seen old people when they try and use a camera? They always look like they discovered an ancient artifact and they try to decipher what the hieroglyphs mean. They're just like, ah, okay. What? Let's go. Oh, wait, wait. Your friend, youber sent you a message. Yeah. Because you realize this is just the beginning. Younger generations use technology. They're going to get older and one day they're going to come into power. So it's only a matter of time before we're in a world where like a world war starts because some leader DM'd a dick pick, you know? They're just going to be like, what? They sent a flaccid penis, prepares the troops. If you ask me. If you ask me, Finland should be grateful. Finland should be grateful for the scandals that they have. Imagine them telling other countries about their problems. America, you won't believe it. Our prime minister was caught dancing. It's terrible. America's like, yeah, yeah, yeah, I gotta go. We're about to raid the former president's hotel to get back out nuclear codes. But good luck with that. Good luck with that. We gotta go. Gotta go. Now, we had more time. We could talk more about how the criticism of Saint-Armerin really just seems to be, how dare you spend your leisure time doing something young women enjoy rather than doing things older men enjoy like hunting or smoking cigars or watching TV with one hand in your pants for some reason. You know, dignified things. But ain't nobody got time for that because we have to go to a commercial break. And when we come back, do say Sloan is going to give Republicans a glow up. You don't want to miss it. CHEERING AND APPLAUSE MTV's official challenge podcast is back for another season. That's right. The challenge is back and so are we. I'm Devin Simone. And I'm Devon Rogers. Now, y'all know we had so much fun covering the challenge USA won together that we thought, why not do it again? So we are joining forces to dive into this brand new season. Season 39, battle for a new champion. Yes. Yes. 24 contenders will compete to win their first championship. They know the battle, but not the victory. Oh, thank God. I am ready for a new champion. A new one. Okay, give us some fresh faces, people. Girl, I couldn't agree more. So every week after the episode airs, come hang with us as we break down all the challenges and eliminations and of course get the inside scoop on all the drama. And we got all the T. Okay? We will be joined by the cast members themselves every week, y'all. Listen to MTV's official challenge podcast on the iHeartRadio app, Apple Podcasts, or wherever you get your podcasts. Welcome back to the Daily Show. Look, I know you know this, but America has a lot of problems. Aging, infrastructure, economic inequality, that smell in the attic that won't go away. But some Republicans think that there is a much bigger issue that demands immediate action. One of the nation's newest culture battles is really heating up here in Michigan, thanks to a proposal from some state Republicans. They are targeting drag shows in public schools, even though it's not clear if any school has ever hosted a drag show at this point. The anti-drag show bill is being sponsored by Republicans, including Representative Bo LaFave. Arizona GOP gubernatorial candidate Carrie Lake attacked drag queens as dangerous to children. We don't want our tax money going into drag shows at school. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis said he would consider sending child protective services to investigate parents who take their kids to drag shows. It is a disturbing trend in our society to try to sexualize these young people. That is not the way you look out for our children. Oh, here we go again. Here we go again. Probably happened once or twice somewhere, they're like, now it's a nationwide thing. It's actually so weird that Republicans are against drag queens, because what the founding fathers, old drag queens, they're wearing the wigs. John Hancock, don't tell me that's not a drag queen name. And look, I agree that this is the biggest danger facing school. Someone could conceal Carrie a penis into the classroom or the humanity. Oh, and Republicans, if you dislike people who wear over-the-top wigs, a ton of foundation and are totally obsessed with sex, I've got bad news about your favorite president, you know. Now, obviously, obviously, people have very strong opinions over banning drag shows, and that includes our very own Dulce Simone. Hello friends. If you know me, you know that I love me some drag. It's like sports, but for people who don't want to deal with any balls, if you know what I mean. But recently conservatives have been acting like drag at some brand new thing that liberals dreamed up to turn your kids into glitter demons. Now, maybe these conservatives wouldn't be so scared of drag if they could just get to know how it could help them. So to get up close and personal with the art form, I want to bring in a true expert, my friend and group-hall drag race superstar, the hilarious Carrie Colby. Hello, I'm going to try to be funny today. I trust this is that's it. Ooh, Carrie and I are going to take a closer look at some of these Republicans who got beef with drag and help them get in touch with their inner drag queen. Okay, first up we got Ron DeSantis, Florida governor, and what would happen if grown-up Pinocchio joined QAnon? This man looks like he's doing Tucker Carlson cosplay. Absolutely, because also can we talk about this haircut? Mm-mm, sir, you are a 43-year-old man. Why are you getting your hair done at kids cuts? So obviously, we need to cover up that cloth with the bold wind. Baby, he needs a blunt cut. Blunt cut to cover your face. Chop it, huh? Look at this man's face, he's got Jim Crow's feet. Ha! It's true. The Crow's feet are crowing, honey. It's just, it's just, the guy like, no, I don't need it. Now, Ron DeSantis threw his hat in the drag-hating game when he said he wanted to revoke the liquor licenses of restaurants that allowed kids into drag brunch. I'm surprised he has so much to say for a man with no lips at all. Look at this man. He runs his mouth so much that his lips have left the seat. Truly. So what I would want is to fill in that mouth with a full red gloss. And we gotta do something about those eyebrows. Right now, it's giving pro magnum. We need to do something with that brow so it can give a little more personality. Now let's move on to Michigan legislator, Bo Leffer. I cannot believe some with a natural drag queen name hates drag queens so much. Bo Leffer sounds like a sexy armoire that lives in a bitch castle. Now Bo here wants to allow parents to sue schools that expose kids to drag queens. Well first things first, let's get rid of that beard, honey. Oh, oh no. Is that supposed to be drag queens? That's not supposed to be that. And a box of Bisqueak has come to life. I will not. I will not dare you. Apparently you are what you eat, girl. First thing you are what you eat. And last, we have Carrie Lake. What a waste of my name. Number one. But she is a Republican candidate for governor and she's also the villain from every cheerleader movie. Oh absolutely. Carrie was quoted saying they kicked God out of schools and welcomed drag queens. But what's interesting about that is that she used to be a fan. Oh, she even had a drag queen perform at her birthday. Oh, it really makes you wonder what happened that day. I know if it was my birthday and someone came in and was being so fabulous, too fabulous even, I'd be a little upset too. Oh absolutely. But now that she's sworn off drag, she's going to be a middle-aged woman having her birthday at Golden Corratt. Oh, that does not sound appetizing. I be asked to go, honey. But we're going to do her a favor and give her a makeover for free. Now getting her from resting Kelly and Conway face to 50 and fabulous, we're going to have to add some extensions because right now she's just ripping off 90s, Hallie Berry. We're going to leave the past behind. That was four cat-woman's ago, okay? We're up to Zoey Krab at Snack. So, there's your new looks because clearly you aren't going to beat us. So you might as well join us, baby. Thank you so much for that. Go say slow down Carrie. All right, stay tuned because when we come back, Miss Universe will be joining on the show. Hey everybody, Stephen Colbert here. I have my own, we have the show has a podcast, the Late Show Pod Show. And here I'm here with the producer Becca. Becca, what are we doing? What is this? So, Late Show Pod Show, it's everything you love about the Late Show, the monologue, the lead guest. And here's, am I correct about this, that you actually get things in the podcast often that aren't on the show because we had to cut things for time. And so you'll get more guests or you might even get some jokes or some more meanwiles or something like that. We didn't get a chance or certainly conversations with Lewis in the band that you don't get. So you get more stuff. So, if you don't listen to the podcast, you're losing money. It's true. It's true. TV, you can only put so much. You got to get those commercial breaks in, but the podcast, we can keep going. That's the great thing about podcast is that the real estate is enormously cheap. And so, you could just shovel anything in there. People go, thank you. Listen to the Late Show Pod Show with Stephen Colbert, wherever you get your podcasts. I use the internet. Welcome back to the Daily Show. My guest tonight is the current Miss Universe who brought the crown back to India for the first time in 21 years. Please welcome Miss Universe herself, Hanaz Sandhu. Welcome. Thank you so much. Oh, thank you so much. Miss Universe. Welcome to the Daily Show. Thank you. Thank you. I'm so excited for today. I'm so excited to chat with you because, A, you don't get to chat to Miss Universe every single day. But also, you've got, honestly, in my opinion, one of the most impressive platforms that you run, because every Miss Universe will say, this is what I'd like to do. It might be education, it might be getting women into business, whatever it may be. But you really have a fantastic platform in that you said, I want to talk about an issue that affects women all over the planet, and that issue is? Mentional Equity. And it's very important. I never realized the importance of Mentional Equity until my mom, being a gynecologist, taught me how important this talk about women's health, and to take care of yourself. And I always looked up to her, and she was someone who was breaking that and empowering women in her life. So when I grew up, and I felt like this is what I want to do. For me, Miss Universe was never about looking beautiful and wearing glitz and glam. It's not about that. For me, it was a platform where you can talk about things that you want to do. And whenever I used to look for Miss Universe's online and their videos and everything, they always left something impactful. And I wanted to do too. I also wanted to leave and create a legacy and empower women around the world and tell them that if I can do it, then you can do it too. You've done it for five times, over. You also be stigmatizing the conversation. So many people from around the world live in a world where they cannot talk about something that's a normal part of a woman's life every single day. They'll get isolated, they'll get told that they're dirty, whatever it is, they're sinful. And you've really been playing a role, not just in India, but around the world and saying, we need to get rid of that stigma. What have you found works well when you talk to people about it? Till now I've been to Philippines, Indonesia, Vietnam, and of course, recently South Africa, I saw there's one thing in common is that women's health is always neglected, and there's different situations in different countries. Sometimes women are not even allowed to talk about their mental health or even let them buy pads. And I think this is what I want to tell them that you don't ask for a pad. Nobody else is going to do it for you. And this pad machine is not only going to give livelihood to women in that area, in the ruler area, but also will give pads to others. And I think that's where we want to see women supporting each other. With that, when women in power will make, for women's health, for mental equity, we are breaking tabbles together. And we definitely mean men also to support us in this big movement. I love how positive you are. I love how proactive you are. It's been amazing to see your journey because your journey has highlighted so many issues, not just in and around what women may face in their health, but also just in society. You've been very candid in talking about how you were bullied when you gained a little bit of weight after the Miss Universe competition. People were really vicious and they were hateful and they brought you to tears. But you bounced back and you've become really a spokesperson for positivity in general. People would be shocked to hear that a Miss Universe has been bullied for how she looks. But you've really highlighted that. And I feel like you've come out of that stronger. Yes, actually, for me, it's not about how you look. It's about what you say and how you say it and how you treat people. Because in the end of the day, when you die, people will not remember you for what you wore. They will remember you about how they treated you. So that's very important to have a kind heart and to remind people that kindness is the utmost important thing in this whole world. I was really just heartened when I saw people bashing me for my weight came, but I didn't let them describe me. There's young girls, like six, seven years old girls and even boys looking up to me. And if they see me being timid, if they see me being not strong enough, I don't think so that would be the right way to be that impactful person or inspire them. I want to tell them that the inspiration starts within you. If you inspire yourself, that's how you can inspire a lot of people. I like that. Your own cheerleader. Your own cheerleader. You're also in movies in India, right? Yes, I have done two recent movies. You've done two? I'm a theatre artist from the last five years. And that's how my life started, actually. I realized my passion of being on stage and expressing myself through theater. And being an actor, that was what I always wanted to do. So I need advice because I've always wanted my dream has always been to be in a Bollywood movie. You want to? I've always done it with me. Do you want my debut with you? Do you want my debut to be with you? I wouldn't even know. Let me think about it, but I can consider you. What do you think about it? Yes, I have the right moves and everything. I can teach you some moves, actually. You can teach me moves? Yes, that would be a great practice for you. Whenever you give auditions for Bollywood, you need to know some Bollywood moves. Come on. I'll learn the moves. You teach me right now? Yes, let's do it. Okay, let's do it right over here. Thank you. I'm going to teach you four simple steps. Four simple steps. Simple.

I have my own, we have the show has a podcast, The Late Show Pod Show. And here I'm here with the producer Becca. Becca, what are we doing? What is this? So, Late Show Pod Show, it's everything you love about the Late Show, the monologue, the lead guest. And here's, am I correct about this, that you actually get things in the podcast often that aren't on the show, because we had to cut things for time. And so, you'll get more guests. You might even get some jokes or some more mean-wiles or something like that. We didn't get a chance. Or certainly conversations with Lewis and the band that you don't get. So, you get more stuff. If you don't listen to the podcast, you're losing money. It's true. It's true. TV, you can only put so much. You got to get those commercial breaks in. But the podcast, we can keep going. That's the great things about podcast, is that the real estate is enormously cheap. Yeah. And so, you can just shovel anything in there. People go, thank you. Listen to the Late Show Pod Show with Stephen Colbert, wherever you get your podcasts. I use the internet. We're so shook for tonight. I'm Joe Runner of Survivor. We are back for a new season of On Fire, the official Survivor podcast. And this time, we are thrilled to announce a new member of the tribe from Edge of Extinction, Rick Devins. Thanks, Jeff. And each week, our producer, Jay and I, will take you through the turning points of Survivor 45. You'll get it all from the fan player and producer's POV. Listen to On Fire, the official Survivor podcast, on Apple Podcast, or wherever you get your podcasts."
