I'm joined, of course, by John Dickerson of CBS's Sunday Morning from New York City. Hello, John. Hello, David. I'm not in New York City. I'm in Washington DC. Let me paint the picture. It's so muggy outside that the window of the hotel is almost completely fogged as the air conditioning the window and the outside air compete for supremacy. Why aren't we seeing each other? I didn't even know you were in DC. I know it's a good point. Well, I have, you know, the hearings and then I happened to be accompanied by my lovely wife and so I've been spending some time with her. Yeah, compete, David. No way. No one can compete with Andy Dickerson. That was Emily Baslan of the New York Times Magazine and Yale University Law School from, I hope, New Haven, Connecticut. I hope not Washington DC. No, I'm not in Washington DC. We're all sitting outside your door. On this week's show, what the January 6th Commission has revealed and what that means for the country, then we will talk to the former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors, Jason Furman, about the economy, the Fed, inflation, and the crypto crash, then Emily's fascinating article about the fight over gender therapy for trans kids. We will discuss it with Emily, herself. Plus, of course, we'll have cocktail chatter. And speaking of Washington DC and gathering in Washington DC, a reminder that on June 29th, less than two weeks away, we will be live for our first show in more than two years at Sixth and I Historic Synagogue here in Washington DC, First Live Gabbfest on Wednesday, June 29th.

It's gonna be a really fun evening. Please join us there on June 29th. It's gonna be a time of fellowship. The January 6th Committee postponed the hearing it had scheduled for Wednesday, but it's slated to hold its third hearing Thursday afternoon after we tape. Probably also before you have heard this, John will be there. This comes after two blockbuster televised hearings, a Thursday night hearing last week that detailed the violence of the insurrectionists and the planning by the Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, among others, to do real violence. The second detailing how definitively and certainly and repeatedly Trump's team knew that they had lost the election, told them they had lost the election and yet failed to prevent him from jinnying up the big lie. Also comes news today that John Eastman, the shady lawyer at the center of a lot of Trump legal chicanery, may have been getting fed inside dope about Supreme Court discussions plausibly from Ginny Thomas. Ginny Thomas, who's the center of all. I'm gonna put on my John Dickerson cap here for a second. My John Dickerson fedora. It's a shapoe. You think of hearings as having multiple purposes? This this hearing could be to record what happened for history so that we are simply documenting this threat to the country and the world has that on notice. It has a record for it. The second would be to reach a TV reading and listening audience so that they hold officials to account. That is another reason, a more immediate reason. There could be a reason which is really to build up a legal case which is even separate from reaching the TV audience just to present the evidence so that the potential prosecutors can have the evidence to array against those accused of potential crimes. Then finally to jinn up voter enthusiasm and influence voters for potential election or potential political gain. So John, how are they doing on each of those four accounts? Am I missing an important other thing that they're doing? I would add one other thing which is that in a rules-based society, in a government that's formed around the ideas, the idea of peaceful resolution of claims. That is based on an idea that everybody has to salute and that that idea loses its value if people just blow it off. That's what this is. The idea that elections are the peaceful resolution of competing claims and when you lose an election you can't just say, no I won and by power and force I'm going to stay in power. Because if you do that the idea that you can peacefully resolve competing claims is ruined. It's all where it's done and that set the center of the ongoing question of American democracy and even if you don't control the mob and you don't control the presidency, there are other ways in which you can undermine the system which is all of the behaviors and habits the president Trump employed and that are being employed by his party in response to the hearings which is to claim things are true that aren't true. It's a real-time examination and opportunity for everybody to sign up and say we believe in these things that have been a part of democracy and implicitly if you don't stand up and say this is wrong you can't just decide an outcome when you lose then you're implicitly embracing the undermining of democracy. I think the committee is doing a good job because what they've done is they've teed up all of these members of the Trump administration. There was rare unanimity in the Trump administration after the election that the election was not stolen. It's hard to get the Trump administration to agree on anything but it turns out they agree to the fact that the election wasn't stolen. It's just President Trump didn't want to believe it or had another plan in mind but I thought the use of voices from inside the president's campaign has been effective in trying to convince an audience that isn't already convinced that he was willfully destroying democracy to stay in power. Emily what moments from the first set of hearings, first two sets of hearings have really stood out to you? I mean I thought Bill Barr's testimony was pretty riveting and I think generally one thing I've noticed is that you have these lawyers there's White House lawyer, other Trump administration lawyer, I think of Alex Cannon in that second role and then Barr and it's like they reached the limit of their partisan selves, right? They wanted Trump to win. I mean this is even true about Trump's campaign manager, a Bell Stepian. They were gonna fight like hell for him to win if there was an opening they would have taken it but there wasn't and in the end the rule of law for their values mattered to them and so they weren't willing to go along with what seemed to them like a just delusional scheme. I mean it is a lot to remember how quiet they were as this was all unfolding. They didn't give us any clue that they all felt this way. I mean Barr resigned but he didn't speak out in any way. It could have made a real difference to how the country absorbed all of Trump's flailing if we had known that they all held these views and so that seems like a real act of cowardice but as they're coming forward now I mean to me it seems like that's important to get on the record for the reasons John said. What's harder is whether you know you think there should be a higher bar for the committee to clear namely that there are real political consequences for Trump that the party, his party distances itself from him that he loses power or that he gets charged criminally and I am not sure how I feel about the second one. I mean it's so complicated or just there are so many different considerations. There's whether he actually broke the law whether we should ever charge a former president, all of those things and then this question of him losing political power just still seems pretty unlikely to me. Well not only that he has gained political power since January 6th. I mean he's the likely nominee of the party at the moment and he's the most powerful person in the party. He's continuing to sell the lie not just publicly but to raise money which the committee also pointed out was a total grift that the money raised for his quote-unquote defense fund is going to all kinds of things other than his defense and there are a hundred Washington and then I'll assist a hundred Republicans who won in primaries who believe this lie that even Trump's most inside people and as you mentioned Emily it's the lawyers including Eric Hirschman who was one of his defense lawyers in the first impeachment. I mean these are you couldn't be anymore on team Trump and yet his White House lawyers multiple ones his vice president his vice president staff the Department of Justice they all his attorney general they all said campaign manager they all said there was nothing there. On the prosecution question it's really interesting because there is this notion that it's obviously going to be incredibly it would be incredibly hard to prosecute Trump and he was impeached twice and not convicted and and it's difficult to imagine there's a jury of twelve people in this country that you could you could find that would convict I don't know maybe that's not true I suppose if you picked them in the in the right way you might find it but it's pretty clear that he he did not honestly believe that he had won it is not credible for him to say that he honestly believe that he won now he will undoubtedly say that and he he acts like he believes it but when you are presented with endless evidence that the world is around and the world is around and the world is around and you just declined to say and you're like I just really believe the world is flat I just that's just what I believe it is not it is not credible for you to say that and therefore his state of mind about whether he was corruptly influencing and official proceeding is not really relevant it does seem pretty clear that he is committed a crime and not just a crime like almost the highest crime that can be committed in this country and the idea that he can't be prosecuted for that I'm somebody who's very you know I'm I'm not like a legalistic person I don't really want a lot of people prosecuted for a lot of things but it is really problematic that that we certainly won't get him to have political consequences but also that the Justice Department may decide this is not a winnable case and therefore not a bringable case Emily building on what David said is if if the defense is oh well you know he wasn't willfully doing this he was just delusional do you do you support the delusional case by maintaining the delusion even like you have to maintain the delusion for the rest of your life in order to create the doubt that you weren't willfully destroying democracy just to stay empowered I mean I don't know how hard that would be for Trump to do because he is you know if you buy into this idea that he really believed the election was stolen he's willing to continue perpetuating that right you know for way color cases this comes up all the time because you have to prove a certain level of what's called men's ray a state of mind in order to get a conviction and rarely do you have a smoking gun in which someone admits like oh yes I knew I was defrauding the company and belking them of millions of dollars and so there's a concept in the law called willful blindness which is like if there's all kinds of evidence that you should have known and were blinding yourself to the facts that's not a defense and I thought when I was listening to Bill Barr in particular that I was absolutely hearing proof for that right Bill Barr called it bullshit he literally said it was bullshit I told him that the stuff that his people were shuttling out to the public or bulk was bullshit I mean that the claims of fraud were bullshit and you know he was in statement about that and I reiterated that they wasted a whole month on these claims on the Dominion voting machines and they were idiotic claims and I think one of the important things that comes out of the hearing that that I think they could make a make clear is these are called the January 6 hearings but really this was not about one day this was about a 78 day effort on the president to try every possible door you know if he's a burglar trying to break into the house he didn't just try some kind of fancy way to break in the front door he tried the front door he tried all the windows on the first level he got a ladder and tried all the second windows he tried to climb in through the mail slot he was trying every possible way to do this over the course of 78 days you know in addition to being willfully blind he was also actively searching for any barista at the local Starbucks who could give him a new possible way to take back the election so it is pretty clear to me that it is not just me that it is entirely likely that we're gonna have another Trump presidency that in January 2025 there may well be a president Trump returning to the presidency there's this really interesting piece by Michael Dorf that we read where you he talked about the difference between the sort of the collaborators the collaborators patriots and scoundrels and people like Rudy Giuliani clearly a scoundrel like stuck with this pushed all these lies terrible the patriots the people who stood up to Trump and rejected Trump from at various points including I would say like Mike Pence at a moment of extreme duress Mike Pence did something extremely patriotic and brave and I hope I hope history remembers that history should also remember all the terrible things he did but that was that was no joke what Mike Pence did though he really had no choice but well but but yeah no choice but it's it is incredibly hard like the Brad Raffensberger it's when you were under so much pressure from your own people to do something that is that so breaks the social bonds with the people you care most about with the people who have supported you most with the source of your income the source of your fame the source of your success and to willfully reject it in a high profile way knowing there could be terrible consequences for it that is that's really really brave and I know Mike Pence was not brave on every moment but that was that matter and I also think the idea you have no choice you do have a choice in this weird world which is just make up something that isn't true and instead of being out in the cold naked believing something that's delusional you'll get a whole team that will come give you a warm blanket and tell you it's all just fine so there actually was a choice in this wacky world I just worry that they're going into 20 potential 2025 there are not enough there's certainly not enough Patriots left and there might not be enough collaborators left to run a government that doesn't do the worst things just to close this out there going to be six or maybe seven hearings the January 6th Commission is going to do and that are going to be televised I suspect we're all jaded and kind of worn down enough to know that it's not going to change the fundamental political dynamics of this country there's no chance of it and I personally was just very depressed and sobered by a David Brooks column just saying that it's not that this stuff doesn't matter exactly it's important to record it for history but that we have a future which looks to be a civil war we have all the conditions for political violence developing around us we have lost trust in institutions there are just the the elements that that are gonna combust are all in place and there's nothing that the January 6th Commission is doing that is likely to fundamentally change that dynamic and there's nothing in fact at all happening in the country is likely to fundamentally change that dynamic and it's it's so depressing to me but the way out of that depression which is a founded one is if you is I think to do what what Brooks suggested which is to see this threat as a present one this isn't some story about Donald Trump this is a story about and I'm not saying this this is the only I think it may not work but is that this is a story that results from a series of habits and those habits are still intact and they are in fact more virulent among these hundred Republicans who were elected believing it's something that isn't true or pushing something we know not to be true and if you keep the light on the fact that people who don't believe in the basic democratic principle of the will of the people and you keep in mind that this is still a live threat for the various reasons we've talked about that at least makes it something that's clear and present in the moment rather than just oh this is another examination of Donald Trump's greatest idiosyncrasy that happened on a single day and can't we move on.

inflation which continues at a rate of more than eight percent it's the biggest rate hike since 1994 I think and we're at what feels like an amazingly complex economic moment we have inflation surging because of continued supply chain disruptions because of geopolitical disruptions because of consumer demand general enthusiastic consumer demand the Biden administration seems to be planning to lift various tariffs unemployment is still low the stock market is in bear market territory and most delightedly for bad people like me the crypto economy is crashing so we're glad to be joined by Jason Furman Gavfest irregular I suppose professor at Harvard and former chair of the Council of Economic Advisors under President Obama so Jason all these various things are happening all at once what what is the one thing that we really should keep an eye on if we have to pay attention to only one of the things that's happening in the economy what should we pay attention to I pay attention to consumer spending which is 70 percent of the economy and it's one of the weirdest things right now consumers are more pessimistic than they've ever been this is in surveys going back 60 years but consumers so far at least are increasing their spending at a decent pace and that disconnect is of all of the weird things in the economy to me I'm the weirdest you mentioned something when you talked to Ezra Klein that I think is in this same basket which was that people were spending in crazy areas like hobbies that that that their behavior was the purchasing behavior was not just on everyday stuff but also in weird hobbies that might not be part of the central part of their life is do you is that what you're talking about here and also when retail sales fall is that a good thing to look at consistent with the point you just made yeah so what you see is incredibly elevated spending on just about every type of goods with the exception of cars which no one can get but everything other than cars people are still spending 10 15 20 percent more than normal but then service spending continues to increase every month people are traveling more people are going to restaurants more and the like and so that combination is continuing to prop consumer spending up your second question implicitly brought up another weird thing in the economy right now normally you're rooting for the more of anything good the better but there is such a thing is too much of a good thing right now I think if policymakers could choose economic growth over the next year of 2.7% or 1.7% I think most of them would be a lot happier with 1.7% than 2.7 which is something that rarely would be the case the concern is that right now the economy is overheating and that's driving up inflation and it's pretty generally acknowledged that you're going to need at least somewhat slower growth to cool things down so that some of the price pressures diminish and so if the economy grew at 2.7% over the next year probably at that same time you'd have higher rising inflation if it grew at 1.7 you'd at least have a fighting shot at that inflation rate coming down so just an overheating economy too much growth can make the problem worse why why is it do you think maybe you don't know that people are so flap happy and they're spending I mean partners they got a lot of money in in three rounds of checks in 2020 and 2021 they spent a year and a half spending much much less than normal and that both gives you some extra money but also some people are taking their first vacation that they've taken in two and a half years I mean some people have been traveling for the last you know for a while now but some people it's their first one and so that both extra saving and pent up demand has meant the American consumer is just yeah sort of detached from from all of the swirl going around us so I mean we see these raid hikes from the Fed this week this effort to cool the economy down I fastened in our reading on a point that Derek Thompson made in the Atlantic about how to have unemployment so low and inflation so high that it's in the past when with that same dynamic has been in place it's been very hard to avoid a recession what do you make of the moves the Fed is making do you feel like this is kind of hopeless that we're staring into a recession the Fed doesn't have absolute control over anything they can control sort of balances of risks and right now they're taking steps that increase the risk of a recession in the next year they are not trying to you know minimize that chance they're increasing that risk they are also increasing the chances inflation comes down over the next year and it's the first time in decades really that they've been in that position where they are sort of willing to risk a recession now the rate hikes we've seen so far interest rates aren't that high at 1.5 to 1.75 they're expected to get somewhat high they're expected to rise to about four but even that isn't crazy high but it's just been this disc you know the sort of whiplash effect of going from zero forever to oh my god it might be you know two or even four numbers that used to be pretty normal but no one is used to anymore give the 32nd explanation for Gaffes listeners when the Fed raises interest rates how does that potentially choke off inflation and raise unemployment yeah when interest rates go up it makes it harder for people to get mortgages so they buy fewer houses and there's less construction jobs it makes it harder for businesses to borrow money to expand and so they hire fewer workers and all of that means less jobs than you'd otherwise have and less wage and price pressure than you'd otherwise have and you know listening to that explanation and that bear form that's not pretty but the reason they're doing it is they think the alternative is even less pretty it seems like the obvious political implications of this are very bad for the Biden administration and the Democrats is that your view or is there some other way of looking at it if you're asking me to use a crystal ball to look at the next five months that's really easy nothing is going to dramatically change in the economy in inflation and any of these dynamics people are going to go to the polls pretty grumpy this November if you're asking two years and five months from now I'd be pretty worried about the set of data but look Ronald Reagan had incredibly high inflation he had a really deep recession and by the time he was running for reelection the economy was roaring out of it and people thought it was morning in America so it's not too late or impossible for the recession to come almost sooner and becoming out of it by the time of the next election because I don't own any crypto and because I am old and mean I have been enjoying some of these stories about the contraction in the crypto economy about how like one crypto product went into a death spiral how the crypto bank Celsius is paralyzed and I know that I'm wrong to be gleeful about this but is the crypto economy useful or good and what should we make of the kind of convulsion in it right now look David my my thinking on this isn't that different from yours I try to be nuanced balanced and fair on most economic topics I find that absolutely impossible to do on crypto and if you wanted to rationalize your horrible horrible feelings you're actually a really good person to you know the alternative was crypto went up to 30 trillion dollars and then back to one and a half trillion so people saved 28 trillion dollars of losses they would have had if this bubble got much much worse before it popped but explain it why well why why are you you're like a world-class economist why why are you just spending vindictive exactly great no I mean there actually is some truth to that I mean part of you know when stocks go down they you know that in the middle of a bubble the bubble could have gotten worse and the crash could have been even larger the thing about crypto is it doesn't really have any use it's just an asset class it's not really a way to pay for things or to store value and all that and as an asset class it has some really bad properties which is that its inherent value is zero because there's an unlimited supply of it you know not unlimited supply of Bitcoin there's some algorithm that limits that but not a limited supply of cryptocurrencies because you could always invent new ones and so in some sense you know it's an asset whose fundamental value is zero and whose side effects are quite bad and you know I'm glad we're seeing a reckoning I wish it had happened sooner but it's better than it happening later how much murkier is the current economic moment than the normal murkiness that pollinate policymakers have to deal with all the time in in thinking about how things are gonna work and is that does that murkiness affect the way or the humility we should have about policy and policy outcomes it's much murkier you know we tend to treat Bernanke and the financial crisis Powell and the covid crisis as enormous heroes a lot of that's justified they did great things to get us out of those crises but in some ways it's easy when you know that you just need to put the pedal to the metal and you need to be creative about like what exactly that means because it's not just as simple as pressing one pedal but like you just pushing everything in one direction now you'd have these cross currents you're trying to balance these cross currents are just enormous inflation the highest in 40 years consumers the most pessimistic in 60 years it's just a much harder job now than it was for Bernanke in the crisis or Powell in the crisis Jason Furman is professor of economics at Harvard Jason thanks for joining us thank you it's a big day here in Gabland because there is a new Emily Bezlon opus long in gestation about one of the most contentious issues on the planet her New York Times magazine article the battle over gender therapy more teenagers than ever seeking transitions but the medical community that treats them is deeply divided about why and what to do to help them oh boy Emily this is a complicated issue it does not lend itself to tweets so I hope you're not tweeting at least not much so it seems that lots of children at different ages are expressing the belief or knowledge that they are not the gender they've been assigned and more more of this is happening in the US than has happened ever before what is happening when those children start to express that well it depends a lot what age they are and what kind of history they have but you know in general in the United States right now major medical organization support it's called gender affirming care and one thing that was interesting about this piece was just trying to come up with a quick description or definition of what that is I actually think it's kind of impossible but at base it's the idea that you're supporting kids when they come out as transgender or non-binary or another gender identity and that you're trying to embrace them and then the question becomes what follows from that so for younger children at this point there's pretty much a consensus that if they express an interest in changing their name pronouns in addition to you know changing the way that they dress or have their haircut that you support that that's called social transition and the much thornier questions arise for teenagers when these questions come up about whether you should suppress puberty as a way of you know allowing them not to go through developmental changes that they may really not want and then later on but also for teenagers whether they should take gender affirming hormone treatments that change their secondary sex characteristics so the kind of spine of my piece is a new set of recommendations that are coming out soon from the World Professional Association for Transgender Health it's called W Path for short it's been existence since 1979 and it's become an organization that has loss of transgender and non-binary people in leadership roles and helping to write these new guidelines and at the same time the drafting process for this adolescent chapter the separate chapter about teenagers was really hard because the people writing it they're all gender affirming providers they included transgender psychologist and they're confronting these questions about why the population of teenagers is rising and whether when to say that medical treatments are appropriate what kind of guardrails to set in place for kids and families and these are just really tricky questions there's some evidence that the authors of the chapter relied on but then there's also just some unknowns and that's really the the extremely difficult topic I was trying to write about because unless you can figure out what the why is you can't figure out how to provide the necessary gender affirming care at the right time and in the right amplitude and history is a little confused right because the the kinds of people who are feeling like they aren't the gender they were assigned at birth is different from that in the past right yeah so you know when you look at and talk about transgender adults it's really important to recognize that the benefits of being able to medically transition are very well established and the rates of regret are very low and so what we know from that historical population is these are people who really really often had to struggle a great deal to get the kinds of medical interventions they wanted and they thrive this is like something there's lots of evidence for when you have a big rise specific to the adolescent population and you're not totally sure exactly why that's all happening you might wonder whether those teenagers are the same as the adults from the past and I that's like one of the really hard questions here so we know that visibility among four transgender people you know in culture and popular media has risen a lot and that is certainly one reason why we're seeing this rise and it's super liberating for a lot of kids and teenagers and they're also being playful and creative and just freer about gender expression that I think our generation and previous ones have been but the authors of this adolescent chapter for WPath were also mentioning and and I think acknowledging that there's a potential role here for social influence and what they mean by that is you know peer-to-peer internet and then that raises a question for a lot of kids again those can be really valuable ways of learning about a different way of being in the world and then there are some kids and I talked to some of them for whom you know they're kind of on a quest and it's not clear that in the long run this is going to be the answer for them and that's totally fine but it does make complicate more complicated these questions of medical interventions. So Emily you're writing this piece and again I would advise you not to look on Twitter but it's at a time when there's this enormous right-wing assault over almost all services to transgender people and especially to transgender children and and of course most grotesquely this this push to criminalize some of the treatment of children and put child welfare investigators on the path of parents who are allowing therapy for their children and so there is this notion that how can you question the treatment of children at a moment when these malevolent bailfull forces are trying to criminalize what children are expressing. It feels like some of the doctors and psychologists who you're writing about who are seeking the well-being of children but who maybe are more they're more cautious about therapy are being lumped in with these conservative attacks on trans people. Yeah it's super unfortunate I mean when people are trying to ban care how do you talk about improving it right because for the people writing this chapter these psychologists psychiatrists medical doctors to acknowledge any kind of weakness or uncertainty and the evidence is to kind of open up the door to this right-wing assault on the very care they provide and that is a real conundrum for them it was also something I thought a lot about as a journalist but I am a journalist in the end that is my job this is a hugely newsworthy story I had exclusive access to the final version of these standards of care coming out from Wpath in a lot of ways that drove the timing of the story. So what I did was to try to weave in the political backdrop mostly from the point of view of the people writing the chapter so that you could see the kind of pressure that was exerting on them and how hard it is to do science when you're in this incredibly hostile political environment so one of the psychiatrists in my piece Scott Libowitz he works in Ohio and on the one hand he's writing this chapter and trying to sound certain notes of caution especially about having a kind of comprehensive diagnostic assessment before medical intervention and he's getting a fair amount of you know flak the whole chapter is from some other gender affirming providers and activists and yet at the same time there's a bill to ban what he does in Ohio and he is personally being absolutely pilloried in front of the Ohio legislature and that's just a really hard position to be in. Emily can you give us a sense of some of the tensions involved so for example one thing that came through clearly and was it was helpful in your piece was that for those who don't believe that they they were assigned with the correct gender at birth their body as it develops becomes you know a constant reminder of their uncomfortableness and so there's a reason to have interventions because of the psychological damage of growing older and that that's the reason to move quickly on some people and yet on the other hand you're talking about medical in some cases choices that that have their own lasting effects that you don't want to rush into so it's so I guess if you could just kind of tee up the tension that people in of good faith forget the political conflict for a moment the people of good faith the tension they're trying to work out in this. Yeah I mean I talked to lots of parents and lots of teenagers and you know from the teenagers point of view some of them embrace caution like they want to make sure themselves they both were very aware of the physical changes they were undergoing but also had some sense that like yeah I want to make sure that I really want this and I want to trust my parents and the therapist I'm talking to to help me through that process and like you know it's sort of the nature of adolescence to be super impatient and I heard a lot of that but I also heard some kids who really were able to think through the long-term consequences and wanting to make sure to trust their own decision-making. I think for parents you know you they have to consent to treatments for kids who are under the age of 18 and mostly they were trying to kind of pick their way through a landscape where it was pretty difficult to figure out what kind of gender affirming provider was what and whether they would find themselves with a therapist who would you know expect them to immediately embrace not just a child coming out as trans but every medical intervention the child might want or whether there was a sense of like okay let's take a moment here let's like process this all together. I talked to one super wise transgender herself therapist in Texas who said that when a kid in a family comes out as trans it's actually going to be a transition and a big event for everybody in the family and it's really important to remember that and that's unfortunately a quote that didn't make it into my piece I interviewed way too many people but that really stuck with me this idea that your family is part of what's happening and we have really well established research that for LGBT kids the most important thing is family support that that is just like hugely protective for them for all kinds of otherwise you know outcomes that they are at higher risk for so I think there's just a lot of still to be worked out about how to make sure that you know kids are being listened to are being embraced or being told that their love no matter what and and that there's like this path for more kids which has really been important and beneficial and at the same time that there's also way to acknowledge that parents who have questions and hesitations are not necessarily being bigoted or transphobic they're just like trying to figure stuff out. Emily I just super admire you I know you've been working on this piece for a long time and just been just thinking so hard about it and working so hard about it and you've talked to every single person in the world apparently 14 times to do it so congratulations people should check out Emily's story in the New York Times magazine it's already out online the battle over gender therapy as I was reading it I was in awe of the amount of work and the care at every turn it's really really amazing thank you guys I really appreciate it. Let's go to cocktail chatter when you John Dickerson are having a post January 6th Commission cocktail with Ann Dickerson in Washington DC without me what are you gonna be chattering to Ann Dickerson and not to me about. So there's a lot of news going on so we might have missed that the FDA advisory committee unanimously recommended that at least two Moderna and Pfizer vaccines for COVID are now available for those under five which is the last age group or the last cohort that didn't yet have access to vaccination so it may be possible by the time you read this but certainly probably next week that the rollout could start to vaccinate kids under five which I was walking by a playground the other day here in Washington and all the kids were outside in the playground going over the jungle gyms and all of them were masked so presumably in a couple of weeks that would no longer be the case. Emily what's your chatter? I was really interested this week in a piece I read in the nation by Joan Walsh called the backlash against sex ed and it's about I mean I've gotten totally interested in sex education which I think is really changing a lot and you know there are these challenges to it and Joan is writing about people on the right who are trying to take their kids out of sex ed programs she starts off in Massachusetts and then moves on to Florida and it's just really I think this issue it just feels like it is so ripe for conflict to me and I thought she did a really interesting job of trying to understand where conservatives are coming from on it. My chatter to a little two-fold chatter one just a note to Gav Fest listeners I do this tour of a secret civil war fort hidden deep in Rock Creek Park on Airbnb it's I do it through Airbnb and it's been sold out for months and months and months but I just added a few dates and often I'll most the people who go on this tour are Gav Fest listeners if you've wanted to come explore the secret fort with me in Rock Creek Park I do it on weekends I added a couple of summer dates and I think a couple of fall dates so you could look for exploring a secret fort on Airbnb or you can email me at David plots at gmail.com and I will send you a link to it.
