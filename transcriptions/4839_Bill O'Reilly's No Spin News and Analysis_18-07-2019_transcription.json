    "text": " Bill O'Reilly here Thursday, July 18th, 2019. You are listening to the O'Reilly update. Here's what's happening across our nation. House Democrats voted to delay impeachment. A Republican businesswoman kicks off her campaign to challenge Ocasio-Cortez in 2020. Los Angeles to pay former female convicts millions of dollars for invasive strip searches. Drugs pouring across the border as agents shift their focus to migrants, former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick up for an Emmy award. Also coming up my message of the day is President Trump winning the fight against radicalism. But first, Democrats in the house voting to delay Congressman Al Green's latest push to introduce articles of impeachment against President Trump. The vote 332 to 95 to table the legislation. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi happy arguing impeachment would jeopardize swing state Democrats heading into the 2020 election. New York businesswoman Shuri Murray launching her campaign to replace Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in 2020. The Jamaican-born Republican saying, quote, there's a crisis in Queens and it's called AOC, unquote Murray posting her introductory video on social media promising to build bridges, not burn them Los Angeles County paying a whopping $53 million to form of female inmates after court rule the sheriff's department caused trauma and humiliation during strip searches at county jails. The class action lawsuit includes thousands of women claiming the exams occurred at night in an unlit bus depot. LA officials say they've since changed their procedures but far too late for the county's pocketbook. The escalating border crisis forcing federal agencies shift focus to migrants in recent weeks closing seven highway checkpoints in New Mexico that typically sees tens of millions of dollars in drugs every year. Border Patrol agents confirming the stations have failed to make a single arrest since March 25th with resources directed towards migrant foot traffic instead of drug smuggling. Former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick back in the news earning an Emmy award nomination for his Nike ad. The advertisement titled Dream Crazy shows the radical athlete telling young Americans to believe in something even if it means sacrificing everything. Coming next, the message of the day is President Trump winning his fight against radicalism right back with it. Well, you've been hearing about gold all over the news and prices keep going up.

Please call today. Time now for the O'Reilly update message of the day. President Trump hammered Congress women Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, Talib and Presley last night in a North Carolina rally. Mr. Trump saying on national television, the women hate America and they might consider leaving the country. As you know, the left and most of the press has branded the president racist for taking on the women, but Mr. Trump sees his campaign as a political winner and it looks like he might be right. In the 2020 election, Donald Trump is not only running against a Democrat for president, he's running against a system. Donald Trump believes that radical left people within the Democratic Party have alienated most of the country. Thus, he is spotlighting the four most egregious Congress women and labeling them a danger to society. The press, of course, is on the side of the radical left. They despise in general Donald Trump, want him out of office. So the reportage this week after Mr. Trump's tweets that the four ladies should go back to wherever they came from, ancestrally or in the case of Omar Somalia, the press said, hey, that's a racist play. And of course, the far left concurred. But it was a political play as we analyzed earlier this week. Mr. Trump calculating that most of the country despises the opinion that America is a bad country. Mr. Trump was right in his initial campaign in 2016 when he demonized the swamp, when he took on establishment politicians like Jeb Bush and believe that Americans would walk away from those men because they had delivered so little. President Trump ran against 17 Republicans, branding them establishment creatures. While he was the outsider, the avenger who would come in and clean everything up. Well, some of that has not happened. Certainly, Donald Trump has passed tax reform. The economy is good. He has issues to run on. But it might not be enough because the national press despises him so much. So now using Congresswomen Ocasio-Cortez, Omar, to leave in Presley, Donald Trump is saying to America, hey, you might not like me that much, but do you really want them? Because most of the democratic candidates running for president are very sympathetic to the far left. This could be a big winner for President Trump. As I believe, the majority of Americans do not see their country as racist and oppressive and in general a terrible place. I believe most Americans think America is noble and they are horrified by the radicalism that has taken root within the Democratic Party. Now, the national press does not report that very much, preferring to ignore the excesses of the radical left. So President Trump is spotlighting it and it may lead to his reelection. That's a message. For more fact-based honest analysis, please visit billowriley.com. You'll like it. Coming next, something you might not know.

When it comes to food, Americans enjoy. The days of hamburgers and apple pie are largely over. In recent years, our tastes have been influenced by the increased availability of foods that were once exclusive to other countries. But that doesn't mean we still don't like our classics. Every year, the food delivery service Grub Hub compiles a list of the 10 most popular items for menus around the country and the results will probably surprise you. In 2018, healthy choices with rage, two of the most popular dishes in America were spins on all favorites, buffalo cauliflower and cauliflower rice bowls. What better way to enjoy a vegetable as healthy as cauliflower than dipping it in batter, frying it, then smothering it in a butter base buffalo sauce. Yum. But I confess I have never eaten this. According to Grub Hub, there is good news for cows. Americans appear to be avoiding red meat these days. Of the top 10 most ordered items, not one contains red meat, while half feature poultry, chicken sandwiches, Parmesan chicken, chicken burritos all ranked among the most popular, but not all of our favorite chicken dishes can be considered healthy. It's doubtful that chicken and waffle sliders are going to help you if you're looking to trim down. Despite the move toward healthy food, good old-fashioned American barbecue remains very popular. Babyback ribs ranked as the number four most ordered item in the USA, the only pork dish to make the list. The influence of Hawaii being felt on the mainland as poqu\u00e9 became the second most popular item on Grub Hub's list. That's typically raw fish, rice, and seaweed. I will confess again, I have never consumed poqu\u00e9. The humble bean burrito tops the list as the most frequently requested item of 2018, with orders of the Mexican classic growing by a whopping 276% from the previous year.
