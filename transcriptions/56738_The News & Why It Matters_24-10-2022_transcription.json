    "text": " Place Radio Network. And now, the news and why it matters. Today, Biden gives an interview to trans TikTok star Dylan Mulvaney. Nancy Pelosi says we need to change the subject from inflation and climate activists vandalize more artwork. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and today's episode is brought to you by Healthy Cell, which I just took earlier today because it is tis the season of flu and just general illness, which is why you need healthy cell. They've got a great multivitamin along with a bunch of other products. They taste great. My family loves them. You can go to healthycell.com slash news. Use code news for 20% off of your first order over at healthycell.com slash news. So I want to get to look, there's a lot of Biden clips that we have here, gentlemen, because it seems like every time Joe Biden opens his mouth, it is worth playing just for just like the sheer fact that you're like, how is he alive? How is he alive? How is he the president? I have some questions, but I want to start with yesterday at a forum for now this news, trans TikTok star, who we talked about earlier. This was last week. He was like, I'm visiting the White House. It's so cool. And I was wondering to myself, okay, so average Americans are dealing with inflation and just trying to put gas in their tanks, trying to make sure that they have food at their table for their families. And the White House is focused on making video, making content with trans TikTok stars. So remember that when you go to the polls. But Dylan Mulvaney asked Joe Biden if states should be able to ban gender affirming medical care, which of course we all know is the mutilation of children. And Biden of course said no. Watch. Do you think states should have a right to ban gender affirming health care? I don't think any state or any buddy should have a right to do that. As a moral question and as a legal question, I just think it's wrong. So I was actually, um, I was watching these clips before the show preparing and Joe Biden rubbed off on me so much that I forgot to introduce you guys. I'm joined by Yaku Buyan, who leads to be contributor and host of the bottom line, as well as Super Gear host of Stu Does America. You should be subscribed to both of their programs. This is, this is, I mean, this is a pretty big statement right there. No, states should not be allowed to set their own rules on whether or not doctors can mutilate children who, by the way, I don't know if you guys have seen all of these, this influx of all of these D transition or clips that are going on. But I mean, these are, are people, some of them are still minors, got this done to them. Well, they were 15, 16 years old, they're 17, 18, and they're like, in tears, I don't know how I can live the rest of my life like this because the medical community did this to me. I wasn't ready for it. They didn't talk me through it. They were not realistic in what actually happens. And now my life has been forever changed and I cannot go back. And Joe Biden says states should not be allowed to ban that. Look, I've said it before, you must change the language to change culture. So the question is not, Mr. President, should we perform double mastectomies on 12 year olds? It's should a state have the right to withhold health care? Such a broad, no, no state. No state should withhold health care. This is not health care. It's not like the 12 year old girl, all of a sudden has breast cancer. And she's now going through a double mastectomy, which is a last resort for breast cancer. Now this is an aesthetic issue to try and appease a mental condition, a psychological condition, that's now health care. It's not health care, number one. It's not health care. They're lying to Americans. They've got nothing to do with health care. And then secondly, how cavalier the president is to... Would you ever have imagined that this kind of an individual would get an interview with the President of the United States, any president of the United States, on an issue like this, when our country is falling apart by the seams, this is the issue that we need to take the president's time with. This is almost as bad as Obama not being in the White House shooting hoops when we're having real problems in our country. So it's not health care. It's got nothing to do with health care. You know, you raise a great point because that does seem to be what they do on a lot of issues, like reproductive health care. They want you to think that reproductive health care is the killing of your own child, which is not actually the point of reproduction. So... Really? Are you confirming this? I have. Several times, actually. No, I just did it. Wow. That's interesting. I'm fascinated by this in watching it. You go back to Roe vs. Wade for a second. Roe vs. Wade was the fundamental right that they created thin air for women. Constitutional right. Constitutional right created completely out of thin air for women to have an abortion. But even with that, in the most extreme circumstances, there was always restrictions built into that. I mean, the second and third trimesters, they were allowed to be restrictions on it, then it changed in Casey to post viability. But still, there was always a way to restrict this. He wants a standard far more extreme than anything ever presented in the abortion debate to apply to minors getting these dangerous surgeries and all sorts of hormones and all of these other treatments, quote unquote. You're right. It's not health care. It's obviously not health care. But people like health care. Health care, health care is a term that tests very well with audiences. Everyone wants health care. So they make it out to seem that way. If they actually believed what is going on was acceptable and positive and necessary, they would just say it. They wouldn't need to change the language. They wouldn't need to call it health care. They wouldn't need to have it presented like this. They wouldn't need to silence everyone who opposed it. They just win the argument on its facts. They can't do that. So they're trying this alternate approach, which for idiots like our president works. Yeah. Can I say one thing, Sarah? Where's the medical oath? Right. Now, as a doctor, you are to disclose all potential complications to your patient, both in medicine but definitely in surgery. You want to tell me they take the 12 year old and sit her down and say, here's what's going to happen. Here's the 400 cases of where kids wanted to reverse this by the time they were 18 and we're going to lay that all out for you. No, they co-hurls this child through some social movement. The medical oath is being violated by every single doctor that's performing these surgeries. 100%. You can't take Cialis without watching a commercial where they tell you, you may die. You may get cancer. Your tongue may fall out of your mouth. You may get herpes and you know, whatever, right? They got to disclose it all. But to a child, they can perform a double mastectomy, right? And not disclose the potential complications. There's a medical oath here. These doctors should get sued every single one of them. I think that's how this ends. Yeah, I agree. Well, in the UK, it is already happening. There's a lawsuit that's been filed against their biggest gender surgery clinic in the UK, to my knowledge, and a bunch of parents and patients and all of them have already filed a lawsuit. So I really do think that that is the end result. It has to be. Well, some people who get this done, obviously, we've seen examples of people who don't feel the regret that so many of them do, but statistically, they're much more likely to feel the regret than not. And what we wind up finding out is, I think, eventually, you have a big class action soon. You have people who went through this without getting the information you're talking about, Yago, and say, look, this is crazy. I'm suing. They will eventually, hopefully, win that case. And then it will scare enough people away from the way they're doing business now. I think the only way this is going to stop. I don't think it's going to stop by our government passing laws. I just think that, eventually, people are going to be able to have to stand up and say, people who went through it. Unfortunately, we're going to have to have that damage to make it stop for the rest of us. People are going to have to show harm. And there's so many that have already talked about it. It's just a matter of, I think, formalizing that. Yeah. So I want to play another clip from this interview. Can you just go control room? Can you just go to that? I just want to look at that image that's on here. How embarrassing is it that this is the United States of America and we're actually, I mean, this is who the President is giving interviews to. A man dressed up as a woman. It's just so perplexing. How did we get here? And how do we claw ourselves out of it? So Dylan Mulvaney was asking Joe Biden what politicians can do to advocate for trans people, which I feel like is weird because I feel like if you're the trans person, you're supposed to be the one who's telling the politician how to advocate for them, not asking the politician how to best do it. But Joe Biden's like, oh, we just do more of us need to be around more transgender people just like you watch. It feels like Republicans have turned trans and non-binary people into this thing to blame society's downfall on in some ways. And this narrative is not only dangerous to our mental health, but also our physical safety. And particularly trans women of color are being murdered at an alarming rate. More than any other group of people at this point. Thank you. How can democratic leaders be more effective in advocating for us trans people and our families and our lives and our opportunities? I'm not being facetious when I say this, being seen with people like you. I mean it. I genuinely mean it. It's not a joke. People fear what they don't know. They fear what they don't know. And when people realize, individuals realize, oh, this is what they're telling me to be frightened of. This is the problem. This is, I mean, people change their minds. People are just don't know enough to know. And it's not because of- They don't know. They're just lack of exposure. And I think that it's really important that we continue to speak out about basic fundamental rights of all human beings. And the idea, the idea that was going on, you know, still going. In some states, I won't get into the politics of it, but in some states it's just, it's outrageous. And I think it's immoral. Yeah, the job is used for immoral. It's not immoral. But they're trying to do the trans persons- How is this going on? I don't understand how this clip is going on. We could have just like bailed and the rest of the program is just Joe Biden mumbling on and on and on about this. Oh, that was three episodes worth of him talking. Is it still the same as hell? So, okay, so he's saying we should need to be more exposed to people like Dylan. And then we'll be like, oh, this is totally cool. So I want to, if I may, I'd like to expose you a little bit more to people like Dylan. Okay, Stu has already hates this. So, what are you doing? Listen, so I want to get some perspective. Earlier this year, he said, this guy said we need to normalize women having bulges. Yeah, watch this one, not with children in the room. I was walking around and everyone was staring and I was like, oh, okay, what's going on? And they were all staring directly at my crotch. And I went, oh, I forgot that my crotch doesn't look like other women's crotches sometimes because mine doesn't look like a little Barbie pocket. And I thought, okay, Dylan, talk about this. Number one, you can stop wearing clothes that fit like this and just find looser fitting items. Number two, I can do a tuck, which is going to have to be a whole other video, but it's very painful and involved. Yeah, that's why your voice is so hot. Number three, I just normalize it and I wear clothes like this and we all just normalize women having bulges sometimes. Because we're coming up on bikini season, baby, and you might see a bulger too. No, please God, no. I don't want to see a bulger. Dude, you got a set of tools. You got a man up. You know, here's my thing. Here's my thing. Go cut it off, dude. Commit to the bit. Come on, where's your commitment? Where's your commitment? You're not, you're a flake. You're looking for attention. This is a broken human being that needs serious help. Serious help, okay? It's as sad watching this person who has completely lost identity as it is to watch the president that doesn't know he's on planet Earth, right? Go cut it off. I very nicely put, Yakka. I think there is something about that though, where like, alright, you went through that much. I go, alright, you know, like, okay. You know, if you're going through that much trouble, I kind of feel like, okay, you've really committed to this and we'll give you that. Obviously, not an option for minors, as I know you would agree, Yakka and Sarah as well. Not something, but if you're an adult, you're a minor. If you're an adult, you want to go do that on your own? Like, alright, that's your thing. I don't know. I would not advise it. I doubt it's pleasant, but go ahead. Give it a whirl. I don't know much about this person other than what I've seen over the past like, week or, it seems like this person has become suddenly famous over the past two weeks. Yeah, well, it's TikTok famous. TikTok famous for a while. Right, okay. But like, isn't one of the shticks? This is day 85 as a girl or whatever, right? Like, isn't that the thing? Yeah. So like, it's this seemingly brand new to even Dylan Mulvaney, right? Yeah. And like, the amount of like, judgment on others on how they're treating this, when it's brand new to even him. Like, it's not even like, it's so bizarre. And I also will point out, I find this portrayal of a woman to be a little insulting to women. Massively insult. Like Barbie pocket? Right. Barbie pocket, dude. It's almost like more like his impression of like a 14 year old girl. Like, it's almost valley girl-ish. You want to go back a few decades. It's like, it's not like, it's a bad impression of what he thinks, I guess a woman is like, which should be incredibly insulting to women. Yes. I think it is probably too many. Well, that's why Ulta had the backlash that they had whenever they put him on their podcast talking about, I want to be a mom someday. Like, no, you can't be a mom. You don't have the parts required. Yeah. Ever. Ever. You cannot be a mom. And quite frankly, I don't even think you should be around children. Are you kidding me? I fight human trafficking for a living. That's the last individual. You want 4,000 miles from a minor. What was his, his question to the president? Why would they block the healthcare to do what? To cut off the body parts of who? Miners. Yet, he keeps his tools. Yeah. He's got to advocate for cutting the body parts off of minors, but him the adult, now he's going to bulge around. Yeah. That's right. You get to normalize it. Yeah. I think that's the main thing. Commit to the bit. You know, because it just does feel like at this point, I mean, this, he was an actor, right? Like he was, I think he was. He's acting now. I think he was an actor. That's what I mean. I think this is just another, it seems like it's just another role that he's found to be very, very famous, apparently. You know, lots of views on TikTok. And I guess that's, I guess that's worth something. I love the fact that we have working together the extremist trans community and the Chinese Communist Party coming together for an interview inside the White House. What a wonderful time we've been invited. We've been invited. Yes. It's happened. Official. I want to add one more story here before we have to go to break. The Cherokee County Board of Education in North Carolina voted to forfeit all games against Highlands High School over safety concerns after a trans player on the Highlands team injured. Another player's head and neck with a spike to the face. Oh my God. Yeah, the ball was allegedly traveling at 70 miles per hour when it struck the girl's face and ricocheted off her face back through the net. She was unable to get up and walk on her own for about one minute after being struck and is now experiencing concussion like symptoms and ongoing vision problems. She has not yet been cleared to play. But don't worry. We're all the same. There's no differences between men and women. All right. We've got more to come.

So during that same now this forum, Joe Biden claimed that his student loan forgiveness package passed by a voter to is what he said, which is very peculiar because he was a student loaned person. It's very peculiar because they don't recall Congress actually ever voting on it at all. Watch. Secondly, if you don't have one of those loans, you just get 10,000 written off. It's passed. I got it passed by a voter to. Who is voting? Who is voting? Who is he talking about? A vote or two? He means Jill in Hunter. He said voter going. Look, I think some of his defenders would say, oh, it's just the slip of the tongue. It's really not the slip. The earlier the same clips calls it a law. Yes, that's what I'm saying. He really does. He clearly is saying that this was passed even though this was an executive order that it's just a signature. But Sarah, is that what they're telling him though? Are they telling him, Joe? That's it passed. I don't know. I think it's funny. I had the same thought. I think it's what they're telling him because there's three ways three things could have happened here. Number one, he's just blatantly lying to win votes for an election. Number two, he is in a situation where he forgot. He's just cognitively dead. A sign bill law that doesn't know he's making it up. He has no idea. But I think three is the scariest one and the one you just mentioned, which is what if his aides told him the law actually passed? What if they said, hey, we got all the votes there, Joe? We got a good shot. Sign the bill. Sign the bill. Is it pop? Yes. It is seriously pop. Now, look, the absolute best case scenario here is he's just blatantly lying to win votes. He's a terrible human being, an awful politician and being what we expect out of him as a politician is particularly a Democrat in what we're watching in D.C. The other two are really scary. Like our country is on the edge of the abyss. If we have a situation where like, you know, Susan Rice is just coming up, hey, Joe, we got that whole bill passed on the college jet thing. What a wonder. Those Republicans will probably try to stop it in the court. But just sign it. Don't worry. It's great. I think that's legitimately possible. I think that's what's happening here. So as we're trying to navigate this and figure out which option it is, I'd like to play for context. Okay. A couple more interviews here. So during an MSNBC interview over the weekend, Joe Biden made this really weird comment about how he's like, yeah, I mean, I could drop dead tomorrow when answering the question on his mental agility. And it just, look, he goes for probably two minutes longer than he should because after he starts, you know the people on his comms team are like, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Okay. Very wet. Very wet. I think it's a legitimate thing to be concerned about anyone's age, including mine. I think it's a lot of legitimate. Okay. But I think the best way to make the judgment is to, you know, watch me. You know, am I slowing up and I don't have the same pace in her? You can yell. And that old joke, you know, everybody talks about the, you know, the new 70s, 50s, all that stuff. You know, I, you know, it could be, I'm a great respecter of faith. I could get a disease tomorrow. I could, you know, drop dead tomorrow. I think people should look and say, is it, they still have the same passion for what he's doing? And if they think I do, I can do it, then that's, they don't, then they should vote against me. Not a bad situation. You will encourage me not to go. Hey, could you not to go there? That's not how I feel. I can't even say the age that we've been. What? It's about the sniff you, buddy. He's about to sniff you. Talking. What happened at the end there? We see that just punch him? Look at that. How's he doing? Oh, he's coming in close for a sniff. He's just, he's emulating, he's former, president. Look how comfortable he is. Look how uncomfortable he is. That's like a fake smile. What are you doing, Mr. President? Please stop touching me. There's something where that's happened with him over the past couple months that I've noticed where, remember when he was running for president and he had all those women come out and say he's made me feel uncomfortable, he sniffed my hair, he's kissed my neck, all those weird things. Remember all that? Touching the kids. And of course, because he's a Democrat, he was able to say, look, I'm just old. And I just say, you know, these fancy traditions of yours, I just don't understand how we don't just, you know, molest each other. I thought that's what we did. That's how we did it back in nature. Did you still run their knees up my hairy legs? A hairy legs, right? That's what I'm used to. So I've been doing it to everyone else. But now I understand, you know, I got it, I got the message, my traditions don't line up with yours and I'm going to be much more careful. And like for a while, it seemed like he was actually sticking to that and in the past couple of weeks, maybe the last couple of months, it's really seemed to have changed. It's like every interaction. Yeah, he's got his hands all over people again. He's running really close. He's over again, little girl's shoulders and peering in closely and sniffing them or whatever he's doing. It's really disconcerting. It makes obviously this reporter feel incredibly uncomfortable. You can see it in his eyes. But it's still one thing that really bothers me is at one point when he says the thing that you pointed like, what? He goes, you know, the old line of the 70s, 50s, 70s, you know, and the reporter. I know. Nots. He lets it out of it. Yeah. I know, that old joke. That old joke. That old joke. He doesn't know the old joke. It's not because he's so uncomfortable and also wants to help, right? But that's got to stop. We need to step back and somebody's going, hold on, Joe. You just said, do I know the joke about the 70s and 50s? I don't know. What is it? I don't know. What is it? Yeah. Call him out on this stuff. Make him actually produce the thoughts from his head through his mouth so others can consume them. Yeah. Because they won't do it though. They really won't. You see this over and over again. They just will give him these outs all the time. He's constantly screwing up in front of other reporters and they just let him go as if it's no big deal. That has to end. So, okay. Case in point here. And also on this MSNBC interview, Joe Biden at a different point, completely, completely zoned. I don't know if he's falling asleep. I don't know if he's short-circuiting. I don't know what's going on here, but none of it is good watch. I have not made that formal decision, but it's my intention. My intention to run again. And we have time to make that decision. Dr. Biden is for it. Mr. President. Oh. Dr. Biden thinks that my wife thinks that that we're doing something very important. Hello? Anyone home? Hello? I genuinely don't think he knew who Dr. Biden was. I don't. I think it's like Dr. Biden. Which one of my doctors? Oh, my wife. Which one of my doctors that give me juice every morning? Yeah. I'm busy referring to. Did you hear the reporter actually address him? Mr. President. It's like, come back. Like what? Don't croak on my interview. It's not even, I'm laughing. It's not funny. No, it's, it's, it's terrible. It's not funny at all. This is the president. It's elderly abuse. It's, it's so bad. Oh my gosh. I would love to see the unedited footage of that. Because it's clear they, they switched camera shots at the most. Yeah. They're hiding in a way. Good, right? Now, I guess Glenn had a theory. I'm Glenn Beck, of course, from the Glenn Beck radio program today that, yeah, just in case, you know, he's not here today as he doesn't seem to show up to this show as much as he's supposed to. But it's interesting that like he, he mentioned something about this where I think they did edit this to make him look better. I mean, I think it's, it's not exactly clear. They switch camera shots right as he's saying, Mr. President. And like, I don't know, listening to it, it doesn't seem like he paused long enough to be like, Mr. President, are you okay? Right. It seemed like that must have been a much longer pause that they shortened. However, it's Glenn pointed out they could have added it out the entire exchange and they left it in. And his theory, which I think is interesting is while they don't want to look like they're on the other team, they don't want to look like they're the bad guys. They don't want to hurt the election chances. The midterms, they feel they have enough of a soul as an American to make sure people understand that something's going wrong. Something's going wrong. They want to leave it out there for people to read into this and say something isn't right here, guys. Because that is not, I mean, that's the type of interaction you have, sadly, with your relative at a nursing home. And you have to imagine these reporters as they are actually doing the interviews are so uncomfortable. Oh my gosh. In the moment you got to imagine. Yeah, I did their calls afterwards. Yeah, exactly. I just like, oh my, I saw it right in front of me. It was, it was horrifying. I mean, to your point, I have a belief. They have to leave some of it in because I have a belief they are going to sacrifice him, meaning they are going to declare him medically unfit midway through that latter part of 23 or early 24 when they're about to nominate March. They're running person who I believe is going to be Gavin Newsom or JB Pritzker now that I know new stuff. But they're the ones that's going to say, guys, he's just not medically fit. And if they completely clean the act up, right, and they edit it all out, right, and sanitize it and he looks tip-top shape, they won't be able to do that to break it slowly. I think there's something to that. I mean, I do think that, you know, I think Biden really does want to run again. I think this is a job. He's wanted his whole life. And it is at some level still his decision, though, if this election goes very poorly, particularly if this is a real wave type of election, which is only a couple of weeks away now, if it hits this party in the face as hard as it looks like it might hit them in the face, then I really do think he's in serious trouble as far as running again in 2024, meaning that the party will pressure him, will start leaking things against him, will ruin his presidency to get him out. And I think that will start really soon after the election because they're going to want that to take, they want him out and have a nice break before they have to really get into this mode. It's one joy by our moment and they break him. It's one joy by our Whoopi Goldberg, I think, is lost. Yeah, that type of stuff will start to happen. And he will have both the health excuse and my family, gosh, Hunter, he was sober for like nine straight days. And now it's breaking down again. I got to leave. He's invited me to some, you know, cocaine hooker party. It's not going well. I got to go collect on all the checks that he saved from me. Whatever they say. And then that will give him a way to get out. And then they can start to rehab his image afterward. Yeah, yeah, it'll be interesting to see what happens there. Can you imagine the joke by the presidential library? It's just like a walk in. It's just a maze. You don't find anything. You know, find anything. You keep falling down trap doors, bumped into walls. Not a joke. Not a joke. Not a joke. I'm serious. We've got to take a break. We'll be back. Not a joke. Not a joke. I'm serious. As an average American, probably thinking about inflation all the time, right? It hits every single part of your day every time you go to buy something, every time you go fill up your gas tank. But I just want you to know, your leaders are taking care of you because if Joe Biden, not making any sort of sense, was not enough, you also have Nancy Pelosi over the weekend who spoke to CBS News and said that, you know, we just have to change the subject on inflation watch. When I hear people talk about inflation as I heard him there, we have to change that subject. Inflation is a global phenomenon. The EU, the European Union, the UK, the British have higher inflation rate than we do here. It's not, the fight is not about inflation. It's about the cost of living. Oh my God. I'm going to flip this table. Inflation is a global phenomenon. It's not about inflation. It's about the cost of living. You're even hosting the show today. You're just cracking up the whole time. It shows that it's laughing. It's incredible. Everything's burning down behind me and I'm just going to laugh. It is the, this is fine cartoon. Yes. We are all the dogs sitting at the table and there's fire around us. This is fine, right? This is fine. It's like peaceful protest with the building on fire. Yes. Same mentality. The cost of living and inflation are very tight. They're very close. They're kind of related. Really? They may be cousins. They're kind of related. They are the, I mean she, they are the same thing and she would know, I'm sure her Jenny's ice cream is now $12 a pint. No, she gets that freeze too. She's never bought it. That's the problem. It shows up free. Change the subject. Look, yes, it's true. There is inflation in other parts of the world. What has occurred and why there's is slightly worse than ours is number one, they're very dependent on us. But number two, they've been doing your Nancy Pelosi crappy policies for longer. They have been printing money for even longer than we have. They have been financially irresponsible for even longer. The reason why we are the same as them this time is because we're doing the same things that they do. We are printing like they do. The reason why we are a global superpower and we're outperforming the rest of the world for every minute of every day of my entire life is because we weren't doing what they were doing. Now we are and now we're feeling the same pain that they are feeling. This isn't an endorsement of you here, Nancy. This is us all falling down on the job and deciding to adopt terrible European policies and then feeling the pain that is associated with them. It's not a good argument for your reelection as a house leader. I'll say that. Because as radical as this may sound, Barack Obama was not enough of a globalist when he was in the White House. Now we have embraced the global citizen. Now we're going to see those European policies, the same policies that saw London overrun, that saw all the radical things happen that's welcome in. As open as the border is, so open now is the house under this individual. Well, there was another point during, this was another interview. So another point during the day yesterday morning where I just want to point out Nancy Pelosi interviewed. This just shows you the difference in good lighting because before she looked somewhat normal in this interview, she looks, yeah, there's her during face the nation on CBS. This one she just looks like Skeletor. Same day, okay, same makeup, same weird bald spot on the top of her head. And she was asked by MSNBC why surveyed Americans say they trust Republicans more than Democrats. And Nancy said, I don't subscribe to that statement. Watch. Why don't the American people, according to the surveys, trust Democrats, but instead trust Republicans? Well, let me just say one of the, you talked about what you perceive to be a change in momentum. Let me just tell you what I have seen over this past month. I don't subscribe to what you said that they don't trust us. The fact is, is that in the last few weeks, the Republicans recognizing now that they have a problem in this election, and you all had been telling them they're going to win for like a year and a half, but they're seeing what's happening on the ground. So they have placed unlimited money, unlimited money into these races with unlimited fact, that's what this representing, what the reality is. And it takes its toll. There's just no question. That is, that's what it is. That's not very good analysis, Sarah. What's, what part of that? First of all, the Democrats are spending more money than the Republicans are. And that's forever, at all these big races, money is flowing. I mean, we have Mitch McConnell pulling money out of the Senate race in Arizona, where Hobbes on the gubernatorial side, Kelly on the Senate side, are getting tons and tons of money from Democrats outspending them in almost all of these close races. And I might live in a different world, but my impression of this world that we're in here is the one where the media has been very kind to Democrats and has not been telling them for a year and a half that they were going to win. In fact, I've been hearing nonstop Democratic momentum talk for the past six months. Ever since Dobbs, that's all we've heard. And I will end it with this, because I have a text here. I'd like to re-verbate them. This is from a source in Washington, DC. Literally, out of nowhere, I got this text the other day. Someone in Washington, DC, just saw Pelosi in person for the first time. She looks like she's melting. It's legitimately a text I got out of nowhere. Can you close this segment with a little Nancy for us? Can you give us a little Nancy? I can't! No, I couldn't do that. That yaku. I don't subscribe to what they're saying. I don't subscribe to that at all. They have unlimited facts. It's just a fact. You're way too good at that. Oh, it's so good. And you know what? We'll be back. Thank you. Goodbye. They're not going to come back if you keep talking like that. Today, the Just Stop Oil activist smashed pies in the face of King Charles Waxwork at the London Wax Museum. Here is some of that. Oh, no. Oh, no. She really got him. Oh, he got him. It hurts up the cake. It passes right inside. So, one might, if they didn't know any better, call this group uninformed because I feel like King Charles has previously supported putting masks on cows to reduce the guy's body. He's on your team. I'm not quite sure why you're targeting. He's been came for like a week. Can you give the guy some time? I'm sure I'll get insane enough for you in a couple of weeks. Give the guy a month or two. I want to also play yesterday a pair of German activists through mashed potatoes on Monet's piece Haystacks at the Barberini Museum in Pottsdam, the painting last sold for $110 million. Here is some of that. So mashed potatoes. Not sure why. Not sure why they continue doing this because it's all like there's protective glass. There goes the... Oh boy, there goes the glue. People are starving. People are freezing and people are dying. She says, we're in a climate catastrophe, which is why we took the mashed potatoes and we threw them. She didn't say that. I didn't translate that correctly. So the hands are glued now. For those of you who couldn't watch, hands are glued on the wall. Stu actually had some very insightful analysis on disgluing up the hands. This is what I cake from the store because I watched this and I don't want to be critical of these incredible activists. Really? Yeah, no, because I'm sure they're very smart. I thought all these things out. They keep saying people are freezing. I thought it was global warming. Why are people freezing? I thought it was... I thought we were all going to be too hot. But my main criticism of this entire protest is... If you're listening on podcasts, you have to understand how they do this. If you're going to glue your hand to a wall, you have to really think that out ahead of time. We saw these people glue their hand to the floor of the Porsche factory last week. Okay, your hands glued to the floor. When it's time to sleep, you could stretch out, your hands flat to the floor, no problem at all. These people, if you picture backing up to a wall and then crouching, then put your hand so the tips of your fingers are pointed to the ground and they glue their hand that way to the wall. There's never a comfortable moment after that. Does this actually go to your mind, Stu? I'm fascinated by this. If you're going to glue your hand to a wall, you have to start it in a really comfortable position. You can't have it like this, because if you're going to... You can't sit down, it'll be too high. Be up behind like this. If you're standing, it'll be too low. If you want to sleep, it's impossible. You'll be sleeping in your hand, it'll be all bent behind your back. This is terrible planning. These guys want to plan the entire global economy. They can't figure out how to properly glue their hands to a wall. It's a travesty. How do you want to train this? You know what you should do with Alex Thun? You should do a training video. I should. I should do a training video. How to glue your hand in the most comfortable position. And true, it's important. I'll do the video, how to rip a hand off the floor. Also going back to the Porsche story, you don't ask for the bowls to defecate in. You bring them. Yes. You think that they're going to give you a bowl to pee and poop in when you just came and caused all this destruction? No. You've got to think ahead and bring your own BYOB. Bring all the tools. Bring all the tools. Is that what those signs mean? I've been doing a bunch of restaurants. That's what they want us to do. That's disgusting. Yeah. No idea. BYOB meant that. That's... Wow. Bring your own bowl. I'm going to eat it home more often, I think. No, you're not. No, that's true. I'm not. No, it really is fascinating, though. This is how scared these people are, I think, because they've been indoctrinated into this idea that the world is going to end if we don't act now. And this is the result of that. This is only mildly more serious than my hand-gluing point. But Michael Schellenberger has talked about this extensively. And I think his stuff is really good on this. He wrote a book called Apocalypse Never. He's a former climate activist, a guy who looked at all this stuff, was on the side of the environmental system. He was one of them. Yeah, he's one of them. And wound up writing this book. He had a change over time. But what really inspired him to write that book, and it's a great book, it's one you should have in your library if you care about this stuff at all, is his... His daughter's friends. He noticed his daughter's friends who were legitimately terrified about their futures over this stuff. Of course, he's looked at all, but he knows. Even if you think it's a serious crisis, there is no reason to react that way. Greta Thunberg is insane. And we've scared an entire generation of children into this apocalyptic view that the world could end at any moment. And they're all going to die this terrible death. They're not going to be able to enjoy their lives because of these terrible things these evil people did generations ago when what they've done is create a civilization that is actually desirable to live in. Fossil fuels are what is most responsible for bringing us into modern society. All the things these annoying young people like, they young people of today, all the things they like with their ubers and their e-bays are all based on things like I don't know fossil fuels. It's all built on that. And it's the only reason any of the things that they say that they like exist. So this apocalyptic view that the world is on the verge of falling over the abyss at any time is not only wrong, it's also dangerous. It's ruining people's lives. Have you seen the social media posts coming around where you see Earth as a little blip in the cosmos? And then the caption is, yeah, right. You're causing global warming for all of us. Right, right, right. Okay. All right, we've got to take a quick break. We'll be right back. Do this thing. You did? New York City, always focusing on the important issues at hand, has renamed MonkeyPox due to its offensive connotations, the new health website of New York City Reads. Moving forward, the health department will refer to MonkeyPox as MPV. The previous name is inaccurate and stigmatizing label for a virus that is primarily affecting a community that has already suffered a long history of bigotry. Stigma is a shadow affliction that can follow viruses and drive people away from care, even when the illness itself is treatable. So make sure you don't say MPV when you're talking about MonkeyPox because it might be stigmatizing for these people who are participating in giant, wild, gay orgies and sharing sex toys and all of these things to be stigmatized. That might be true if it was called gay orgy pox. Right. It's called MonkeyPox. It's just stigmatizing monkeys. Right. It's really like it. So what we do now on the horizon is we just say, okay, MPV spreads with gay sex and then they're going to have to change MPV to, I don't know, CST or something else. That is a great point. Like, why? I honestly don't. How is that? We know, we've seen the statistics on the spread in the community that's been most affected by this. But what does that have to do with the name MonkeyPox? MonkeyPox is a- You've got to go back to the AIDS epidemic in the outbreak in Africa with the monkeys and the apes as a connotation there. They're separating from the apes. They're separating from the apes and the monkeys. I mean, this table is the type of table that would be blamed for increasing those connotations. I don't even know who they are. And that's a mention. When you just shorten something to three, everyone knows that KFC serves chicken. We still know. We still know what it is. That's my point. MPV. Alright, gentlemen, this is a fun one. Thanks for being here. We'll see you all tomorrow."
