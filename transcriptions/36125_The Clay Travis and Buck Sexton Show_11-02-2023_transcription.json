Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Second hour of Clay and Buck is underway right now my friends and we had talked a little bit at the top of the show about this. That in Oklahoma right now there is a bit of a kerfuffle. There is a protest that has been underway where they seized the state capital. And this is all because of a transgender law or transgender laws that have not been signed yet as I understand it. But there are issues issues around it. People are upset about it and we wanted to talk to you about what exactly is going on here. So it's called Senate bill 1-2-9 and well before actually before we get into. Exactly what's in all these bills Clay last we had checked in on this. They had stormed the storm the capital and there was a trans lives matter group. Trans lives matter which I had never heard of this before. I think it's interesting because blue lives matter got so much anger from the left. How dare you appropriate the oppression all lives matter got so much criticism. So but trans lives matter is apparently okay for the left which is so it's so interesting to see see how this how this goes. And they're there. Here we actually have some audio here they are chanting just in case you're wondering trans lives matter play it. Right. So that that's they're very clear about what they're there to do and who they are. So there are about a over a hundred of them from Oklahoma and Oklahomaans for equality and freedom. Fascinating the way they name these groups isn't it. They were outside the capital they made their way into the rotunda. The protesters were calling on lawmakers to vote against variety of bills that would have prohibited gender reassignment surgery or hormone therapy for those under the age of 18 specifically the Senate bill one to nine which is being called the Milstone Act. That would ban treatment for people under 26 years of age by punishing the doctor. So effectively Clay if you're a doctor and you do a trans surgery for people under the age of 26. You can lose your license and even be criminally prosecuted. So there are a few different a few different bills that are all at issue here. Like I said there's the Milstone bill. There's also a bill the less restrictive House bill one oh one. Now that would stop doctors from giving a referral for puberty blockers cross sex hormones and gender reassignment surgery for anyone under 21 and then there's Senate bill two five two which would prohibit anyone under the age of 18 from receiving gender reassignment surgery. And then Senate bill two fifty would prohibit medical officials and entities from receiving reimbursement from Medicaid if they do gender transition services. So there's a whole variety of stopping gender transition surgeries within certain age ranges in Oklahoma. I think that I think the governor's there we're going to have them all next hour. I think that they should continue through with this. I think the notion that anybody under 18 should have any of this done is barbaric and crazy. Yeah. I think the under 18 is a really easy argument. I don't know what the law will ask the governor. I'm not sure what the law is on for instance tattoos in Oklahoma. But there are many different states out there where you cannot legally as a minor get a tattoo. And I think that's always good to focus on because let's take it outside the transgender issue for a moment. Why would you have that rule on tattoos for people under 18 because for everybody out there listening right now. If you allow to 14 or 15 year old to legally get a tattoo you might well end up with a tattoo that looks really ridiculous when you're 22 or 32. Like that doesn't seem crazy to me at all to believe that that is a law that makes total sense. That relatively speaking you may not like the barbed wire tattoo that your 16 year old got on his biceps. But by and large that isn't going to remember when the barbed wire tattoo. I was going to say has anyone gotten a barbed wire tattoo on a biceps since 1994 clay. All right. In 1994 that's my point. 1994 you got the barbed wire tattoo. You were a badass by 2004 you were like why did I ever think getting a barbed wire tattoo on my bicep was cool. Everybody's like why do you think you're an in sync. Yeah, that's true. And so people make bad decisions with tattoos. But in the grand scheme of things you can get a tattoo removal I think like all those things. If we're as a reason society out there of the opinion oh we got to keep tattoos away from kids under 18. We got to keep beer away from kids under 21. We got to keep rental cars which to me is still pretty crazy. A lot of you out there remember you couldn't rent a car in college. You got to keep a rental cars away from kids until they're like 25. How in the world does it make sense to allow someone to get their breast removed at 15. That's child abuse. Like I don't even understand how this is remotely controversial. And this is where this moved very quickly Buck from we're trans and we just want the right to live our lives as we are. To if you don't agree with the six year olds ability to choose their own gender. Then your barbaric transphobe I mean Buck I had a friend talked about this I think on the show before. And I bet there are people out there listening to us right now especially if you're in New York or LA or you're in a big city. A left wing location. There are regular emails that go out where they say hey so and so is six years old and she now identifies as a boy or she doubt identifies as gender non binary and so we're going to take it seriously. And my wife we had this conversation and I think it's perfect for anybody out there as a parent. We don't let our six year olds choose what they eat because we don't think that they have the mental you know where with all because the six year old would say I want cake or I want ice cream for every meal. You say no you know if you're going to have a cookie you've got to eat your broccoli or whatever it is beforehand. That's what parenting is. Parenting now in some of these communities and in some of these schools and this is happening. Increasingly an elite high-end private schools is where this is taken off. You're going to treat a six year old like they could choose their gender. I mean this is this is madness. I also want everyone to know that while this is playing out in Oklahoma the issue of transgenderism for children for minors has for one exploded by the numbers. And anyone who is looking at the data honestly will say this is something that is more a fad than a scientific reality. That's just this is clear. There's there's a rapid onset gender dysphoria was the term coined by the Brown University study that looked at. Hey what happens when a seven year old says I think you know a seven year old boy says I think I'm a girl. Oh all the adults gather around they make a big deal with oh what can we do for you and what are the other seven year old sink who are you know maybe at a point where they're a little unsure of themselves. They're seven they're kids I don't know anything they go well if I say I'm a girl too that everyone's gonna oh what can we do to cater to you and make sure that you're happy and oh you're so brave you're so brave this is the stuff. And they can show this through the data that the chance of another kid in a class all of a sudden now I know the activists are you that's because they're just finally willing to speak out that they're not willing to speak out. They're willing to speak out that they're trans to the seven years old. They probably thought they were platypus the month before it's absurd. We all recognize this is absurd. The Biden White House meanwhile. You remember this is just back a few months ago this was about a year ago March of 2022. They put out the equality and visibility for transgender Americans statements specifically specifically singling out how we need to make sure that transgender kids children. Are a focus of this effort. And you know they're talking about reinforcing protection for transgender kids. And including this is the key part gender affirming care. So while you know the left wing activists and everything you can see that you're the crazy blue haired nose ring maniacs running around shrieking trans lives matter. You know they're doing that clay. Everybody's understand Biden White House is totally on board for this pushing this using federal power to try to advance this as well. This is not a minor thing. This is not a side effect. This is the main effort. Yeah. And I think it's also important to emphasize they chose this battle. So everybody's out there like why can't you just leave because that's the other argument they'll make. Why does this bother you so much? Why can't you just leave trans people alone alone? Well because we don't think that 14 year olds should get their breast removed. Like that's a surgery that we don't think should occur for minors. We don't think that 14 and 15 year olds and younger 12 year olds should be given puberty blockers which keep someone from going into puberty and have massive as you can well imagine. Developmental issues. In fact, Buck. There was even in the New York Times, a story recently where they said, Hey, if you take puberty blockers. The overall strength of your bones is brittle because puberty is when you get all of those extra hormones that help to strengthen your body and your bones. And if you get that delayed then in your twenties and thirties and certainly on for the rest of your life, you're more likely to have significant issues with your bones. That seems like a really big deal. So we're not choosing this battleground. They are. We're just trying to provide some sanity here. The lifestyle lives who won't buy apples unless they're organic because they're so concerned about pesticides, you know, won't put that in their bodies at Temple. They won't do that. But they think that puberty blockers for a 12 year old, you know, that's a great idea. That's gender. Just even the term it is Orwellian gender affirming care. Notice they have gone from gender transition. It used to be called gender transition surgery because you were trying to change from something. Now what they say is it's affirmation. Affirmation implies you already are this. We're just making it more clear that that's what you really are. It is intentional. It is dishonest. It's odious. And another way that you can tell this argument clay is made in bad faith. These protesters, for example, the ones in Oklahoma, they're referring to these legislative acts as genocide. That is a quote genocide because of all the trans youth that they claim, whom they claim will commit suicide unless doctors will cut off their breasts at 15 and give them puberty blockers at 12. They're going to commit to you are literally killing kids. They say unless you let us chop off their genitals. This is how insane the left has become. Just for everybody out there listening, how many huge percentages I would bet of listeners have been tomboys themselves. Remember when that was a phrase? You know, like you'd have a seven or eight year old girl, maybe, I don't know, 12, 13 year old girl before puberty running around thinking and feeling like she had a lot of boy characteristics. And how many of those girls as they age become women and are very happy to be women. Now, how much different would that be if when we were all seven or eight years old, if instead of saying, oh, you know, she's just kind of going through a phase. Let's let her develop, you know, and she'll decide what she wants to do. She gets older. What if we had said, oh, yeah, you're a boy. Let's stop puberty from happening. Let's totally change your gender. Let's keep, let's have a surgery to remove your breast. Which of those feels like a healthier way to treat seven or eight year old kids? Say, hey, you know, you're probably going to work through it. It's a phase you're going through. You'll be fine. And by the way, if you don't, when you become 22, you have the right to change your gender. Almost all of those girls out there, almost every single girl who had tomboy characteristics. A lot of you I bet are listening to us right now. Your kids or your grandkids. Maybe it was you. You grew up your girls. You're totally happy. And how much different would that be if everybody gathers around to Buck's point and says, oh, my goodness, you must be a boy in a girl's body. Let's go ahead and get you treated for this. You never hear about the people and they exist and you've heard from them. They're interviews with them. The people that went through this and they realized they destroyed this. And they realized they've destroyed their lives. They'll never have children. They'll never be gender normal. They'll never have a normal love life. They'll never have an orgasm. They'll probably be in content that their bones will break. What about the suicides of those people? Oh, no, you can't talk about that. Just even the mental health of those people. What they're doing is monstrous. This is when they do this to children, it is monstrous and everybody should understand that. Imagine waking up tomorrow to text messages and emails from your bank and credit card companies, letting you know, guess what? Your bank accounts empty. Your credit card's been maxed out.

Fraudulent credit card charges make take days to resolve, whereas someone taking out loans or applying for jobs or apartments in your name could take weeks or months.

She says, listen, giving a speech that even if it's 40 million people watch it, which is less than the Super Bowl, but still that's a huge number of people. That's a big opportunity for any president. It's the biggest speech of the year any president gives. But what he needs to do is tell a story. Joe Biden is an amazing storyteller. I mean, you sit in the Oval Office and you can story tell for six hours. He needs to do that in the speech tonight. People aren't sitting at home and just like writing down data points, right? They support people. They feel something from. So he needs to tell the story. An amazing story. I mean, he tells a lot of lies, Buck. They also are claiming, did you see this story that Joe Biden wrote the entire speech by himself? There is a super. I really want Biden to do to do a sequel to the to the corn pop story. Remember that? Oh, maybe that could be the theme of the entire entire state of the union. He and corn pops it down and have a good discussion. I want I want Biden to tell some of the old, the old classic Biden stories where even the staunchest Democrats look at them like, what is this crazy old man saying? But he had Harry, he's going to be all the other. They're wearing my hairy legs and the kids would feel the hair standing up on my legs. You guys all remember that that was that was bizarre at a level that I still can't begin to to fathom what he thought he was even talking about. But you know, he's president somehow. What would Biden's say to the union actually sound like if he truly wrote every word in the state of the union? I mean, I mean, I would love to hear that. That would be worth watching. Yeah, I would I would make sure that I had a stiff drink with me and kick back and I was ready to roll. We're going to watch it tonight because that's what we do. We watch it so we can tell you what's going on. And if something you want to watch it, I'm sure there'll be some moments in it. The town of the towers foundation, my friends, delivers on its promise to do good and never forget the sacrifices America's heroes have made for us. Heroes like Air Force senior master sergeant Israel Del Toro Jr. Israel promises father he'd take care of his family and his son that he wouldn't grow up without a father. When his Humvee exploded in Afghanistan, he suffered severe burns over more than 80% of his body, with only a 15% chance of survival. Del Toro focused on the promises he made. Later, he became the first fully disabled airman permitted to reenlist and a gold medal winner in the Invictus Games. Now he shares his story to help others. Thanks to the Tom of the Towers Foundation and your generosity, Del Toro received a mortgage-free smart home. The home has a myriad of smart features to help him live his life more independently.

Well, we just heard the the beats that some of you will know come from the German singer Nina with her 99 Luft-Balloons. Or it's in the English. What? That's what this is. Okay. I was not paying attention to the music we came back to. Okay, it gets a lot faster. We should I got to come into like the. There we go. Okay. Now I recognize it. There we go. 99 Luft-Balloons. Okay. Anyway, now that first part I didn't get I had to get the beat picked up there. I've been I've been bothering our team to play that ever since the balloon went up. So thank you team. I was like, where's my where is my 99 balloons? Yeah. But the 99 balloons was many too many because we only needed one big balloon. So that song by the way is about balloons. Traversing from West Berlin to East Berlin, triggering defense systems that then lead to nuclear war and the annihilation of the planet. So I'm just going to say way way happier sounding than I would have presumed for you know, for something that would be reflecting of that design as the New York Times described it, a bunch of balloons floats over the border to West and East Germany, triggering defense systems and leading to a war that destroys the planet. That is what that song is actually about. So when you're in the bar and you're having that seventh shot of Quairvo and you're like, 99 balloons, you're yelling it. It's about the end of the world. Just so everybody knows. Man, what a downer. I mean, everybody was in a good mood. We just brought them right back to the square. You sound like Biden doing the state of the union. Yeah. No joke. That's like, you know, how, you know, when you were a kid, do you ever hear people playing a ring around the rosy? Right? Oh, yeah. I know that. I know that story. Yeah. People say it's from the black death and that this is supposed to, they taught kids this and the idea was that it would, you know, ward away the anyway, if about as effective as triple masking outside of the wall. Just the modern day mask. So Karina Jean Pierre, since I got to play the song that I've been wanting to play for this, Karina Jean Pierre was on the view because when you are addressing an urgent matter of national security importance, Clay, where do you go? You go to the geniuses of the view, obviously. That's the first stop on the media tour. So you can have, you know, Joy Behar way in on whether we should send a patchy to Ukraine, et cetera. I'll send all the fanciest planes. As bad. Joy Behar is the dumbest person on television daily. I don't know that she would be any worse analyzing information than Joe Biden is, which is really kind of scary. But if Joy Behar was in the situation room, I don't know that she could be much worse than Biden is. I actually have a, I have a, before we get to the view, I have a real question for you. Something really bad. China invades Taiwan. Yeah. Okay. It's happening. The flotillers have mobilized their first airstrikes have happened. It's on. And you only have a choice between Joe Biden answering that phone call on, you know, the red phone or Kamala Harris. Who do you prefer to answer that call? If it were to happen, you know, in the next year, Kamala Harris, not because, not because I think that Kamala Harris is in any way, should be in the position that she is in. But I think that given the fact that she is, I think 58, I think she could synthesize information and competing arguments better than Joe Biden could, which could lead to a better result. I think I was actually talking about this buck with my wife yesterday because we were talking about the balloon and her argument. I think it's a good one. She's like, I know Joe Biden is ostensibly the commander in chief. That is the military officials have to come speak to him and say, Mr. President, here's what I don't think that they speak to him and that he in any way is actually the commander in chief. So I think really the question here, Buck, is who is the military official? Who is the decider? Right? What should happen is when we select a president, we are selecting the decider in chief, whatever the toughest issues are in the world. They come to his desk. You've been in there for these briefings, Buck. Yes. You have a lot of smart people. This is true. Who have elevated themselves inside of the government and they will make the case. We should choose option A, Mr. President, and they will give you all the reasons why option A should be selected, then B and C. And they're all really good options. And the job of the president is to decide between several challenging options. The best. He's the decider in chief. That's what scares me the most about Biden. I think you're right about the Kamala choice between the two. I think maybe Biden 20 years ago, I would take over Kamala, but but by now, I think I think Kamala is the right choice under that very, very frightening circumstance. They're both the wrong choice. Yeah. She's the best of two bad option of the two of them. If that phone call were to come along and then also on the on those kinds of briefings and those moments, you know, one thing I will say, I'm very critical of the deep state and the apparatus and everything that goes on from the top level, whether it's FBI CIA, there are freakishly smart people who can sit there and just tell you everything that you would ever, ever want to know about every Soviet missile system devised in the last 50 years. Those people do exist in the CIA and the DIA and, you know, they're there. They're just not the ones that are, you know, going, going for big photo ops with the president. They're not the ones that are appearing on NBC. They're not the ones that are, you know, so just to be clear, there is that repository of knowledge that exists, but they're not involved in the political nonsense. And they're also not the ones who you'll be hearing about the opposite of those super brilliant people that know a lot about a lot of things. And they just quietly do their work every day inside the intelligence community and inside the, you know, Pentagon and the military intelligence would be the view. The view does not bring a lot of knowledge, skill and wisdom to anything, certainly not to daytime television. Karina Jean-Pierre, though, this was interesting to me. She went on the view to talk to them about blocking U.S. transmissions from the ground to the balloon. Play to one of the things that we were able to do is to make sure none of the sensitive security information, national security information on the ground was transmitted. So we were able to block that. But at the same time, we're able to gather information, form the balloon as it was traveling on its path. And then when the time allowed and it permitted the president, who was also the commander in chief, as we all know, and when the balloon got over water and as he had asked for the Pentagon to do, which is to take it down, they took it down. By the way, can we just say shoot it down? We shot it down. Yeah. We didn't, we didn't take it down like, you know, like party streamers in the office birthday setup. Like we, we, we shot it down. Let's just use the real terminology. So we just like gently glided it to the ground. But clay, but clay, first of all, okay, so let's, let's say we just take this at face value. They were the block that transmission back to China. Were they the block at the whole time? Where are we to believe that they were just hovering there, blocking the trends? How long was that going? This went on for days, right? This thing doesn't move fast. And also the Chinese never, they didn't have some uplink that would send back the, I mean, if they thought a slow moving balloon was going to have to get back to Chinese airspace intact, this is the crappiest surveillance plane, you know, in history. I mean, you'd be better off with a hot air balloon back in the Civil War days, right? So something's up. Well, not only that, what did China expect that we spend a lot of time talking about what we do, right? A big part of this to me is figuring out what were China's motivations. I asked a question earlier, Buck, where did China launch this from? Did China, when they did their briefing on what the Chinese spy balloon was going to accomplish? Did they ever in any part of their analysis think this balloon's going to enter United States airspace in Alaska and exit off the coast of South Carolina and then the United States going to shut it down? Like what did they think? My expectation would have been if I were China, the United States is going to shut the, shoot this thing down over Alaska as soon as it significantly enters airspace, right? Like I think the story of the Trump thing may be true, but I think they were kind of probing. Hey, do they notice if we go into Hawaiian airspace a little bit? Hey, do they notice if we go into Florida airspace a little bit? Do they have the NORAD defense mechanisms in place to recognize where this balloon is? I think that was their test. I don't think they ever expected that it would go all the way across the entire continental United States. And so I suspect that they adjusted the game plan. Like they're like, okay, well, we're in Montana. Why don't we go over this Montana airfield? And then we're going to drift down. I think they thought that this thing would get shot down. So if that's what they thought was going to happen, what is their analysis right now in China of what took place? To me, it looks like, oh, the United States defense mechanisms are not very strong. Biden does not have the political will to act aggressively in short order when given new information, which is why I think your question, Buck, is such a good one. What is he going to do if he gets woken up at 3 AM in the middle of the night and they say China has begun its invasion of Taiwan. Everybody asked about this, by the way, claims that, well, rather agrees that no one really knows what the US would do that this, this strategic ambiguity is really a we're not sure what we would do. We think we have strategic ambiguity with regard to Taiwan so that we keep China on its on its toes, you know, so we don't give away the game. But actually we don't know. That's the truth. We don't know what we would do. And Buck, here's the other question. What are Biden's top advisors going to suggest to him to do? Because if my wife's right and basically Biden is commander in chief and name only, then whomever those top military advisors are, whatever their recommendation is, is what Biden is going to do. So don't worry. That's a lot of power. Secretary of defense of the future of Buddha judge will be handling it just like he's handled the transportation situation in this country.

We're going to be joined in the top of the next hour by Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt to talk about the crazy transgender protest going on in his state. We're also going to be joined by Gordon Chang. We'll ask him that question about it. Potentially Taiwan invades China, what the impact would be there. And also certainly discuss with him the Chinese supply, the Chinese balloon spy issue. But Buck, I got a confession for you last night. And I may need advice from the, from the clay and buck audience out here. Did you play horse against your dad when you were a kid growing up ever? I got a lie. Definitely defeated him in horse many, many a time. So last night I played against my 12 year old son, my sixth grader. And he beat me H O R S E to nothing. Now we have in the Travis household, pre regular match ups between the two of us. And we have a belt championship belt that is bestowed depending on who wins. But when you get beat H O R S E to nothing, it was a, it was a dark moment. I mean, it was sobering to get crushed like this by, by your sixth grader. So I don't know what at this point I should do. There are a lot of different suggestions out there. I'm only 43, but there were a lot of claim injuries, a lot of, you know, trick shoulders, a lot of issues associated with that. How do you handle one of your offspring becoming better than you at a sport, particularly at this age? Like, you know, 16, 17, 18 when a kid's hit puberty, 12 year old beating you pre puberty is a, is a tough one to take. Humility is an important thing, Clay. So however you achieve it, I think it's all for the better. The funniest comment buck was that I saw it. I can't keep up with all the comments because I tweeted about it last night. The funniest, funniest comment was one guy said, you should have just told him you slept with his mom, which is, which is accurate and also his, and also hysterical. I'm going to have to put that one in the back pocket because there is some trash talk that goes on sometimes during the course of the horse game. But when you get blanked, H.O.R.S.E. to nothing, no letters on him, there's not a lot of trash talk I could be involved in. I'm pretty sure sometimes with my dad back in the trash talking days, a lot of it was around ping pong, by the way. The sections were really, and we all. I had a grandfather who was the best in ping pong in your family. I mean, I'm the best at ping pong in my family. You know, my brothers are going to write down their freaking out, especially if they're but you know, maybe they're not listening. So they won't even know. Some days they do. Some days they don't. I am the best at ping pong. I am absurdly good for somebody who doesn't play very often. I would say that. Okay. So like, do you have spins? Like is there substantial spinning or you more of like a trident like because if you watch really, really good ping pong players, they have an inordinate amount of ability to spin. I'm talking about like, are you just kind of a traditional player? Yeah, I'm a traditional player, but I mean, I look when I play, it's like when Forrest Gump is doing his thing in the movie on the ping pong. So you're taking full swings like it's I think I'm pretty good at ping pong too. I'm racking the Oh, okay. I do this. Good. This is the clay Travis. All right, I'm trying to probe there. There's going to be some big wagers. There's going to be some people. Do you have a ping pong table at the at the Travis residence? We do not because I've been so afraid of my boys are so competitive. All three of them. And you know, whatever it is, I am concerned with introducing paddles into the house for fear of what those paddles might do, both as weapons and also as projectiles that could break things all throughout the house, depending on who's winning or losing. We used to have the brother, the three brothers and our cousins would even set up our own paintball wars in the backyard when we would go upstate. That didn't always end well. I could tell you because because you know, when you shoot somebody with a paintball gun and you think that maybe they didn't actually have the ball, you know, it didn't splat. Maybe you shoot them three or four more times. People don't like that. So things can get those things out there. Those things hurt too. They do hurt. You take a paint ball in the wrong place. Like it is a it is painful. I got hit in my hands a few times in the fingers. Let me tell you, the fingers is one of the worst place to get hit with a paintball. I took one in the back of the head one time in paintball. Usually you have like some protection over the eyes hopefully. But I was going to tell you, you know, a line that, you know, when I when I would sort of talk trash to my dad, other in basketball or ping pong back in the day or at the rifle range, you don't even just say to me sometimes, I made you. Which is we just true. That's accurate. Also not a bad line. Not a bad line. I have to try that one. I like I slept with your mom. I think you would have a tough time dealing with that one.
