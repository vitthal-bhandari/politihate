    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Duchinsky, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radio at thefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today, I'm joined by a host of The Matt Walsh Show, which is part of the Daily Wire. Matt Walsh, he's also the author of the new book, Johnny The Walrus. Matt, welcome to the program. Hey, thanks for having me. So tell us about Johnny The Walrus. I've read it. It wasn't a difficult read. It was a funny read. It wasn't a tough one. But tell us about the book and why you decided to write it. Yeah, it's not the kind of book where you have to dog ear a page and come back. You could probably get through it in one sitting. So the book is a, yeah, it's called Johnny The Walrus. And it's about a young boy, imaginative child, as all children are, who likes to pretend to be different things. He plays games. And one day he decides that he's going to pretend to be a walrus. And he's got wood spoons in his mouth like tusks. And he's wearing socks on his hands like fins. And he goes into the kitchen and he says, look, mommy, I'm a walrus. And the mom responds initially as any sane parent would and says, that's a fun silly game. But then she goes online and she starts talking to people. And she discovers that in this day and age, in this progressive day and age, if your child identifies as something, then you have to take that self-identification seriously. So she then endeavors through much of the rest of the lengthy tale to raise her child as a walrus. But she discovers that she thought that this would make him happy, but she realizes she starts to see that something's wrong. This isn't trying to raise my boy as a walrus, but he still does not quite seem satisfied in his new walrus skin. And then I don't want to give away any spoilers, but at the end she kind of has a wake-up call and she realizes that, oh, well, just because your child is identifying as something, just because your child is pretending to be something, doesn't mean it actually is that thing. And I think the comparisons I'm making here are not very subtle and they're made even less subtle by a lot of the illustrations in the book. But I think it's pretty obvious that we're drawing a connection here between this and the gender theories that are voiced on our kids from a young age. And I do think that it is in fact exactly the same kind of thing. A boy who, a four-year-old boy, the age of Johnny, the walrus, who says, hey, mommy, I'm a girl, that's exactly the same as a boy saying, I'm a walrus or I'm Batman or I'm a dog or whatever. OK, so in that sense, is this a book kind of for parents? Yeah, I think it well, it's for both. So that's what we really wanted to do with this book. And when I spent months and months writing this, my magnum opus, my goal was for it to be a book that children can engage with on one level, and they'll find it really funny and silly. But then parents will engage with it on another level and they'll actually understand the commentary on the broader culture and on gender and everything. Because in the book, I never come out and say, I don't use a word like transgender in the book itself. Because part of the point here is that I don't think kids should be exposed to these kinds of ideas at such a young age. But my hope is, I think for the most part, kids will just think it's funny and that's great. But maybe a child will read this book and he'll understand that, OK, well, when someone identifies as a certain thing and they're just pretending, and then maybe down the line, when he is exposed to some of these gender ideas, perhaps he'll draw those connections and start to understand that it's the same sort of thing is just pretending to be an animal. So it's kind of maybe inoculating them against this madness when it comes for them later on in life. Was it difficult to have something operate on those two levels on the one hand litigating what has become for some reason a controversial and complicated question for parents? And then on the other hand, something that is sort of eventually obvious to children, was it difficult to sort of operate on those levels when you were writing this? Yeah, I think it's a it there's a little bit of a tough balance, especially with an issue like this. And so it did actually didn't exactly take me months, but it did take a couple of passes to kind of strike the right balance where it's not. I think, you know, initially kind of what I came up with was really totally for adults in that kids wouldn't understand what was going on at all. And then kind of whittled it down from there and settled on what we have now. Yeah, and how much have you like have you really read a lot of what the left does with their children's books, which I guess I shouldn't even say the left. It's just really the corporate establishment because a lot of these books they don't even see as being political or leftist. And are you sort of trying to invert that formula or I mean, I guess that is sort of what it seems like inverting the formula, having sort of subtle messaging that I mean, it shouldn't be political, but I guess it is into the narrative. Yeah, I mean, we I think I have some of those books in my studio. I thought I did. Well, I don't have any more. But yeah, I've read I've read quite a few of those of the left wing brainwashing books. And I was I think pretty obviously using some of that as a model here because this is a response to that. And so I guess I'll be accused some people accuse me of well, you know, you don't want the left to brainwash kids. And so now aren't you trying to brainwash the kids yourself? Well, no, it's more this is more an attempt. This is this is blocking the brainwashing the kids that kids indoor from the left because, you know, the idea that boys are boys and girls are girls and that just because you imagine you are something doesn't mean you are that thing. That's I can't that's just reality. That's truth. You can't you can't brainwash someone into reality. So I don't think it's exactly the same. Right. And it's also not political. Their attempts to sort of change the norm is political, but the norm itself is not political. It's something as simple as biology. I want to ask why and they started to cut you off, but they this is exactly what they do where they try to they have a political and ideological idea. And it's a radical idea that subverts what is normal and obvious. But then all of a sudden, if you disagree with that idea, now you are taking a political and ideological stance yourself. It's kind of like what they do where where they say, Oh, well, if you're if you're a man who just identifies as a man as you are, then now you're cisgender. So that is that's that's just another category. Just like being trans, you're you are part of now part of this, like spectrum that we've invented. And I reject that entirely. Right. Or like you were proclaiming the importance of biological reality. Therefore, you're the culture warrior, even though you're doing it in the face of all of our efforts to obviously change that. Is there a book or do you think I mean, I'm not a parent. So this is it's sort of different for me, but these books, how powerful do you think they are? One of the things that came out. I know you're a former Virginia resident. One of the things that came out of that election is all of the the books that were in libraries that I think parents were surprised to find there. How successful do you think those books are at the sort of brainwashing or the indoctrination? Are they just sort of funny things that collect dust in libraries? Or is there a really very, very real effect being had? I think they're effective as when you look at it from the broader context of everything else that they're doing. I think that if we lived in a normal insane culture. And the only place where kids encountered these ideas were some of these weird kids books, then they had very little effect at all because everywhere else they go in society, they would encounter reality. And that would make those kids books seem to be what they are, which is just this radical, weird kind of thing. But considering they're getting this message, they're getting it from the kids books, and then they go to school and it's reinforced there. And they turn on the TV and it's reinforced by everything they see on TV right down to the advertisements. So the ideas are reinforced everywhere else they go. And so I think that's what makes it especially effective, unfortunately. Yeah, that's a really good point. I also wanted to ask you there are because it's funny you're using the animal identification as a parallel to gender, but there are actually case studies. There's like a high school in Kentucky. I have an article from not the be up right now in August where students are starting to identify as first. And it's interesting. It's funny, but it's funny and terrifying, but also interesting because everybody has their own individual truth and identification is, you know, in accordance with your truth. To some extent, the walrus thing might actually be very real that this could you not foresee in some school if a child said they're not walrus, then letting them identify as a walrus. Yeah, I think we're I mean, that's why you got that from not the be because it's it makes it so hard to actually do parity or satire in our culture because, you know, with parity, you're always taking some idea and you're taking a one step farther than the other. And then just to point out the absurdities, but it's the left is already taking everything to its farthest possible extreme. So it's hard to do that. Yeah, I think, yeah, they're already in among Gen Z things like neo pronouns people identifying as not just animals, but, you know, whether whether phenomena and clouds and mythical creatures and that stuff already exists. We could say it's relatively fringe and maybe it is, but once you break down, as you point out, once you break down the walls of objective reality, then it's not even the wrong is slippery slope. It's just we're in a total free fall environment and anything goes. So, yeah. Yeah, I want to ask you more about that because and you talk about this issue line. I'm going to talk about very cogently, but that does seem to be at the core of a lot of this. Is that also something that's in messaging in children's books? I mean, I've taken a look at a couple of them, but it does seem to be the, the my truth, the breaking down the walls of objective reality. It does seem to be a big part of the sort of subtle messaging campaign aimed at younger people who, by the way, struggle with levels of anxiety and depression that we haven't seen before. Is that really what this is all sort of rooted in at the end of the day? I think so. That's why I talk about, I think there's a war on reality happening on our calls, right? I don't think that's hyperbolic. I think that's actually what is what is happening. I think that's ultimately the goal is to whatever you want to call it. I say the left, but whatever would it woke the church of woke, whatever phrase you want to use for this for the people who represent this idea. What is happening is unmistakable that they're trying to break down reality itself to build their own sort of alternate universe. And that's where, but it does have to be subtle there. And that's where anytime you hear something like live your truth, speak your truth, you know, where you own the truth. It's your own version. It's just as valid as anybody else's, even if it contradicts everybody else's, even if it contradicts physical reality, it's still true in some deeper sense that's always vague and never really outlined. And that's why I think you talk to anyone who identifies on the left side of the spectrum, almost any of them, and they'll look you in the eyes and they'll say there is no truth. There is no objective reality. If you use a word like truth around them, they'll say something like, well, who's truth are we talking about? And I think that that kind of seeps in subtly over time. You can't really go up to a kid and throw all this on them all at once and say there is no truth. Nothing is real. Because if you say that, it's bewildering and crazy and it's scary as it should be. So instead, they just kind of, yeah, little by little, they send this message that, hey, you can make your own truth. Yeah, and I just sort of pre-vided this line of questioning, but that's where it gets really, I think, worrisome is, and I wonder if you share this concern, that with Gen Z and the students that are just the kids that are just below the ages of Gen Z, is there a point of no return that we've already hit? Or is there still sort of, I don't know, I look at the success of Jordan Peterson or the Daily Wire and say, you know, people really are yearning for some different messaging, especially young men, but it is sort of troublesome to think, you know, if you've been sort of brought up, if you've been floating in this like intellectual idea, if it's been passed on to you through every institution for your entire life, the sort of deprogramming is going to be almost impossible. Yeah, I struggle with feeling that way sometimes, but then if I really accepted the idea that we're past the point of no return, there's no hope, then what's the point of anything that any of us are doing? So I can't accept that, and I don't think it's actually true. I think it's more to say that we're locked in a generational struggle. So if the question is, can things be turned around by next year, or by the next election or whatever, then yeah, that's not going to happen. There's no hope of that. But then again, how did we get to this point? We got to this point over the course of many generations. So it's going to take generations to reverse the course, and you know, you and I are not going to be alive to see really the fruits of our labor. We have to accept that and start thinking about, like I said, think about a generation, think about our own kids. How can we rescue our own kids from this madness and then build out from there? One of the interesting plot points in the book is the mom, the way that you had the mom sort of thinking about caving here was that she saw mean things on her phone. And I thought that was really interesting because it wasn't as though she had some sort of real intellectual struggle of herself. It was entirely the sort of external pressures that were shifting her in one direction over the other. Can you talk about that decision? And is that sort of getting into the cancel culture, mentalities, power and influence over where this conversation has gone? Yeah, well, that's one thing that I wanted to put in the book. It's kind of an irony in that the book is Johnny the Walrus. Well, there's a couple of liners. Johnny the Walrus, but it's not really about a walrus. And also, the book isn't really even about Johnny the boy. It's actually, it's really the stories about the mom because this is at the end of the day, like kids don't actually choose this. And they're just kids and they're skipping merrily through the daffodils and the fields and everything. And they're doing their thing and they're climbing trees and just living their lives. It's parents and adults who foist all this onto kids. And I think there are a few different ways that parents will do that to very young kids. I think, and I also think you have to, there's two different categories really. Like there's young kids and there's adolescents. And I think there are a lot of adolescent, especially girls where it's the most common. And Abigail Schreier with her books done a great job of documenting this. But among adolescents, you have in many cases the girls, they pick up this stuff in school or wherever they pick it up online. And the parents do not encourage it at all. And in fact, do everything they can to discourage it, but they are just powerless. And that's a terrible thing. And I feel really bad for those parents and those kids. And the young kids is a different deal. I think that, you know, if you have a four year old identifying as quote unquote trans, that the parents have to be actively involved in that or it's not going to happen. And so I think you have some parents who really make the decision to impose this on their kids because it's trendy and they treat their kid like some kind of trophy to show off. That's not the that's not the mom in this book. The mom in this book is this other category where it kind of floating on the tide of the culture, not thinking much about things, but wanting to fit in desperately afraid of being accused of bigotry seeing that is like the worst possible thing anyone can be. And then their kid says something and they just basically well meaning, but they go looking for advice in the wrong places and then they end up falling down this rabbit hole and dragging their kid along with them. So the way she sort of brought back to reality without any spoilers, I guess, the way she sort of brought back to reality is very bluntly. And someone sort of gives her permission to just obviously embrace logic and reality. Can you talk to us about that choice and is that do you think the most is that what it takes to shake people out of this just to hear it from somebody is that or is that the most powerful way to shake somebody out of it just to hear it from somebody who tells them and almost gives them permission and says, you know, you're not a bigot. This is exactly how things are, but says it sort of, you know, bluntly and almost harshly. Yeah, I think so. I mean, I think we're way past the point. There may have been a point in our culture where we could have combated some of this stuff in a gentle kind of way, but we're, if that would have ever worked, we're way past that now. And sometimes in order to get above the den of all the noise and everything and all the competing noise, you have to shout a little bit and be firm. You know, there's there's not any shouting in the book, but you have to be more firm and harsh and blunt. And there's not there's just not time to try to be diplomatic about it, especially with something as basic as this. Like, that's a boy. That's a girl period. That's what it is. And you have to be firm about it. I think that's what people need. And I think you're also right that people are looking for permission to believe what they inherently know. People are looking for permission to just to exercise their own common sense. And sometimes it can be kind of, it can be bewildering when you look around the culture and it just seems like everyone has accepted this idea that to you seems kind of crazy. But when everyone is saying it, it seems like it's everywhere. Maybe after a while, you start to think, well, no, maybe I'm the crazy one. Then you start to accept it. And that's why you need someone to give you permission and to validate. I mean, we hear so much about validation. We have to validate people. I think we have to validate people in their common sense. I think people really need that. Yeah. Do you were you worried about sort of being persuasive in the book and like, actually, this being something that people can really give to their friends and pass around. And in a sense, it's like, helps parents sort of feel like they do have permission to embrace what they inherently believe, as you say. Was that kind of, was that part of the aim to actually be persuasive and to move people's hearts and minds? Or was it, were you more focused on making the comparison or were you maybe trying to do both? I think it's a, you know, I guess I can't be too ambitious with what I could possibly pull off with a 400 word board book for preschoolers. But, and like I said before, you know, with any, whether it's my book or one of the crazy leftist books, it's got to be part on its own. That's all it is. It's not going to do much. It's got to be part of. So I know for me, it's like, I have this message, but I also need some backup in the culture, which I have. I mean, we have it from the federalists. I haven't, I work for the daily wire. And so, you know, we're all, we're all kind of working on this in our own way in different ways. And so this is part of that effort. And I, you know, I hope it's persuasive. I also wanted to be, you know, just funny and entertaining. I wanted to be funny for kids and they can appreciate it, at least on that level. And, and at the end of the day, make the point for adults. I hope it's persuasive, but I will see. Did you see in the Virginia results and you did, you know, spend time there actually in the frenzy, the sort of frenzy time before the election? Did you see it in what happened there? As a lot of people did this heartening sign that parents, not just Republicans, not just conservatives, not just people on the right, but sort of parents in general are waking up and they are getting sort of, they are feeling more emboldened to embrace what's, what's obvious reality. Do you think that was reading too far into the situation or do you think there was something really there in Glen Yunkins win? I hope so. I think it's probably too early to say. We know that one of the problems we have, not just on the right, but in our culture in general is that we all have the memories of fruit flies and we tend to get distracted by the next shiny object. So if, if a year from now, we're looking back and all saying, Oh, remember that time when we were all invested in the school board meetings? That was fun. All those many months ago, if we're saying that, then I think that'll mean that it really amounted to nothing. We have to continue to put the pressure on. This has to be, this really has to be like a lifestyle now where we're holding public schools accountable, going to the school board meetings, even if there's not a big crowd, even if there's not a rally every time, it's not a big dramatic thing, but you're going, you're staying invested. And I hope that's what we do, but I guess time will tell. Why were you so active in this particular storyline? Like, what was it about this that you thought was like so important? You wanted to get involved and to really make a big point of it? What in the Virginia case study was, you know, was animating for you? I think for me, it was, and I know a lot of people were very invested and are invested in the school board issue because of critical race theory. And I think that's great. I mean, critical race theory isn't great, but it's great to be invested in getting rid of critical race theory in the school system. So I agree with that, but for me, I think the gender theory, which is, you know, what the book's all about, gender theory is the much bigger threat. They're both bad. Gender theory is worse. It's more pervasive. It's more insidious. It is, it gets at kids at such a basic level where it's basically depriving them of identity, of reality. And so that's always been where my focus is. And when I looked at Loudon County, you know, the policy they put in place, their gender, you know, their pro transgender policy, in many ways similar to what we've seen across the country, but also much more extreme. You know, in that in Loudon County, their policy says that, for example, if you're a teacher, you know, potentially upon penalty of being fired, you have to use the preferred pronouns of your students. And if they're if they're preferred pronoun changes by the week, as it often does for kids who go through this phase, which unfortunately ends up not being a phase, but a lifestyle choice in the end. But if it changes by the week, then you got to stay up to date. And it's just that kind of thing. And in fact, in Loudon County, the thing that first put Loudon County on my radar is that a teacher spoke out against this policy at a school board meeting. And they they fired him for it for speaking at the school board meeting. He took it to court and he was he was victorious there as he should be. But I mean, just think about that in Loudon County, the way the policy that they want to have in place is that you can't even you can't even criticize the policy at a school board meeting without getting fired. Did you also get the sense? I mean, I think you were at a rally. Did you get the sense that there are people that aren't just, you know, your typical movement conservatives or Republican activists that were voting maybe for Glenn Yunken when they haven't voted for Republican in a while or definitely didn't vote for Trump, whatever the case may be. Did you get the sense that there was a coalition that wasn't really just on the right when it came to this issue of parents and schools? I think so. I talked to quite a few people there and I talked to many people myself who said that they're not either not Republican or they sort of are, but they don't, you know, they're not very political. So I think there's, I mean, generally speaking, I think if you were to do a survey, you would find that the majority of people who are part of this movement with the school boards in Loudon County and across the country probably identify as conservative, but it's probably not as big of a majority as you might think. I think that this is something because people, look, people, people love their kids and they want to protect their kids. And no matter what side of the aisle you fall on, when you feel like your kids are being threatened and when you're, when you're being told that you shouldn't have a say in your child's education, when you're, when someone else who's not, who's not you says that you need to butt out when it comes to what your kid is doing, I think that rubs almost anybody the wrong way if you're a parent. And so it did become a more bipartisan movement that I think people realize. Yeah, absolutely. And I want to sort of end by asking you a couple questions about your style, which I think is actually really helpful. And there was a time when people, especially on the right, you're maybe one of the best examples of a conservative thinker who establishment Republicans would just cringe at and say you are, you are bleeding voters because, you know, you're losing less all of these people. You're speaking so bluntly and you're embracing all of this sort of traditionalism. But actually, when I have friends or relatives or people who are thinking about cohabitating, I send them a very, very harsh article you wrote about the dangers of premarital cohabitation. And I found again that to be extremely persuasive because there's a lack of, I think, truth and objectivity that irks people, even if they can't put it into words and when somebody comes in and does explain things bluntly. It does sort of make them feel like they're latching onto something that is real because if you have confidence in your beliefs and you speak with the authority of truth, this persuasive. And I guess I'm just curious as to how you've never changed. I mean, even when before the sort of Trump Trumpian culture war era, you're still the same person. Have you noticed a shift on the right and has it been difficult to sort of stay the course on that? It hasn't been difficult for me personally, not because I have any great courage, but just because I'm a stubborn bastard. So it's just how I am, which doesn't come in handy in many aspects of life. But maybe with this, it does at least. I have noticed a shift. I think that, and I think some of it is exhaustion and desperation where people are part of the French, but they're exhausted by all the bullshit. And it's where a critical mass with it where people encounter this everywhere they go, which is they're expected to believe things that are plainly false and they're accused of being a racist for having the most normal opinions about things. And I think people are really sick and tired of it and fed up with it. And they're desperate for common sense. And this is something for as long as I've been doing this when I'm out in public, I'm speaking somewhere or whatever. I check my DMs and of course there's a lot of people wishing that I'll get cancer and die and that sort of thing. But also a lot of people saying, hey, I totally agree with everything that you say. I say the same thing myself. You sound just like me. I'm glad that someone is saying it. So I think that's what it is. I mean, I appreciate you called me a thinker. I actually don't think that I wouldn't call myself that. I'm not sort of an intellectual. I didn't even go to college. I think I'm really a normal person with some basic common sense, the same common sense that most people have. And maybe that's worked my benefit because I'm a normal person saying really normal things. If we lived in a society that was not totally insane, I wouldn't have a job. There'd be nowhere for me to go because I don't think I have any really deep insights. I don't think I have any sense of what I have is just common sense. But fortunately because we've gone insane, there's actually a market for basic common sense. So that's where I fit in. Well, yeah, and the issue of cohabitation is kind of an interesting example because it's one of those like downstream cultural issues that does actually really affect the way people live their lives and the way I were sort of ordered as a society. I'm curious as to what your take is on the importance of issues exactly like that one. You know, people delaying marriage, people moving in together. Do you think the right needs to kind of talk about those lifestyle issues more and have the courage to sort of talk about them and talk about them and very clear authoritative moral terms? Are those really having a bigger effect than people realize? Yeah, I think so. That's another shift that I think I've noticed that people are more willing, maybe not with cohabitation specifically. That's still going to be a tough one because no matter where people fall in the political spectrum, this is something that lots of people do. And they don't want to feel like they are being personally criticized. But even so, when it comes to basic lifestyle things, moral questions about how we live our life, it seems like people are more open to actually talking about those types of issues now. At least I at least I hope they are because this is another area where the left has made huge inroads when they've been able to, you know, they have a message. They don't just have a political message or a message about economics and taxes and everything. They seem to spend not a whole lot of time on those kinds of issues. Like their message is like, this is how you should live your life. These are the priorities you should have in your day to day life. This is what you should care about most deeply. And they've been hammering on that message for decades and doing it for a long time, totally unopposed because the right was too afraid to talk about that stuff. And I think that maybe that's changing how I hope it is. Yeah, it reminds me of the kind of Willing Grace, obvious example or the Murphy Brown example that people, you know, the single mother, the championing, which to sound like Dan Quayle, the championing of single motherhood. And you can look at Willing Grace and all that. And I guess my last question for you is something that I've been thinking about a lot lately. Do you think that there's a, that there's something happening on the right where because of the transgender extremism, there's going to be a reopening of the conversation about marriage. And about sexuality, because I've seen that sort of cropping up more and more and I personally think that's great. But do you foresee that happening at all? It would be sort of unthinkable just a couple of years ago. And the Republican Party itself now is, is obviously very pro-gay, but do you think conservatives are really going to start feeling more comfortable criticizing our cultures, you know, I guess embrace of some harmful ideology just when it comes to sexuality. I think eventually, I mean, this is not a settled, this is not a, this is not really a settled issue. This is where we go back to, you know, short term versus long term. I don't think, I think in the short term it's going to be how it is right now, but long term it's not, you know, this is not what has been decided in our culture about marriage, for example. That's not the last word on the subject that's ever going to be spoken. And the other thing is that the, you know, we talk about LGBT, and I know that there's the whole alphabet is attached after that, but really it's LGBT, right? And the problem may be on, for gay activists, the gay lobby is that the tea have long since sort of affixed themselves to this. And now it's, it really should be T, GLB or whatever, because they have, they've become the preeminent, the, you know, the top of the victim hierarchy. And so I think the more that people start to ask questions about the tea part of this, and like, is this actually true trans ideology that when they start to criticize that and start to think critically about it. Because tea has lumped itself in with the other initials, then they're going to start asking questions about some of those other issues as well. So that'll be interesting to see. Yeah. Well, the book is Johnny the Walrus. It is out in time for Christmas would make a great gift. And you've been listening to Matt Walsh, host of the Matt Walsh show on the Daily Wire.
