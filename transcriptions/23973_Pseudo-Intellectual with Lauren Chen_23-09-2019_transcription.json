    "text": " Hey guys, welcome back to the show. Today we're going to be talking about a bit of a more serious but very important topic, and that's violence and domestic abuse toward men and the cultural attitudes surrounding it. But first, I have a quick message from our awesome sponsors over at Cabbage. Managing inventory, covering payroll, and doing a hundred other things before lunch is just your average day when you run a small business. That's why Cabbage created a simple modern way for businesses to access up to $250,000 worth of credit. Three years ago, when I started out making videos independently, one of the biggest challenges that I had was getting access to funding. I know that if I didn't have the funds to pay for things like software or video equipment, I wouldn't be here today on this show talking to you guys. Cabbage's application process is online and takes just minutes to complete and get a decision. If your business qualifies, you can access the amount you need right away and withdraw more funds whenever you need extra capital. Cabbage has an A plus rating with the Better Business Bureau and has provided over 200,000 businesses with access to funding. So get the money you need to run your small business. Go to Cabbage.com to get started. That's K-A-B-B-A-G-E.com. Credit lines are subject to review and change, and individual requests for capital are separate installment loans issued by Celtic Bank member FDIC. Now in my humble opinion, public freak out videos are some of the most interesting, if not concerning things you can find online. And if a video is shocking or outrageous enough, it tends to go viral as this video did just this past week. Basically, for anyone who's listening to us on an audio-only platform, what happens in that video is a taller man gets a child's happy meal as a joke for a shorter woman who I'm guessing is his girlfriend. Ha ha, kinda funny, right? Not according to that chick. No. She knocks the tray of food out of his hands, smashes the ice cream against him all while getting in his face and verbally berating him. And everyone else in the restaurant by the way just kinda stands back and avoids eye contact. In response to that video, almost everyone was condemning the actions of that short, angry loud woman. And a lot of people were also applauding the restraint that this guy had. He didn't reciprocate his girlfriend's behavior, he didn't lose his temper, he just calmly removed himself from the situation and left the restaurant. Although his girlfriend did follow after him yelling. Now when I first saw that video, there were a couple things that bothered me about it. Number one, that nobody in that entire restaurant did anything when that woman was accosting her boyfriend. I fully understand that people generally don't want to get involved when they see public freakouts unfolding in front of them, but imagine for a second if the genders had been reversed in the situation. If a man had knocked a tray of food out of his girlfriend's hands, smashed a thing of ice cream against her face all while yelling at her, screaming at her, do you really think nobody in the entire restaurant would have said anything? I'm sorry, but I have a really hard time believing that's the case. And furthermore, if someone had been there filming this incident of this boyfriend assaulting his girlfriend and then later put it online like this other person did, if the video had shown the girlfriend quietly, sadly, dejected leaving the restaurant, being followed by her boyfriend screaming after her to do, god knows what, do you really think all of the comments would have been about, gee, it's so great that she's restrained? No, you know the answer is no and make no mistake, what that video shows is nothing short of full on assault and domestic abuse. We have a sickness in our society where so many of us are incapable of when it comes to relationships with women acknowledging the fact that men can be victims. According to anyone who's thinking, well, maybe some people in that McDonald's would have intervened if that woman was being more physically aggressive and was at risk of actually hurting that guy. I gotta say, I love your optimism. However, based on other videos that we've seen, I highly doubt it. I'm not going to be a victim of the fact that women are being treated as a victim. I'm not going to be a victim of the fact that women are being treated as a victim. I'm not going to be a victim of the fact that women are being treated as a victim. I'm not going to be a victim of the fact that women are being treated as a victim. That girl hits that guy in the face repeatedly and when the guy tries to get away from her, she follows him to hit him more and no one standing around does a single thing. It's only when after giving her many warnings that the guy defends himself, do people finally step in and break them apart. And look like I said, I get it. People don't want to get involved in other people's business. But if you're more willing to break up a fight to protect a female aggressor than you are a male victim, then you need to re-examine your priorities. And it's exactly this kind of apathy toward men being assaulted by women that makes it so hard for male victims of domestic abuse to come forward and get the support they need. As the BBC reported in 2018, quote, male domestic abuse victims are suffering a lack of support despite a sharp rise in attacks, a charity said police in England and Wales recorded 149,248 incidents in 2017. More than double the number reported in 2012. One charity, the Mankind Initiative, said while a third of domestic abuse victims were men, only 0.8% of refuge beds were reserved for them. The charity, which helps men escaping abuse, told the BBC while there were more than 3,600 beds in safe houses for women, there were currently only 20 earmarked solely for men in England, including none in London. And everyone, I want to make it real clear here that this video is not about some competition about who gets abused more or worse men or women. Abuse is wrong, period. And the suffering of a man who was hurt by a woman or another man is not any less valid, any less concerning or any less worthy of support than if he were a woman. And I don't want to hear, I am flat out not interested in any, oh, this is taking away attention from female victims. No. This is about expanding the conversation surrounding domestic abuse to include all domestic abuse victims, period. And what makes me so upset about this issue, because in case you guys can't tell, I'm a little riled up here, is that sometimes when a man is being attacked and actually does defend himself from his female abuser, there will be people who say, no, I don't think he should have done that. For example, check out this video. I'm going to punch you and then... Oi! Oi! Go, bud! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Oi! Good on that kid for standing up for himself against that gang of bullies, who by the way, were girls just as big as him, right? Nope, not if you're this one Twitter user who actually believed that an appropriate response to that video was men only care about equal rights when it's about hitting women back. B-what? I abhor violence. Man hitting a man woman hitting a woman woman hitting a man man hitting a woman it doesn't matter. It's all awful. However, there is a big difference between hitting someone and hitting someone back. It is not the same thing to be an aggressor in a situation versus merely trying to defend yourself from someone who is actively attacking you. If you ask me someone's right to defend themselves, it's not dependent on the gender of the person attacking them. But in our society, not only do we not give male domestic abuse victims the support that they need, we also don't even want to let them defend themselves. You see, it wasn't too uncommon in previous generations that when a wife was getting a little out of line, at least in her husband's opinion, that he would give her the old Sean Connery treatment. You think it's good to slap a woman? No, I don't think it's good. I don't think it's bad. I don't think it's bad. I think that it depends entirely on the circumstances and if it merits it. What would merit it? Well, if you have tried everything else, and women are pretty good at this, they can't leave it alone. They don't want to have the last word and you give them the last word, but they're not happy with the last word. They want to say it again and get into a really provocative situation. Then... I think it's absolutely right. Yeah, that interview is quite the trip. Eventually though, it began to fall out of fashion for men to casually beat their wives and girlfriends. Thank goodness. And so more and more men began to adopt the phrase, a man should never hit a woman, to express the fact that you shouldn't be physically disciplining your partner. And less of course it was consensual and you were both into that kind of thing. Somehow though, over time, the valid and important concept that men should not be hitting their wives, girlfriends and daughters, or again, nobody should be hitting anybody, has evolved into these strange notion that men are not allowed to defend themselves when being attacked by a woman. Of course they shouldn't lure and self-defense aside what about chivalry. I'm a big fan of chivalry. I really am. And the thing about chivalry is that it states a man should treat a lady like a gentleman. Ladies do not hit men. Trashy cows hit men. And the chivalry code just doesn't say anything about men not being able to defend themselves from trashy cows now does it. And to illustrate how apparently controversial it is to assert that men should be able to defend themselves, we have the article, This Poll Questions Shouldn't Have Been Asked by Cheryl Moody. Quote, If a woman hits you, would you hit her back? An online poll asking this question appeared on an Australian men's rights Facebook page about two weeks ago. By the time the poll was deleted, almost 80,000 people had responded. This dropped to 49% as anti-violence activists urged Aussie females to cast a no vote. Personally, the idea that you shouldn't hit someone in self-defense after they've already hit you simply because of their gender seems kind of ridiculous. So to understand that mindset a little bit more, I posted the following Twitter poll. I asked, Is it ever acceptable for a man to hit a woman in self-defense? Over 15,000 people answered with 90% of them saying yes. Although keep in mind that my Twitter followers aren't representative of the general population, and that if you asked random people on the street, the spread would be pretty different. One answer I saw quite a bit was that hitting a woman in self-defense would be like hitting a child in self-defense. I have some thoughts about that. The way I see it hitting a child, even one who's hitting you, is wrong for two reasons. Number one, they're probably not going to be able to hurt you seriously and number two, because they're a child, they likely don't understand the consequences or implications of what they're doing. Regarding the consequences of hitting someone, women are not retarded. And I don't mean that as a slur, I mean that in the literal sense, women are not developmentally dysfunctional. Women, just as well as men, are perfectly capable of understanding what it means to be violent with someone, namely that you're hurting them and you're likely going to get hurt back. And second, regarding the idea that women can't really hurt men, therefore mention and defend themselves, that's some victim-blaming BS. And I'm not here for it. Check this out. My ex-girlfriend, she just beat me up because I want to be with her anymore. I just caught a police on his b****, and she outside right now. She just f****** cut me, put me in my nose, but you know what? I'm still a man. I ain't no punk-ass man, because I ain't hit her back. I ain't hit her back. She bust my f****** lip. She bust my nose. And she cut me and s*** with this, uh, blade and s***, and she out here. I'm calling the police on you. I'm calling the police on you. Get a f****** away from me. Get a f****** from this car, b****. You crazy, you crazy b****, you get in my face. Try telling that guy that, oh, she's just a woman. She can't really hurt you. Even weapons aside, a woman can still break your nose. A woman can still make it so that you're gonna need stitches. A man shouldn't have to deal with that. A man shouldn't have to deal with any physical harm coming to him just because he's a man, and his attacker is a woman. And there are also some people saying stuff like, even if it's in self-defense, a man just doesn't hit a woman. It's just not something that a man does. Again, victim-blaming BS. A man being attacked, being assaulted, is not any less of a man, any less honorable, any less chivalrous if he decides to defend himself and shame on you for implying that he would be. And of course, there were other people talking about proportionality, and some were saying, it would be better if he could just restrain her, not hit her. I do agree that in an ideal situation, a physical confrontation, someone attacking another person, is solved by restraining the attacker. But you have to realize that that takes a special set of skills that not everyone has. There's a reason why bouncers and bodyguards have to be specially trained. And yes, if a guy punches a girl after she's punched him, he'll likely hurt her more than she hurt him. But it's just strange to me how even when I've painted a scenario where a woman is attacking a man, some people's main concern still seems to be on the well-being of the violent female attacker over her innocent male victim. Someone who assaults another person forfeits any and all rights of their well-being, being taken into consideration by their victim. If someone attacks you, I say you do whatever you need to to get them to stop. If you're some sort of MMA master who can disable them without hurting them at all, great, more power to you. But for the rest of us, no. We are under no obligation to just sit there and take a beating. If anyone who's still worried that a woman in this situation might get hurt more than the man she's attacking, look, maybe it's high time these women learn what most guys were taught in school, which is that you don't pick fights with someone bigger than you. In any case, though, that's all I have to say for now, and as always, I would love to know what you guys think. Should a man be allowed to hit a woman in self-defense? Why or why not? And what can we do to provide more support for male domestic abuse victims? Let me know, but that's it for now. Thank you guys so much for tuning in, and I'll see you next time."
