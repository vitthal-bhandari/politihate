    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucks, sex and show podcast third hour of the clay Travis and bucks sex and show gets going right now everybody. Thank you for being with us. We had Joe Biden just address the nation on the the devastation in Florida and the oncoming hurricane now the continuation of hurricane Ian into South Carolina and that part of the coastal southeastern US. So our thoughts are going out to everybody who's been already affected in Florida and also those who are going to be bearing the brunt here of a less extreme but still dangerous hurricane Ian in the southeastern United States. One thing that I'd mentioned at the top of the of the program today, the first hour, if you missed it, please go check out the clay and buck podcast is that Russia has now had a a sham referendum effectively in a number of parts of Eastern and Southern Ukraine. And so now they are officially Russian Federation territory according to Russia. I had thought all along in fact in the beginning of this conflict at the start of this year, I'd said that Russia is just going to carve up and take parts of Ukraine into its territory. Their question really was how much I bring this up because our team was monitoring this. And Biden spoke about what's going on right now in Ukraine. And here's what he said. He's his neighbor's territory and get away with as simple as that. And they're going to stay the course going to continue to provide military equipment so the Ukraine can defend itself. And this territory and its freedom, including additional resources that the Congress is going to give me today of 13 billion more dollars to help the Ukrainians defend themselves and fight back. And we're fully prepared to defend. I want to say this again. America is fully prepared prepared with our NATO allies to defend every single inch of NATO territory every single inch. So Mr. Putin don't misunderstand what I'm saying every inch. So Clay, we're sending now billions more to to Ukraine. I have never heard the president talk about what the negotiated settlement. It seems like this administration has decided this war ends when Russia loses. And they keep saying this without ever even explaining what does that mean? Does it mean that Russia is losing all of the territory even territory that had taken from Ukraine, stretching back seven now going on eight years ago? Does it mean the fall of Putin as the leader of Russia? There seems to be a mission creep underway here for us and for our allies in Europe. That's very concerning when Putin is giving. I mean, I could look up some of the quotes. The speech that he just gave is is scary. I mean, it's something I mean, he says he hears the headline the BBC Putin raises the stakes in speech full of anti Western bile. And he's talking about obviously the the incorporation or the seizure of this territory. He said the Oh, sorry, the United States Biden said we'll never never recognize Russia's claim on Ukraine, sovereign territory. So what does that mean? Because taking this territory back from Russia is going to take a long time and more than billions of dollars years, theoretically. Now, maybe there's just going to end up being some sort of tacit, you know, boundaries drawn and both sides are going to stay armed and there'll just be some sort of agreement on where that line is when that would actually happen and how it would happen. I don't know. Also, we talked about this and it would have been a major, major story all week, but for Hurricane Ian coming in. But there's still this great who done it associated with the Nord Stream pipelines and Joe Biden also discussed that just now and said it was a deliberate act of sabotage, which seems clear. Listen to this. It was a deliberate act of sabotage. And now the Russians are pumping out this information lies. We work with our allies to get to the bottom exactly what precisely would happen. And as my direction have already begun to help our allies enhance the protection of this critical infrastructure. And if the appropriate moment when things come down, we're going to send the divers down to find out exactly what happened. So we don't know that yet. Exactly. But we're not just don't listen to what Putin is saying. We know it's not true. The biggest challenge I would say in general, Buck is whatever your politics are, even listening to Joe Biden make all of those comments. He sounds like a weak and enfeebled person. And we know this week he tried to say hi to a dead congresswoman and he couldn't find his way off the stage multiple times. We are dealing right now with one of the most dangerous moments in modern global history. I think it's fair to say certainly in the 21st century in terms of the geopolitical significance of what's going on. And the danger, World War three is truly looming out there. Do you feel at all like Biden is up to making intelligent reason decisions as it pertains to this situation at all? Because I don't know it. And when you hear him saying outright that we will never accept Russia's seizure of any territory. Russia had a referendum in Crimea, what, seven years ago now? I'm going to go back. I mean, it's been a while. They've already, they already took. So is Crimea a part of this will never accept the seizure of Ukrainian territory is the Donbas region of Eastern Ukraine. Part of this as well. I mean, Putin said in response to a couple things, one on the pipeline blast issue, he has accused Western elites. He gave a speech announcing these ref this referendum areas that are effectively the border regions of Eastern and Southern Ukraine that now connects. There's a kind of a half moon, if you will, of Russian seized territory that connects Crimea to the Russian Federation now by land bridge because it's all it's all contiguous. So Putin warned that Western elites are adopting outright Satanism by blaming them for the nor blaming Russia for the Nord Stream gas pipeline blast. Everyone's saying blast, by the way, just to be clear, there's no one who's saying this was the accident. The stuff happens. Yeah. Pipeline's complicated. Everyone's saying sabotage. And Putin also said that the United States had set a precedent in nuclear usage by dropping atomic bombs on Japan. Now, okay, we can keep saying this is saber rattling. We can keep saying, you know, people also said Putin crazy is not the right word to use malevolent insidious, but he is clearly a crafty individual. You know, this is not like North Korea where he came into power because of who his father was. It's effectively, as we know, a monarchy. This is a guy who made his way to the pinnacle of power in Russia. So bad guy, yes, crazy guy. Remember the movie speed? Remember that? Oh, yeah, back in the day. That's one of my favorite. I mean, the Matrix is the best Keanu Reeves movie. Your John Wick fans. I respect you. I like John Wick to the Matrix one is better than John Wick one. You can fight with me all day on this. I'm right. But speed was a fun flick. I bring it up. Sandra Pollock made her a star. That was one of her one of her best moments because there's a scene with Dennis Hopper. Remember Dennis Hopper? Yeah. And they say that he's seated in the crazy, but not stupid section. Putin is not even seated in the, oh, sorry, Putin is in the not crazy and not stupid section. He's a guy who maybe seems a little bit off the people, but he's actually very cunning, very strategic in how he approaches things. And so that's why that mean the usage of Putin as this figure, we can just ignore everything he says. Okay, but how long do we think a war is going to be able to grind on where we give billions of dollars to his enemy here? And look, we're not far away from in theory, the winter season arriving there, in which case everybody's just entrenched and things can't move very much, right? We're probably six weeks, eight weeks away in Europe. Remember, they didn't invade until the end of February because they had to wait out the snow season to be able to even move. So I think the point is well taken. How many years potentially of trench warfare could we be dealing with here? And at what point does Putin get frustrated enough to basically use an accelerant here and decide that he's going to do something that takes us to the next level and require us to figure out and determine what our response is going to be? Because what do you think? Well, what do we do? Let's play this out. If he used a localized nuke, right? Not a tactical nuclear weapon or low yield nuclear weapon. Yeah. What do we do? Like what good options do we have? We have protocol. I mean, I'm sure you could roll out thousands of pages of highly classified response from the Pentagon, you know, whatever levels of the basement there, they're keeping these things in. It's actually going to be kept, obviously, electronically, not a hard copy of boy or actually we're both. Yeah. What do you think? What we would do though? I mean, like, the point is that we have doctrine, but doctrine is just like a suggestion box, right? Doctrine is we think we would do this, but in the moment it's not really clear and look at the leadership we have. That's what I'm saying. I mean, I think we have people who, I don't know, they're always trashing Trump, you know, and saying, oh, he's not smart. He's not a reader. He watches too much TV, whatever. Trump at a gut level had brilliant political instincts. You know, his political instincts about people were very sound, particularly about a lot of the adversaries that we have globally. Remember, he got in all that, all that media hubbub because Trump said, look, Putin, what he's done. I mean, he said genius sarcastically. Yes. But he was talking about the Russian invasion and he sees Putin as what I was saying, somebody who is cagey. I mean, it might seem crazy to people, but it's actually somebody who has a totally different value system that he's approaching and a totally different strategic endpoint that he's trying to get to. I don't, I don't know what we would do. And I don't know what the Biden administration really thinks is going to happen here other than the continuation of the status quo, which is that we fund all of this stuff that's going up. But the, the pipeline getting blown up, I mean, this is an escalation. One way or the other, whether it's Russia or anybody else, it's an escalation. And we don't ever talk about these things as escalations. We just, it's, it's almost like we're sending checks to Ukraine, you know, not having any fighting a proxy war or fighting a proxy war. And by the way, the Ruble, I just checked this up. Like 28% so far this year. Yep. Just shot. Just saw up against the dollar. It was up even over 40% of what, but let's call it roughly 30% the Ruble has gone up. Remember, we were going to the beginning of this triple rush. People telling us now, we're not going to abandon one inch of Ukrainian territory. By the way, way more concerned with Ukraine's borders than America's borders. As we know, those same people were telling us in January and February, we're going to destroy the Russian economy and they'll bring them to their knees and they'll stop this war. The Ruble is up 30%. I just don't think we have very many good options. And I certainly don't think we have a very good leader to handle and dissect those options. And this is part and parcel and I'm a huge optimist. You know this, I think 2023 is going to be one of the most challenging years that we have had on multi fronts, right? COVID was and everything that it created was supremely challenging. But I'm talking about everything that Biden is touching is getting worse and it feels to me like things are only going to get worse in 2023 as we come into a third full year of Biden. And I don't know where exactly that's going, but when you look at inflation, when you look at the stock market, when you look at the border, when you look at crime and you consider what's going on in Ukraine right now, it feels like there are an awful lot of potential powder kegs that are about to go off. Our government loves to spend money. You know that enough so that we're contending with record setting inflation already and it's not going to win anytime soon. That reckless spending is driving up the costs on everything for your family. There are things you can do right now to lower your monthly expenses and mitigate the impact of inflation. One of them is switching your cell phone service to pure talk. You'll get cell phone service on America's most reliable 5G network. There's zero sacrifice and coverage.

Our number two clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. Appreciate all of you out there hanging out with us. Hope you're having a fantastic early start to your weekend and certainly we are continuing to monitor all the fallout from Hurricane Ian in Florida as well as watching and seeing what the impact is going to be in both North and South Carolina and even Virginia. Georgia as well as this storm in now comes in on the Atlantic seaboard and crosses those states over the next several days when all of you to stay safe and hope that if you were in the midst of Hurricane Ian in Florida, that you are able to find the help that you need to get started on rebuilding down in Florida and we're not going to let this story disappear. We will be helping out many of you in Southwest Florida in particular as we get into the next week and become able to see what needs to be done in particular to get people back up on their feet down there. Buck bunch of other things we're going to get into in the next couple hours and culture is going to be in studio with us. Ainsley Earhart from Fox and Friends who many of you start your mornings with will also be in studio with us here in New York City. We're about to give you some updates here in this hour on the ongoing battles in the Senate as trend lines continue to break in the direction of Republicans, even though a lot of people out there have not talked about it to a great extent. We'll give you some of the latest data out there polling and gambling lies on many of these elections. But one of the guys who writes for me at Outkick, Joe Kinsey has done a fantastic job, Buck, covering much of this transgender insanity as it pertains to athletics. And I just want to share a story that he posted in the last hour from the state of Vermont. There is a boy who has decided that he identifies as a girl that is using the women's locker room in a high school in Vermont. And this is in Burlington, Vermont. Randolph High School, the girls complained because a boy who identifies as a girl was using the locker room and changing with the girls. Parents and athletes raised concerns with the school. And what do you think happened? The transgender protections out there essentially said the biological girls, the girls were the problem. And email said, there's plenty of space. This went out to the school. But they said, because of Vermont law, there is, quote, plenty of space where students who feel uncomfortable with the laws may change in privacy. If you are a girl who was uncomfortable with there being a boy who is using your locker room, if he identifies as a girl, there is no way for you to use your locker rooms now in Vermont. And the reason why I think these stories matter, Buck, is we hear all the time, oh, there's no issue with transgender athletes out there. And then we see we got a dude winning the women's swimming championships in the NCAA and slowly this is becoming a reality all over the country where boys decide to identify as girls. And I mean, it sounds like a made up, ridiculous story, but they now are able to have equal access to women's locker rooms. And when the girls complain, they say, well, there's other places you could go if you need privacy inside of your locker room. I mean, what kind of crazy world are we living in when we're allowing this to happen? First of all, the most, well, the most dishonest argument is when they say men can get pregnant, right? I mean, the most dishonest argument is when they say things. Parenthood doctor said yesterday on testify. You know what, actually, let's just I wasn't going to go here right now, but you're right, Clay. We should just let everyone know plan. Parenthood of Texas said yesterday on Capitol Hill that, yeah, this is a doctor saying men can get pregnant. Let's just keep it real simple. Dr. Kumar, can biological men become pregnant and give birth? So men can have burdenscies, especially trans men. First of all, why men can have pregnancies like he's asking a question. Can men be pregnant? The answer is no. Yes. At some point in the future with new technology or whatever, maybe they'll be able to do womb transplants, et cetera. We were discussed that. Dr. Artica Kerry told us that. That might be a reality. It was pretty mind blowing. And at that point, I guess we will have to say it is theoretically possible. It is not even theoretically possible right now for this to happen, meaning it's not even something that science can do. So you have doctors who are lying to Congress, but really they're trying to change the plain meaning of languages where they get into the difference in sex and gender and all these things that they've just made up five minutes ago. But one. So that's the most dishonest argument. But another one is to the point about the women changing at this is a high school, right? At this high school, they say it's not a big problem. Why do you know the most dishonest like leftists, especially you see some of these leftists pundits who want to pretend like, you know, they're tough guys. And they'll be like, yeah, that's right. Men can get pregnant. It's like no one even cares about this. It's not even really an issue. That's a lie. Yes, it's a lie because they want to amend Title 9 to include gender identity. So they want to change federal law to this end. So if it isn't really a thing and whenever we talk about it, this is just hide the football, so to speak. This is just, you know, oh, the moment that there's focus on it, they don't want to have to defend it. So they pretend that it's not really an issue at all. They're trying to amend Title 9, the Biden administration was pushing for this. They want to do it. So that's a huge sweeping federal law. And on top of that, I would add, notice how there's never any consideration given to the feelings. Put aside for a second, we had, I spoke to Riley Gaines. You're right with her. Yes. Thank you, sir. She's very former Kentucky swimmer who was on with Rand Paul and she is speaking out against the idea of biological men being able to compete against women. So usually this debate becomes, well, okay, maybe she had to share the podium with a biological male. She's been a great swimmer. You know, it's not like there's millions of dollars. It's like they try to minimize losing to a transgender female as though it's not a big deal in this case and that the feelings of the woman should be made secondary to the need to be inclusive. That's right. But in this case, it's home on a second. Why does a transgender male, why is it so important that a transgender male has to change in a female locker room and such that the females in that locker room, their feelings are irrelevant. That's right. This is what's going on in this high school. This is what's happened in many other of these cases. It's, oh, you're uncomfortable with this. Women too bad. We have an agenda here. We're lunatic leftists and this is the way it's going to be. They never take into account. I mean, you know, if I had like a, if I had a 13 or 14 year old daughter, yes, and there was a 14 year old boy changing next to her, I would have a problem with that and she would have a problem with that and that doesn't make them bad people or doesn't make her a bad person. It just means that they're reflecting on the separation of the genders as a privacy issue and a respect issue. And notice that there's no respect given to these women. It's obey the trans agenda or else. Yeah. And I think one way to think about it for everybody out there, first of all, the policy as it's written in Vermont says a transgender student should not be required to use a locker room or restroom that conflicts with the student's gender identity. So if you are a boy who decides that he is a girl, you cannot be made to use the boys locker room. But to me, the way to think about this, that that makes a lot of sense is at some point tolerance expands to such an arena that it becomes intolerant of other people's opinions. And that's the good way to think about this. Like the idea is this transgender student has to have his decisions tolerated to such an extent that the girls own opinions are considered to be intolerant. Right. At some point, you have conflicting spheres here where tolerance infringes upon the rights of someone else to be comfortable. And for the most part, I think everybody out there listening to us right now, the idea of a 15 or 16 year old boy just deciding to say he's a girl and he's going to use the girls locker room is crazy when any of us, especially if you are, I would say pretty much 25 or older, anybody who's in the 25 or older camp, if you had ever even tried this, you probably would have gotten arrested, Buck. If you are an 18, 19 year old and you walk into a women's locker room for most of human history, you would be arrested for trespassing. There will be all sorts of laws that you are violating now. You're protected class. This is crazy. Think about this as well. Why is it this is all based in this in this high school story talking about, but this has happened in other cases and it's happening all over the country right now. People forget. I mean, the Obama administration was was really a huge surge toward all of this. It was under Obama's second term that they I believe he even said, I know it was from the White House. I think Obama himself essentially threatened to pull federal funding from the school system in was it I was confused. It was North or South Carolina, North Carolina, right? North Carolina, they were going to pull federal funds over the bathroom policy over this exact issue. But just as we think this through, why is it that consideration for the emotional needs of a person who is male and has male genitalia exceeds and really erases the emotional needs and the need for safety and dare I say safe space of women in this case as in, why is it? OK, if we're all supposed to use, you know, call, we're going to call Bob Jill now and you know, you can change your name fine and they're going to say, we have to use the female pruning and say, all right, maybe that that's a matter of respect. But why does the burden fall upon women to have to deal with this and the emotional discomfort? Why can't the transgender female in this case just change with the men? It's not that big a deal. They'll say it's not that big a deal to the women. They will not say it's not that big a deal to the transgender men and we should all ask why. And let's be honest, Buck. There's also now because of these stupid policies going to be a bunch of teenage boys who just decide that they're going to identify as girls so they can go change the girls locker room. I mean, this is this is the recipe, the crazy that we are unspooling here does not end and maybe that's what has to ultimately happen is it becomes so ridiculous that we go back to, hey, you know, boys and girls need to change separately. I know some some true leftists and I do talk to them occasionally about these things, you know, be all fair and in places where I'm just trying to get information and the real answer to my question, by the way, why is it that the women have to, you know, we ask these questions. We're approaching this rationally. The ultimate answer to all of this is that to be a true believer and it almost requires a religious tran, like a transformation of perception that is religious in nature, a transgender female is a woman the exact same way in the in the left's mind and the left's methodology. It is a woman, a hundred percent, no difference. So in their minds, the true leftist believes that women who don't want to change with a person with male genitals, they're the crazy one. Yeah. And I know that that is an upside down. What does Buck say that I'm telling everybody that is the real belief of the left? It's not that we need to make accommodations for trans women. It's that trans women are women period, which is why they say men can get pregnant. And it's also evidence, I think, Buck, of how left wing insanity doesn't stop. They always have to find something more. It really is a slippery slope. Would you have believed a decade ago that we would have fights over people who are deciding boys are deciding to identify as girls and they get to just walk right in the locker room. And if you complain, the Vermont schools shut down the locker room, Buck. Yeah. I mean, they're just like, oh, the only way we can solve this is just not let anybody. So women suffer the consequences. The emotional needs and the desire to feel safe of women is irrelevant when the trans agenda is at work. That's what the left is telling. And here's what has to happen. Women have to speak out on this sooner or later. Real women like Riley Gaines is doing. You talk to her on Wednesday, women have to speak out and go to war over this.

But they're also censoring us, Buck. Like everybody out there who listens and heard our interview with Donald Trump at Bedminster back in July. Yesterday afternoon we get an email saying that YouTube has pulled that interview for election misinformation and that you can no longer out there watch it on YouTube. And what's wild about this is not only the censorship, it's that this show often interviews people and when we interview political thought leaders and or potential elective candidates for office, certainly the former president of the United States, how in the world in a democracy, Buck? Can you justify taking down an interview with one of the most popular politicians in the world, whether you agree or disagree with what Trump is saying, the essence of a democracy is being able to familiarize yourself with the opinions of people who run for office. So we saw this yesterday. We got the official strike notification from YouTube and it seemed to me that also in their guidelines, there's this there was election misinformation. And and we didn't try to correct it or something because obviously we didn't say we just were talking to the former president of the United States, the future president of the United States. So like usually I think we let him have his say, I'm not going to sit there be like, sure, you're not allowed to say that. So interesting though that they really that the attitude of the libs with this stuff is that they want to co-opt you into doing their bidding. It's like, well, you didn't push back hard enough, really? Because do they do they have that push back hard enough demand on all the videos of people who said that the COVID vaccines were going to eliminate COVID and that they're going to be 95% effective? Where are the push back demands on that? I just if they wanted to cancel us, I would disagree with it clearly because I think that marketplace of ideas is important. But when you have guests on and interview them and they are candidates for political office, you should want to have those distributed as widely as possible so that the people who make decisions when it comes to voting, i.e. you, me and everybody else out there should be able to familiarize yourself with the opinions of these candidates as much as possible. So the other thing that really strikes me, Buck, is the people who are screaming that fascism is out there and and and and and oh, the the awful right wing they're actually the totalitarian because they are not allowing their their opponents to have their opinion shared. Who is actually the threat to democracy? Let's think about this. We're right in the run up to an election. Yes. This is clearly not just happening. There's going to be other people this happens to as well. And I'm at the point where any conservative who has never been, you know, ding suspended or booted off of Twitter YouTube. I'm like, well, what are you doing? Yeah, it's not possible to be in these fights and somehow not ever get throttled or suspended on Facebook or Twitter in any way. But they went back to an old video. I think this is one they're they're showing everybody were cracking down or cracking down and for some people, it's a really we don't care. For some people, it's a really important revenue stream. Their YouTube is their business for us. Our radio and podcasts is our business. Look, when I ran out kick and they would throttle us down and not allow our stories to be shared, it was a major impact to our overall. It could cause being able to be able to be employed. And also, I think that hysterical lives are now going and flagging this stuff in an effort to create this groundswell of suppression of information in the run up to the election. So there's, you know, this is like, do you ever get this things on Twitter where they're like, we have received a report from Germany that you violated. German start you two seven five fun, fun, fun, fun, and you're like, wait, I don't live in German. Why is Twitter getting mad at me because of those emails to I don't understand. Welcome back to Clay Travis and Buck Sexton show. We are here in studio with Ainsley Earhart of Fox News. You all know her from Fox and Friends in the mornings. She has a new book out. I'm so glad you were born celebrating who you are. Ainsley, first time in with us. Thanks so much for joining us in the program. Thank you all so much. I'm so proud of you all. You're doing great. Thank you. We have a lot of fun. We do. We are a little tired after last night, which I know you're never supposed to say all the air, but we were out quite a bit. We were talking about what happened last night. I went home. We had a little bit of an engagement party here in New York and Clay, I must admit, stayed out. Clay is married with three kids. He stayed out later than me. He made out, paced me. I got sent home early by the fiance. I we had an awesome group of people and it spiraled into a Irish pub from the engagement party. And it was just a really fun. We took over an Irish pub as a parent. We did basically take over an Irish pub. So for people who are listening that don't know the Irish pubs, they're everywhere. Yes, downtown. When I started at Fox News, there was an Irish pub before it was torn down for a parking garage. There was this one Irish pub that everyone went to and we had it like a back room and that was where all the Fox people would hang out. But those are the early years of Fox. It was so fun. When did you get to Fox for the first time 2007? So did you come when you came to Fox from where? San Antonio, Texas. So was it a culture shock for you to suddenly be in New York City? Well, I'm an East Coast drug group in South Carolina. I worked there for five years after college, then did San Antonio. And I always wanted New York. That was my dream. San Antonio, like as a city, I always hear people say great things about it. It was super safe, family friendly, quality of life very high. Y'all, but you would love it. There are big parties there. There's the yesterday. I have to carry on a shoulder, but yeah. A year ago, you would have liked it. Now you're engaged and slowing down a little bit. I'm glad I'm proud of you. No, it was so fun because they love their faith, which is important to me. And they loved a party, which is important to me. So it's like the best of my career. Exactly. I went to a Southern school. Yeah, we're SEC double grads here. So I can't stay out as late as I used to, but I like to have fun and the faith aspect was great. It was a wonderful place. So we have this fabulous book here. It is in studio with us. I'm so glad you were born celebrating who you are. It's a kids book. Yes. Clay has copies. His kids are a little old maybe for the day. You're old, I think, could handle this a little bit. So a second grader. I've got 14. I've got 12 and I've got eight. They just had a couple of birthday. So I got to make sure I got that right. I'll tell you this. This message though, even if you don't read the book to them, the message I'm so glad you were born is something my mom said to us on our birthdays, which if you think about it means a little bit more than just happy birthday, even though happy birthday is great, it's something that you hear every birthday and everyone says it. I'm so glad you were born is like, OK, wait a minute, I have to stop and think that's pretty cool that I was born on this day and I'm going to make a big difference and I can change the world. God can you use me to change the world? You have a young daughter. I do. She's six and a half. How much did that motivate wanting to write a children's book? You know what it's like as a parent. Yeah, you have three boys. That's right. So six and a half. My first two books, my first two children's books were lyrical and like sappy sweet what I was going through and I was pregnant. I was so glad I had her and we'd gone through a lot. I tried to get pregnant. I had a miscarriage and then three months later I conceived Hayden. So I knew I had gone through that bad place because I wouldn't have Hayden if it weren't for that really tough time. And this book is just about now I'm six years, six and a half years past that and how much I love being a mom is so fun. I just want her to come home. We all grew up in the in the generation where our parents were so tough and I grew up in South Carolina. There were spankings, you know, and I mean, not too hard. I was a girl and I rarely. You know what a switch is. Yes, I do. And to pick it out, right? Actually, my mom used to fly swatter and my dad one time when we used a belt. Usually it was his hand and it hurt him more than it hurt me. I saw that I knew that, but it was it was rare. My brother, however, probably every day. But now, you know, I live in New York. He did. He did. Now I'm in New York and that's just not the way that we punish our children. It's more time timeouts. I'm grateful that I have a really pretty fairly easy child to raise. So I mean, I can just kind of raise my voice a little bit. She calls it the dark voice and then I feel like Darth Vader. But and then she starts crying. But I love her so much and we just have fun. We have dance parties in the kitchen. So she she picked out the illustrator for this book. We put all the pictures on the floor of the illustrators that the publisher sent me that were available at the time. And so I said, Hayden, which one do you like? And thankfully she picked the one I was really drawn to. So this is our illustrator, Kim Barnes. And Hayden loves this one picture in the book. Hayden, we talked to the illustrator about the dance parties and how important they were for us to show the dance parties in the kitchen. Because that's where we have ours and kind of they trail off into the living room. But this illustrator drew a picture of a fence in the backyard and their backyard and she lets her children paint use real paint on the fence. Yeah. I mean, it covers the whole backyard like my dad would have lost. I definitely would have gotten the belt for that one, right? But yeah, so she my my daughter said, I really want to do that. And I'm like, well, we rent a house out in Long Island from one of my friends. And she probably would kick us out if we painted her fence. So we're not doing that. But I just love the illustrator. I love the message and at the end of the book, the children yell out, I'm so glad I was born. You're about to go through this. You just got engaged. No, I know. I need to hear. Yeah, I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to start I'm going to start leaving through this. I do have a it's actually perfect because I was talking before about my two year old nephew who is his name is Ryan and he's absolutely amazing. And I've I've never really spent time around kids that small a small person like that. Oh, it's so much fun. The best thing and this is actually true. I sent Clay the video to prove this. My mom, she's very proud. She has a little from one of our events, you know, sometimes they do these radio events. They have a little poster with our faces on it, you know, Clay Travis and Buck's Exon show and little Ryan walks past it and points and goes uncle Buck, which is obviously very exciting. And he also goes uncle Clay. I'll take it. That's good. I like anyone in there. I we're going to give him honor. Starting him early, he listens to y'all every day. Yeah, well, he just knows the he knows from the from the photo and my parents, I guess, when he asked who it is, so he's learned he hasn't I don't know if he's listening quite yet. We're going to get him. He's a little patriot for sure. We absolutely work. So you are from South Carolina. I am. Yes, we're watching this. We're watching this right now on Fox News. We've got and you have your sister, I think you said, is in Charleston. You were going to do a book signing in Charleston on King Street right in downtown Charleston. So what are you hearing from people in South Carolina as they prepare for Hurricane Ian, which is now making landfall? No one at home can see this, but I'm getting all these text messages and all these pictures and people who left their cars in their driveways and but everything looks OK to be honest with you. I don't know one person that left and we were all panicking. This is our immediate family in our family text chain and my sister finally wrote us back because we were all on her like get out, move your car. The garages are free right now. You can move your car into one of the third, fourth deck of the garage. She just wrote us for the first time in like 15 hours. All is well here. Car is fine just without power. So my dad writes back good answer prayers next time. Leave exclamation exclamation exclamation. She's a school teacher there and so she she's with all of her friends and we were interviewed Rick Scott this morning. He's not leaving. I mean, he's the senator. He can't leave because he wants to take care of his people. He said his mom was staying. He bought his mom a house when he became a senator and had enough money, which is a sweet story. So he said he and his mom were staying. He was going to pick her up. My sister staying. My sister is actually in Mount Pleasant. So downtown Charleston is that peninsula go over the Cooper River Bridge. And then you run into Mount Pleasant and she's right there. But she's two stories up. She lives in an apartment building. But for people who haven't been to Charleston, they've seen certainly that there's a very low sea level in many parts of Florida. Charleston is almost underwater. I mean, below sea level. I just looked it up before we got here and I don't know if this is correct because this is just a Google search, but it said eight feet above sea level. The surge is supposed to be like between seven and nine. So it could go above my sister when she lived downtown. She was driving through the streets just to try to get to her house and her car was completely flooded. She lost the car. It was my mom's old car. This is right after college. She just left her left her car there in the middle of the road and had to walk out of the car. So even with a minor storm, it floods. So hopefully people got out of Charleston at least and went inland. I mean, with Florida, we know that that's there. They're always thinking about and ready for hurricane season. What was the last time you go? Part of it. You go that really we've had some others, but Hugo was the big one. And what we learned about Hugo is devastating as it was. There is have you ever been to Isla Palms or wild dunes or Sullivan's Island? Yes. Right outside of Charleston. What we learned, it wiped out those beaches. And those were like it was so fun. It was old school beach houses like where you would go and there's like grit and sand on the on the floor and just old furniture. Those were all demolished and they built these monstrosities on that property. And many people got made a lot of money because they sold their houses and made these, you know, built these huge properties and they they built them higher. So their own stilts. So you park your car underneath the house and then on the first floor of the bedrooms and the top floor kitchen den and all that so you can overlook the ocean. So now it's beautiful. Those, you know, $50,000 houses are now multi million dollar houses. That's happened all over the south in many different communities where they initially built like school. Yeah, like down in Florida, like along the Florida Gulf Coast used to be the red neck or the air. Those things didn't cost anything. And now they're all gone. It's, you know, multi million air. Is that 30? Yeah, 30. Yeah. Buck's got to come down there. He hasn't been, you know, bucket never been really to the south at all. In like, I'm talking about like Alabama. I'm not my family is from Virginia, sir. I'm like, Charlotte, I'm not from, you know, Northern Virginia. I'm talking about like Alabama, Mississippi. That's still kind of, I mean, Florida doesn't, it depends on what part of Florida you're in. It can spend some time in these places, but only on military bases. But you know, that means y'all are a good team. You represent. Well, I've got it down now for college football. So you're on a Southern military base. You definitely, you definitely know you're in the south. But you have a rag on Buck a little bit. Buck went to high school at and y'all don't know this in the south, the hardest school to get into in the city. And it's all scholarship and you cannot get in unless you are top of your class. I know people out on Long Island that commute in high schoolers that drive that ride the train for an hour to get into the city just so they can go to reach us. That's very great. Yeah, you get you see, I'm getting I'm getting the rough stuff from clay over here. So she throws me. I will say, Ainsley, you know, who also went there? Dr. Fauci. Yeah, class of 1910. Fauci he rolled really good. He's a buck went to the same high school. That's right. That's great. A hundred years ago. So yeah, Fauci was there. Ainsley, the book looks awesome. I'm so glad you were born celebrating. Why I'm sorry, celebrating who you are. I'm so glad you're born. Go get a copy today. I just say one thing. My mom had a stroke four and a half years ago and she doesn't have a voice anymore. So I don't know how many days we have left with her. She's kind of slowing down. And she lives in our basement with 24 hour care. And this is something she said to us. She was a school teacher for fours and five year olds for 33 years retired. Reluctantly, my aunt talked her into it because she had diabetes and she said, I don't know how long you have. And mom retired. She traveled with my dad for about 10 years, had the stroke dialysis, kidney failure. And now her voice is going to be heard and carried on for generations. Oh, that's so awesome. I love you. I'm sorry. I gave you a hard time. That's amazing. Thank you for the cop. I'm going to take you from my old nephew. If you want to buy a signed book, it's Ainsley book.com. And then if you want to go to my website and see where we'll be, we had to cancel the thing today at Charleston. I'm so sorry, but we'll be in Florida on Sunday. It's Ainsley E.
