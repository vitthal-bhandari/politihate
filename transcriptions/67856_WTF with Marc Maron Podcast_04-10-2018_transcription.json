Welcome to it. How you feeling? Everything okay? How'd that thing turn out? Yeah? Did you get the test back? It's good? Oh, all right. Well, you just got to see what happens. Today on the show, Sissy Spacek is here. That's a lot of S's for me. As some of you know, I have a slight but barely noticeable list because I don't say my S's correctly nor do I say my R's correctly. All right, that's why GRA RANA is very difficult for me. And thank you for the emails about how to pronounce GRA RANA. But it doesn't matter. Now I'm not doing that today. That's not part of the show. But Sissy Spacek is a lot of S's. Sissy Spacek and Squared Space, a lot of S's today. And I think the more I don't want to, I don't want you to focus on it. But I'm excited to have her. It was a very pleasant talk. And she's a very unique being, Sissy Spacek, one of the great actresses of her generation of all time, continues to be that. And she's she's unique. I mean, you saw Carrie. I mean, maybe you'll go see Old Man in the Gum with Robert Redford, which is in theaters right now in select cities. But Sissy Spacek, Badlands, you saw that too. I mean, she's almost otherworldly. Sissy Spacek. So when she came in, it was she's very, very nice, very grounded person. Very, she's from Texas. Texas. You ever driven across Texas? That's a long fucking day or two. Yeah, because I once had to cut up from the Gulf all the way through to New Mexico, Northern New Mexico. I went on the diagonal all the way through Texas. And you just sort of drive. And then all of a sudden, it's like, hey, is that a town? Hey, Eric, was that a town? Was that a what kind like one? There was a an old truck there and a place that had a door. It was just a lot of that. And then there were big cities. But a lot of like, Oh, what's this? Is this store? Oh, no, that's that store hasn't been opened in. Wow. Long time. Geez. How was that tractor? Hey, is this a hey, is that a town? Nope. Nope, it's not. I don't even know what that is. That's a that's my impression of driving across Texas. Hey, look, some hills kind of. Well, are we over them? Yep, that was it. Seems kind of dry. I remember got pulled over in Texas and it caught past me what I was doing in Texas. I was doing comedy and he just looked at me and laughed and let me go. How often does that happen? That was back in the day, back in the day, people. So what is on my mind? Oh, shit, did the president text me? Yeah, I'm wondering how those presidential alerts are going to be popping up. This guy just cannot be in our fucking faces up our asses in our brains in our ears enough. It's just the more he stays in the news, the more we got to see his face. I'm so tired of his face. And then his tweets, I don't follow him on Twitter. But now I guess he can just text everybody text things like, it's not safe to vote today. Yeah, wait for that text. Wow. I guess he was worried that not everyone was on Twitter. So I mean, what do you give him two weeks before the president of alerts are just his shitty tweets. Man, exciting as we slowly normalized a complete immersion into this Trump ego. Just like, yeah, that's kind of weird. Yeah, it is weird until the presidential alert. Hey, it'd really help out if some of my people could attack California. Wait, what? I live here. That's, I guess that's not for us is that that's a joke, right? Hey, what? Why do I hear trucks outside? Setting some scenes today. Ah, update on the Joker don't know when I'm going to be shooting yet. But it's coming. It's coming. I know my lines. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to launch. This seats for tonight, Thursday and Saturday at Dynasty typewriter here in LA are sold out. So that's nice. That's a good thing. Right? Well, you know what? I want to tell you this. I yesterday I spoke to my old buddy, Ted Alexandra for an upcoming WTF episode. I've known Ted a long time. He's a New York guy. He's a Queens guy. He's a solid guy. You know, very earnest, honest, funny dude. You might have seen the little viral thing that he did from the seller about Louis and the culturally living. But I never really had an opportunity to talk to him. He was on a live one a while back, but he's got a special coming out. It's it's called senior class of earth. It's available today from all things comedy. You go to atc specials.com to get it. And you can watch it. He's a very smart, very funny guy. We just couldn't sync it up to put his episode on today because this is basic as today. But go check him out. And that'll be up in a few weeks. It was a good comic talk was smart. We talked about purpose. That's what it is. What's your purpose? If it's not clear to most people, I can't take it. I can't, you know, I can't, it's relentless. What's going on? Brett Kavanaugh, jock douche partisan hack, probably going to get confirmed. You know, I just, I guess this is just my semi weekly PSA. I hope the voting works and I hope you do it. Presidential alert. I'm president for life. Go fuck yourselves. Winning. Oh, that was another lunatic. Believe me, presidential alert. I, you know, I've got a lot of things going on in my mind. And we just have to go on with our days despite the fact that there is just this vibrating dread of a diminishing future hanging over us. Where's the hope? I got some hope. Maybe, maybe a nice email. Maybe a nice email would be nice. Right? Wouldn't that be nice? A nice email? Here's one subject line. Please help. My dad really likes your podcast. Won't shut up about it. How do I make him stop talking? Me and my mom suffer daily from this. Please respond. What? And then like, like the next day, again, same guy. By the way, he just bought merch. So it's getting worse. Hey, just be thankful. All right, that you have a dad that likes to talk about something. Imagine relatively interesting. I'm not saying I'm interesting, but okay, I guess what I'm trying to say is that I don't think my father has listened to one of these. All right, so shut up. Now, you know, say hi to your dad for me. Tell him I'm happy he's listening. And maybe you should start listening. How would that be? Maybe that would be good. And then you could talk to him about me and the guests I have. Yeah, try that. And also like, it just remind me I like to take a moment to to congratulate my friends, Adam and Roxanne on the birth of their new son. They know who they are. I don't need to tell you who they are, but congratulations on a sunny sweets. That's a I'm not that's the name they chose the two names. And I got to say a couple of good names. It's a couple of good names. That's a that's great. Yeah, welcome sunny sweets to the world. So Sissy Spasic, one of the great actresses, she's in a new film called The Old Man and the Gun with Robert Redford, which I saw. And a lot of great people in that movie, man. Tom Waits is in there. Danny Grover is in there. Ben Affleck's in there. Denzel's kids in there. A lot of great people in the movie. And and Sissy is one of them. She's also in a new Amazon dramatic series Homecoming with Julia Roberts that premieres on November 2nd. And and this is me, somewhat nervous, sweet talking to Sissy Spasic. It was very comfortable, actually. She's a very sweet woman and a great actress. So enjoy the talk. You don't live here anymore, do you? I don't live here anymore. We have a place out here. Oh, you do. Just so we don't have to stay in hotels. Right. But most of the time you spend in the country. And yeah, Virginia or in actually or in Austin. That's where I'm from. That's all my family's there. Right there in Austin? Yeah. Oh, because I thought like I noticed like this new film shot in Texas. I was wondering if it was sort of like, Oh, I'm back in Texas. I'm back at home. Yeah. I do feel like that. I have I have quite a lot of homes. Yeah, but I mean, I don't mean, you know, yeah, houses in my heart. Yeah, yeah. But like Texas, the original one. That's the original one. And is it well, I mean, it's in completely Austin's got to be completely different from when you're a kid. I mean, it's crazy. It is. I actually grew up in Northeast Texas and it's a much more rural area, a farming area, kind of the Piney Woods. Yeah. Oh, there's Piney Woods in northeastern Texas. Oh, yeah. It's beautiful there. It's much like it's it's where the the that whole mountain range, you know, the smokey mountain, the Blue Ridge Mount, the the they're all there. It starts there and then right. We just have little hills. Right. I grew up in New Mexico, like in Albuquerque. So I, you know, down in South South New Mexico, southern New Mexico, so I Texas and you drive. I mean, I've driven down all the way across Texas and those towns are just there. They're just like four buildings on a highway. I know. And then just miles of nothing. But I mean, they're farmland. You do love it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. I love I love Texas. Yeah. That's if that designed your consciousness, so a lot of space up there, huh? A lot of space. Yeah. A lot of space. And how would you like what kind of families you grow up in? Like what was the business? My father was a agriculturalist, soil and water conservationist. Uh huh. Did he work for the state? He did. Yeah. And he worked with farmers and, you know, helped them with their crops and yeah, tried to make it. He would grow anything. He was, you know, just he would bang on the door. Yeah. If he thought we were using too much water in the bathtub, bang on the bathroom. He was way ahead of the curve on that. And he was the way ahead of the conservation of water. Yeah. Because it must always been an issue there. Because it's pretty dry. It's pretty arid. Well, it is. But I think that his belief was there's one air and there's one water and we need to protect it. Yeah. And soil conservation. Because there's, in, you know, he wanted people to become aware of protecting their land from soil erosion. Right. And depleting it. Yeah. So that's that. And my mother was a, was precious and a homemaker. Uh huh. And was it like did you live on a big chunk of property? No, we lived in a little house in a little town. In the town. A little tiny town, a thousand people. So he never had his own farm or anything. Um, he did. But that was earlier in, and he never had a farm that he worked. He had a cotton farm in West Texas out in near Lubbock. Uh huh. And they, but that was, that was another life. That was before me. Yeah. And he decided he, he's going to get out of that racket. He was just a man of the land. Yeah. He appreciated the land. So he always like just driving around. Do you have a truck? No, we didn't have a truck. No, my, my father's family was Czech. Um, front like, he's like first generation American. No, my great grandfather was his grandfather was, they came over from Czechoslovakia. Yeah, they came over from actually it was, uh, Moravia was before Moravia, Slovakia and Bohemia. So it's really spa check is, is, uh, how it's pronounced, but it was never pronounced that way in Northeast Texas. Right. So it became basic. So, they did what they, they could challenge it. Yeah. If there's no age in it without it's written, we're not going to say the age. And my mother's family was, they were all, um, Irish English. So I had, and you know, there were no, no cowboy boots, no, you know, no pickup trucks. No, no, no, we had, you know, German sausage sausage. Uh huh. And, um, you know, it was very, very Czech that the town where my father grew up, which was in Central Texas. Yeah. Everyone spoke Czech and German probably to German and spoke and drank long neck ball beer. Yeah, it's weird. I, you know, learning about how the Germans came to Texas. They brought, they brought the polka and they brought the accordions. Yes, the accordions. But a love of the land. Uh huh. Just a real love of the land. Yeah. And, um, it's kind of beautiful. Yeah, there's still a lot of that. I think I imagine that some Texas barbecue is rooted back to the German. Oh, yeah. And you know, homemade pickles. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Relish. And it was, they brought all that. Yeah. So I, I really was fortunate to have a very, um, kind of ethnic, uh, I got to experience that, uh, ethnicity that I have, that is running through my veins. Yeah. And well, the Czechs very specific in English, Irish, that's pretty tough too. Yeah. Come from tough jeans. Oh my gosh. Yeah. Do you have, do you have relatives that are full on Irish and British and like, or no, my mother's family was, was like that. They were very, what did we, we, we've referred to them as threadbare gentility. Oh, nice. Yeah. Yeah. But they were lovely, genteel family. Good people. A lot of love and, and not much money. Well, that's good. A lot of sense. That's good. Decent people. Good, classy people. How many siblings do you have? Uh, I had a group of two brothers. Yeah. And are they, are they, they're not around anymore? Are they around? I have one brother. It was around. It was around. Yeah. The other passed away as a teenager. Oh my God. That's, that's sad. Yeah. How'd that happen? He died of leukemia. Oh wow. And how old are you? I was 18 and he was, or I was 17, almost 18. He was just turned 19. That's like devastating. Kind of mimicking. Yeah. I had really fabulous parents, though, who were insistent that it become something positive in our lives that we were able to do something with it. Otherwise you just become paralyzed and, you know, can't go on and be bitter and they didn't want that. So they were tough people. Yeah, they were tough people and they were wise people. I don't know if they were so tough, but they were very resilient and wise and religious. Uh, spiritual. Oh, okay. Spiritual. So they, oh, that's good. So there wasn't a big Christian rap on it. Well, I, I, not, um, my mother was always our Sunday school teacher. She just moved up with us because she didn't want us to be influenced by any fanatics. So she, she actually had the job. She had the job. She taught us the school. I will, I will be, I will bring the, the refreshments. But she had, I can't complain. I can't blame anything on my anything bad on my parents. Well, yeah, I mean, do you, what, I mean, do you have things to hang on other people? Oh, yeah. Particularly now. Looking back on it? No, no, not back from them. No, no, no, right here where we are. Sure. Sure. Yeah. So like, so instead of like, being morose, you just, you guys just kind of processed it and moved on from your, your brother's death. Uh, well, for me, it was like a rocket fuel. It's, and I realized that I had lived through that. Yeah. And, um, you were going to take life. I would, I could, I could deal, I could handle anything if I could handle that. Right. And in my work, that was, you know, I had so much already, I'd lived so much and felt so deeply, yeah, from such a young age, it opened it up, it opened it all up. I had, I had a deep well of emotion to draw from. Yeah, at a young age or like it, but it was also like when you were becoming aware of the world. I mean, you weren't eight. I mean, you were 17. So like it, it processed through most of my teenage years that he was sick. Yeah. Yeah, and what did, when did you decide to like that acting was the thing that was going to, you know, satisfy your creativity? Music was the thing for me. Originally. Music was the thing that I always did. Um, you play guitar, play guitar, 12 string. Oh, nice. And it would play for anybody that would listen. And it was that time too. I mean, it was sort of coming into the 60s with the folk explosion. Yeah. So you had a lot of role models, I imagine. Who are your people? Who are you? You know, I, I, I, I, I, I loved people like Crosby, Stills, Nash, young, you know, all, yeah. But I remember when I went to, um, New York, two guitars, I was 16. So I was there before my brother died. I was there for a summer and then, uh, visiting some relatives and, and spent time there with them. They were in the theater. And so I got a glimpse of that. It didn't make me want to act because I didn't know how. But what was New York like then? So your folks are sort of like where you can go to New York, you wanted to go to New York and spend time with these relatives. So what kind of, who are they? What kind of theater were they involved in? Um, you know, Broadway theater, not Broadway theater. Yeah. Were they producers or actors? There were actors, Geraldine Page, Rip Torn. They're your relatives? Yeah. My, uh, Rip is my first cousin. His mother and my father, uh, were the Fodchick family. And really, he, she was, he was torn, Rip Torn. Yeah. So doing. You know, I haven't talked to him in a long time. I hope he's out on his Johnboat fishing and having a great time. Yeah. I saw him briefly at, uh, at the Gary Shannelling Memorial. Oh, yeah. I don't know him. That was a great show. That was great. Yeah. He was, he was quite a guy, but I didn't get to talk to Rip much, you know, he just kind of darted in, darted out. Yeah, I was respect. But Geraldine Page and him were your relatives. And so that must have been a pretty lively trip to New York at 16. Well, I, I didn't know anything. You know, I didn't even know enough to realize how brilliant they seem like exciting people. Very exciting people. I think that's when I, you know, I just getting to stay with them and meet the people that they, um, worked with and, and, their friends, it was just a whole, it opened up a whole new world. I remember, I bet. I remember thinking, Oh my gosh. Yeah. I want to, I, you know, maybe someday I can join in that conversation. Yeah. It was wild though. Yeah. But, but it must have been mind blowing. It was mind blowing, but I went there to, to do music. And so that was, you know, I was on a path. Did you go play? Did you get, like, did you do a show when you were there? I did hooten any night. At the bottom line or something? At the, the bitter end. Oh, the bitter end, right. And what was the one that was right across the street? The cafe wa. The cafe wa. And I remember going down and seeing the nitty-gritty dirt band was playing somewhere, but it was in the village. Right. They were all down there. Yeah. I would go down there and take my guitar and sit with the guys playing P. Knuckle. Yeah. In Washington Square Park. You're 16 of us. But it's just sort of like, this is it. And then I, I went back and I, you know, finished high school. My brother died, finished high school and, went to University of Texas. For all four years? No. I bailed after rush week. I went, okay, this is not for me. But you're really right away. Right away. Well, one week of rush will do it for you. Whether you're being pressured to be in a sorority and, oh, yeah. I don't think I was being pressured, but I had already had, you know, I already had my moccasins and my bell bottoms. And you've been in New York for a while. And I'd been to New York and I, I just wanted, I wanted that. Yeah. Get out of Texas for a while. Well, I loved Texas. Yeah. I always loved Texas because there was so much happening in the, in music in Austin. I mean, it was incredible. Yeah. Who were your favorite? Progressive. Even then it was, there was a lot going on in Austin, like in terms of new music. I'm not Clark and, you know, it was just a really great, yeah, progressive music scene. Yeah. And so I, I loved that. Were you writing songs? I was writing songs and, cause you made one record like in the 80s, but like, did you, was that? No, I think it was much earlier. Oh, in the 80s, yeah. After I did Coleman, his daughter, I did. Yeah. But you made a record when you were younger? I did. And it was a real, it was a really great experience for me, because I wanted to be in the music business so bad. And I wrote songs and I, you know, I'd played in clubs. Yeah. I met these record people who had a record, had a song. Where were, where was the, in Texas? It was in New York, 1619 Broadway, 1650 Broadway. It was the Brill building. Sure. Yeah. Do you remember that? Well, why, I know about it. You know, that's where it all happened, where all those R&B and early rocks, yeah. Carol King. Yeah. Well, I met those guys. Oh, yeah. And they had this song and they, they had, it was produced. They did a beautiful job. It was called John You've Been Too Far This Time. It was about his nude record album. Why am I talking about this? Yeah. But they needed a girl and in the door I walked. Yeah. Okay, it's gonna be you. I lost my identity. It wasn't my music. You know, you sang? I sang. And it was after that that I thought, okay, I'm not changing my name. I'm doing my own thing. Right. And if I fail, I fail. Yeah. I'll fail on my own. Yeah. Not on someone else's sad project. Well, they, you know, they were very talented. And they were just churning out hits. They were just churning out hits. And they thought they had. But I met some really wonderful musicians there that then I went on to work with doing, you know, just things to pay the rent. Sure. Like backup singing. Backup singing. I sang on the Andy Warhols, Lonesome Cowboys film track. You did album. Yeah. With the, with the group, I was just, you know, one of the, one of the group. But you were a holder, you like 19? Yeah. And maybe 18. 18. And you were sort of like somehow got dropped into that. They were thinking, what are you doing here? He must have loved it. He's like, we got it. I never met him until years later. Oh, really? We did have, they did come into the studio one point and say, they're doing, they need extras. So let's, we'll, let's finish up this song and then go over to the, this, some bar up town. Yeah. And for movie. And for that, that movie that we were doing, the soundtrack for Lonesome Cowboys. But we got, we ended up on the cutting room floor. Oh, really? That was my first foray into, into film. But do you, did you go? Failure. No, it had nothing to do with you. It didn't, it didn't. I think you didn't find you looking back. But did you go to the factory? What did you, like, I imagine that, that must have been a mind blowing group of people to be around today team. I never went to the factory, but I did, I did go to Max's Kansas city occasionally. Yeah. Most times I was looking in the window. Yeah. That must have been, I can't, it must have been a scene. You know, all the, you know, all the important people ended up in the back room, which was sort of, right. I saw it seen pictures, right. John Lennon, David Bowie, Lourie, everyone's hanging out. Throw in stones. It was, it was amazing. But I wasn't in the back room. No, I was in the front room. Like everybody else? We're out on the street. Watching the show. Yeah. That's right. So when does, when do you, like turn, when do you put down your guitar? Well, I didn't put down my guitar. I, I, I just, you know, those doors weren't opening for me. Right. And you were at it for a few years, huh? I was at it for a few years, but I was, you know, really didn't have a plan, didn't have a, you know, didn't, it just wasn't happening. Right. But I kept on. Yeah. But, um, everything that happened to me in the film industry, the film business was really because of my music, because that would get me in the door. Really? And, uh, from the beginning, from the beginning. Well, maybe they thought I was funny. I don't know. So you mean in auditioning or how do you, how do you first start acting outside of the showing up at a bar for Andy Warhol? It was, it was kind of purely accidental. Yeah. I had a friend who was a photographer who took photographs of me, took him to his modeling agency, who was also, they were also theatrical agency. And, and, uh, I'm much too small to be a model. I went in with a whole book portfolio of photographs of you, of me. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. So, but they said, oh, you know, we have the actual apartment go over there. And that's where I met. Um, my first manager, who was really talented, Bill Trish in New York. And he handled a lot of really wonderful, uh, actors. He took me under his wing and did you train? Did you, what, I mean, I went to the Strasbourg Institute. Was that where it was, where Geraldine and Rip involved with that? They had been before. And, and, um, you know, they, they were great. They didn't want to say do this. Yeah. That they just, uh, you know, encouraged me to follow my instinct. So you're at the Strasbourg Institute with, was Lee alive? Who was, I wouldn't, yes, he was. I went up in the elevator with him once, bet him there, but I was never in one of his classes. No. Who was your teacher? His name was Ed Covid. And you stayed there. How long? Oh, maybe a year. Uh huh. And this was like straight up method stuff, huh? I guess so. Yeah. He gets it. That's all. Yeah. I was, I only got as far since memory. And then I never got the same class. Then I was out. But since memories, I guess pretty important. That's sort of the, the nuts and bolts of it. I mean, if you can do that, yeah, I'm a one trick pony. But the rest is just like knowing where your mark is and talking to somebody. Exactly. But if you can actually embody where you are, I think that's probably most of it. Oh, well, maybe. So what happens? So then you get, you move out here, you get, you get cast in something there. I got cast in something there. And the irony was though that when I was cast in New York and came out to LA, they considered me a New York actress, which was really not true at all. But that was a good thing. It was a great thing. It means you had integrity of something. Yes. But it was, it was all a lie. It was all a lie. I was the Texas actress who stopped in New York for a little while. Right. But did you tell him that? I hope not. No, I didn't. Of course not. Why would you? And you did like, I went through that, you know, all the movies, but your first role was in prime cut. Yes. That movie scarred me. Did it? You saw it. When I was a kid, like, oh my God. What is it? Like 1970s. You never had sausage again. That kind of thing. Yeah. Well, it was sort of like the one part I remember is when they they sent the guy back as sausages. Like, there's a scene in the opening of the movie where they like, it was both scarred. I bet. Well, yeah, you played one of those women, right? Like where's it? Like one of the women in the, in the hay, in the stuff. Yeah, we were the women in the hay. Oh my God. Women in the hay. It was a weird movie. It was a weird movie. It had a really wonderful director named Michael Ritchie. Yeah. Who went on to do the candidate downhill racer with Robert Redford and he really, we wrote some songs together. Oh, yeah. Me and him. He and I. Did you meet, like, I mean, what was the set like? Did you meet Hackman? Did you meet Marvin? Wasn't it? Wasn't it Marvin and Gene Hackman? Yeah. Yeah. They were great. Gene Hackman was a prince of a fellow. Yeah. Just a really easy going. Yeah. Wonderful guy. And, and, Great actor. Great actor. And Lee was a great actor and a quite a, quite a character. He said to me once, I have blue eyes if they are. No, I have green eyes whenever they look blue, stay away from me. Yeah. That's a good wording. What, what, what happens? What happened? He's, he was a interesting guy. I think there was a lot of, a lot going on with the, with the studio and, and, you know, everybody working on that. Everybody, but they, I was having a wonderful time. I thought it was just great, but it's a first set, right? But this, but now I realize there was all kind of undercurrents. Oh, yeah. Like, like, like a bad behavior undercurrents, bad, facing off, you know, and about that would be, oh, right. Between the, the studio and the director. Oh, really? That happens a lot though, I guess. I guess. But back then it was a little more intimate. It seems that like that's what I always find because I've talked to, who have I talked to that you know, Nolte was in here. It's kind of interesting talking to Nolte because it's all up there, but you don't know what's going to come out in what order, you know, just. He's one of the greatest actors. No kidding. Ever. Right? Well, the way he talks about acting in terms of like he, you know, he didn't, he wasn't, he came to it in the sixties, but there was a period where he realized he needed to get good at it. And the way he kind of characterizes it, he stripped himself of his ego. Like he, he sat in a room and drank or did drugs or whatever the hell he did, but he just got rid of any idea he had of himself and started there. He would make, he would just write pages and pages and pages of research of notes on his character. And then he also, but he also wrote notes on every character in each project he was working on. No kidding. So he was in. Yeah, he was in full. He's totally devoted. And you worked with him the first time on heartbeat. Yeah. That like that, like movie doesn't get a lot of a lot of praise, but like it was really the first, I think, attempting at characterizing the beat nicks, those guys. And he played, you played Joan Cassidy. Was that it? Was that her name? Was it Carolyn Cassidy and, and Nick played your husband, Neil, that was a tough role. And John Hard played Carol, Carol, Carol, Carol, that was wild. That must have been like, it was so wild. You have no idea. I don't tell me. I've been sworn to see. Come on. What just the sense of like getting into character, those particular characters? Those guys, those guys, you never really knew what was going to happen on the set or in real life, in real life. Right. Or on the set, as on the set is real life, Mark. Let's pass it. It is. It's set life. Yeah, it's happening right then. But yeah, I have to imagine with those two guys, it must be pretty crazy. Oh my gosh, sometimes they would come, you know, come straight to work from, you know, a long night out. D&L fall night. But always he was Nick was always on point. Really. And then I worked with him again on with on affliction on affliction a lot of years later. Oh my god. He was just so brilliant. It's such a he's really one of the most brilliant actors he give. He is like his entire being, you know, he just becomes these and that was heavy. That that that movie is like hard to hard to watch. But wonderful. Yeah, it's brutal, man. Schrader's like a little brutal. Those those scripts, I can't imagine looking at those scripts and being like, okay, here we go. So, so after prime cut, that's when it takes off, right? Then how did you get bad plans? Well, after prime cut, I came to Los Angeles and I the one of the girls, one of the other hey girls. Yeah. Yeah. We became very good friends and her family had moved out here out to LA. And so I moved from New York and and stayed with them. And that's how I met Terrence Malick. And and then that was a really a big break for me huge because it it influenced my my entire life. I don't know where I would have where I'd be now without without that. That's where I met my husband, Jack Visk, who was the production designer and you know, and Terry and it's when I began to understand that that film is an art form. Oh, I bet. Yeah. That you're, you know, celebrity, huge on the screen. Well, Terry would be the guy. Terrence Malick would be. He was the guy. And how do you like you? Was the meeting set up by your agents or you just met him at a party or how do you set up on my agents? And you guys just hit it off? We just hit it off. And I think it's because he's from Texas. He is, right? And I'm from Texas. And he, you know, he we connected on many different levels. And like the process of shooting that movie with that guy, you know, with that vision, I mean, how did it, how did it change your life in terms outside of career wise, but just in terms of how you looked at the art of movies? Do you know, it changed everything? Yeah. I had never looked at film as art. Yeah. And that it just, oh, it was, it was a total and complete transformation for me because I was working with all these wonderful artists. And I was a part of it. I had a seat at the table. Right. Yeah. That was what I had always wanted to be a part of this industry or, you know, first it was music, but then it was a whole new awakening for me. I thought of film in a whole and entirely different way. And acting as well. And acting as well. And like so working with everything. Yeah. Like working with Martin Sheen at that point. Oh my God. He was incredible. And just, you know, he would do whatever you needed to do. If cable needed to be rolled up, he rolled up cable. And, you know, I learned, I learned from the best. Yeah. I was very impressionable. And I got to work with these spectacular artists. He's pretty new too at that point. Wasn't he Martin? He was. Actually, he'd done a, you know, he was in his late 20s or early 30s. I'm not sure. But I remember we were meeting with all the young actors in Hollywood and they were all fantastic. It was like such an amazing position to be in. Yeah. Who was in that crew? Like De Niro in those guys? Well, you know, I'm trying to think who all I met with. But it was not De Niro because he was back in New York. It's a New York guy. Yeah. That's right. Yeah. Doing the mean. But I remember Terry saying, you know, there's this actor coming in. He's fantastic. Yeah. And I think he's too old. But I just, you know, he's a great actor and we're going to meet with him. But, you know, he might not be right. He's just too old for the role, I think. Yeah. Well, he walked in. Yeah. And he was the character. He just, I mean, he blew us away. You know, I'd been, I'd been Holly Sargis, this character for a month working with everybody as I, you know, thinking I knew everything about the character. And when he walked in and played the scene with him, it was completely different. Oh my God. That just was, you know, it was just one of those things. It was like a lightning strike. So he's incredible. He's an incredible actor and an incredible human being. He seems like a very decent guy. Unbelievable. So from that, then then the big ride begins, then you get Carrie, right? Yeah. Right after that. And how did that come about? Well, how did you meet the pama? Did he just, you know, there was that during that time, there were all these young directors that they were out here that knew each other and they talked and they talked about the actors they were working with. Right. Right. That crew. That's kind of the way. It was like a little club. Yeah, smaller community, because they were the new guys. They were the guys that changed everything. How Ashby and Lucas and Spielberg and the pama and, you know, that whole generation of dudes. So they all knew each other and they were like, you got to check her out. Yeah. And he brought in. Yeah. So that was a good place to be. Yeah. But there were, you know, it's interesting how he cast for that film. Yeah. Yeah. He brought everybody in and most everybody, you know, we'd all work together. We'd be in the same room. You'd be doing a scene with one character and then you'd switch off and we all changed, exchanged parts. Oh, really? When we tested for it, I only found this out a few years ago. I had gotten a commercial for the same day of the screen test. All the other actors were trying out for multiple roles. Yeah. I was only trying out for Carrie, which kind of hurt my feelings a little bit. But I got a commercial for the very same day. And I had worked with Brian as a set decorator. Well, he thought I was the worst set decorator in the universe. What before Badlands? Before Badlands on a film called, oh, I forget what it was called. Yeah. Anyway, yeah, two films actually I worked with him on because my husband was doing the production design. Together. One was Phantom of the Paradise. Oh, that was it. Yeah. Yeah. And we had an incident on set where Jack left and that was before cell phones and he said, like, just take care of the set. He'd lost his crew the first day. Your husband. My husband. And so he had he was stuck with me and my cousin Sam who had long hair and wore beaver top hat. And 70s. Yeah, the 70s. Yeah. And we were he said, just watch the set. You don't you don't have to do anything. It's all dressed. Everything's done. Yeah. No problem. He wasn't gone 10 minutes when Brian said, Okay, we're not going to do this scene. We're going to do another scene. Well, it wasn't that big a deal. Yeah, because the we were using the same set. All we had to do was paint it and redress it. Yeah. And Brian is notoriously poker face and he was there watching while we while we went up in flames. I didn't realize then that you had to paint something if you were going to repaint something in a different color, you had to paint it white first. Primant. Yeah. And then paint the other color. Yeah. So we didn't do that. We skipped a step and the old color bled through and what was supposed to be one color became magenta. And it was a disaster. And Brian hated me. Do you remember that when you were up for Carrie? Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. He didn't forget a thing. But I went up. I called him and said, Brian, because I knew him. And I thought he was my friend and he he was. Yeah. He just didn't ever want to work with me as a septic reader again or in any way. Oh, really? So I said, I got this commercial tomorrow. What should I do? And he said, knowing he would say, Oh, sissy, please, you got to come because he said, do the commercials. Oh my God. And I'm not going to tell you what I said, but I stayed up all night and reread the book, Carrie, and put Vaseline in my hair the next day. And you know, it didn't brush my teeth or wash my face. I was really disgusting. Yeah. And I went in and did the screen test and got the part. Yeah. Which was, you know, I thought was, of course. Yeah. Yeah. But I found that years later that that the studio hadn't wanted me for that role. They wanted someone else, one of the other actresses that was trying out for Carrie. And Brian was just being nice. When he said, do the commercial because he knew what I didn't know that they didn't want me. So he wasn't being an asshole. He was actually, no, he was watching out for me. I would prefer him to tell me they didn't want me. And then I really would have worked hard. Yeah. Sounds like you worked pretty hard. Pretty hard. Well, that's such a, with such a bizarre, you know, like, like just the distance between like Carrie and even, you know, the jump in terms of, of character from Badlands to Carrie, I can see that. Like, you know, these are kind of out there young girls in a way, but different. But like then from to that, to coal miners daughter was like, that's an insane transformation. So when you do care, yeah, a little bit in terms of character, sure. But I mean, in terms of like doing Carrie, like, as an actress, like, how do you, how did you get there? How did you like, when it was it putting the Vaseline in your hair? Was it I went to that, that place that all teenagers spend a lot of time where you're the victim and everybody hates you. And you know, you're in your locked in your room writing poetry and hating your mother. Right. So, you know, and I, I, actually a lot of things I learned from my husband, Jack, he was, he was doing this sets. He was designing it. Right. And I noticed they had this whole pile of research of, of, all the plates, all the doree etchings of the Bible, which are these overly dramatic body positions and people, you know, rolling their eyes and afraid the line is coming to, you know, rip their arm off. And I start a study those and would try to start and end scenes in those body positions and use, you know, it was that whole biblical type of lawyer mother was such a, right, right, religious fanatic. Right. And so the terror of God, the terror of God. So I kind of focused on the physicality and the isolation of it. The thing about Brian was he really knew, you know, he knew exactly what he shot was going to be. And if you would, could work within the confines of the shots that he had planned, he would let you try anything. And it was a, it was a wonderful working experience for me. And of course, papillori, one of the greats, one of the greats with that. I get, I get chills just thinking about that role. Oh my God. Where, you know, she's just this sweet, mild, mannered, darling woman. And then when she came on set and, you know, there was something that just came from her solar plexus strength and power. Yeah. She, she was really a gift to that film. Yeah. And now that like you say what you say, like that, that expression that you had when once the blood comes, that when they dump it on you, and your eyes just kind of like, like it was complete. That was what was in your head is that physicality of those those door right etchings. Yeah. You have to look at them sometime there. I kind of remember like, I can, I get pictures in my head of something. I don't know them by name, but I know exactly what you're talking about. Yeah. You're just that, you know, yeah. It's happening. Yeah. So you would never, like, I imagine, well, obviously that Colmires daughter was the first time you were playing somebody who was alive and part of the process. Exactly. So, you know, you got to spend time, a lot of time, I imagine, with Loretta Lynn. We, she was wonderful. I went on the road with her. I, you know, do a little push to me out on the stage at the Grand Ole Opry just like he had her. I wasn't quite ready to go on, but he decided I was. Yeah. And, and you, she really opened up to me about, her life. Yeah. And we became very close. She actually, she cast me in the, in the film. She did. She chose you. She chose me. Who else was up for it? As far as Loretta. Yeah. Oh, every, every actress in Hollywood. Yeah. And there were scores that would have been great. Yeah. But she, you know, she'd never seen any of my work. It was just kind of one of those things. And so, she wanted me to get to sing the songs. And you were, and that's great because you're like, I can, I can do that. I can really. Yeah. But then, then, then when they said, okay, you could sing the songs, I was like, oh, shit. But you nailed it. Well, thank you. It's like, it's such a, like, it's such a kind of interesting, like the way that, who directed that Michael, Michael Apted, who was, who was an Englishman. Yeah. And he grew up in a coal mining area of England. Yeah. And he didn't bring along any country cliches. Right. You know, he was not aware of that. Just brought the coal dust. Yeah. Just brought up a pot of coal dust. Yeah. And if you can feel it, every, like, all that stuff, he was, he was, he was incredible. When he came aboard, it was just everything started to fall into place. Yeah. Of course. Tommy Lee was a key. He's a text in two, isn't he? He is. What an actor that guy is. That must have been something. Oh my God. He was just an old leave on. Incredible. And leave on. And you know, leave on, leave on it never acted. And he was astonishing. He just did it. He just knew the character and he lived it. Yeah. And we played music. Great. Great. Oh my God. Great drummer, great man. God bless him. Yeah. And he was in the, he then he went on, I guess he did the right stuff. I don't know how much longer. After that memory, he played sort of at Sam Shepard's sidekick. I've just been listening to some of that to the Dylan record Planet Waves, which recently, man, it's like, they were such a great band. He was such a great, talented guy. Yeah. So you, you won an Oscar for that. And that like, that must have been astounding and amazing. Could you believe it? No, I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe it. But you know, it took a lot of people to win me that Oscar. Oh, it did. Like, yeah, like Tommy Lee, Loretta, and Ryder, Tom Rickman, who just passed away recently. And, you know, it was Beverly D'Angelo. Good. Great. Yeah. Anybody better than her? No. No. Yeah. Yeah. Do you keep in touch with anybody? I see my little dad. I've worked with him. I stay in touch with Loretta. I haven't seen Beverly in a long time, but I try to keep up with everybody's work and, Yeah. Tommy Lee. Tommy Lee. I've seen him. Yeah. Yeah. That's so it's so amazing. See him on the Polo field. Yeah. Is he out there doing that? Oh, he's out there doing that. And when so you, when you win an Oscar, like that night, I mean, I can't, like, I have, I romanticize the 70s Hollywood that like, I just feel like it was a smaller community that everybody kind of knew each other. It wasn't so much necessarily that they're rooting for everybody, but you kind of, like, you know, you'd see Nicholson there, you'd see all the, you know, the actors and actresses that were working at the time, and you all kind of knew each other, right? Yeah. And it wasn't, it wasn't horribly competitive. Right. Then, because I think everybody felt like, you know, we were all working and you got the parts that belonged to you. Yeah. The ones that didn't went to whoever they belonged to. Right. Yeah. But there was a real, you know, it was an exciting time. There was, I think, you know, there was a Goldie Hahn, a Dine Keaton, and Sally Field, and, you know, just, just, Jessica Lang and Glenn Close, it just was a champ pack. So, working with your husband as a director, was that difficult on Raggyman? Did you like, you know, it was great. It was great. Although he said that whenever we looked at went to Dailies, that if I didn't like something, I would scoot away from him. You really? Yeah, I think so. And when, and also like, you get to work with these actors of another generation, and he worked with another nomination for Missing with Jack Lemmon. Oh my goodness. That guy. That guy. Right. Like, what is it about him? Like, he had a lot of range, but he was always sort of this solid kind of like, like, he's, I don't like, people speak of him so highly because he could do anything. Right. He could do anything. He'd be telling a joke to the crew. Yeah. And then they'd say, okay, we're rolling. Yeah. And he'd say, it's magic time. And then he'd do some, you know, intense saying we'd be emotional, you know, it'd be brilliant. And then then they'd say cut and he'd finish the joke. Oh, oh. And he gave me great advice. He said, you know, you're working too hard. Just like, trust yourself. That is something, isn't it? Yeah, I took his advice. Well, how were you? Do you think you were working too hard because of how you thought you needed to do it? I would, if I had a really heavy scene in the afternoon, I'd start in the morning thinking, okay, I got to, I got to get myself there. Beat yourself up. I got to beat myself up, get myself to that emotional place. And then, you know, think I could sustain it. Right. For hours. And then I'd be worn out. Right. By the second take or? Yeah, he'd said, you, you, you've got to trust yourself. It'll do the happen or it won't. Huh. So that, because that's sort of like that moment that, that, I don't know if it's true or not about, about Lawrence Olivier and Dustin Hoffman on the set of Marathon Men where, you know, there's a scene where, you know, Dustin, it has to be all sort of worn out and he's being tortured and he had stayed up for three days. Right. And, and Olivier walks in with a crawler and his tea and he goes, Dustin, you should really try acting. I know, but those Englishmen, you know, they're English men and women there. What is it about? Spectacular. Yeah. You know, they think of it as a job and they just go from one project to another. They don't wring their hands about what they should do next. They just work. And, and, and you can tell they just know what they're doing. They have experience. They, they're incredible with accents. Yeah. It's bizarre, right? It's bizarre. And it's not a method thing. Really. It's like, maybe, no, they hit their marks and do their lines and they just act. It must come from Shakespeare or something just from like coming up in that world. But then there are a couple of those English guys like Daniel Day Lewis that just transcend everything. Oh, well, Daniel Day Lewis isn't a, you know, he and Merrill are in a, on a planet of their own. Yeah. Incredible. Yeah. Incredible. Daniel Day Lewis becomes, if he's going to play a, a, yeah. Yeah. Whatever he's going to play. He becomes that. He'll be, I will maybe a year. It's crazy. Yeah. A cobbler. A cobbler, a butcher. It's a, it's incredible. But that's, that's a, yeah. That's a hell of a commitment, right? Yeah. And, but it's, it's so. Merrill doesn't do that though. I don't think, and I think you're in the same league as Merrill Streep. You guys are crazy. Well, thank you. Thank you. And that's, that's, I take as a high compliment. I, I love her in every way. Did you do films with her? I've never done a film with her. Oh. But I've watched her in everything. She's kind of, it's kind of astounding, isn't it? Yeah, she has them. There's something very luminous about her and she just transforms herself. It's incredible. Yeah. It's, it's, some of it must be innate. Like I, I think a lot of actors, you know, the great ones yourself included, you, I mean, you, you do have a certain, obviously there's a talent. You have a natural thing for it. I mean, a lot of, you know, being a great actor is that not, is that, you know, you just can do it. Because it, you know, I mean, you can't learn that, right? You can learn stuff to help you. Right. I mean, she's so brilliant with accents. I've never seen anybody that has a knack for accents. And I don't know if it's a knack. It's just, maybe she's just like works harder than we don't know. We don't know. Yeah. Yeah. Merrill, if you listening, we want to know how you do it. I haven't actually doing a joke on stage about her about seeing her. I was in Connecticut with my girlfriend and she was in town doing something, I guess, but she was just sitting at a restaurant with her husband. And I was just, I noticed it was her and she was just, the beat and the joke is like, she's just sitting there eating a piece of bread with some cheese on it. And I just got to be honest, it was just brilliant. I mean, really nobody could eat cheese in a piece of bread like, yeah, so natural, the craft. Well, you know, the thing about her, she's just a real person. And I think she's plugged into humanity. And, you know, she's also very courageous. And when Donald Trump spoke ill of her, I think, you know, you can do a lot of things, but you don't talk about. Merrill Street. Merrill Street. You just don't. Yeah. Yeah. She didn't take it. But like, when you work on, like this new movie, like when you work with somebody like Redford at this point, like, do you like, do you just, you look at that each other and just know what you've been through in terms of this business and like how long you've been around? Is there a camaraderie there that just happens naturally at this point? You know, the director, David Lowry, has is a real, he works with all the same people. He has the same cinematographer these had since like eight years. Right. And it's very much like working with Robert Altman. He has his crew and his castor people that he's worked with. It was a little, I was a little nervous in the beginning because I was the only one that hadn't worked with David before. That was the first time. It's a hell of a crew on that movie. It was almost sad that like, you know, most of your scenes, almost all of them were just with Robert because he got weights and glovers and half leggings and the Denzel Sun, like there's this like that loaded up. Yeah, weight it up. Weight is like too much. I was it when I saw him. Oh my god. And that's why I hate Christmas. Exactly. Did you see that part when I did? Oh my god. I only met him. I've been a huge man of him for since the beginning of time. But I only met him as I was leaving this set and he was arriving one day. Oh, that was it. Yeah. And we had a nice, nice chat. Did you? Yeah. Yeah. What a cool guy. He is. He's a great storyteller, great presence. He's a great storyteller and it seems to be a wonderful human being. Yeah. And he's a great actor, really. Great actor. Do you remember that? Do you remember Ironweed with Nicholson? Yeah. Like he he he waits places his buddy and it's just like he how need to see that again. A lot of things like that. I I've got away from it. Like that happened to me with. Oh, there's the gardener in the that happened to me within the bedroom. I'm like, you know, I know I saw that and then like and then when I went and looked at the, you know, in on wiki, I'm like, Oh my god, that movie was devastating. Right. It just things like that just become a part of our consciousness to oh my god, you and Wilkinson, like what the that was crazy. Todd Field, a great director. Really great. These writers are really something. Yeah. So when you saw that script where you like do you get excited about going to that place? So excited. Yeah. So excited. It was, you know, I think we made that whole entire film, which included everything. Everybody's salaries. Yeah. For a million dollars. And it was just I was sending my young daughters out to get set pieces. Oh, really? Yeah. Go find us one of these. Go to the dime store and get what was this other film? Why didn't he like little children? Oh, god. Yeah. Oh my god. Oh, yeah. I just remember like the end of that of in the bedroom that that this sort of after he goes and does the thing. And you know, you don't know how you're really going to be with it. But then it was sort of like, okay. Yeah. Everything done. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. You want coffee? Oh my god. That was a really that's that's what an actor lives for is, is, you know, projects like that, like Badlands and like Coleman or daughter and just those ones that you can, I love the straight story also. That's one of my favorites. That's great. That was the David Lynch movie. Yeah. Oh my god. But it's really all it's a director's medium for right. Yeah. You know, so it's we're always prowling around looking for the next. Yeah, the great director. Yeah. But well, the ones that afford you the space and they're not overwritten and you really, there's a depth to the character, but it's not hammered out in, you know, like it's not overwrought. So you have this this space to work, right? Yeah. Do you ever do stage? I never did stage and really it was a miracle. I started making films. Yeah. You know, I just was in the right place at the right time and I got to be that girl. It was that I was kind of every woman. Do you miss doing like like the was the other big look at me. I'm like, now I'm that guy. It happens when when I talk to people that've done so many movies, but the the crimes of the heart film. Oh, yeah. Working with a bunch of women. Like there's not enough like I saw like Keaton Bergen and Steem Bergen were in that movie recently the club. Oh, yeah. But like, you know, there's not a lot of movies like that was that must have been fun to do. It was a blast. But, you know, that was back in the day when everybody was saying, oh, they're going to claw each other's eyeballs out. Right. You know, that's not the way women who who said that shot. We had a blast. We instead of having motor homes, they they rented the house next door to the location house and fix that up dressing rooms for all of us. So we're all together with them with our babies and it was just heaven. That was the best thing about that. Yeah, getting to know Jessica and Diane and I just met her. Diane? Yeah, she's amazing. Yeah, it was very quick. Yeah. Yeah. She's like, she's our style maven. Yeah, she's weird platform combat boots. Oh my god. She's so incredible. And Sam Shepard. Sam Shepard. Powerful Sam Shepard. Oh my god. Oh, yeah. He's like, how is he a nice guy? Superbly nice, fabulously nice. I, you know, I knew him as a dear friend, Jack worked with him many times. I worked with him many times. Yeah. So you guys work social all the way through. Yeah. And we lived near each other and our children went to school together. Oh, that's sweet. Well, I'm sorry. He passed. That was, you know, sad. Sad for humanity. Really was, you know, time does go by fast. Doesn't he feel that? Yeah. When you, when you talk about it, it's weird. It's like now I'm always the oldest one on the set. And when people are treating, treating you with a lot of respect on set, it usually means you're really. But, but also that you're, you're great and you deserve to be there. I think it's because you're really all, but okay. Okay. But, but, but you know, you've had, you've been able to sustain a pretty amazing career. You know what I mean? I mean, that's, that also is why you get respect. Is that not everybody lasts as long and not everybody can continue working and you seem to, you know, continue working and doing great stuff. Well, there's a lot of stuff happening now in the business with the TV the way it is. Yeah. There's so, there's so many more places to work. And you mentioned Almond, did you work with Almond? Yeah. On which one? Yeah. Number of time. Three women. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Okay. And then I did a film that he produced called Welcome to LA. Right. Right. So was he kind of a maniac? Like was he? Oh, he was divine. Yeah. He was, you know, he was an innovator. He's the one that, that started, you know, everybody with a radio mic. So you could talk at any time and overlap. That was revolutionary. Used to be. He's the one who did packs like, you know, a lavalier. Yeah. Well, that's how he did. He was the first guy. Yeah. He was the first guy that I knew of that, that did that. Because he loved that. Like, McCabe and Mrs. Miller, like everybody's talking. Exactly. And, and it really gave it such a sense of reality. Yeah. You gave it such a sense of being in reality. Yeah. Yeah. And he was great. But he was a little bit of, you know, he was a real, he loved to play practical jokes on people. He was a really a prankster, you know, along the lines of Jack Kerouac and, oh, yeah. Yeah. Don't cacity. Oh, yeah. You never knew what was going to happen. You never knew what was going to happen. And what was always good. Yeah. Well, I mean, he may, I'm surprised I haven't seen that film. I just, I don't like, I know a lot of his movies. I'm a huge fan, but I have not seen that one. I got to watch that one. Because that was like, it was, oh, 77. Hmm. It was good. Good work. Good work. Good experience. She's a chef. Yeah. Svella Devalle was fantastic. Yeah. And an actress named Janice Rule, who was, had been a ballet dancer her entire career and then switched over into acting. And what is this? I didn't get to watch the, I don't know if it's out yet, the thing you did with Julia Roberts. What is that? It's called Homecoming. Yeah. I play Julia's mother and she does the, she and Shea Wiggum and a young actor named Steven James, who's incredible. And it's a Bobby Cannavale. They do the, you know, they do the heavy lifting. Yeah. And it's a thriller. Yeah. Psychological. It's really weird and wonderful. And Sam Esmel, who did, who directed Mr. Robot. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Directed all 10 episodes. And he's, he's really amazing. It was a, it was a good group to work with. And it's a, it's a, it's a Siri. It's going to be like a, it's a half hour drama, 10 episodes. And that's it. Or is it supposed to go on? It's going to go on, I think, but it's an anthology like Castle Rock. So it'll be different people and different, different things. I get it. Yeah. Yeah. And you just like to keep working. You know, I really love it. It's, it's, I don't want to work for work's sake. Right. I want, I just love having a project that I can focus on and, and a character that I could explore. Yeah. That's a really fun thing. Are your kids grown up now? My kids are grown up. Yeah. Now they take care of me. No, mom. That's not the way the gate is over there. And do you have horses? We have one old horse, one foot in the grave, the other on the banana peel. Yeah. But we had, I think at one point we were, we had about 60 horses that we were raising in Virginia. In Virginia. Is that where do you live by Duvall? I live about 40 miles, 30 or 40 miles from him. Uh huh. Are you guys friends? Well, we work together. And so yeah, I haven't seen him in a really long time. Which one did you do with him? I did get low. Duvall's another one of those people. He seems to lead a pretty private life. And when he shows up for work, he really shows up for work. Yeah. He's, he's, he's really spectacular. Do you ever have that when you're acting with somebody where you just sort of like, Oh, look at him go or look at her. You know, it's funny because I always love to watch actors and and watch and and kind of try to figure out their process. Yeah. And it's, you know, it's, it's easier women. Yeah. Usually share their process. Yeah. With men, it's like, you know, they're protecting their favorite fishing hole. Yeah. So they're, you're just gonna mind their own business. And like, yeah, I guess like some people also are fairly competitive when they're acting. Like there's some people who, who, you know, who really want to showboat. Like, you know, I don't know. Well, that's always good. It is good, right? Yeah. I talked to Ethan Hawke about doing training day with, uh, with Denzel, you know, because he's got to play. And he said he watched Denzel movies like he was watching football games from the other team. Like he was like, I'm not going to let this guy devour me. That's so funny. Yeah. Sometimes I would be work. I've been, I've worked with people before where you're in a scene and you just start watching them and you forget your lines and you, I can't, you know, you get so pulled drawn into what they're doing. Yeah. You completely blow it. Yeah. And you got to be like, I'm going to need another take on that. Well, I, it's, it was a pleasure to talk to you. I, I, I enjoyed the movie. It was a real honor to go through your life. And thanks for coming. Is it over? We don't have to. Where are you going now? What do you got? I thought you might have to go do another thing.
