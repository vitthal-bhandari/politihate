Today is Wednesday, the 9th of September. And here's your quarantine tip of the day. If you're getting breakouts on the bottom of your face because of your mask, here's what you need to do. Take a second mask and put it on the top half of your face. Now at least your breakouts will have symmetry. Anyway, on tonight's show, Halloween is canceled. The sky is angry. And once again, Donald Trump has been caught on tape telling us who he really is. So let's do this, people. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show. From Trevor's couch in New York City to your couch somewhere in the world. This is the Daily Social Distancing Show with Trevor Noah. Here's the decision. Let's begin with the end. We want to take you now to a live shot of the Bay Area in San Francisco. Stop what you're doing and look at your screen. This just doesn't look real, but you've got wildfires burning in almost all sides, obviously other than the ocean, and it creates the smoky orange haze that looks like dust or a movie on Mars or something. One local forecaster says that they're not expecting to see much blue sky in the Bay Area until Friday or probably the weekend. Sweep, Lord. Did you see that sky all across the Bay Area? Wildfires have turned the skies into an apocalyptic orange haze, which is freaking everyone out. And you know, it's not just the fact that the sky looks like gritty, exploded in downtown San Francisco. What's freaking people out is that climate change has turned devastating wildfires into an annual event in California. And it's clear, humans have one of two choices. Either we do the hard work we need to reverse climate change, or in the next 10 years, humans have to rapidly evolve our bitch-ass skin to be something that's a lot more fireproof. It's weird, though, because the sky is terrifying, but in a weird way, it's also really beautiful. And so I'm begging all of the Instagram models out there to please not rush out to get photos in front of that orange sky. I know how you people think. Hashtag no filter, hashtag suffocating, hashtag call 911. But let's move on from some bad news to some bad news. It's 2020 people. This is all we got. Right now, pharmaceutical companies around the world are racing to develop a vaccine for coronavirus that can save countless lives and give us the freedom to freely lick pork benches once again. But one major vaccine trial has just hit a major snag. Breaking news overnight, a setback in the race for a coronavirus vaccine from a soon-ical giant AstraZeneca pausing phase three of its global trials because of an unexplained illness in one of its volunteers. The company now has to determine whether its vaccine might cause widespread adverse reactions. You see, this is why we need vaccine trials in the first place. Because right now, one person in that trial has an unexplained illness, possibly from the prototype vaccine. But you realize if they just released this thing to the public without proper testing, we could all be out in the streets with random diseases and mutations. I mean, on the bright side, maybe some of us would develop that fireproof skin, but still. Now, the scientists still don't know yet whether the illness is related to the vaccine trial or not. But I think I know what happened. I think what happened was coronavirus got to the vaccine and said, Look, man, whatever the humans are paying you, I'll pay double. And now we got to find a vaccine for the vaccine. Yeah, I'll read Facebook. I know what's going on. But let me just say that I'm incredibly grateful for all of these people who are injecting themselves with a vaccine without knowing whether it's safe, because they're doing it for the rest of us. And in a way, I know how this feels. In also the same way, my family would make me drink the milk in the fridge to see whether or not it had gone bad. Spoiler alert, it was always bad. But until the vaccines are available, we just have to keep wearing masks and socially distancing as much as we can, which is why in the UK, they've now decided that it's time for the British to party a little less hard. As Europe struggles with the surgeon, new coronavirus cases, the UK tightening restrictions. The government say social gatherings can include no more than six people instead of the previous 30 allowed. In England, from Monday, we're introducing the rule of six. You must not meet socially in groups of more than six. And if you do, you will be breaking the law. Yes, starting Monday in the UK, no more than six people can socialize at a time. Six. It's a very specific number. It almost makes me think that Boris Johnson has a seventh friend that he's trying to kick out of the circle of friends. I don't understand, Boris. Why can't I hang out with the gang? Well, you see, there were already six of us here, and scientists say that seven is COVID's favourite number. Well, what if I came early? Then I would just be the third person. Oh, no, you'll always be the seventh person, no matter what time you arrive. But look, these restrictions are better late than never, because, man, those Brits can party hard. As someone who has spent quarantine binging all of the great British Bake Off, I'm telling you now, those people are out of control. They put cocaine on everything. Now, Corona isn't just cancelling parties for the living, because in Los Angeles, even ghosts and goblins are now being told to stay safe. No trick or treating. That's what health officials in Los Angeles County are saying this morning. The Department of Public Health there is saying door-to-door for candy is just too risky this Halloween. They say it poses a higher risk for spreading coronavirus. Halloween is still more than a month away, but the department is hoping that this will give people enough time to find other ways to celebrate the holiday. They're encouraging online parties and contests and maybe some drive-through activities. Oh, are you serious? Trick or treating is cancer? This is awful! So what? I'm going to have to mail all the kids in my neighborhood razor blades? Oh! And I'm going to be honest, guys, I don't know if this is going to work. First of all, I don't think nine-year-olds should be driving. That's just me, okay? And secondly, no drive-through experience ever ends the way you want. Hi! I'd like a full-size Snickers, please! Okay, one bag of panties, is that all? Uh, not panties! Candy bars! Okay, that's the one bag of rusty old panties. Pull off to the next window, please! In other news that's rocking LA, after years of hashtag Oscar So White, the Motion Picture Academy has announced a major rule change to hopefully make the Oscars hashtag so right. The Oscars are making inclusion, a requirement for best picture considerations. Starting in 2024, those movies must meet diversity requirements in two out of four production categories, widening opportunities for underrepresented groups. They include women, minorities, and people with cognitive or physical disabilities. Promoters of the initiative say the changes will better reflect the diversity of the movie-going audience. So this is encompassing the totality of the people that actually work on a film. Oh shit! From now on, movies can only be nominated for best picture. If they meet certain diversity thresholds, wherever Martin Scorsese is right now, he is shitting himself. He's probably calling DiCaprio begging him to make a plan. Come on, kid, you sure you can't play black? You can do anything. I know you can. Personally, I think this opens up a bunch of opportunities. I hope that long-running franchises will just switch up the races of people and never address it. Like, how dope would it be if in the next Batman movie he's just Jamaican? Ayana y bida bat man. Man. Wa-wan. De jouca, ganigarce fora tin. What do you want to see fora-t? Gimcans doar. Now, you know what was funny, man, is that as soon as this story came out, so many people read the headline, and they just started panicking, bitching online. People were like, this is censorship. You can't force filmmakers to create whatever you want. I mean, how can you make a period piece with diversity? There were no black people back then. If you actually read the story before chiming in, people would have realized that in fact these new standards, which only take effect in 2024, are not that strict. For instance, a movie qualifies if it has just one lead role from an underrepresented group, and 30% of the crew from an underrepresented group as well, right? Or even if it has just 30% diversity in the marketing department or an internship program for an underrepresented group. And by the way, they define underrepresented groups as black, Asian, Hispanic, indigenous people, women, the disabled community, or members of the LGBTQ community. So in other words, it's super easy to meet this criteria. All right, we have to take a quick break, but stick around because when we come back, we'll catch up on all the latest Trump scandals.

Welcome back to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Let's take a moment to talk about Donald Trump, President of the United States and the main reason McDonald's signs say billions and billions served. There was some big, crazy Trump news today, and I know we say that every day, but this time it's true. I mean, it's true every day, but this time it's also true. And it starts with the president and his administration making a shocking legal maneuver. This morning, an unprecedented move by the Justice Department, stepping in to replace President Trump's private legal team to represent him in a high-profile defamation lawsuit. It means American taxpayers would foot the bill for the government defending the president in the suit by author E. Jean Carroll, who says the president raped her more than two decades ago in a dressing room at New York's Burgdorff Goodmans. The latest move protects the president from any potentially embarrassing disclosures. Justice Department lawyers argue that because the president was, quote, acting within the scope of his office at the time of his denial, he could be defended by government attorneys. Wow, wow, we wow. The Justice Department is now defending Trump in a defamation suit against one of his rape accusers, which means taxpayer dollars are paying for this. Now, you know that's going to make a lot of people mad. Our taxes shouldn't be going to this. They should be used to fund schools, to build roads, and to drone weddings in Afghanistan. Oh, and in case you're wondering, yes, this is unprecedented for a president. But I can't say I'm surprised at this point, because Trump has basically turned the government into his own personal concierge service. Like all the Department of Transportation does anymore is order Ubers for Trump. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if the border war turns out to be one side of Trump's new country house. Okay, now we need another wall and another one. Now let's throw in a roof and a pool, and we'll finally be safe from Mexico. Now, the Justice Department's justification for defending Trump in this case is that when he said he didn't rape her because, quote, she wasn't his type, end quote. He did that as part of his official duties as president. And I know that sounds wild, but remember what it says in Article II of the Constitution. The president shall execute the laws, command the military, and vehemently deny boning anyone who's less than a ten. But hey, conservatives wanted someone to run the country like a business, and what's more corporate than a CEO using company resources to shut down sexual abuse accusations? You did it, guys. So once again, we have big crazy news that a normal times would be all anyone talked about for a month, but because it's Trump, it's not even the only scandal that we have to talk about today. Now you might remember, back in February and March, Donald Trump was very confidently saying that the coronavirus was not a big deal, and it was basically just like the flu. But since then, we've all learned that that was bullshit. Well, today it's come out that Trump privately knew that it was bullshit. He didn't want to create a panic. I think Bob really, to be honest with you, I wanted to always play it down. I still like playing it down because I don't want to create a panic. You didn't want to create a panic? You didn't want to create a panic? So what did you want? For people to very calmly be dying in the streets? What's wrong, buddy? I'm dying. But it's chill. And also, since when is Donald J. Trump concerned about creating a panic? That is literally his favorite thing. Cities are burning. Sub-obbs are collapsing. Caravans of Antifa Mexicans are committing Muslim voter fraud. His campaign slogan is basically, look out behind you. But yes, thanks to audio tapes of interviews Trump did with Bob Woodward back in February and March, we now know that he was fully aware of how the virus was transphoned. And how deadly it could be. And yet in public, he told everyone there was no reason to be afraid. And look, I get that as a leader you don't want people to panic. But you also want to inform the people so that they can be safe. You know, if a plane is crashing, a pilot will tell you to remain calm, but they'll also tell you to fasten your seatbelts and brace for impact. If Trump was a pilot, he'd be like, Attention all passengers. Everything's fine. Streetbelts are for snowflakes. And if you want to stretch your legs, now's the perfect time. Bye bye. And this is really confusing. Because at first, I thought Trump was too stupid to understand what was going on with the virus. But it turns out that he was actually smart about it in private. But he's also stupid enough to tell Bob Woodward on tape. Huh. Now I don't know what to think. And Trump aside. Am I the only one who thinks it's crazy that people keep releasing books where they reveal that they've known the most incriminating things about Trump, but they only tell us about it now? I mean, imagine if Paul Revere had this attitude. Ah, the British coming? Find out by pre-ordering my book on Amazon. So, Trump purposefully obscuring the threats of COVID-19 was the major revelation that took over the news today. But remember, Bob Woodward interviewed Trump 18 times for this book. And he recorded Trump on tape talking about plenty of other subjects too, like racism. And believe it or not, it turns out that in private, Trump is a lot more aware of racism than he acts like in real life. I think there is systematic or institutional racism in this country. Well, I think there is everywhere. I think probably less here than most places or less here than many places. Okay, but is it here in a way that it has an impact on people's lives? I think it is and it's unfortunate, but I think it is. Whoa. Somebody finally got around to watching Get Out. It really is interesting how private Trump seems to know a lot more than public Trump. I mean, this whole time, I thought there were going to be secret tapes of Trump saying the N-word. Instead, we got secret tapes of him being an epidemiologist with a PhD in critical race theory. And you might be thinking, oh, but this is good news, Trevor. It means that Trump isn't as dumb as we thought. No, this is terrible news. Because you know what it shows? It shows you that Donald Trump is willfully misleading the public. It reminds you that he's a con man. He lies about coronavirus to protect his economy and his re-election. And he ignores systemic racism because he knows it exists, but he does it to protect his image with his base. And then when all the bad stories pile up, what does he do? He tries to drown them out with some crazy news announcement, like him saying that he's going to appoint Ted Cruz to the Supreme Court. Which, to be honest, just sounds like a threat to the Supreme Court. So once again, we're reminded today that Donald Trump doesn't care about America. He cares about himself. He cares about his money, and he cares about two-fifths of his family. And that's it. All right, we have to take a quick break, but when we come back, we will talk to the woman who invented gender reveals. That's right, invented them. And now she's coming back for avenge.

So yesterday, we talked about how one of the biggest California wildfires was started by an explosion set off as part of a gender reveal party. And obviously, we're all asking the same question. Was it a boy or a girl? But also, how did gender reveal parties become a thing? And why are they still a thing? Well, Desi Lydic found out. Gender reveal parties. They started out as innocent gatherings to share the blissful joy or horrible disappointment of finding out the assigned gender of your unborn child. But now, they've turned into this. And this reveal of a baby boy sent passengers scrambling to safety. As far as fire officials are now confirming, which started by a gender reveal gone wrong. Almost like a grenade that went off and exploded and caused this fire. So I met with Jenna Carvenidis, the blogger who threw the very first gender reveal party back in 2008. So what was your grand reveal? Do you have skydivers come down and light pink and blue dynamite? You have a big fireworks production. How many gators did you have? We had a cake? You had a cake. Did you have a stripper pop out of the cake and start a wildfire? No. Can I see a picture of the cake? That's the cake that started this whole trend. A very simple cake. Look, I love a good party, especially ones I'm not invited to. But these baby ones were getting out of hand. I think it is time for you to come out and publicly disavow gender reveal parties. I've definitely already said that and people should definitely stop doing that. Oh, you said that? All right. Well, that's good. I'm glad I got through to you. I wife publicly disavowed gender reveal parties for quite some time now. About a year. I've been campaigning against them. So you technically invented the gender reveal party, but you do not condone gender reveal parties. That is absolutely true. I didn't call it a gender reveal party. I actually called it a peep show cake and a peep show, huh? That's how we ended up with my son. So what happened to change your mind? Somebody on Twitter was looking for the source of the gender reveal party and one of my old social media followers tagged me into the conversation. And I was like, well, it's kind of funny that this is even coming about because we had our family picture taken recently. And there's my daughter. She likes to wear a tuxedo. It's like kind of ironic. And people were like astonished and it became a story and it became an opportunity for me to really speak out. Yes. The first baby to be gender revealed is in fact not eager to be defined by gender. I think the parties are physically harmful for many of obvious reasons. You know, blowing up the forestry and burning down things at the parties, but they're also very socially harmful. Well, yeah, I mean, they're boring as shit. No alcohol, cheesy games. No, I mean, socially with the people in our society for transgender and non binary people who don't fit on the spectrum. These parks can be really harmful to them. Yeah, that I mean, that's more important than the fact that they're just boring. And even heteronormative people really are harmed and incensed by this idea of if it's, you know, an explosion with the tractors or whatever. It's a boy. And then the girls are on the opposite spectrum and everything has to be pink and two to I'm sorry. My son just came in. He heard to to when he came running in. I'm sorry. My son is looking for his superhero toy. So. Yeah, but you like dolls and stuff too, right? No, we're not that heteronormative around here. You like dolls and playing dress up. You like pink stuff pink. Pink is his favorite color. Yes, it is. Yes, it is. It's not pink is your favorite color. Pink is totally his favorite color. No, it's not. It's not. I totally. I totally. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. I totally agree with what you're saying. But how did these gender reveal parties evolve from cake eating to mass destruction? I think a lot of people out there are searching for likes on the Internet and it has caused a lot of problems. Yeah, exactly. Who cares about likes? I don't care about Instagram likes or the fact that Wolf Blitz are blocked me from Insta Stalkingham. Yeah. And the ultimate truth is it doesn't matter. And what really matters is how you feel about yourself, how your family feels about you, how your community feels about you. So when you start a forest fire, you are really acting against that goal. Jenna, what would you say to the people who insist on continuing to throw these parties? Be a little bit more responsible with the parties. Throw a different type of party. Like, yeah, what's the baby's name? That's, you know, so much more possibilities with that than whether or not has a penis. That's a great idea. You should absolutely throw a party and reveal what the child's name is going to be so that all your family and friends can sit around and judge the name you've picked and tell you stories about all the assholes that they knew with your kids name. That happens. How is I supposed to know that Tate would be a bad name for my kid? Ha ha ha ha ha ha. Take it out. Tate, mommy needs some quiet time. I hate Tate. Thank you so much for that, Desi.

Earlier today, I had the honor of speaking with the one and only Jane Fonda about her new book on climate activism and what it takes to be a protester fighting for what's right. Welcome to the Daily Social Distancing Show. Thank you. Some know you as an Oscar winner. Some know you as an Emmy winner. Through the years you've been given every title from sex symbol to rebel to political organizer. And you've been causing what John Lewis would call good trouble for the good part of 50 years. Fighting for climate change is deep inside your bones. In fact, now you've moved to Washington, D.C. to basically get arrested repeatedly to try and get more action on climate change. I would love to know in all the years that you've been fighting, have you seen any progress or have you seen a change that inspires you to keep on fighting? I see change all the time. I see all the way back starting in the beginning of the 70s when I first became an activist. People changing, mostly women. I think women tend to change more than men. Women who had been very shy, scared to talk in public housewives, who when there was an emergency, when their children were in danger, became these fiery warriors overcame their shyness. And fought and won for their community. That's the kind of change I've seen over the 60 years that I've been an activist. And so I don't get cynical or discouraged. I'm really encouraged by people's ability to change. Your book is entitled, What Can I Do? And it's about climate change. But what I found interesting about it is you also talk about protest. You talk about challenging the status quo. You talk about fighting for equality and for justice. And what I really was intrigued by was how you talk about the way you've seen it for so long. You said you saw it first as a sprint and then you saw it as a marathon. And now you've started to see it as more of a relay race from generation to generation. What exactly does that mean? Well, what really got me to move to DC were the young climate strikers, Greta Thunberg and all the other. There were millions of them. It was the biggest global demonstration in human history, I think. About a year ago, it actually is when it took place. And I've met a lot of them since then. And I see how they're carrying grief. They're mourning about what's been lost and what they know will be lost, even if we start doing everything right because of all the heat that's been baked in. And they were saying, look, we didn't cause this. We're fighting for our futures. Where are the grownups? Where are the adults? And I realized it's kind of a reverse logic that they were passing a baton to older people to join them. And then we in turn are passing it back to young people. I'll be dead before the problem is solved. But I want to pass it to young people. You've been through it all from the Nixon administration tapping your calls and from the intelligence agencies, basically trying to sabotage you and get you on trumped up drug charges. People have tried to silence you for a very long time. And this is something that's not dissimilar to what happens to some people today, is that in their protest, people try to silence them. They try and stop them from speaking the truth and speaking truth to power. You have fought in a relentless way. But I wonder if you've learned any tips and tricks on how to fight effectively in terms of advocating for change. Don't get impatient. Keep talking. Talking about it. Like talk about the climate change. We have to keep talking about it. If we don't talk about it, we're not going to care about it. If we don't care about it, we're not going to do anything about it. So we have to talk about it, you know, at family dinners with our uncle who doesn't believe in it. We have to listen to people, find out what they care about, and then pitch what we want to say to them according to what they care about. You know, if they care about their grandchildren, well, we want to have a future for our grandchildren. If they care about birds, almost 3 billion fewer birds in North America since 1970. I mean, that's astonishing that that many birds have disappeared or it can simply be the extreme weather of acid or whatever people care about. That's what you should focus on. Don't write anyone off. You know, be open, especially to people who don't agree with you. The social scientists have studied this and they say, this is really good news. You only need 3.5% of people to win. And that's 11.5 million people in the United States. We can do this. You talk about how everyday people can make a difference. I know that governments need to do something. We know that corporations can do a lot. But everyday people sometimes feel powerless. You know, someone will go like, okay, I don't use straws, but it seems like there's still tons of plastic out there. I may not use single use packaging, but there's still tons of trash going out there. Do you really think there's something that we as individuals can do to change the levels of pollution in the world? Absolutely. We can stop being individuals and join with others so that the individual becomes the group. You know, the powers that be the American oligarchs, basically, they don't want us to realize that there's strength in numbers. They want us to be individualists because that helps them because we're powerless as individuals. But if we join organizations and work with other individuals, we can make the changes happen. We can't rely on government. We have to force government to do what's right. That's why I keep doing fired real Friday. It's why I wrote the book. I want people to take the next step. You know, for 40 years, we've pleaded and petitioned and we've lobbied and we've marched, we've protested. We've used all the levels of democracy and we haven't been heard. So now we have to civil, good trouble, civil disobedience. You've been arrested more than most people I can think of. And you've become somewhat of a hero online because people say, this is how you use your privilege correctly. Have you gotten comfortable being arrested? Like, do you just have like, is this like a thing where you go like, oh, just another day for me? It doesn't get you at all now? Well, you know, first of all, I'm white. So I'm white and I'm famous and I have a hit TV series behind me. And so I'm not going to be treated the way you would. Well, I mean, you're famous. So maybe you wouldn't be treated the way, you know, some black kid on the block would be treated. I mean, I can't pretend that my experience is the same as it would be for a person of color. Then I've been arrested before and it was not so good. It was under orders of Richard Nixon and it was not good. I wasn't treated so well. This time I was choosing to be arrested. I was engaging in civil disobedience. And so even though you're really giving up your power, you can't control anything anymore. You're in the control of the police. But you're putting your whole body in alignment with your values and it's so empowering. It's like stepping into empowerment, into wholeness. And as I would look around and see the other people getting arrested, I could see they all felt the same thing. Building community, being part of a group of people that are fighting together is joyful. What advice would you give to the next Jane Fonda, a young aspiring human being who says, I want to fight for all the things I believe in, but I may be afraid and I may not be treated well when the police encounter me. What advice would you give to them? Yeah, it's the same as I said before. Don't be alone. We're so vulnerable when we're alone. Be part of a movement. That's what the joy comes from. And that's where your safety comes from. If you're embedded in a movement. I think there are no final words to end an interview on Jane Fonda. Thank you so much for taking the time. Thank you so much for everything you've done throughout your life. And thank you for joining us on the Daily Social Distancing Show. This is the book. I hope people get it. It's really good. It's very useful. It's a fantastic guide on how to get into good trouble and fight for causes that you believe in. So thank you very much. I appreciate you having me. Thanks. Well, that's our show for tonight. But before we go, I just wanted to remind you that there are less than two months until the election. 55 days to be exact. And America is facing a nationwide poll worker shortage. Coronavirus is still out there. And most poll workers are over 60. So understandably, they are not showing up. But fewer poll workers means fewer polling stations are open and it means longer lines that not everybody can afford to stay and wait in, especially in poorer communities. The good news is though, poll working is paid and in some states you can be as young as 16 to do it. So if you're interested and you have the time, this is your chance to make some money, protect democracy and save your granny at the same time. Until tomorrow, stay safe out there, wear a mask and remember, if Bob Woodward is interviewing you, lie. This has been a Comedy Central Podcast. This is Holly Fry from Stuff You Missed in History Class. Toyota is a leader when it comes to electrified vehicles.
