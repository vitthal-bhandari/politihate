Hyman, that's audible trial calm for such dr. Hyman. That's just dr. Hyman. All right now Let's get back to this week's episode Welcome to doctor's pharmacy I'm dr. Mark Hyman and that's pharmacy then F F A R M A C Y a place for conversations that matter and if you have had Issues with hormones this conversation is going to matter to you because it's with my colleague and friend at the ultra wellness center Dr. George Papanicolo and here we are at the Elchowana Center in Linux, Massachusetts. We're a purpley socially distance and We are going to talk about a number of cases today and one of them is going to be about hormones It's a big issue George has joined our practice a number of years ago. He's an incredible physician Big man with a big heart. I he's been a functional medicine practitioner for years. He worked on the Navajo Reservation and he's just an extraordinary dude who I love having in our practice And we are going to talk about hormones today and all things hormones. So George welcome to the doctor's pharmacy podcast Mark, it's always a pleasure. So, you know hormones is a big topic And you know we talk about hormones and men hormones and women and there's a lot of hormones, right? There's sex hormones like testosterone estrogen progesterone. There's thyroid hormones insulin stress hormones and there's many many other hormones but we're going to focus today on Guys who have a problem. That's very common Sometimes referred to in the media as low T or low testosterone, which is a pandemic out there And it causes so many different issues other people call it andra pause or male menopause But if you're a guy listening this whether you're 30 or 40 or 50 or 60 This could be happening to you and you just don't know it and it makes you feel like crap and you are often misdiagnosed misunderstood and Suffering with fatigue muscle loss low sex drive and lots of other problems. So George tell us a little bit about how we think about this in traditional medicine And how that contrasts with how we approach hormone imbalances in functional medicine Well, you hit all the hot spots So my thunder yeah Yeah, you hit all the hot spots, you know men men we always when we think about hormone replacement You know we're always thinking about women But believe it or not I have more men asking me about hormones and I do women and I think there's some reasons behind that I think there's there's women still have a great deal of fear about hormones because the media for so many years would publicize the relationship between hormones and cancer and So women are very reluctant men on the other hand are now starting to experience hormone issues and it's becoming more of a popular conversation and As you said the media talks about it and men are living longer And they're starting to experience difficulties with is all all the things you just said fatigue mental Disclarity brain fog libido lack of motivation Erectile dysfunction and they want to get help with that and why shouldn't they we want to live vital lives? the difficulty is is In the diagnosis, so that's where we run into our first, you know difficulty How is this true to treat in traditional medicine or is it well? That's the point that the diagnosis piece It's really the diagnosis requires you to have a little testosterone of about 300 250 to 300 which is about what you see in the average 97 year old Exactly so now a gentleman shows up with a what's normal for a guy is like 20 30 And he can be anywhere from 600 to 10,000 yeah Yeah, so so guy shows up with a with a testosterone of 400, but he's not feeling good He's tired. He has no sense of well-being. He doesn't have erections He doesn't have motivation. He's apathetic and his testosterone comes back at 400 the doctors Hey, you know what? That's pretty good for a guy is 52 or a guy is 48. We expect for a guy your age exactly so That's the first problem You don't treat the number you treat the patient and that's that's where I think we we really focus on in functional medicine And then the second problem is is that when you do address testosterone. That's all that gets addressed You know, let's just replace your testosterone and that's not how we approach it in functional medicine Certainly not in in mind in my approach. I it's for me It's all about the first thing we do is we dig into lifestyle because if you change lifestyle Most of the time I can get that testosterone to get up, you know to 600 just by changing lifestyle and addressing some co morbidities that might exist. So let's talk about that. What are the drivers of? Dropping testosterone in guys from a lifestyle perspective, and what do you do to address those? stress nutrition lack of exercise poor sleep Too much alcohol too much pot Bad relationships the usual suspects. Yeah, so so you're saying stress lowers testosterone. Yeah My favorite study was this study where they they looked at guys who went to football games and They measured their testosterone before and after the game another study and and the guys whose team won Their testosterone levels went up the guys whose teams lost their testosterone levels went down the particularly the ones that had been gambling Oh, there wasn't a game like that. That was in the fine print of the methods of the study. I didn't get that That is striking when you think about that. Yeah, so your mental state has a huge effect on your hormones Yeah, so you mentioned also nutrition talk about that because I think that's something people understand How does food affect your hormone levels particularly testosterone? Well, there you need food is fundamental to build it's the building blocks for everything that we need so hormones require certain food Macro nutrients like you need really good healthy fats that you can have cholesterol in your system So you can make because cholesterol is a building block for testosterone So diet Diet provides us the macronutrients we need to be the building blocks for creating hormones Cholesterol is a building block so cholesterol is what actually testosterone is made from yes, right? So what about people taking statins? They could potentially statins can lead to low testosterone Because you're going to drop your cholesterol levels and if you get them too low You're not going to have that building block and if you're under lots of stress and if you're not sleeping well Both of those are going to drive down your to start you know are going to really create We'll get to this later an imbalance where you're going to actually produce too much cortisol Which is going to demand the use of cholesterol because cortisol is also made from cholesterol So yeah, this you have this this Cholesterol and it needs to be used to make your hormones and if you're using it primarily to make cortisol Like the cortisol steals it away cortisol steel it steals it away from being able to make testosterone So getting back to the nutrition piece we do need those building blocks to come from eating fatty fish Taking the fish oil capsule if you don't And then making sure you have all the other nutrients that are required to make testosterone It's very important. What about what about what causes it to go down because that's what causes it to go up In fact saturated fats can help it go up right exactly. So what causes it to go down? Yeah You know sugar, you know sugar it plays a big role in creating inflammation sugar also Drive insulin up and that can have an impact on your testosterone levels as well So having a diet that's going to be rich in whole foods loney sugars processed foods Will definitely be beneficial. So so essentially What you're saying is that our diet plays a huge role in regulating our hormones So good fats are good for you. Yeah, and even a little saturated fat is this very brief cholesterol And our starchy sugary diet which is about a pound a day per person in america of starch and sugar Which basically are the same interchangeable flour and sugar Drives your testosterone down. Absolutely And when you get high insulin levels from eating too much starch or sugar that causes the deposition of belly fat So what you see is it's this amazing phenomenon of these guys. They get these big bellies Their testosterone goes down They lose they raise hair on their body And they actually get man boobs. Yeah We're gonna yet because what's happening is that when you have that excess belly fat It's it's basically too much estrogen and estrogen And we're gonna when I talk about my case we're gonna talk about this when you have too much Estrogen then estrogen to drive something called sex binding sex hormone binding globulin So this is a it's a protein that carries your testosterone throughout your body But the active testosterone is free. It's not bound So when you drive your estrogen levels up Then you're going you know by being overweight you're gonna you're gonna store Excess estrogen in that belly fat then what's going to happen is is that you're going to then Drive down drive up your sex hormone binding globulin You're gonna bind that free testosterone And now you're gonna start to and you're you're gonna start to experience the effects of low testosterone Yeah, and also Estrogen gets can test testosterone gets converted to estrogen right And there's ways to block that conversion there are but but the key is it's so dire related so yeah, maybe getting Your sexual function back has to do with getting your belly to go down Absolutely. Do you want something else to go up? Yeah, and you know and it's so true what happens to men in our society is that they're working too hard They're stressed out. They don't sleep well Then they they eat in such a way that they're going to gain weight And all of those things are impacting their testosterone levels, but it you know There's this combination too where cortisol As we talked about is going to steal if you'll lose your testosterone there But also you begin to have other hormones that are involved. So if you're um Again, if you're in we're gonna talk about this in the case Yeah, if your thyroid isn't functioning well There are some studies to show and I there it wasn't really clear to me as I looked at the studies I don't think that they delineated it but when you have hypothyroidism you can also have low testosterone So you have to look at all you have to look at low sexual or virus one of the symptoms of low thyroid Yeah, so you have to look at when you think about testosterone in men or they come in saying hey I think my testosterone is low or I'm having you know, I'm having erectile function issues or I just don't I don't have I can't build muscle mass in a gym I Think about testosterone, but I think about balancing all the other hormones. I start to look at the entire lifestyle pack Well, they're all connected right. It's like a big chicken wire. We learn medical insulin Sex hormones cortisol. They're all interchangeable Separated by a few different molecules that are regulated by different enzymes and it's like a pinball machine Which ones are gonna go down? And if you're just looking at testosterone alone, then you're going you're gonna potentially miss the root cause of the problem and so Just replacing testosterone is never a good idea and alcohol is another huge failure Right when you see guys who drink and have you know, quote beer bellies what happens to their bodies They get this big belly. They get breasts enlargement. They lose all the hair on their body. So they look more like women And it's because the alcohol increases estrogen production in the body That's why alcohol increases risk of breast cancer But it has that effect in men as well and when you Help them cut out the alcohol cut out the starch and sugar or increase the good fats increase fiber or increase plant-rich diet These guys see dramatic improvements in their hormone levels without actually using medication So that's always the first step is yeah addressing these lifestyle factors sleep stress exercise diet and Sugar alcohol and the other thing is fascinating is muscle is the usual and one of the ways to boost testosterone Is is to exercise and build muscle? Yeah a strength training literally will build your muscle and will build your testosterone levels Yeah, so when we're talking about Patient's low testosterone. It's always lifestyle first And managing all of that so we're gonna the first things I'm gonna do with my patients Things that we've already discussed and it's going to be get them exercising again get them meditating to reduce their stress and the cortisol levels Get them to avoid alcohol as much And you know what that's not what they come in for they don't come in For me to tell them to do that they want the magic And they wanted to testosterone injection or testosterone gel And that's not where I start and in the end for for a majority of my the men I work with They're much happier because by re by changing all their lifestyle factors They're much they're much more satisfied And they're much healthier. It's a lot of beneficial side effects huge side effects to Improving all of those things so weight loss and increased energy and better sleep happier all that stuff Oh, just just by getting them to meditate, you know, I'm I'm I'm very much Believe in the the benefits, you know, the data on meditation and its impact on your your body your overall health is huge so I've I've probably every male patient that comes into my practice has that conversation with me And they're just like they're just shocked that we're talking about meditation when they come in for all the issues They come in with and I identify stresses a major issue and I tell them about meditation That will drive their cortisol down And that will help them improve the testosterone levels in and of itself So so tell us about this patient you had who came in with you know fatigue and and he was overweight What what what was the story with this patient and how did you approach him because functional medicine is is a very different approach You know, like you said, it's not just here take the testosterone It's looking at all the variables that could be impacting a patient and affecting their hormones whether it's toxins Whether it's their gut whether it's nutritional deficiencies whether it's Their diet stress all these factors we look at comprehensively and functional medicine. That's what we do at the ultra vulnerable center That's why you have so much success. So not just a knee jerk. Oh, you have low testosterone give testosterone It's a comprehensive approach to these right all these variables, right? So the gentleman came in He was experiencing Fatigue he as you described already he was having adiposity around his waist and also in his breast tissue and he had been working out And he'd already been to a physician who had given him testosterone And it wasn't he was not getting the clinical benefit that he wanted So when when a patient like that comes in we begin to go through everything we go through the lifestyle We go through previous treatments and we go around our matrix Which is that that that tool that we use that identifies the way we think about overall health in a patient and we don't treat this the Symptoms we treat the systems. So in this particular patient. I immediately identified that he was a busy executive 52 years old He was under stressed. He was a little bit overweight and He had been on testosterone and he brought me some lab values and his testosterone had gone up But his his free testosterone Was really low that's the active that's the active testosterone So I started it though Otherwise what you're saying is that guy could have a normal level if the doctors let's say you're checked the normal Let's say 300 doing he was about 550. So it's 550 which seems pretty good But if you don't check the level of active free hormone You're not really knowing what's going on right and if you don't check these other tests you're gonna talk about right You don't really know what's going on. So tell us about so that works Yeah, so the way so when you see that you're like well, that's interesting So the tests that I do Included a a something called a Dutch profile Dutch profile that just doesn't tell me about the total amount of testosterone It also tells us how you're metabolize your testosterone and as you mentioned earlier mark That you convert your testosterone to estrogen and there are some men that naturally convert Their testosterone very efficiently to efficiently into estrogen and so they're overaromatizing And you can see that on the Dutch profile you can see That the results show you that pattern He was an overaromatizer And so when he was being given testosterone he was converting a lot of it into estrogen So he was actually taking testosterone. Yeah at the time he came in with this He was he was he was taking testosterone when he came in and he'd actually Gained more gain more visceral fat while he was taking a sort of backfire. He was a little muscle It's very interesting. It's very it's why I brought up this case. It's a great case You know if you just go to regular traditional doctor, you're gonna get testosterone They'll just give you testosterone. They won't look at all these variables and like well I don't know why you're losing muscle and gaining fat and growing boobs and losing hair in your body Right so it was an interesting case because what hadn't been tested was his sex You know hormone binding globulin hadn't been tested and his Estrogen had not been tested and he had been on the testosterone from his nine months And he saw these differences. Mm-hmm So on the basic labs that anybody can get I checked his estradiol level I checked his sex, you know hormone binding globulin and his estradiol level relative testosterone was elevated His sex hormone binding globulin was also elevated and that That's what was binding the free testosterone And then when I looked at his Dutch profile it all made sense. He was an overaromatizer So this Dutch profile is a test we do at the ultra walnut center. It's quite different It looks at how all these hormones interact correct how they're metabolized What's getting vertibut to what where the imbalances are this is not something you get Whether it's a traditional hormone test that you go to the lab and get right it's a saliva test It's a saliva test and so And it's very it's a very effective test and It made sense when I saw that picture so so that's the that's the difference now He had some other things going on And that included a sleep apnea But the the main thing was is that all we needed to do was address this hormone imbalance And to do that we needed to account for the fact that he didn't aromatize really well So you add in something an aromatase inhibitor called an astrozol So I added an astrozol to his treatment plan And that you know was going to make a difference he was going to now that was going to block his body's natural ability to so readily turn testosterone into estrogen and I because of his age and the The urgency because he was getting a lot of emotional stress over this I added in a peptide so I added in something called cjc1297 and That actually helps you along with ipramoralin that combination will help you lose fat and gain muscle so we added that in for a three month cycle And he did extraordinarily well. He lost all that vistrolatoposity around his waist also his um The man boobs went away and he was feeling great gain muscle mass and did it was extraordinarily pleased with the outcome amazing so you know you talk about these this uh an astrozol which is uh Medication, so he was often in cancer treatment for women for breast cancer. It was a blocks estrogen production by the body uh, there are also natural ways to to inhibit aromatase and to help with the Excess estrogen one of the ways that we deal with hormone imbalances is using foods Right and and using even ingredients that are in foods that are powerful regulators of hormones One of the most important things is is a compound found in the broccoli family the braska family It's called dion dol methane or dim And that can be used in patients who are taking testosterone to help affect the hormone metabolism into estrogen and limit that Absolutely also use biotin right and so there's a lot of other things that can be taken Yeah, along with the hormone replacement to help mitigate And I will and I will commonly use dim and calcium deglucurate because they they both increase in metabolism Vestrogen I use them in women, but I also use them in men particularly a gentleman like this that would have been an option I chose to do something that would be a more aggressive You know, this is definitely gonna work. Yeah faster And then and then what about the Method of testosterone replacement can you talk about the options for men about what kinds of available testosterone replacements there are and what is the Point at which you would initiate that what's your decision on these patients of okay? This is now the time to start right so the first thing I do is as I said before Is we balance out everything else we do lifestyle factors and we make sure that that's a long place if after six months or so of Lifestyle factor intervention they're not improving that's when we'll start talking about testosterone replacement And testosterone replacement you can do topicals you can do injectables and I tend to use the injectables because they're very effective and very efficient So how how did that work? How do you do an injection? So injectables can be given i.m But recent in the muscle which is in the muscle and the research research has shown that the sub q injection meaning you just Pinch the you know the little fat around your waist you inject right into that little that little piece of tissue that you have there That's called a sub q injection. You can get absorption and elevation of testosterone just as effectively as I am so it's a very very simple and that's an easier It's very simple and use compounded hormones. You just get them at the regular pharmacy. Where do you get them? So they can be you can get them in a regular pharmacy and you can get them compounded the the Most of the time the wrong ingredient of testosterone is going to be very similar. It's the carrier molecule that might be different so Some pharmacies use grapes grapeseed oil I mean some compounding pharmacies is grapeseed oil because there's some theoretic advantage of absorption So when they compound it's going to be the same raw material. It's going to be the the carrier that might be different And so I use Compounded when that's appropriate sometimes patients don't want compound. It's a little more expensive. So we'll go with a Pharmaceutical grade from their Local pharmacy and then we'll do sub q injections and what about what about the topicals? Can you talk about when you would decide to use topicals or why or I don't use topicals that often and the reason being is that they're They're just sloppy I'll just say they're there you need to use large quantities of them to get the concentration that you need You need to be sure to wash your hands after you've used it because you can actually by touching your child or touching your wife They can actually absorb some of that testosterone and I've I've had I've had situations where women are beginning to have you know the effects of elevated testosterone because they're coming in contact with their husbands testosterone on their shoulder on you know Or other what other location you may have placed it or if it didn't wash his hands appropriately and they're in intimate contact So I don't use gels that often Because you can do sub q injections. I primarily will use the sub q injectable form of testosterone and there's other forms right pellets. Can you talk about pellets? So now you know again pellets what is that how do you do it? So they have to be placed on your skin And they're usually placed for up to six months they get replaced The the issue well, there's no issue with pellets They work they work fine, but you don't have the ability to make any alterations in the testosterone Concentrations so if it's not enough they're not experiencing it you have to remove them you have to put new pellets in I find that using testosterone injectable is just it's very flexible And it's very very simple and easy and it doesn't involve the placing of pellets in the skin. Yeah and in terms of the the side effects of testosterone placement because they're you know it is a hormone and and it can Have adverse effects and there's concern about risk of prostate cancer high cholesterol heart disease How do you address that? Well I think the the data on all of those are mixed When you look at you look at heart disease Particularly relationship to metabolic syndrome and even diabetes actually taking if you have low testosterone, which you probably will have in those cases Actually, there are studies that show replacing testosterone will improve your metabolic syndrome will actually improve your glycemic control muscle mass blood sugar. Yeah, exactly so So in that regard spike people's cholesterol. Oh, you can you can you can spike people's cholesterol Um does that mean they need a statin? No, it does not need a statin It's not something You know, you can also I've seen some studies where it also has lowers to lowers cholesterol So it's something I watch closely. It's not something I see that often And the other concern about prostate cancer is it's pretty clear in the data that testosterone does not cause prostate cancer Um if you have prostate cancer, it can it's not something you want to be taking because it can accelerate the growth of the cancer Uh the the issue that may or that I've talked to some urologists at harvard and your specialists in prostate cancer And you know a lot of times after prostate cancer treatment men have low sexual function and They're actually using the estalastral replacement and somebody's men when they're carefully monitoring them. Yes. Yeah, that's absolutely Um, yeah, I've read that in the literature as well And so there's there's a lot of safety behind testosterone And that's why I think men are beginning to understand it's safer and they know it's an option and they want it Uh and particularly when you start to combine it with the lifestyle changes and you combine it with the use of peptides Which I mentioned, you know men can regain a huge amount of vitality and and really improve their overall Experience of life now in a very in a fairly safe way. There's there's no reason I I believe that as we age Things happen to our bodies that we should and can't account for and I think it's it pretty I think it's a pretty you know Um low-hanging fruit for men to address these these hormone issues And use things like peptides that are sucker gogs for hormones that can actually increase muscle mass And decrease body fat What is the raging? Yeah, I think it's a really important point George. We we Are living longer Although our life expectancy is going down as a country because of all the obesity and terrible disease but but we are seeing people living longer lives and Sometimes in order to live vital lives there there needs to be a little bit of extra support because we do decline as we age But there are ways to mitigate that through the lifestyle interventions Exercise is so important Building muscle is so important and that's why testosterone is so critical even for women Uh testosterone is very important And I think that affects their sexual function affects their muscle mass energy motivation mood And it's really an ignored aspect of hormone therapy in women the thing that's just estrogen and progesterone But women also need this and I I have many patients right you've topical testosterone for women on the clitoris Here at the Elle Trolana Center. I mean, I don't apply directly they do it themselves, but it's It's a very powerful treatment and I it works. I know it works because women are always calling back for refills And they're just happily referring all their friends for it So I think there's a lot of ways to use hormones judiciously to do the right amount It's different than we think of the anabolic steroids like testosterone and bodybuilder shoes They use super physiologic dose. They use doses far beyond what is Ideal for a normal level. You don't want to get super levels you want Optimal levels optimal levels, right? And you want to and you want to make sure you're checking, you know, everything So you always check the sex Hormone binding globular now we check the estrogen levels Just to find this a gentleman like this that really needed an adjustment needed to be on a Remotase inhibitor There are some there are some docs that just put you on a romantic inhibitor right with testosterone. Yeah, I usually do Um, the natural versions I use this damn which is a supplement right and I'll use biotin Yeah, the other thing I think it's it's worth mentioning is that For some people there's an increased conversion to something called dht which is a Dihydro testosterone that can happen one use hormone replacement therapy and that increases the size of the prostate so People are concerned about a large prostate with this or increase and it can also increase cancer risk in some patients So it's really about looking at everybody's individual hormones and there are natural ways to affect the dihydro testosterone too, right? So with yeah, so with dht in particular So that's a that also and this is one of the concerns for women is hair loss You have you know increased dht which can affect the hair follicles and you're in and that can lead the hair loss And that's why men get hair loss and that's some of the drugs Like propisha right are actually blocking dht to prevent reductase inhibitors. Yeah to prevent the hair loss Right. Yeah, and so so that's so that's you know, I'm I'm generally again careful about that and on the Dutch profile It measures dht so we can actually see if a person, you know is going to be making too much of that and we can make adjustments You know and as you brought up before there are things that we can use like propisha now propisha You know has some concerns in regards to Some side effects that can be permanent so we're careful with using that There's natural versions Mato which is basically an herb. Yeah, you can take that helps to mitigate that conversion and you can use that topically as well as in an oil So I'm a little I'm you know, I use testosterone in women both Clotorally and it is part of their overall gel or I'll create for them with their cream But I'm somewhat careful about it because the hair loss Yeah, because the women the women that are coming in that need it are also going through menopause And they are there's naturally beginning to experience some of the natural aging that will thin out their hair And change their their hair growth cycle. They'll have a shorter antigen phase And so you have to be careful with the addition of testosterone Yeah, and we've done a number of podcasts to dr. Bo and others on on hormone replacement and hormone issues in women Which are common infertility PCOS PMS menopausal symptoms Fibroids all these are signs of hormone imbalance and they manifest differently obviously in women and men and we use a very similar approach of looking at Sophisticated testing that helps us navigate what's going on not just doing a simple regular blood test and the ultra-vondyl Center in functional medicine We we know how to think through the complexity of human biology and we can map out what's happening in each individual And it's not a one-size-fits-all treatment So, you know, it's the right medicine at the right dose for the right person for the right amount of time And it's really that personalization that is so key and I think we have the ability to do Testing to look at all these things not just testosterone, but free testosterone sex hormone binding goblin DHT estrogen levels the pathways aromatization the saliva levels It's a very sophisticated way of looking at things that allows us to really personalize the treatment Minimize the the dose and the risk but maximize the benefit. Yeah, and again with this patient Looking at the Dutch profile that we use that also tells us about the adrenal glands Yeah, and again He was a man that was under a great deal of stress with his work at that particular time And you can see that When you looked at the adrenal function on his Dutch profile You can see that his total his total cortisol levels were low His free cortisol levels were low which were evidence of chronic stress So we had that conversation So I can replace his testosterone But if I can I can do all these manipulations to make sure that it works right But if I don't reverse his stress, I am not doing that man a service I you know, I he will not feel well So with him we talked about meditation and we also gave him an adrenal supplement You know, these are herbs that are adaptogens that help the adrenals function better and between functioning adrenals that got his cortisol levels appropriately up but not too high Taught him out of meditate He was a far he this this guy was he was not just happy about his testosterone He was happy about the new lifestyle that he was adopting because then he got into yoga, right? And then he had a different community now a different community, you know, and of New blood and new stimulation in his life brought him greater life satisfaction Yeah, I think that's true. So so this is just a recap You know, many people suffer from Hormone imbalances and guys tend to have declining hormones as they age and even young guys I've seen young guys as young as 20 Who eat a crappy diet or stressed have low testosterone levels and poor sexual function So it doesn't mean it's just happened to seven-year-olds it can happen to anybody along the spectrum So I think it's really important to understand we we take a comprehensive approach. We look at lifestyle We look at the role of nutrition in hormones exercise stress sleep Environmental toxins and we look at a complicated Panels of hormones to help understand what's happening for that person and then we apply The first things first, which is food and lifestyle and then we can modify Using nutritional supplements herbs and if we need to we'll use hormone replacement therapy, but we use the minimum dose possible Applied in the safest way possible in a way that we track and follow and that's what's so unique about functional medicine It's not just a knee jerk response to oh, you've looked at south don't take the history of hormone secret It's really understanding the whole picture. Yeah, and that's what we do at the ultra-woundest center That's what's so special about our practice. We have a group of incredible physicians nutritionists Physicians assistants who've been working together for a long time We've probably over 60 years of collective experience in functional medicine And we now we're doing all virtual visits people want to come virtually they can Zoom it's great.
