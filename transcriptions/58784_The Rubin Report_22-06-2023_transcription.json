    "text": " I'm creepy Joe, one of the princesses. I'm here to shop you around and make all your selections for the day. Well, after a cold open like that, we're all going to have nightmares. I'm Dave Rubin. This is the Rubin Report. It's June 22nd in the year 2023. Little known fact, my due date back in 1976, that's a long time ago for you kids, was actually June 22nd. I was not born until June 26th. That's right, this Monday is my birthday prepare. Accordingly, people, we are live streaming as always on Rumble, Locals and YouTube. If you want to join us for the post game show, please do at RubinReport.locals.com. We are doing a community Q&A today. You can still get in some questions on the fly and a special welcome to the Rubin Report intern, Michaela, who is in town, in studio right now. Maybe at some point we'll have your hand just come in and you can wave to the people like the Queen. Last night, guys, in case you missed it, I was on the Fresh and Fit podcast over here in Miami. Really great show. I did not know, so these guys, they talk about culture, they talk about chicks and sports and just all the stuff going on in the world. They're here in Brickle in Miami, a really cool studio. I did not know that they're doing their show not only on Rumble, but on Locals. That's the home of their show. I walk in and they've got all these locals, signage everywhere and they're pushing everybody to Rumble in Locals. We talked about it a bit and it was just so great to see this fight that I've been on to get editorial independence and technological independence and everything else. Because I did something that I needed, I had to solve a problem for myself and how I wanted to go about doing the show. I was obviously one of the first guys doing the home studio thing before everybody was zooming without pants on and everything else. That now there's all of these people in all of these other disciplines doing all this other stuff literally all over the world using some of the technology that we built. So that was pretty awesome. You can catch the Fresh and Fit podcast with special guest Dave Rubin on Rumble or Locals right now and quick reminder, Dave Rubin.store. We have relaunched the store, new shirts, mugs, hoodies, all sorts of stuff and today's program people. You guys know my feelings about the great Douglas. Murray Douglas is a spectacular conservative thinker out of the UK. He actually lives, he's made one mistake in life. He lives in New York City at the moment. I'm working on getting him to the Free State of Florida. He lives in New York City at the moment. It's okay. He's having a little honeymoon with New York City. But nonetheless, he was on Piers Morgan's show debating one of these crazy woke gender crusaders and it was just an absolutely beautiful smackdown. And one of the things that I've been talking about a lot during this pride month or 22 days in pride month, only eight days left. And as I keep saying, if your genitals are still attached, you're lucky and enjoy them. One of the things that I keep saying is that the gays have to separate the Gs and the Bs and the Ls have to separate from the Ts because there is no movement more radically against the Gs and the Bs and the Ls than the Ts. If there was a group of, let's say, white male Christians that wanted to chop the genitals off the Gs, I'm pretty sure everybody would be against them. But because it's the Ts, somehow everyone and the corporations and big tech and everything else, the nonprofits, the NGOs, they're all about it. This is a problem. Douglas had a beautiful moment on Piers Morgan's show, so we're going to get to that. And then a Ruben report, community Q&A. Let me talk to you guys about old guard Petco quick and then we'll get to it. Guys, don't all dog food companies want to be the best for your dog? Well, no, not really.

Quick point on dogs. Do you know? You guys remember Emma? Emma was my dog before our dog before Clyde. I adopted Emma. It was I think 17 years ago today. It was June 22, 2006. She was a survivor from Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. They sent the dogs all over the place. She gave birth in a box during the hurricane. She wasn't able to be adopted. The hurricane was in August of 2005. She was so sick for about seven months. They could not really know more than seven months, about nine months. They couldn't release her. Finally, she was able to be adopted in June of the following year. We got her 17 years ago today. I missed that beat. All right. Let's talk about Douglas Murray and the destruction of the woke. Check out this clip. This is Douglas Murray on Piers Morgan going after a woke cult ideologue who was claiming that Douglas is a mean man. A fallacy which has been propagated by gender ideologues and is doing profound damage to gay people among others in our society as well as women. Like you ever had. And let me explain very quickly why. I can't quite hear you. I can hear you muttering something. Let me quickly explain why. A poll that just got published in the United States showed that among the general population support for gay marriage has been starting to decline in the last year. Why is that? It's because the arguments that actually brought about liberal rights for all minorities in the last few decades have started to get turned on their head and turned against people. What is the source of that? It is the gender ideology movement. What is the tripwire for the general public? It is children. It is people learning that their children are being taught nonsensical things. It is being seen by the wider public, most of whom are heterosexual and don't need to identify a cis or anything else. It is being seen from that vantage point as the LGBTQIA plus movement losing control of itself. And so a backlash is starting. And the backlash is coming because people are lying to children and are using children for medical experiments. There is nothing funny about this. There is nothing that should cause levity in that. It should be treated by adults seriously. Yeah. I mean Douglas, he is just one of the best. Who says it better? That perfect Queen's English? Is it the Queen's English or the King's English? It is the Queen's English, right? I think it is the Queen's English. The King probably spoke it too. But there is a point here. Years ago, you could probably find an interview. I have interviewed Douglas maybe a dozen times. I think he's probably been on the rubin' report more than anybody else. But you can find an interview of mine and Douglas from probably the fall of 2016. And he said a line that I often quote, which is that one day the barbarians will be at the gate and we will be debating which gender pronouns to call them. That's what he was saying seven, eight years ago. And that is what is happening right now. We are watching communism, socialism, Marxism, collectivism, all of this stuff usher in. And we're debating gender pronouns. And I love that he makes a point. I try to do things with a little bit of levity here. But he has a way of saying things in a very direct, clear, serious manner. That this is actually deeply depressing what these people have done. They have taken a movement that is just, movements for equality or just, movements to free the slaves are just movements to have black people vote or women vote or gay people to get married, movements that are of equal with the goal of attainable equal rights. So everyone that is legally here as part of the United States in this case is treated equally under the law. That is just, that's what liberal movements used to be for. But they could not leave well enough alone, right? And that's why the second gay marriage happened, the activist class, the average gay person was like, okay, wow, we did it. We're good. We clip. Let's go be human beings like everybody else. But the activist class, the people, the nonprofits, glad the HRC, all of these organizations. And by the way, you can do the racial version of this. What's Al Sharpton doing every day, all the race hucksters, they can't let it alone, right? Because they have to keep raising money by making you think everyone's racist or in this case everyone's homophobic or anything else. So the LGBTQI elemento P squad, they need more of this nonsense. And then they started turning it on kids, right? Suddenly you've got to be able to have a guy dressed as a puppy at a public parade, you know, basically torquing in front of a kid and that's supposed to be okay. And we all know that it is not. So Douglas beautifully lays that out. The woman kind of jumps in and then Douglas smacks her down just a bit more enjoy. So Douglas, it's really important actually all of that point that you've just brought up. It's very on brand for you because you know, you like to stoke fear. You've actually made a career out of it. We are, you know, I'll take you back to your book, The Strange Death of Europe. And you made a big fright. You know, you frightened the entire public about your thoughts on Europe and we end up in Brexit. You weren't this whole contributed to that, but you were a big boy. Can we stick on to the... You can't see the reticulises in that argument. I can't help you. The bigger issue is there is no such thing as gender ideology. We all have gender identities. You identify as a man and I fully respect you. Well, no, no, hang on. I don't identify as a man. I was born a biological. Yes. Yes. That's where this whole thing goes. Here's unique. Okay. Douglas. Very quickly. I don't know, Ava, anything about your career. I don't know if you have one. But you did try to imply that you knew something about mine and you just showed, you know, nothing about it because actually my 2017 bestseller, The Strange Death of Europe, was not about the EU. So you should learn at some point to read more than the title of the commenting upon it. He's just absolutely fantastic. First off, I love the other guy who of course was on the same side as the woman. I'm not even true who that was. But turning to peers, like trying to throw him a bone like you identify as a man. He's like, well, I am a man. But that's the whole point of how ludicrous this thing is because if peers had been said, you know what, I've been thinking about it while we're sitting here. I've enjoyed this debate. I'm actually a woman. The guy would have had to acknowledge that he was a woman because that's how stupid this whole thing is, right? If you feel like a woman on any given day, I'm a cat today. All right. Get him some kitty litter. Like it's so absolutely insane. And you can also see the way they try to link everything together, right? So because Douglas has a certain position based in biological reality when it comes to the sexes, somehow she can also kind of link him to the fact that he's a xenophobe because he was for Brexit and he doesn't like immigrants or something. It is just absolutely insane. But I want to link that to something that happened right here in the United States yesterday. There was a Senate hearing. It was called protecting pride, defending the civil rights of LGBTQ plus Americans. Again, that acronym is completely ridiculous. These letters have nothing to do with each other, but okay, let's put that aside. You guys all know Riley Gaines. Riley Gaines is the incredible female swimmer who was basically the number one swimmer in the entire country until Leah Thomas, who is a guy who has a penis, which as Connor often points out, he uses as a propeller for extra speed when he's swimming. He then became a girl and started beating Riley and all the other girls in these swimming races. Riley has just about had it. She has become an incredibly outspoken voice against boys and girls swimming, which something 10 years ago we all know we all would have agreed with. Here she is at the Senate hearing and it's rather extraordinary. In addition to being forced to give up our awards and our titles and our opportunities, the NCAA forced me and my female swimmer to swim to share a locker room with Thomas, a six foot four 22 year old male equipped with an exposing male genitalia. Let me be clear about this. We were not forewarned we would be sharing a locker room. No one asked for our consent and we did not give our consent. And I'll set the scene as something locker room is not a place of modesty. You're undressing, you're fully exposed, and we were forced to take off our swimsuit in front of a man who was doing the exact same thing. If nothing else, I truly hope how you can see this is a violation of our right to privacy and how some of us have felt uncomfortable, embarrassed, and even traumatized by this experience. I know that I don't speak for every single person who competed against the atomist, but I know I speak for many because I saw the tears. I saw the tears from the ninth and seventeenth place finishers who missed out on being named an all-American by one place. And I can attest to the extreme discomfort in the locker room when you, from these eighteen to twenty two year old girls when you turn around and there's male eyes watching in that same room. And I can attest to the whispers and the grumbles of anger and frustration from these girls who just like myself had worked our entire lives to get to this meet. And I can attest to the fact that around the country, these female athletes who opposed the inclusion of Leah Thomas and the women's divisions were threatened, intimidated and emotionally blackmailed into silence and submission. You know, that girl is a true hero. You know, a hero is not necessarily somebody who wants to be a hero from day one. A hero is someone who along the journey, something happens, and then they choose to walk into the fire. And that's what she is. This is a girl who committed her life to being the best swimmer she could be. Happens to be a female, so you compete against other females. Do you think if you would have asked Riley Gaines three years ago, would you like to be or do you think one day you will be testifying in front of the Senate because there'll be a guy in the locker room who will be beating you in swimming? She would say you're completely insane. Everyone would have said that was complete insanity. And yet here she is fighting it. And you know what's happening to her right now? The mainstream media, corporate press, blah, blah, blah. She's now far right. She's an evil conservative. She also happens to be supporting Governor DeSantis for president because he's actually fighting against that stuff in Florida. So you know, obviously she's very scary because of that. Anyway, this hearing continued. And now let's take someone on the other side of this debate. This is Kelly Robinson, who identifies as the first queer black president of the Human Rights Campaign. And here she is defending dudes in girls sports. Women in some that are short. You know, that a biological male has a physical advantage in sports over a biological female? Not as a definitive statement. Give me an example. Well, no, I don't think. How many female members of the NBA do you see? Well, I can say that, you know, there's been this news article about men that think that they could beat Serena Williams in tennis, right? That they think that they could actually score a point on her. And it's just not the case. She is stronger than that. What's your experience, Ben? Male female. Both Serena and Venus lost to the 203rd ranked male tennis player, which they're phenoms for women. My experience, my husband, he swam at University of Kentucky as well. In terms of accolades and in terms of national ranking, I was a much better swimmer than him. He could kick my butt any day of the week without trying. Okay. So here you have the black queer head of the human rights campaign saying that Serena Williams could beat men in women's beat men in tennis, right? Just if you put a woman against a man in tennis. It took us about 10 seconds to find this video, which we've shown you before. Here's Serena Williams on females versus males in tennis. Wow. Actually, it's funny because Andy Murray, he was joking about myself and him playing a match. And I'm like, Andy, seriously, are you kidding me? For me, tennis and men's tennis and women's tennis are completely almost two separate sports. So I'm like, if I were to play Andy Murray, I would lose 60, 60, and five to six minutes, maybe 10 minutes, because it's true. Honestly, really. It's a completely different sport. The men are a lot faster. And they get, they serve harder, they hit harder. It's just a different game. And I love to play women's tennis tonight. I only want to play girls because I don't want to be embarrassed. I would not do the tour. I wouldn't do Billie Jean any justice. So Andy, stop it. We're not going to let you kill me. I'm with you. And it comes to tennis. I only want to play girls. Yeah. We got that. That's a good line, Letterman. I miss him. Look, there you have arguably the greatest female tennis player saying it's not even the same sport. Men are stronger. They serve faster. They hit the ball harder. Like, it's obvious everyone knows it. And people always go, when is this thing going to end? Right? Like, what is rock bottom with this thing? And I'm telling you, there will be a rock bottom. And my guess is it's going to be something like this. There is going to be a 37 or 38 year old washed up because 37, 38 year washed up if you're an NBA player. I'm talking to a basketball player. I'm talking to somebody who's probably six, eight, two, 80 scoring two points a game. Never particularly good, but size wise could just make it to the NBA. He's going to retire. And he is going to suddenly give himself the name Angela. And he is going to score 35 points a game, grab 12 rebounds and eight assists a game in the WNBA. And they will crown the WNBA MVP a guy named Angela. That is how this thing will eventually implode. But you see how insane it is. The women and the women, I should say, so on one hand, Riley, on the other hand, Serena, the women that have to face off against men, they know reality, but the activists, the activists want to rejigger everything the way they want it to be organized. And that really is the problem here. It is a bunch of people against reality. Once again, to quote the great Douglas Murray, the barbarians will be at the gate and we will be debating what gender pronouns to call them. All right, we've got a Ruben report, community Q&A on the other side. Let me talk to you guys about Birch Gold Group real quick.

Tommy says tuckers getting 30 plus million views in 24 hours on Twitter. The question is yes, media is changing and I see the end of legacy media. How long do you think this is going to take? How will it manifest itself? Podcasts or shows like The Rising. Will there ever be a news show without bias on Twitter or locals that are powerfully educating and not indoctrination to any side? Well, let me just be very clear. The locals in Rumbles side, we welcome everybody. So you want to come on, you want to be a crazy lefty, you want to be on the far right, you want to be a moderate, you want to whatever you want to do, we just give you the tools to do whatever you want. You want to create a subscription system for your network or channel. That's what locals does. You want to get it out there and get distribution. That's what Rumbles does. So that's on one side. As far as the collapse of mainstream media, I mean, look, we've been seeing this forever. More numbers on this show if you add up, but at the end of the day right now, usually we have, you know, like on an average day, we'll have about 200,000 views on our full live stream on YouTube, usually about 150 on Rumbles. That's about 350. There are some days where it's cumulatively over a million, some days it's a little bit less, but our numbers on our long live stream that we do every day at 11 o'clock as you know, as you're watching it right now, we are now beating basically every, certainly every show on MSNBC. We're beating every show pretty much on CNN. We're beating many of the Fox shows and Fox had one standout show. That one standout show was Tucker in terms of news, right? The gut felled nightly show is crushing it. Absolutely. That's a little bit of a different situation. They have decided they didn't want to go that route. We'll find out a little bit more why they're obviously in this lawsuit with Tucker and he's fighting them right now. I think the reason that he's not on Rumble is for contractual reasons. They're able to keep him off a purely video site and he's using some legal loopholes to get on Twitter, but they're fighting that out in the legal battle at the moment. I think basically what's going to happen is that the mainstream media is pretty much like a wounded animal in the corner. Right now, it's wounded. It's going to die, but it will lash out relentlessly as it does. That's why for all the people that CNN fires, right, they got rid of Stelter, they got rid of Don Lemon, they got rid of Chris Lick, who was the new CEO to turn the thing around. As many people as they fire, they're not turning it in the right direction. It's too late. The New York Times is not suddenly going to be like, oh, I guess we did lie about everything for the last couple of decades. Maybe we should fix it. Washington Post, they're all in on the thing. They basically have to run out the clock. I don't know what that means exactly, but they're just not going to turn around. I think the best bet for you watching this is if you think I'm doing a decent job, you keep tuning into this show. If you like Shapiro, if you like Crowder, if you like someone on the other side, you just keep supporting the people that you think are doing something roughly close to the truth. And yeah, the danger, of course, is that we'll all kind of go off in our own different ways. We'll never agree on what is true. It's one of the reasons that I've been hit in Trump the last couple of days, right? Like these attacks on Florida, when he's going after DeSantis, and New York was better on COVID and calling him Lockdown Ron and everything else. It's like, we all know it's bullshit. He knows it's bullshit. He's not convincing anybody, but a certain amount of people just go along for the ride. And I think that long term that becomes dangerous for the country. The truth is the truth, and we need to be able to know what the truth is. Tony says, how many countries have you visited, and which was your favorite? I'm up to 14 myself with another two to three in the works this year. You know, I'm probably around 14 or so, maybe a dozen. No, it's got to be a little bit more of that. With Jordan, I did a whole bunch of countries because we did all the Nordic countries, and I've done UK, and I've done Italy, and I've done Egypt, and I've done Israel, and I've done Hungary and Canada and Mexico. And yeah, so it's somewhere around there. What was my favorite country? What was my favorite country? Well, I would say the best moment, you know, when I was bouncing from country to country with Jordan, the best moment, I can't say this is my favorite country overall, but the best moment was going to Sweden, where we did two shows because the first show sold out in literally two minutes. We were like, holy cow, what's going on here? So we added a second show, and Sweden, which is absolutely, it's a beautiful country, and the people are beautiful, and it's very clean and all that. It's having problems with immigration and everything else. They have a real political correctness problem there. And to go there and talk to the people, it was actually one night after the second show, I was doing meeting, Jordan would do his meet and greet, and I would do a separate meet and greet if people wanted to chat with me after, and it was so packed with like several hundred people that I said, you know, we got to get out of here. Let's just all go to a restaurant together. We all went to a restaurant, and there were philosophers and Swedish famous Swedish comedians and authors and all of these people, and we just talked for hours and hours that night. It was just an absolutely wonderful night. Jen says, have you commented on the AI-generated photos of Trump and Fauci that came out a week or so ago from the DeSantis campaign? Tim Poole brought it up, and unless I missed it, it's just sort of failed away without comment. I mentioned it briefly on the show, maybe a week or so ago, it wasn't a campaign ad on the rapid response DeSantis Twitter account. They put up a video of Trump and Fauci, Trump praising Fauci, which was not manipulated, and then they did put up, I had to watch the video twice to even see what they had done, because I watched it, and I was like, why is everyone freaking out about this? There was two or three small pictures of Trump hugging Fauci that were not real. They were AI. Now, let me just say this. First off, they shouldn't have done it. They shouldn't have done it. Everyone's going to do it. Does Trump lie about everything? Sure. But AI is so dangerous that we are going to so manipulate images and voice and video and everything else. It is just a dangerous path to hell that we're probably going down one way or another, when people will no longer know, speaking of truth, when people will no longer know what's true one way or another. They put it up. They got hit hard for it. I don't think that they'll do it again. I didn't feel the need to make a big deal about it, because again, the other side's lying about pretty much everything. This was a very, it really was minor in that if you watch the whole video, it didn't change what the truth of the video was, that Trump gave Fauci an award on the way out that he repeatedly praised him and everything else. If they had used AI to manipulate the truth in a way, then I would have hit them harder on it. But for sure, it was a mistake. And you look, you open that Pandora's box of AI, and you better be very careful, because what comes out could really come to bite in the butt. Snowbaby says, as an employer, what are some things that you value greater than potential profit? I've always felt an employer should consider the safety of their employees one of their priorities. The bottom line is important. I know you drug your team from the dumpster fire of California. Yes, I did save all you people from California. I always say to my guys, I don't want to grow just for the sake of growing. You know what I mean? There's always ways that we can figure out how to grow the show, and then I can hire more people, and we can grow the show, and I can hire more people in everything else. One of the things that I'm very proud about here is we have never, believe it or not, we have never put a dime into advertising on this show. So if you watch all of the shows that are comps, everybody puts a ton of ads into YouTube and all that stuff, we have never put a dime. Every bit of our growth has been completely organic. And that was sort of a, for me, it wasn't that I didn't want to spend the money on that. It was just like, all right. I put more money into the advertising. We get more viewers now, I hire more people. Then I put more advertising in, we get more viewers, I hire more people. Like, it just seemed like, let's just keep doing something that's nice and tight and trim. I'd say the most important thing when you have a team like this is that you want everybody to feel fulfilled and rewarded. So my policy on work, as I always tell the guys, it's like, as long as you do your work, I don't care when you do it or how you do it. But we have an incredibly, incredibly tight team now. Nothing ever slips through the cracks. We just, I know my guys are going to show up in the morning. I know I'm going to wake up every morning and my rundown with Phoenix is going to be ready to roll and we work through it and then it happens. I know when we're doing the show, that Connor running the board is going to get to the right videos at the right time. I'm putting a lot of pressure on you today. Anything could happen. And we just know that it's all going to work. So I think just making people feel like they're valued and important. And I'll feed you guys on Saturday. We're going to have a big birthday party. I'm going to feed you probably filet mignon, but we shall see. David says, while I understand the support for governor DeSantis, I fear this Republican civil war is just what the Dems wanted. How do you think DeSantis wins the general without MAGA? How does either candidate win with a split base? Well, first off, I think that whoever the nominee is, most of the people will come around. Right? Look, am I supporting DeSantis? Yes. That Trump, even this morning again, with this Florida nonsense and the COVID that he keeps doing this, yes. Will I vote for Trump if it's Biden against him? Obviously. And I think that's the way most people feel. It just, there's a primary and you fight it out in the primary. That's just kind of how it is. So I think it's a key piece of this to make sure that you're not burning everything down. That's why I think the lies out of the Trump side are so dangerous. Because you don't, when you say, okay, Ron DeSantis is a rhino and he's sorrows back that he's friends with Paul Ryan and Karl Rove and all that, it's like these are literally made up fabrications. They're made up fabrications and especially on the COVID stuff, it's completely counter to reality. But you're telling a certain set of your people that and they're going to believe it and then they're not going to vote. I'm fairly certain that 99% of the DeSantis supporters at the end of the day, if it's Trump, especially the Floridians, if it's Trump and then DeSantis stays the governor of Florida, they'll vote for him. And that's how it'll be for me. At the end of this, people are like, Dave, you're going to come crawling back to Trump. But I'm like, look, first off, I think it's important to fight for what you think is right. Whether I agree with you or not, if you're fighting for what you principally believe is right, then that's good. And at the end, it's just politics. So if my guy loses this one and Trump becomes president, that's fine. What we don't want is Joe Biden to be president again. We don't want is Kamala Harris. We don't want Gavin Newsom. That's the big issue. So you just got to remember, primaries get nasty. Don't forget literally, literally during the 2015 primary, Donald Trump said that Ted Cruz's father killed JFK. Okay, that was a lie. It did not happen. Ted Cruz ended up being one of Donald Trump's biggest supporters. So politics is very weird. It makes strange bedfellows. I think most of that stuff will work itself out. Matthew says, do you still talk to Candace Owens? I asked because she moved further to the right. You know, I haven't spoke to her much lately. We did trade a phone call two or three weeks ago. She had said something that I just wanted to clarify with her. One of the things that I'm not a fan of doing is especially if I'm friends with somebody. If they say something that I don't agree with or whatever, I'm not just going to blatantly go after them without reaching out to them privately. So I did send her a text, put in a call, missed her that she called me. I missed her. I've been able to connect. But look, again, as I just said, everyone's entitled to their own political beliefs. I believe that friendship as a general rule is more important than politics. It's why when as the DeSantis Trump thing heated up, I went out of my way to text junior and say, hey, I hope we're good to go. And you know, we'll see what happens after this. He immediately responded that we are. We've been friends for over a decade. I had the same thing with Ivanka. Texted her. And immediately she responded. And that is the weird thing about being part of this. It's like your allies with people one day and then seemingly you're in opposition and it can start getting real nasty. But like if you realize there are more important things about being a human than just winning in politics, I think you'll be okay. Pratt says, Fox now has many ads from BlackRock. Follow the money. I also spotted an anti-oil sans ad being from Alberta. Definitely caught my attention. Follow the money has Fox been bought out. So Fox has a lot of ads from BlackRock. I didn't know that specifically. So I'll take your word for it, but I can't verify that just on the fly. Have they been bought out? Look, it's a little hard to see to tell what's going on with Fox. You know, they lost the Dominion lawsuit, which was about the election and all that stuff. It was about 800 million bucks. And then obviously what was it two weeks later? Tucker, it was out over there. Dan Bongino was out soon after. Or was it or maybe Bongino was out just a few days before if I'm not mistaken. Anyway, so it's hard to tell what exactly is going on there. What I can tell you from my back and forths with the Fox people is we get emails every week. Would you like to do this show, that show, the other show? I always say the same thing as long as it's live and I'm unedited. I will go on the show. So lately I've been doing Dan Bongino a lot. I do some of the other shows. I'm not doing the even people always ask, why aren't you used to do Hannity all the time? I was on Tucker and the more of the evening shows. I don't do them just because my life has changed. Now obviously with kids, I just don't want to be in studio. It was easier when I was on the West Coast. We're here now and I didn't know kids. We're now I have kids. I just don't want to be in studio at seven o'clock, like we're either putting them to bed or I just want to be around a little bit more. So it's much easier for me. I'd always rather do something from like 7 a.m. to say 5 p.m. Something like that. So there's no grand conspiracy there. But my personal policy on Fox, which would be even if CNN called me now and CNN has never called me. I've tried to get on many times over the years. I don't try anymore. And even if MSNBC, if you will put me on unedited and live, that's it. Those are my obligations. Those are my requests. Then I'll do it. But so I can't speak to what's going on on the advertising side. I don't know. Talway says, I've noticed you haven't had much to say about the lost submarine that went after the Titanic. Rather than asking your thoughts about the sub and the passengers itself, I'm more curious as to your thoughts on the reactions and responses to this crisis. And do you see this as part of the degradation of society through social media? So for those of you that haven't paid attention to this, you know, this is the story that everyone's been talking about these last few days. There was this expedition by a billionaire and a few other people to go see some of the remnants of the Titanic and now the ship that they went on, the submersible has disappeared. There is an operation right now trying to find them, but Phoenix was telling me right before we started. It sounds like at this point they've most likely run out of oxygen and died. What you're referring to there, Talway, is that the media's reaction to this and social media's reaction, like people joyfully, you know, celebrating that a billionaire died or how stupid these people are. I mean, it's all just gross, but you know, social media just does gross things with everything. But I think we have this one headline. I saw this. This is truly beyond imagination. Like I actually, my quote tweet of this was I'm actually speechless. This is from the New Republic. Look at this headline. Ocean Gate CEO missing in Titanic sub history of donating to GOP candidates. What the high hell does that have to do with anything? What does that have to do with anything? Are you celebrating this man's death and the death of the other people on board? And there was a 19 year old because this guy may or may not have voted or supported or given money to Republicans. Like how freaking twisted could you possibly be? It's just incredible. But yeah, you just see awful things on social media all day and partly why I try not to be on the Twitter on the weekends and I just hang out with you guys on locals and post food and pictures of the kids and that sort of thing. And it's why I do the off the grid August. I think it just keeps me fresh and you know, that's it. Quinn says, if I'm not mistaken, Dave's birthday is next week. How are you celebrating beef, fish, pork or chicken, all of the moyk options? So my birthday is on Monday. We're having a team dinner for everybody here on Saturday and I'm trying to decide what to do. It kind of depends on the weather. You know, Florida this time of year, you can just get crazy storms. Later today, I'm going to try to get to the place where I get my big ass briskets. We may do some flamingion if they don't have a brisket that I like. But if I can get a nice like 14 pound wagoo brisket, I'll put that on it like I'll try to put it on about six in the morning and we could eat about seven o'clock at night. Let it go for about 12 hours and knock that out. And you guys you guys eat meat? Okay, you eat meat meat meat. Okay, everybody's gonna eat some meat. We'll see. I don't think we have any. We have no vegetarians on this team. That would be my red line in terms of hiring. I am not going to have one of those soy boy freaks on this team. Okay. So yeah, it will it will be red meat related. I promise you that and we'll get some pictures up of course. Joe says in your opinion, which religious story offers the best life advice? You know, this is very easy for me. And because I mention it so often and I've written about it and I just think it's the one that is the most important, especially these days as we have a time of big government and big tech. It's David verse Goliath. The little guy can beat the big guy. There is a reason that is a biblical story that has resonated with people for literally thousands of years. It's not just that David had the slingshot and was able to take out the giant, right? It's not just that. It's that you have a chance to do something against the machine, right? Like if you really believe that, you might start doing things. You might build a company like why was I like, all right, everyone was complaining about big tech and all these problems. And I was like, all right, I guess I'll just start a company, locals, and we'll just see what happens. Well, locals eventually then merge with rumble. Rumbles now the number one competitor to YouTube. YouTube's the Goliath in this situation. I really fundamentally believe that if David can beat Goliath, then Dave can beat Google, this Dave. So like if you get that concept, I mean, that's the purpose of biblical stories. They're not just like, like some of the stories are more fun, right? Noah is a kind of fun story. He got all these animals and they built a boat and they'd like, that's nuts, right? And it's kind of fun. And if you watch the, I actually thought the movie with, what's his name from Gladiator? Who's the actor? Russell Crowe. I actually thought that movie was pretty good. You know, they, they'd fictionalize it a little bit and it has some sci-fi elements or whatever. But the point of a good story, it is, it's going to unleash a, a hidden truth, right? And if you fundamentally believe that, and I think truth is so fundamental that when it's released, it's like it cannot be stopped. Because if you did not believe that you could beat the big guy, that the little guy could beat the big guy, then, then how would it, how could you go about and accomplish your dreams? How could you ever have the hero's adventure or any of that kind of stuff? So I think that, for me, that's the one that resonates the most. It's like, you've always got a chance, but you got to take that chance, right? I'm guessing David was pretty nervous before, you know, he's putting the slingshot together going, oh, shit, that guy's huge. But you know what, one shot, he won and then it worked out. He became the king. Pretty good. Mike says, hey, Dave, when today's children are growing up, many of them will be suffering both physically and psychologically from current year sex change surgeries. Do you think the Democrats will own the mess they created or will there be more smoke and mirrors like when they lied and said it was really Republicans who wanted to defund the police? That's a great analogy. And unfortunately, yes, smoke and mirrors. At what point in the last 10 years of this craziness has the left ever said, boy, maybe we went a little too far. Maybe defunding the police, burning down our cities was a bit much. Maybe relentlessly lying about Trump and Russia collusion was a bit much. Maybe calling Brett Kavanaugh a serial rapist, like you know all the stories, right? Like everything that they lie about, the machine then covers up for them. Did you see this clip? We could have showed it on the show today. Adam Schiff was on Anderson Cooper last night and Anderson Cooper actually did a halfway decent job of journalism. He basically was like, you know, so it all kind of turned out to be nothing. Now, of course, Anderson Cooper was pushing Russia collusion for three years, but he basically was like, you know, it turned out to be nothing. Do you regret anything? And Schiff is like, no, don't regret it. We'll do it all over again. And it's like Schiff should be embarrassed. Schiff should never want to show up at a restaurant again. Schiff should be living in a cave somewhere, right? But he won't. He will, you know, he's a congressman now. He says he's going to run for Senator and knowing Democrat privilege, he will probably become the next Senator from California, right? These people fail their way up. It's just absolutely extraordinary how they do it. So no, I don't anticipate, you know, the people who lied and lied and lied about COVID, right? All the people who demanded who weeks before were telling you my body, my choice when it became when it was a woman's right related to abortion and pregnancy and that sort of thing suddenly were saying, no, it's not your choice. You damn well better get injected with this experimental vaccine that's actually not a vaccine. We're going to have to redefine the word vaccine because this thing does not vaccinate, which is what vaccines usually were known to do before the COVID vaccine. They get away with everything. I think the comeuppance that you're looking for will not be that the Democrats as a party or the media as an institution will come around and say, we're sorry, we really screwed that one up. I think what's going to happen is actually going to be something much more twisted, which is that the generation of kids right now who are going undergoing chemical castration and hormone therapy and being so mentally and physically abused, when they are adults and when their parents are now aging out, they are going to send them to some freaking nasty old age homes. I'm not actually kidding on this. I think there's going to be elder abuse that you cannot imagine. These parents have failed their basic duty as a human being, as a parent, and they're going to be sending them to shady pines from hell. I mean, it's like I can be glib about it, but I think there's going to be a mass generational problem. Imagine if you're 14 right now and your parents allowed you to do this and now you're 28 and your genitals don't match and all of the stuff, the psychological stuff and the drugs and everything else, how angry you would be at those people who it was their most sacred duty to protect you and they did not do it. On top of all the teachers who did it and everything else, yeah, so they'll be held to pay, but it's not going to come from the Democrats or mainstream media. Kathy says, would you like one of your sons to follow in your footsteps and work on the Rubin Report? You know, that's a good one. Justin, I mean, this kid is, he is so, first of all, they're both 95th, 95th or 96% island height and weight. They're huge. Both of them are absolutely huge. Justin is a beast. This kid is climbing over everything, ripping wallpaper, anything he can find anywhere. If he, like, he's eating Clyde's toys. I got Clyde. The dog is eating all the baby toys and the kids eating all the dog toys. It's just bananas downstairs. We got like just everywhere. I'm just trying to make sure that whatever he's climbing on, he's just not going to get too high and hurt himself. He's going to do something physical in life. It's very obvious. He's clearly going to be a great athlete, something like that. Luke is just a thinker. This kid just sits there and he stares at you and he's thinking and he's very serious. And then every now and again, little smile, little smile because he knows something's up. I don't know what he knows, but you see these kids every now and again, you're like, he knows something. I'm not exactly sure what it is. So I think he's going to be like a playwright or writer or an author or something like that. And Justin is definitely going to do something and Justin's going to be like a bitch digger or he's just going to do something physical I can tell. But as far as like working on this, I mean, look, their last names are Ruben. He's going to have to take over when the old man retires. It's going to be like secession. You know what I mean? There's just going to be a war over who's going to get to host the Ruben report. It'll be, they're going to do a series on HBO. We shall see. Joking aside, I just want to support whatever will make them fulfilled and hopefully a little bit happy, but happiness should not be the goal. Purpose should be the goal. And hopefully we'll give them the tools to do just that. Dave says, just discovered the improvements in the locals Apple TV app. Ah, very nice. We're now watching on the iPad over dinner and move to the Apple TV on the big screen. You look fabulous. It even remembers where we stopped on the iPad. Keep up the good work. So I've been telling you, you know, a lot, I know people are always, there's a lack of patience when it comes to building things, but you really got to understand what we're doing at locals and rumble. We are building everything ourselves. We are not outsourcing stuff. We're not bringing in third parties. The cloud infrastructure is what rumble built itself. Literally the physical pieces are owned that like the hardware is owned by rumble. There are cloud servers all over the place. I don't even know where they all are. I'm not even supposed to know where they all are because you want cloud servers in various places so they can't just be taken out, right? Like that's next level warfare when when the machines take over, they start blowing up buildings because that's where the servers are that are running the internet. That's a whole other sci-fi black mirror adventure right there. But we are building everything ourselves. So I'm glad to see that the new Apple TV app is humming along quite nicely. We are working on some call in features. You know, we acquired the call in app that David Sachs created. So I'll be able to do a live call in audio call in show with you guys, which I can't wait till we incorporate in the app. So that will be something for subscribers. So we'll start doing a new version of the show or it'll be part of the post game show or something where you guys can call in old school radio like Larry King when he would do his TV show and he'd be interviewing somebody and then they would take callers that were screened in. But we're not even going to screen them because if you guys pay a couple bucks, I'm going to trust that you're a decent human being that cleans up almost everything. And we're working on a whole host of other features. I told you, we're working on messaging to messaging, meaning that you guys can message each other having nothing to do with me once you're in the app, a whole bunch of other stuff. So just just hang tight. But I promise you, it's all coming. It's all coming. One more for you. If you couldn't learn, this is Elizabeth, you could learn instantly. Any language, what would it be? Look, I live in South Florida. My Spanish could be better. I am working on it a bit, but we have so many Cubans down here, so many Venezuelans, Guatemalans, so many people, Spanish is just ubiquitous down here. And if I could brush up a little bit, I could probably get more of my house projects done because I got a lot of guys coming in and I got to do translate, they got to do translate and it would save a lot of time. So a little un porquito espanor, we be a little Spanish. Very good. Guys, if you have not subscribed, please do so on rumble.com slash Ruben report.
