That's home title lock calm Your life your country you're listening to the Laura Ingram podcast I'm at the foot of the ladder the lamb footbeds are only depressed in the surface about One or two inches although the surface appearance be Very very fine grained as you get close to it. It's almost like a powder Down this is very fine I'm gonna step off the lamb now It's one small step for man I Please It is hard to believe 50 years ago this month of You know they Apollo 11 mission was successful Americans on the moon I was Just out of kindergarten and I remember it It was the biggest event like it was the biggest television event that I can remember That was like I can't think of anything in my life now that approaches in and a little black and white television and You're you're seeing the pictures on TV so challenging wait a second that thing we look up in the sky at night That that's and when I was little I remember looking up saying can you see the men on the moon? Yeah, like when you're little you just think wait He's up. Do you think they're looking down at us now and it was just such a it was such a period of even with all the you know the anti-war protests and Summer of love and then it was after of course the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert F. Kennedy and All the things that were happening on the streets the riots in DC This was a moment that our nation came together in Wonderment of what was possible when we put American ingenuity engineering These team efforts at NASA were it's just amazing and similarly when You think about it. It was also You know rather disheartening depressing even when America seemed to be giving up space Where NASA was you know obviously we retired the space shuttles and instead we were relying on private companies or other countries to launch our research into space and even our personnel and That also became a depressing depressing moment in our history in recent times and of course we we fell on economic hard times and It was budget cuts and it was I mean this is what happens when you don't have periods of peace and prosperity We you don't focus on America first meaning We need to take care of ourselves our engineering our know-how our Advancement our quest for knowledge and when we do that we're better off for everybody for our people for the rest of the world and I think that it's a good thing to remember now as President Trump has said You know we're not we're not giving this up. We're not we're gonna be be back in space In a big way, and this is something he addressed on the 4th of July Exactly 50 years ago this month the world watched in all as Apollo 11 astronauts launched into space with a wake of fire and nerves of steel And planted our great American flag on the face of the moon half a century later We are thrilled to have here tonight the famed NASA flight director who led mission control during that historic endeavor the renowned gene cramps Gene I want you to know that we're going to be back in the moon very soon and someday soon We will plant the American flag on Mars And I want to thank all of our sponsors who are supporting this show and this podcast of course helping make it available Free to you every week gen you sell ADT home security and home title lock We don't stop at the moon We go beyond the moon into into the next frontier of space Joining us now is to mark this incredible month of discovery as we look forward to the future is Holly riding she's a NASA chief flight director and Just a huge moment for NASA and I think so many people are just excited about what's to come Holly It's great to have you on how are you doing today? I'm doing great. Thanks so much for having me What does this mean this 50th anniversary as a point of reflection and perhaps a to use a Apropos phrase a launching point for future NASA missions Well, I think you described it really act clean first of all the reflection is is very important right? I mean one of the phrases that we use when we talk about You know the team that got us to the moon is that we stand on the shoulders of giants right and and those people the astronauts You know the flight directors the flight controllers the entire team, you know really are giants to us, right? But along with the reflection it's also exciting because now we're having the opportunity in our careers to be those giants for the next generation That's now our responsibility and you know, that's just really an amazing honor and opportunity Will you explain to our podcast listeners across the globe? What being a flight director means and we remember all the you know the classic archival footage Of the of all the engineers and all the flight personnel on the ground and at the space center and they're doing calculate They're like hand calculations by hand and they're charting it out with pencils and pens So what what does a flight director do today? Well, the most important job of a flight director is the safety of our crews that are on orbit, right? So that's the number one thing to remember how we do that task is things like you saw We have a team of folks who are experts in all of the different systems of the spacecrafts and cute including the human systems And so those systems are required different things sometimes it's mass or trajectory You know, we have power systems communication systems But at a very fundamental level the flight director is the leader of the team responsible for the safety of The astronauts are crew members and then after that obviously the safety of the space vehicle They're flying in and thirdly the success of the mission that we've been charged with I mean, are you the first female flight director in the in the history of NASA? That's amazing. Oh my gosh That is such Congratulations just on that that is so incredible and so inspiring to young girls across the the country and across the globe Tell us how you and your own personal Trajectory and school and so forth. How did you get to this place? What did you study? What did you immediately find yourself drawn to and talented for? Well, I mean, I've been interested in space since I was really young One of the things I love to do is just solve complex problems So, you know, the young student coming out space has got a lot of complex problems and I arrived at NASA I was drawn to operations. I enjoy communicating and Working with people and that's kind of the place where the people aspects merge, you know with all of the technical aspects I was selected as a flight director and you know kind of worked my way through through the system had a bunch of opportunities You know, NASA's amazing from the perspective of diversity and so me personally, you know Always had opportunities that really came with you know As hard as I wanted to work and as much you know grit and effort as I wanted to put in and then about a year ago I I was honored to be selected as the first female chief flight director. Oh my gosh You like to solve complex problems, okay? I can't even I can't imagine I couldn't as a child watching Apollo 11 again on our tiny little black and white television in Glastonbury, Connecticut where they huddled around You can't conceive as just a person who's maybe not the greatest at math or you're not like I remember physics and calculus And I would get I have a cold sweat right now actually just remember remembering studying them So here you all are there okay, you know the speed that the air that the vehicle will travel in and the with a booster Is drop and the panels and we can't have it milk I mean how many people I know these seem like really dumb questions But these are the questions that I come come into my head about this how many people does it take to get a complex NASA mission Off the ground from start to finish if you had to like just ballpark it how many people? And you know it's a good question right because when you consider you know how many people we support in America through the various contracts we have and if you added all of those right right all of the people who you know build the nuts and bolts that then get you know assembled into the spacecraft I mean you're you tend tens of thousands of people that you affect their lives if you want to think about you know Launching the spacecraft or the folks are sitting in mission control. We often are taking care of the space station with you know Just a dozen or fewer people so you got to think about how you want to answer that question But out of fundamental level space as an industry space as a human endeavor You know touches you know so many human lives here in the United States and then also across the world Gene crance of course who is a legendary you know flight director He said he was taught he was being asked about his vision and the learning process And you can hear some music in the background of this sound bite, but this was from an interview he did with Smith Sonyan back in I guess it was just last month. I thought it was earlier this year, but it was last month. Let's listen failure is And it's an ingredient in life. It's an agreement ingredient in growing Probably the worst failure of my life and our lives as mission controllers is when we Lost our crew and they Apollo one fire And we lived with that failure and what we did about it though became very important We sat and established a set of values a set of standards that We would all live up to they were expectations for ourselves and for others Failure is an incredible intense learning process and if you use those learning process It was worthwhile The annoying music notwithstanding in that clip that has to be Always on your mind It's a human beings involved and the world is watching how much pressure does that add to the situation? So you're exactly right I mean there is a tremendous amount of pressure with the you know the lives of our crew members, you know in our hands and and You know genius quoted talking about failure is not an option and and that's in our DNA today Right, we have the type of people who want to solve problems who really want to be You know in the hot seat making the decision when you know when it needs to be made if you were doing a Sportunality you say you know you're the type of person that wants the ball when the game is is on the line and you know It's very stressful, but we have an amazing training program that helps us You know know what to do in the right cases and then we have to you know find the right folks who really when you Get outside of your training have that ability to still you know figure out what's the right thing to do for the crew members And the mission we call that risk management and it's been passed down to us You know I mentioned at the beginning on the shoulders of giants King cranes is one of those giants and so that's our our DNA today And it's partially my responsibility to to maintain that that DNA and pass it along Holly this is just such an amazing moment for the country for NASA for what lies next and before we let you go What do you hope for Out of NASA in the United States. Let's just over the next decade. What can we expect? Well, you know we started out with Was talking about reflection, but the word I like to use is excitement, right? So Many people remember Apollo, but my generation and our NASA administrator Jim Brydens and talked about this We remember you know challenge and we remember Columbia and and weren't alive when Apollo happened And so you know to have the opportunity to get to the moon in 2024 the first woman on the moon the next man on the moon and the excitement that goes with that sure It's a tremendous amount of responsibility But you know we get the flight spaceships out of low earth orbit You know to the moon and then beyond to Mars and you know This couldn't ask for a better opportunity and we need to make sure that that we provide that you know to The people today and then the generations behind us because you know We should never underestimate the power of that dream and the impact that it's gonna make and we're gonna do it We're in 2024. We're excited. Oh my gosh. We are so thrilled. Holly riding NASA chief light director historic moment for NASA for the country and led by The first woman chief light director, which I think is so I mean that's important for so many reasons we need more young women going into stem and engineering and and technical fields all across the board because they're great leaders and inherently I think women are problem solvers we have to be and Holly you obviously are in a big big way. Thank you so much Holly for joining us. We really appreciate it I'm glad to be a role model and thank you so much for having me and letting me share with everyone Absolutely, Holly riding here on the Laura Ingraham podcast Have you gotten robo calls or mail saying that you're pre-approved for loans or credit cards? Well, if you have thieves both foreign and domestic may have you in their sites and it's the equity in the home that they And it's the equity in your home that they want. It's called home title fraud And it's one of the fastest growing crimes thieves are after your money and they get it by forging your home's title So it looks like you sold your home then they'll take out loans against your home and stick you with the payments. Oh No insurance bank or identity theft program protects you but home title lock does for pennies a day home title lock puts a barrier Around your home's online title and mortgage to keep thieves away again If you've received robo calls or mail for pre-approved credit cards or loans, you need to move fast You can receive 60 free days of risk free home title lock protection now by going to home title lock calm Register your address to verify you're not already a victim go to home title lock calm. That's home title lock calm But why some say the moon? Why choose this as our goal and they may well ask why climb the highest mountain? Five 35 years ago fly the Atlantic why does rice play Texas? We choose to go to the moon We choose to go to the moon and this decade and do the other thing not because they are easy But because they are hard Because that goal Will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills Because that challenge is one that we're willing to accept One we are unwilling to postpone and one we intend to win and the others to Well, of course JFK was now reaching for the stars literally and it was tied into this sense I think in the early 1960s of America the best the strongest unafraid We're the smartest and we're gonna show everybody and we're gonna do it because it's hard think about today how So many that get a lot of airtime on TV and politics and the culture they do do the easy thing to get attention to Get promoted to Make a buck But the easy way out we have a lot of people who take the easy path Sue someone to get money because you can You can Make a charge against someone It's easier than making an argument, right? you can Come to the country illegally well, it's not easy to get up to the border But once you're in you don't have to go through all the nonsense of applying for You know legal status do the even even that I mean it's not easy, but it's it's not the right thing And it was the right thing and the hard thing to go to the moon It was right for science and research and discovery But it was also it was hard obviously and it's beyond obvious But it also tests us as people and it affirms our sense of patriotism our love of country our love of Achievement and again getting back to merit where it doesn't matter It doesn't matter where you came from or your skin color or your ethnicity none of that matters as long as you Follow the rules want to be American Contribute love our country as much as we do doesn't mean you don't criticize leadership Yeah, I'm not saying that but you love the country love the fundamental tenets of this country That's what it's all about. That's where we are and and I think that's where we're we're slowly getting back to Where that sense of patriotism? It's right out in front of us and we're not gonna allow it to be put on trial our patriotism. No way In fact, we're gonna challenge those who don't seem To love the founding ideals of our country our founders Everyone's imperfect they were imperfect but genius a Genius after a genius after a genius against all odds broke free from the bonds of tyranny from Britain and I ultimately established the government that would organize and Set off the most incredible experiment and Representative democracy the world has ever seen That's an amazing thing Again doesn't mean there wasn't some bad things that happened very bad things happened but overall and Without a doubt the greatest country in the face of the earth from from the start Where people believed we would fall quickly. There's no way a representative democracy organized under the principles of federalism and And the states rights argument versus the federal government and all these different visions coming from Hamilton to Jefferson led by Washington and Madison and that was no way they were gonna hold together this diverse group of people from these Different parts of of this new new land this new country the Virginians didn't agree with the Connecticut folks and the Massachusetts folks didn't agree with You know with the folks in Maryland, but we we figured it out This sense of patriotism that we we should be proud of who we are and I think going back in a big way into space is important for our national psyche our advancement our Our young people who can strive to greater things as well, and I just go back to this I go back to this Understanding in my own way of of the genius of the men and women of NASA I mean the minds and the ability to see what none of us just mayor mayor You know academic mortals can see I Mean brainiac a total brainiacs. I'm so fascinated by just that level of intelligence and the vision it takes to think not only can we send a Rover to the to Mars take a long time to get there once it gets there we're gonna be able to control it from Houston They're controlling it every day the Mars rover you can go online and watch what it's discovering goes over little bumps I mean I met one of the guys who actually Did the Mars rover project on a plane once I talked to him for three hours He was really fascinating a really geeky guy But it was just like quintessential NASA engineer and he was showing me all these photos I was like that is really cool. I'm all go back to my politics job. You're listening to the Laura Ingraham podcast Bill Barry doctor Bill Barry is NASA's chief historian and Wow who better to talk to at a big moment and the reflection of our 50 year history with Apollo 11 and dr. Barry dr. Barry great to talk to you. How are you sir? I? Am great Laura. How you doing? I'm fantastic. I'm just in awe. You know I talked to NASA's chief flight director Holly riding we just got got Got finished for that interview and she was just inspiring and great. Oh my gosh what I mean She's so humble and this is what I love the people who don't have a right to brag Are all over Washington and all over social media and they're bragging about stuff that you know You got to be kidding me and then the people who are actually doing the most amazing things in society as Volanthropically or volunteer wise or in the case of the great achievers at NASA You know you don't even know their names, but but there they are doing the work every day That's one of the great pleasures of my job is that I get to work with people who are Changing the world as we speak and and they're just doing her job. It's incredible and I know you join NASA In 2001 was it Is that right? Yes, I had a career in the Air Force by that and when I retired from the Air Force I was lucky enough to the land my dream job working at NASA so And how did you make that transition though because you Were you a pilot you were pilot in the Air Force and then when you retire I don't I don't usually think of people retiring and then going to NASA You you decided to go from Air Force flying flying planes and then ending up as a historian at NASA ultimately well It's a long story and it starts back probably in 1962 with John Glenn and my first memory of if anything is watching John Glenn's flight done on TV And I was inspired from that point to be big work for NASA be an astronaut. I hope but Computer science and I did not get along really well so when I was in college as at the Air Force Academy I I discovered that being an engineer was not going to be my 14 But I went on into the Air Force and I spent about half my Air Force career flying Kacey 135 Are we feeling tankers? Oh, yeah, you know a great airplane and And then I spent about the other half my Air Force career teaching at the Air Force Academy and in the course of doing that The Air Force very nicely sent me off for graduate school education And I did my doctoral dissertation on the basically a political history the early Soviet human space flight program And that's what lined me up to come work for NASA You know what I remember from my Russian study days Sokol, yeah, Berkut, we've been yesterday Slicio, I mean, it's just it was just like so cold Berkut remember from the I was just like that was one of our early dialogues in Russian we first started taking Russian is hilarious Yeah, it's interesting. I actually wound up studying Russian in junior high school. I had a which is Actually had school right now. Okay, so did I yeah? Yeah, the I think I read a part of skia I'm not a I'm out of practice these days, but okay I want to be Russian because I hated my French teacher That decision in seventh grade made all the difference in my life in terms of the paths that I wound up following But it's been interesting now. Have you ever named a dog like since you said besides? I Know it knows what we're talking about by the way, but that's the dog that the Russians end up in space The first the first dog in space. Yeah, but Nick too. No, I haven't ever named one of our dogs Like it but I've been tempted and my wife is very wisely advised me not to do that Okay, so let's talk about this 50 year anniversary and the importance of NASA in this moment and in our overall sense of pride in country Which I think a lot of us think is taking a hit in in in recent times and for a lot of reasons There are a lot of people who find fault a lot of fault with the United States a lot of fault with our founders a lot of fault with our even our music or our symbols or statues or you know, there's a lot of you know whipped up anger out there but the Apollo is a rallying point the Apollo missions and the missions that followed We're for the most part a rallying point for the nation And I think it's just so important that we not only remember but that we continue to rally the country behind the you know That reaching into this this other world of space. Yeah, Apollo was really a transcendent moment for the United States And for for human history, I mean really it's the first time we set for an moon here, you know, 500 years now Who will people remember from from the 20th century? You know, I think the list of names will include Neil Armstrong just like we remember Christopher Columbus from 500 years ago So I think it's a huge it's a huge thing not just for us history, but for for humanity I remember the interview that Armstrong gave some years back to it with Ed Bradley on 60 minutes Where is that notion of humility really came to the floor? Let's listen you sometimes seem uncomfortable with your celebrity that you'd rather not have all of this attention No, I just don't deserve it But look how many people have walked on the moon 12 you were the first you were chosen to do that that special Yeah, I wasn't chosen to be first. I was just chosen to come in that flight Circumstance put me in that particular role that wasn't planned by anyone Just that it's so Unusual to hear today from most people. Yeah, you know, it's of course an interesting guy, but but And I think it was great that he was with the first the foot foot foot in the moon I mean we couldn't have picked a better guy at several of his own colleague astronauts have said that about him in the past But he actually is correct though. I mean the we were incredibly lucky during the spring of 1969 There were three missions that had to go perfectly And first to get on the moon in July 1969 up all 9 10 and 11 and the fact that they all went well And we wound up landing on our first attempt with Apollo 11 really is You know was the circumstance that I think most people at NASA would have been betting against Because we knew the odds were we're you're stacked against everything going so well, but I had and I remember watching it as I said earlier on This little black and white television in our house and we were all huddled around I don't think anyone spoke everyone was like holding their breath It was it was before reality TV or cable TV or it was just everyone was watching all of America That doesn't happen anymore. I don't care if it's Super Bowl or World Cup those moments Don't happen anymore for the most part Maybe 9-11 when but that moment where everybody was watching and there was no question We were all rooting for the same thing and that in and of itself is important Yeah, our estimate is that 650 million people on planet earth watch the moon landing live on TV Which you know it's only about 20% but when you consider that large swaths of the of the planet Blacked it out like the communist China didn't carry the coverage It wasn't carried in the Soviet Union either in Eastern block So large parts of what couldn't possibly see it anyway, so a big big chunk in all over half of Americans We're watching this the show life. I'm like you I was one of those kids who's sitting on the on the floor, you know In front of our TV and the only noise we heard in our house was Bill get backwards in the TV so the rest of us can watch Yeah, that's hilarious. By the way, I just read this you might have seen this Neil Armstrong's gold medal that flew to the moon sold for more than two million dollars Oh my gosh, I guess that just happened. I mean just it's just just broke on Fox News a 52 minutes ago Wow I haven't seen it yet, but I'm not surprised. There's a very big market in collectibles for the Apollo program Because everybody you know loves the Apollo program and they will want a piece of it I mean we all own a piece of it and we paid for it Through a tax dollars and and many other people pay for it through you know years of their life and investment and effort and energy and blood sweat and tears but But everybody you know wants a little talisman to remember it by Wow and on the question of history the USSR was originally Ahead of us as we noted with the dog up in space and so forth. How did we? Beat them. How did it happen? Well, this is the brilliance of President Kennedy's decision to race to the moon And the Soviets were ahead largely because they had a much bigger booster rocket than we had and they had that because they had Much larger design for their nuclear warheads so they built that rocket originally as a as an inch of the continental ballistic missile And then they were able to use it for space watches It was big so it could carry a lot of things and and they had a very small team of very clever engineers who were watching what we were doing And finding things that they could do ahead of us. So so they gave they gave you a principle way ahead Were they really had that's another question, but but nonetheless President Kennedy recognized that That big booster was the problem and folks from NASA advised them You know, if we have a if we set up a fair fight where they have to build a new booster rocket to get a human to the moon And we have to build a booster rocket to get human to the moon That'll be that'd be a first fight. We think we're gonna win it and and so that's how the Apollo program started and And the Soviets actually interestingly enough. They didn't take Kennedy's challenge seriously in 1961 It wasn't till 1964 when we actually had a booster rocket that was bigger than theirs Uh that they decided to over the United States is actually serious about this And then they started a crash program to try and beat us to the moon and uh they almost they almost won they They had a Robot they sent to the moon at the last minute and it crashed on the moon while nila buzz run the moon It was called luna 15 Uh, it had been successful. They would have been able to bring back a sample about the same time that we got back with our samples Wow again the Brain power The vision obviously the money It costs to do this Is today this it's it's always been hard for me to contemplate But it's it they're visionaries and everything and a present Kennedy was a visionary and stating the importance of this and committing the nation to it But the engineers the people who are the unsung heroes of nasa Uh those people who uh were up night after night after night for years Doing the calculations that We didn't have computers to do Uh to make this you know this apollo 11 mission a success and obviously learning from the apollo 1 Disaster, I mean it's it's actually hard still to contemplate all these years later with all our advancement and super computing and ai And everything else it still takes a person to have the vision initially and then back then to do all the Incredibly complex calculations to make this all happen Yeah, there were about 400,000 people who worked on the apollo program overall to make it work and uh what's amazing to me i'm looking at it from you know a leadership perspective As well as uh, you know historical perspective, but um we had we were incredibly lucky in having some really brilliant leaders Um who came to nasa from the national advisory committee for erdotics when it turned into nasa 1958 And some of the people that came into nasa is nasa was growing in early sixties and the leadership was technically competent But they they also recognize that they needed to let the people that work for them Run and they hired a lot of really young people You know if you look at those pitches of mission control those guys are on their 20s Um, and and they trusted those guys to do their job and do it well and and people were um highly motivated not to disappoint The leaders who had such faith in them. So, you know, this is virtuous circle there that happened where we had great leaders Great people work for them and they'll reinforce each other and uh, I think that was a that's a critical component to Just putting together a team, you know, just the i'm always fascinated by team dynamics Whether it's sports or good business teams Innovators and the management of that team of people a lot of the kids came out of mit um right and other Incredible institutions of learning PhDs young PhDs, but to to manage all the different types of talents that had to be in that mission control at one time That was stunning and it continues to be stunning Yeah, if you listen to the you know as you listen to those the tapes and of the power descent and landing on Apollo 11 Um, you know jean crans is is like the master orchestrator. You know, he's the conductor who's leaving a team who's just On their game and sharp and they know what they're doing and it's just it's a thing of beauty Just to listen to to that those conversations big problems come up and they identify them and they move on And it's just amazing Why is it important for us to go back to the moon? That's just a question that a lot of you know regular folks would would like to understand Well, of course I'm a historian. So i'll take a philosophical perspective. I think it's human deputy that that we will move the on planet earth and and you move on to the solar system and The moon is the obvious next Stepping stone to get there we we we learned how to fly to the moon and operate there during the 1960s and 70s But that expertise those young guys that were in the mission control and the 60s They're in their 70s and 80s now and they're not going to come back and do this mission force So we need to train a whole new generation on on how we're going to get out to the moon and then on tomorrow Um, so the moon's a good training ground to do that and I think that's the next logical step and I think the in the president's policy to You know get us to the moon and prepare for mars is is a wise step so moon will be the base of operations for the mars operation is that how it works Um my understanding is that we'll go to the moon and we'll train on you know how to do things there The actual how would fly from earth to mars i'm not sure that that answer is completely baked yet So, you know, I suspect there'll be some combination of things will happen um, and uh, you know that that mission could launch from earth or it could launch from uh, you know gateway around the moon or you know or any of those Places so it'll sort of depend on how the technology, you know gets us moving in the next decade or so Totally most sort of up to off topic back to your air force academy experience I ended I ended one of my book tours at the air force academy. This was high seven years ago I had such a great time there in colorado springs. I had never been there I've been to you know west point and to to the naval academy many times But i'd never been there what a great group of people what it just I got to speak to the cadets in the Mess hall and they what do they get to eat like four minutes they get to eat or something? No time to eat Yeah, so they said well you can speak for 60 seconds. I saw I got up and I said all right guys I was our I was just in your what do you call the barracks? I don't know what you call it What you know where they live they called the barris dorms. Yeah dorms. I was there I just went through your dorms. You're all out of sammy And meaning what that's your out of your inspection that's something with it's an acronym for inspection You're all out of sammy We're doing a 80 pound run this afternoon 80 pound packs Get your stuff together and it was I just was so deadpan the whole place like 5 000 people went silent And I said i'm just kidding come on. I guess drop and give me 50 though just for the heck of it Oh, it was so funny. I loved it there. I had such a great time It is a great institution and it's made all a difference in my life You know sitting on a path that's led me right to here at bathroom school No, it's it's amazing. That's amazing when you when you read and I'll let you go after this when you read uh these ridiculous conspiracy theories that the moon landing didn't happen You know as the chief historian for nasa, what do you what what go through your mind? I I have to chuckle mostly. I mean to me the biggest problem with the conspiracy theories is that We were in a race to the moon against the Soviets and they would have outed us in a second if we tried to fake it So there's there's no way it would what would happen anyway But to me, I I often wonder you know what it pretty people are convinced moon hoaxers What are they going to tell their grandchildren when they're out there visiting the Apollo 11 Lunar landing site on the moon at the at the park. We're going to have up there someday. I suppose Uh, how they can explain their their social media post from you know, the 20 years before to their grandkids But that could be pretty embarrassed. It's it's completely embarrassing Uh, thank you so much And we just love hearing the stories and also just your expertise dr Bill berry and your service to this country in the air force as well, uh, just so impressive And happy 50th anniversary of of of apollo 11.

Well, we are living in one. He is that president He is corrupt He is the worst president we've had He is inept and we're going to call him out for it Well and not only she said that but then she went on at the net roots convention And said this something that I get criticized for all the time. It's not what you thinks or don't Don't ask it is that I am anti-american because I I criticize the the united states and I I I believe As an immigrant I probably love this country more than anyone that is naturally born Really Joining us now Delighted she's with us Raheel raza is the president of the council for muslims facing tomorrow The author of the book their jihadi not my jihadi And also she's uh in washington promoting This fabulous new film kids chasing paradise, which we'll discuss in a moment But she we got such a great reaction to uh rahil raza on the ingramangal on fox that I wanted to chat with her for a longer period of time about this new dynamic of these very very vocal and well attention grabbing uh female muslim congresswoman in washington dc and how that might portend other more radical movements to come in the united states Raheel it's great to have you on uh the podcast let's talk about this you on omar argues that she is more pro-american loves the country more Than native born americans has that been born out in her comments and her actions It certainly hasn't been born out. I would say that she's a very good liar since the day she was elected she has said You know nothing that would prove that she loves america She has been critical of the president of the united states of america And these are the people who elected her so the hypocrisy and the double standards and the lying and she has a history of going back and forth You know she says things and then she retracts and so how can one trust what she's saying? I mean her actions and her words have proven beyond reasonable doubt that she hates the president And she hates the country so when he invites her to leave then she gets upset and plays the race card Yeah, and what is the agenda here? I mean they they've been very transparent about decriminalizing illegal immigration green new deal most of them support one way or another Some type of socialized medicine they call it medicare for all which will just bankrupt medicare very quickly Uh, but what is their ultimate goal? Is it to transform the democrat party blow it up? uh Make america part of just a general global order So we shake the bonds of or the connection to the evil racist past. I mean what do you what do you see happening here? You know, it's very complicated, but what I see is this bush towards globalism and Islamism And when I say Islamism, I'm talking about political Islam, which is an agenda of the muslim brotherhood And the you know globalism is also something that they are pushing for and it's uh, it's it's very insiduous It's very dangerous and they keep uh, elan omar keeps deflecting from the real issues of what she's talking about by Constantly blaming someone else for what is happening But I think that the democratic party needs to be very cognizant of the fact that this is a dangerous agenda And in the work that I do with a youth radicalization. I believe she is setting a very very dangerous precedent For young people that it's okay to hate america. It's okay to hate the president. It's okay to insult him and abuse him and uh, not to Mention that she has normalized anti-Semitism to a degree where it has become an everyday occurrence uh, you know, I clearly remember working in the field of trying to uh, you know expose the dangers of anti-Semitism the 20 20 years ago It was still something of a shock to hear anti-semitic remarks That is no longer the case. It has become normalized by everyone And everyone has jumped on the bandwagon because you have people in power a congresswoman who holds responsibility And if she can be anti-semitic so people feel that it's normal to do so Well, and they they write it off as oh, you're just every time they're criticized They say you're zon Islamophobic or racist or xenophobic. That's just there. That's their reflexive response. Is it not right? That is it is a this whole issue of Islamophobia, which is a term that is used to shut up any kind of criticism to actually Stifle free speech and it is again a very dangerous tool that is used by the islamis To stop us from criticizing and speaking out So anyone who criticizes what any of these four women say will be called in Islamophobia racist or bigot because they're playing identity politics And that is something that they shouldn't be doing because in the world today. We already have the danger of This kind of rhetoric leading to hate leading to radicalization and then ultimately leading to violence This documentary that we are showing in in that we we show what is it that ultimately leads to violence it's hate and we're talking to rahil raza who's the author of the book there jihadi not mijihad and also Is promoting this incredible film kids chasing paradise Tell us about the film why this is so important and What we need to understand about the again tolerating political islam In the united states tolerating it Normalizing it making ourselves numb to it and how that could lead ultimately to really really bad results Documentary that takes an unfinging look at the brutal exploitation of use by extremists Worldwide and the reason this is important is because According to the george w program on extremism Investigations of connections with isis have been opened in all 50 states There are a thousand open investigations with 182 arrests Having already been made and 45 percent of the arrests are of people under 30 So we know from u.n statistics that there are child soldiers fighting in the world We know that isis has recruited thousands of young people Including americans, canadians, europeans and this radicalization of young people is an issue that has spilled over into the west It is just not being addressed So we are showing this film and accompanying this film. We have a workshop called tv e which is preventing violent extremism And in this workshop, we talk about the the factors that lead to use Practicalization and how we can prevent it before it happens And rahil i'm talking to a lot of friends in europe Who tend to be fairly liberal on social issues and so forth and they didn't really care for donald trump for a whole bunch of reasons and sweetish friends and friends in uh norway and I've got to say my one freetish friend who she and i argue politely on text messages a lot about trump or the but she has seen her country Transformed in many places in many ways by the massaged andistic and oftentimes violent Aspects of this radical view of islam brought in by refugees mostly from syria Into sweden and with the crime Uh, the liberal leaders of sweden making excuses Saying you can't publish people's Ethnicity on facebook who are perpetrators of horrible acts of violence against women And now the swedes are fed up. They're just fed up with this But I wonder if it's just too late now for them, but they're they're starting to deport a lot of these people who are radicalized and spreading radicalization in throughout sweden Well, i'm afraid it's too late for sweden and for the rest of europe and in some ways for the uk Now i've been on educational tours to all these countries and sweden was the most concerning It was a terrible state of affairs There is a town in sweden called malmo where the police would rather resign than go in and Do law enforcement because it is so dangerous Islamis have totally taken over and i asked members of parlament in sweden that you have such a wonderful country in so many resources And such great infrastructure and why are you letting this happen? And I will never forget what they said they said we have too much We have too good a thing and we want to share it Well, the sharing has led to this situation where it's too late for them to turn back They wanted to bring in ices fighters and accommodate them there Take the the immigrants and the refugees that they have accepted into parts of the country where they The sweden have never seen Another colored person before and take over their hotels and their seniors home So it has been a very very traumatic situation then you look at the rape gangs in in the uk They were not mentioned in newspapers and law enforcement wouldn't do anything because they happened to me for a certain ethnic minority They were Pakistani Muslims and I am a Pakistani Muslim and I can say that this was an atrocious thing that happened But politically correctness the redress of less the world we are living in today and this label of islamophobia Has created an atmosphere in which people are terrified to speak out So it becomes incumbent on Muslims like myself to be the frontline speakers and to talk about these issues Because we have to expose these problems and if people like ilhan umara are not addressing Problems within the somali community where female genital mutilation is rampant We're forced in underage marriages happening where young somali boys are being recruited by al shabab Which is a terrorist extremist organization and so on somalia And I have met the somalia activists who have said we have this problem What can we do about it? She is so concerned about constantly abusing trump to the united states and of course israel That she doesn't look at her own community Now it's and what's happened and It's a religious freedom. I'm reading about this uh patriarch of the uh keldian catholic church in iraq uh louis taco he's He's very worried about the christians in iraq. I mean that they've been just obviously pummeled so many killed and Others just left after the us uh invasion in iraq They had two million christians in iraq living peacefully. I might add under sadaam was saying who kind of left them alone uh for the most part um, but they've been decimated by the sectarian violence driven out of their homelands Uh and they're they're they're not but in many parts of area christia area. Yes They are the the worst parsec persecuted Community so let me ask you a question the squad who calls themselves Social justice warriors and are so concerned about the vulnerable Do they ever speak about the persecution of christians in muslim land? Do they ever speak about the persecution of minorities? They don't So where is the is is there a sense of social justice if they're only talking about one particular issue and one person And they're not really looking at these larger issues of minority persecution of religious Persecution. I mean social justice needs to be across the board It kind of be just for one person or against against one person. So um It's very transparent if the democrats would only see through the facade And understand what the agenda is and also a very dangerous trajectory Raheel raza. Thank you so much for joining us These issues are not going away anytime soon, but we pray every day for our persecuted Christian brothers and sisters around the globe in jordan and syria in iraq uh from the ninava planes to the Horrible conditions in some of these refugee camps Where christians still are persecuted and some now living in in europe who feel persecuted Christians because of the violence and crime Are brought by many of these refugee communities and europe's got to save itself now. We're not going to be able to save it You're listening to the laura ingram podcast i want to thank all of our sponsors again who are supporting this show Genucell adt home security and home title lock Support them because they help provide this podcast free every week The laura ingram podcast america now and forever.
