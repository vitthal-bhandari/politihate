Welcome to today's edition of the Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show podcast. Welcome back in Clay Travis Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. We are having a fantastic Monday here as we roll through. Get you ready for what is officially for a lot of people the start of summer. I know kids officially getting out of school and one of the big topics we've had by the way encourage you as always go subscribe to the podcast. 17.5 million of you downloaded clay and butt podcast shows in the month of May. We want June to continue to set that number. It's crazy to think about. We're going to be well over 20 million downloads as we roll into the midterm season. But a lot of you out there as you are paying attention to the insanity that's been going on in the larger United States universe have recognized that one of the things that you never would have thought would ever be an argument would be that men shouldn't be able to decide they want to compete against women. And that's because we basically create massive differentiators for competition in sports because we recognize that there are all sorts of things that make competition unfair. For instance, kids play against other kids their own age when they are growing up. Boxers, box against people who weigh around their own age because a heavyweight boxer shouldn't be fighting a flyweight. People who are bigger and stronger in boxing and combat sports shouldn't be competing against each other. I mean, this is not controversial. But this past year, what has been inevitably forecast and all the people told you would never come to reality began to come to pass in great magnitude, which is men, biological men, decided they were identifying as women and they would start to compete against women. And this happened in a big way in college athletics with a transgender swimmer from Penn. Swam on the men's team for several years decides that he is a woman begins to compete as a woman and wins one of the women swimming championships at the NCAA event. That was a man who decided to now call himself Leah Thomas. And so this is really the first real punch back I've seen against this. And I want to read some of the details here for you, Buck, and get your reaction. The world swimming governing body has effectively banned. I'm reading from the Associated Press, transgender athletes from competing and women events. This happened yesterday. Members voted 71.5% of them, by the way, in favor of a new policy that only permits swimmers who transitioned before age 12 to compete in women's events. And so this situation that just happened in the NCAA in theory under this guideline would not be able to happen. Now, here's this is a 24 page policy analyzing all of this. Here's the challenge, Buck. And this is why while this is the right result, I'm actually troubled by this exemption that they put in, which is if you begin to transition before the age of 12, then you would still be eligible to compete as a woman. My concern is this is going to be used as evidence of those in the transgender community that children being given puberty blockers, transitioning, all of those things should be encouraged to happen. So how do you assess this? On the one hand, yes, biological men shouldn't be able to compete against women. The downside here though is they've left open a loophole in exemption as it were for people who transition or begin to transition before puberty before the age of 12. Well, one thing I think we'll be fasting to watch us play out is who that transitions before the age of 12 is going to want to without the benefit of yes, all of those years of testosterone therapy, because really what are we talking about? Biological men, also known as men swimming against women. Okay. Yes. So who is going to say, well, I essentially was chemically castrated at a very young, you know, at age 10 or 11, whatever it means. Both agree, by the way, is child abuse. 100% and should not be happening at all. And it's interesting to see all these people say, well, let's look at this practitioner or that practitioner. I'm pretty sure what we've seen in the last two years is that blue check MDs on Twitter who have lots and lots of Ukraine flags and vaccine needles and mask emojis on their profiles, are not to be trusted on matters of policy or judgment and certainly not with your kids. But I wonder if this is even, you know, effectively, you won't see the same kind of dominance. That's the positive that you see the same. It may not even arise as an issue under this under this auspices because, you know, it's about what's, it's about what's fair. And so if you don't have the biological advantage as Leah Thomas, for example, has roughly 10 years of testosterone therapy, natural testosterone therapy that has changed muscle bone structure, heart size, all, this is science. Six foot, by the way, six foot four as well. Hashtag science. Okay. So that's reality. What we've seen is the Democrat party now wholesale embrace this standard of we used to be a society where we would say, are though, is that male genitalia or female genitalia? And you and I and everyone listening would say, pretty sure we can tell the difference. When you ask though, when you're when you pose that question as a Democrat now, the answer always must be it depends. It depends. Not sure we can. This is what they say about babies, Clay. Remember, they say doctors get it wrong. Sometimes when babies are born and they say it's a boy or it's a girl. They are, they are forcing people to, to abandon their own most basic objective reality and sensibility in favor of a political fad and fashion right now. And that is what is happening. All of the country is happening in the school. It's happening in the board rooms, the number of else they are demanding this of people. And it all started, you know, years ago, it was, oh, let's just be, uh, let's be courteous to each other. Let's be, let's be civilized to everybody with which conservatives completely agree, right? You treat human beings with dignity, decency, and kindness, irrespective of whatever the, you know, the gender spectrum issues or whatever it may be. But somehow that transitioned, pardon the phrase, in the last 10 years to now when you see a six foot four guy dominating NCAA female swimming, you're, you better clap in cheer or else you're a bigot. So we've gone all the way. Now it's doctors don't know if a baby's male or female. They're just making an educated guess. I guess this is crazy. That, that is what they say, by the way, I know, I know, I know you know this, but forever listening, I'm not trying to like, that's not how perbole. This is what I have to say. They say doctors get it wrong and they're basically guessing when a baby is born and they say what the gender is. And I, and I insist on my right as a person, as a sentient being, as a rational human being, I insist on my ability to say I can tell the difference between male and female genitalia. I can tell the difference between a man and a woman. They can, they can argue with me as much as they want. They can, but you see, they want you to concede. This is, you know, I'm always glad I've been fascinated by the history of totalitarian regimes of the last hundred years. And it's the more aggressive lies that they want you to, because if something is a close call, if the judgment call, if there are things on both sides, you could sort of see that doesn't break your spirit. That doesn't make you give in your rational faculties and say, fine, I'll just do anything. The whole point is to get you to affirm that which you know to be untrue because they degrade you in the process. They degrade your ability to make your own judgments on other things too. And that's part of why this is so important to the Democrats to the left in this moment in time. They seek to remake and break society. And one of the ways they do it is by telling you, you fundamentally cannot tell a difference between a man and a woman. You can't do it. And they're wrong. And that's a lie. And that's why on the swimming issue, finally one organization is saying, look, you know, if you've been a man until until last year, you have a physical advantage because of reality. I'm sorry if that hurts some people's feelings. And it's amazing to see the left wing freak out about this and act like we don't see what reality is. But Clay, I mean, St. Bob, what do you think the crossover is between people say it's so bigoted not to let Lee Thomas swim against women under this, under these rules, the crossover between that and people that are going to be so excited if they have children to get their two year old, not one, not two, but I think it's a three dose vaccine. That's right. Three doses, a huge overlap. And what's also intriguing and fascinating to me, Buck, about this entire story is there's almost no one, almost no one out there who is involved in the world of sports at all that will argue in favor of this. They either pretend the story doesn't exist or they say something like, uh, well, you know, that's for the governing body to decide. No one will say even a far left wing. And you know now how far left wing the sports universe is. There's nobody out there who's a strong advocate for this. And here's another one that I saw. Do you see Hillary Clinton came out and got asked about it? And we think Hillary, even though she's saying she won't run, Hillary did an issue doing a lot of things that would suggest she might be interested in running. She did an interview with the Financial Times and this was the quote she was asked. Democrats seem to be going out of their way to lose elections by elevating activist causes, notably the transgender debate, which are relevant only to a small minority. What sense does it make to depict JK Rowling? Of course, the Harry Potter author as a fascist. That's the question she got asked. And she said, you know, of course we're standing on the precipice of losing our democracy. And she basically said this, we don't need to be focusing on transgender related issues in the Democrat party. Even Hillary Clinton, which, by the way, the trans community is not happy about this answer. But Hillary is saying something that the vast majority of the American population agrees with. And most Democrats won't even go there, right? Most Democrats, Joe Biden certainly doesn't. I would love, I know, Peter Ducey listens to this show. I would love whenever Joe Biden is in front of the media again for Peter Ducey to say, because this story is out there. Do you believe that biological men should be able to compete against women, like what happened with the pin transgender swimmer? Or do you think this governing body got it right? Joe Biden, 1 billion percent. He's 78 years old. He's a sports fan. He's not in favor of guys being able to identify as women and compete against them. What would he say in response to that question, though, how how handcuffed by the transgender community? He'll do the, he'll do the good old Joe by the fireplace grandpa routine that, you know, unfortunately, idiots still fall for some how it's going. It's not about, you know, it's not about that. It's about, you know, it's about middle class and, you know, it's about, you know, decency, common decency. He won't give an actual answer. He will retreat as he always does to platitudes for the idiotic. And that is, that is this guy's entire political career effectively. He won't, but he certainly won't say what everybody knows, which is that this is absurd and this is outrageous. You know, one thing that I thought about recently, Clay is as this transgender sports thing, you know, they used to play the game of why are Republicans so focused on this? Why do you even care so much, which is always, that's when they know their argument is bad and they don't want the American people paying attention. That's always a tell. Why are you? Oh, there's like two traces of drag distraction. This is just a huge movement, folks. We all see it. They want to, you know, they want to drag your kids through this agenda in school as well, too. But as all this is going on, I used to think, you know, what needs to happen. The only way this comes apart is if you were to have somebody who is like a, let's say a male basketball player of the, you know, of the physique of James, you know, deciding to play in the W and B. A. Would be amazing, you know, six foot eight to seven feet tall, and you know, can, you know, 40 inch vertical, whatever, right? I mean, just one of these guys who are physical phenomenon, are phenomena and have them play in the W. M. B. A. and score 100 points a game. I mean, this is kind of the joke that, that, uh, James Chappelle made that got him into trouble. That LeBron James and score, you know, 800 points a game. But what you see now is that actually what the Democrat media would do, if that happened, is stand and clap and say it is stunning and brave that LeBron, LeBron James in this example is scoring 130 points a game. This is what it means to be a good person in America today. They would actually do it. They would mouth the preferred slogans, like the little marionettes of the apparatus that they are. I also wonder how long could LeBron James play in the W. M. B. A. until he's 65? I mean, think about how big and strong and fast he would be even identifying as a woman. And by the way, some of you out there who are esteemed, uh, brilliant scholars of, well, I think late 90s, early 90s movies may remember this was the plot of a Damon Wayans film. Juwanaman. Do you remember Juwanaman? Buck at all? Yeah, it's an esteemed member of the canon, but the concept is, the tomatoes were very high on that. Yes. But the concept is it was played for laughs. A NBA star gets banned from playing in the league and so decides to become a woman and disguise himself. And it was played for laughs then. Now, I guess Juwanaman would be a heroic film about the struggles of a man inside of a woman's body or vice versa. Whatever the heck it is.

What we do have is something that's very disturbing in this country is what I refer to as the normalization of untruths. There's so much distortion of reality and conspiracy theories that are spread widely by social media when you get total of a Fauci welcome back to welcome back to Clay and Buck. Distortions, untruths, Fauci. That was just him a couple days ago. Very, very unhappy about the distortions and untruths that are out there about health issues. Here's Fauci, May 17, 2021, almost exactly a year ago, playing. When people are vaccinated, they can feel safe that they are not going to get infected. Oh, wait, hold on a second. When they're vaccinated, they are safe that they are not going to get infected. That was a year ago. That is entirely catastrophically, categorically untrue clay. Has he ever said, I'm sorry, I'm in little evil moron. No, he has not. No, and worse than that, if you pointed to the data from Israel and England who were ahead of us in vaccine distributions and you could see all of these people testing positive, you were banned for even discussing that as recent as July of last year, President Biden was saying, if you get the COVID shot, you won't get or spread COVID and you also will not die of COVID. Now, again, all of that 100% untrue. You know, the feeling you wake up in the morning, achy, slow to move. Sometimes you wonder if that feeling's ever going to go away.

Welcome back in Clay Travis, Buck Sexton Show. Appreciate all of you hanging out with us. Very few shows out there will support police more than this one. We need more cops on the streets. We need more criminals behind bars. We need more support for law enforcement period, but the doesn't mean cops are without flaws. And as more and more of the details come out surrounding the you've all day school shooting, it becomes increasingly clear that this was a failure of epic proportions when it comes to the response that was brought to bear inside of that school. Now, to reiterate, for a lot of you out there who may have forgotten some of the details, this shooter went into the school two minutes later, according to the timeline, the first you've all day police entered in behind him. Reports are that they exchanged gunfire in some way. And for a long time, basically, since this story broke Buck, the report has been that the shooter locked the door behind him in the classroom and they couldn't find the key, and they had to wait for the right group to be able to breach that door. Now, there is a report that came out over the weekend, and we increasingly don't know the most basic details here that suggests the door may not have been locked at all, and that there was therefore no need whatsoever to have ever waited in the hallway while that madman was in there with the kids and the teachers. This matters in a massive way, because he was left in there for up to 75 to 77 minutes before he was finally challenged by the border patrol guys who went in through that door. We still bucked to my knowledge. Haven't seen any photographs of these classrooms were their windows that could have been accessible as opposed to the door. But if the door was unlocked and they simply didn't grab that door and swing it open, how many lives were lost? Unnecessarily, as people were in their wounded, bleeding kids and teachers. And when will we know the full truth? Because more and more, this begins to look like one of the most incompetent police responses we have ever seen in a mass shooting situation, certainly inside of a school in the post Columbine era. What was your reaction when you saw that the door may not have been locked at all? They're going to delay the final results of the investigation as long as they possibly can, because there is simply no way to explain the fact patterns, the reality that we've already seen here that does not make it seem like a huge failure of command and procedure on the ground. And to some of those folks involved, what's even more troubling, perhaps a failure of nerve. This is something that we don't often talk about. This is something that, you know, we just assume because we have such an incredible military and such an incredible law enforcement apparatus in this country, so many people that work in law enforcement who will lay their lives down for their community, for their country at a moment's notice, that that is the case everywhere and with everyone. It is not though the case. There are always individual instances of people who may freeze in the moment, who may lose their nerve. And there is still reporting, for example, for anybody, and I know some people get, they almost take it personally when you say, even if they're not members of law enforcement, that some individuals from law enforcement may have suffered from a moment of, or longer than that, of cowardice here. That is very, that is possible. Some people take it very personally. I would want to know who had nothing to do with this. Of course, they just seem to get very upset at the notion. It deeply disturbs them to think that there could be cowardice among some members of the same way. When I was the NYPD, they had a term, perps in uniform, which is what cops would disparaging, refer to cops who actually break the law in serious ways as. And they say we hate those guys more than anybody because they make our lives miserable. Internal affairs comes down on everybody. They make the job harder for the 99% of officers who are doing everything the right way. And so, you know, we're speaking about the less than 1% here in the possibility of the degree of failure we saw in the U of all day response from law enforcement. There is still reporting, I have not seen it retracted that there was a girl who shouted out and it's one of these things you read and it's just it's haunting who who called out to police outside the window when they when they called in and then she was immediately executed by this mass murdering psychopath. That was after police had already gotten into the hallway already in the building. There is simple 911 calls from inside. So they knew there were survivors. They knew there were survivors in there. There were there was a gunman. It is simply inexcusable that they did not that these armed men who have who have guns who have body armor that they did not try a breach to stop the slaughter from going on. There is no justification for it. It's hard for people to hear, especially I think a lot of people that believe very strongly in law enforcement who believe as we do. Yes. But remember when we opened up the lines when this story first started to come together in this way, every law enforcement officer who called in said this was a massive failure. This absolutely is an unacceptable response. So you know, we're not we're not sitting here. We're not sitting here as cheerleaders for any law enforcement action. That's not the way we did. And in this case, I think the the lessons learned are going to be really hard once for people to take. And it also raises questions about, okay, you say if we just have a fast enough law enforcement response, well, that may not be sufficient. They were in two minutes after he breached the school. How much faster could it be than that? It's almost impossible to think how it could have been any faster. And I'm sorry. The Pulse nightclub. I I talked about this, I believe with you before Clay on the show, we certainly talked about an off air. The Pulse nightclub shooting was very similar. There were SWAT teams on the scene very quickly. The Pulse nightclub shooting in Florida. And there was a long wait before anybody and he was walking around shooting people who were wounded. And they said, Oh, we were worried that maybe he had rigged the place with a bomb. Okay, so you're you're going to take that concern above the real time executions going on of defenseless people inside that nightclub. So the policy there has to be a clear the policy has to be if the active shooter is still active and you have law enforcement on the scene, they go in and stop the threat. It can't be we call for they call for negotiator and you've I know, I know. And they were getting calls from inside of those classrooms from teachers and students. So they knew there were still people alive and every every profession is filled with imperfection. Nobody is perfect in the way that they would respond. And frankly, we still don't know exactly the command structure or what those officers who were arriving were being informed about what was going on there. But if that door was unlocked and there were police within that school two minutes after, and then there were dozens of police within five, 10 minutes in that hallway, how in the world did they not go in? I you you've been trained in tactical situations, Buck. I mean, we're talking about this at at dinner on Friday night. We were out. A lot of these police, I read that the you've all day police had just been through tactical training for how to respond in the event of a school shooting to have a failure of command and response in this magnitude at this situation is just devastating to think about. And I can't even imagine if you had had a wounded child in there and you look back at at the autopsy results and you think my goodness, maybe if I could have gotten in there within five minutes, there wouldn't have been the loss of blood. There would have been an ability to treat some of these kids, less kids and teachers would have been shot and maybe less would have died. I don't know how you sleep at night. If you are involved in that police response as more and more of these details come out. The final report, I think, will be very damning whenever it does come out, Clay. And I do believe that the bureaucracy involved will slow road as long as possible because it is such a such a gut punch in addition to the atrocity that occurred here that there could have that there it seems there was such an entirely insufficient response of again, not, you know, Bortec went in there, Borpatrol agents went in as soon as they killed him and credit to those guys. But why were they not in the you've all day police faster? We're big supporters of police that doesn't mean that police are infallible in this situation. It increasingly looks more and more indefensible. Most colleges are known for the teaching that takes place on campus.

She's got a new show launching it out kick. Talk to her in just a little bit. Tommy's always got a lot of stuff to say. And it is amazing clay to see some of the ongoing back and forth between members of the I think we could call the elitist media because they're not elite because they're good but they belong. Yes, institutions. I think they're better than everyone else. And we've had a few of these fights recently even Bill Moore was saying recently that the Washington Post writer who is now fired. So ex Washington Post writer who came out and said that she thought that Dave Weigel should be fired because he retweeted a joke and it was clearly a joke. He retweeted it and she wanted him gone. I also thought as fast as to watch that she for Alicia Sonmez is her name now now looking for work. I cannot recommend her journalistic credentials to anybody out there. But she also did you see wanted discipline against anybody who defended Weigel. So if someone does something bad at your company and you say, hey, I don't think that's so bad. The new position of the shrill authoritarian, you know, post modernist left is you need to be punished for disagreeing with me that the person who did the thing should be punished. That's an I've never seen that escalation before. That was interesting. But then it doesn't stop there. Felicia Sonmez is is indicative of a more widespread reality among leftist women in media these days who simply not only can they not take a joke, they refuse to allow anyone to make a joke. Mattie a glacial, Matthew a glacial is a well-known left-wing guy. He writes a lot of stuff. He's actually he strikes me as among the the he's smart for a leftist. I think it's fair. I'm not a big. I don't know his work very well, but he's not like a joy Bayhars. What I'm saying? He's not a total right? He's a pretty pretty clever guy. And he wrote this some personal news. I have contracted the novel coronavirus. Frankly, I think the virus should respect Father's Day more than this. FYI, all future typos are due to long COVID like these are what we would call dad jokes, right? I mean, on Father's Day no less. But this is, you know, hey, there, Clay, a flu in from Vegas over the weekend. And boy, are my arms like harmless corny jokes. Taylor Lorenz, who likes to ruin people's lives for a living using her purse in the media to do so, responded to Mattie Glaceaise on this one. I'm glad it's a joke for you, Matt, and that you're lucky enough to get access to great care. But for those who have had their lives destroyed by the virus and who have had loved ones die from or suffer from long COVID, it's not funny. Hope you could have a little more sympathy, especially today. That is the quote. She kept going, by the way, there's, there's more to that. These, these people have, she is mentally ill. There's something deeply wrong with her. They have totally lost their minds. You can't even make a joke about COVID without, I mean, and by the way, to your point, it's clearly a dad joke. It's not a malicious joke in nature. These people, here's a good, here's a good way of thinking. Has there ever been a really great person with an awful sense of humor? Like, do you think that there are really funny totalitarian? Most of the time, the answer is no. I bet most terrorists don't sit around making each other laugh all the time because generally, complete, fealty to a dogma is the opposite of humor. And increasingly, that's what you see online from all these blue check mark journalists. By the way, we got a couple of cops who want to weigh in on our last discussion surrounding you've all day. Let's let Rick and Idaho start us off. Rick, when you hear these details as they continue to come out from you've all day, your reaction is what? Well, my reaction is this in law enforcement, you can either be first or third. You're either first to the call, third to the call. Doesn't mean that just because the guys are there that they're warriors. So you have guys in law enforcement been there for years. Say they've never pulled their gun, never had to do it. They were always third to the call. If you're first to call, you're going to be in action. And I think that's the big difference. And a lot of these guys, we took calls on this. Your response based on all school shooter training is you keep going until you get put down by the shooter, right? That's the reaction from Columbine based on all school shootings is you never fall back and try to set up a perimeter. You go for lack of a better way balls to the wall until you can't anymore. And if you go down, the next man up does the same, right? Isn't that the general training that should be in place in these situations? Well, if they're trying to kill you, they can't be trying to kill somebody. Yep. So the idea is that you engage them. Hopefully you're training and you're a little bit of tactical work keeps you in the game. And if they're trying to kill you, they can't kill somebody else. Based on the facts that we know so far, I want to ask you, I mean, is it your assessment that some of the some of these law enforcement officers in the hallway in a makeshift stack? They just didn't want to go in. They were they were scared. They're going to get hit by that AR 15. What do you think? That's it's hard to tell. You know, because not everything's out. I think if they were under if they were under orders, not to, then they should have disobeyed those orders, just like in a military law enforcement, you swear an oath. But part of that oath is that you have a right to refuse an unlawful order. So if we were there and somebody said, Hey, we can't go in. We're going in. That's just the way it is. Bob at North Carolina really quickly. He wanted to weigh in as well. Bob got 30 seconds. Yeah, just just a quick note. Nobody's really talking about where the shooter got his money. Several thousands of dollars to purchase these weapons. My my understanding Bob, sorry to cut you all, but my understanding is that he's he worked at a Wendy's. Yeah, he worked at a five place and saved up all of his money. As you can well imagine when you live at home and you don't have to pay rent. He saved up all of his money and that that seems to have been the source for him to be able to purchase all of his weapons. We got more coming up here in just a few. Like we said, Tommy Laren will be joining us at the bottom of the next hour. So 230 Eastern time. And also I want to talk to you a bit about what Portland is finding out from its experiment in decriminalization and de facto legalization out in the streets of Portland.
