    "text": " Happy Monday, everybody. Question of the day, have you taken the Black pill? You've heard about the red pill, but have you heard about the Black pill? I'm going to tell you about that. Plus, later on, you're not going to believe it. I certainly didn't, but the trans TikTok star, Dylan Mulvaney, that is being figuratively shoved on our throats, has announced that he is now the latest spokesperson for Bud Light. I think that's bad. While country singer Kelsey Valorini performed at the CMT Music Awards, with drag queens, and yeah, she's from Nashville, where a transgendered person just shot up a school. But who cares? Because we need to appease them or something. All that and more today, coming up on Candace Owens. So I saw this tweet this morning, and I wanted to share it and then answer it. The tweet was written by Gina Florio. And she asked, are you Blackpilled about the future? I can't be certain what the Black pill is, but I have a good guess. I started, of course, my career, my political career on YouTube, under Red Pill Black, which was for me, what it meant was, I was going to be a red pill for Black America. And we all should know by now what the red pill is. It is, of course, a cultural reference to the Matrix, that moment, the Morpheus, as you can take the red pill, and you can see how far the rabbit hole really goes. And what does that mean? Well, it means that you are going to understand that the reality that you thought was reality isn't really so, and that it's being created for you. Taking the red pill, I have to say, is an astonishingly optimistic and hopeful experience. I remember suddenly waking up to all the lies of my childhood, the lies of the education system, recognizing the lies that the media had spun throughout my life as a Black person. And I was hopeful because I felt like my life was finally able to begin. I woke up every day feeling this genuine hope and an excitement and realizing that if every single person in America could see it, could see how the system really works, we could become freer. That somehow, if everyone in the world could see how it really works, then we would be a freer humanity. And so I hit the ground for four years with exactly that message, all across the United States on stage speaking, I was with Trenton Point, USA, talking to students, talking to adults about this, I guess, recognition that I came to. During those four years, I met my husband. He was a London boy, a British citizen, and he too was flying high with optimism because Brexit was taking place in his home country. For him and many others who supported Brexit, it represented a chance of the United Kingdom to become like America, the land of the free. It wasn't even a discussion when we got married. We wanted to start a family in America. In fact, my husband was insistent upon it. I remember how struck I was by his viewpoint, a foreigner's viewpoint on what the United States of America represented, how much he and his friends loved America, how they just viewed it as the land of opportunity. He'd even comment on how expansive the highways were and how even the big trucks felt like freedom. These were the Trump years, by the way. America was back. But something has changed since. Our discussions at home have changed. We are living our dream, so to speak. Of course, we have two healthy children. We're living in the great state of Tennessee, but our conversations, our actions are portraying a different kind of emotion. I would almost say that they are portraying fear. We have conversations like, let's move somewhere isolated in the middle of nowhere. Let's make sure that the property has running water and that we can raise and grow our own food, that we can be entirely self-sustaining in case. We say things like, we definitely are going to have to homeschool our children, or maybe we should send them overseas. We ask questions to each other like, what would be our plan be? Where would we live if things start going downhill faster? I proposed Switzerland. I actually took time to look up what it would take to secure a passport in Switzerland. My husband, on the other hand, is thinking Africa, Namibia, a farm. So I have to ask myself, why are we speaking like that? Why don't we feel so secure about even the next five years? This, I suppose, must be the Black pill experience. An underlying recognition that America is transforming into a dystopian nightmare. In what ways you ask, well, take your pick. Maybe it's the recognition that our intelligent agencies are in fact terrorists, international terrorists. At first, they started terrorizing overseas, staging color revolutions, installing puppet presidents and murdering and imprisoning civilians who tried to resist them overseas, calling those civilians terrorists, hunting them down, locking up political dissidents. In Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Ukraine, all in the name of fighting for democracy. And now, the CIA is focused on fighting for democracy, quote unquote, here in America. It's the same tricks. Changing color revolutions interfering with our elections by locking up political dissidents like Donald Trump's supporters in the FBI led at January 6th insurrection in the Capitol building. Now nobody cares about in selecting Capitol buildings when it's transgender people storming capitals as they've done over the last week. No, that's totally fine. But Trump supporters put them in prison for a very long time. What's worse? Now we've learned, of course, that they are indicting Donald Trump himself. And people are understandably angry about that. But I just feel this sort of deep-seated sadness. When I learned the news, I felt sad. I think that's the black pill. Resigning oneself to a certain truth, America is on a death spiral. Our intelligence agencies are attempting to take down America from within to make America submit to a cultural demise, from which, of course, dictatorship will arise. If you need more proof of that, look around you. Just examine the last week. There was an anti-Christian hate crime which took place. It stole the lives of three elementary school children, and it was executed by transgender filth. And what happened? Well, it inspired our government to come out not in defense of Christianity, but in defense of transgender filth. The days following the tragedy, President Biden said this. On transgender day of visibility, we want you to know that we see you just as you are. Made in the image of God and deserving of dignity, respect, and support will never stop working to create a world where you won't have to be brave just to be yourself. I think that's bad while the press secretary took it a bit further. She said this following the shooting. And one of the things that we saw during the midterm elections is that people don't want their freedoms to be taken. They want us to fight for their freedoms. And so it is shameful. It is disturbing. And our hearts go out to the trans community as they are under attack right now. Yep. When a member of the trans community quite literally attacks Christians, leaves a manifesto, and kills three nine-year-olds, the White House wants you to know that you responding to that, you being angry, yeah, that's disturbing to them. Your hearts go out to the trans community for having to deal with the way that you feel. This is the America that we're living in right now. And yes, I think at a certain point, I have to admit to myself that I have become incredibly cynical about the future of America. I am not going to say that I have absolutely no hope. That's not true. But I am recognizing that something is shifting. And I think that something is realizing that there are certain people that are so committed to the lies that they are never going to acknowledge that we are suffering a cultural demise. I mean, we have teachers, we have educators, we have politicians that are outwardly saying that we need to push children into this sort of ideology. Think about that. We have to hit pause. What do we do? How do I regain the hope and the optimism? How do you regain the hope and the optimism that you maybe were feeling a few short years ago? I don't really know the answer to that question. I think it starts with having the courage to say the things that need to be said. I don't think it's enough to just listen to the Candace Owens podcast and listen to the Matt Walsh podcast and to like tweets silently anymore. We are definitely reaching a pinnacle here. And we need every single person to be willing to fight. And that's all I'm going to say about that. Robert Kiyosaki, the author of the best-selling book, Rich Dad Poor Jad, has just cautioned that the world economy is on the verge of collapse, warning of bank runs, frozen savings, and balance. He suggests that you quote, buy real gold and silver coins now. In this volatile market, diversification has never been more important. That's why buying gold with Birch Gold is such a smart choice. The government spending is out of control. Long-term bonds have diminishing value, which is crippling banks. Depositors are holding their breath and investors are bailing on bank stocks. You can't spend your way out of inflation. Gold is a tangible asset with a reliable store of value because it's not tied to any one economy or currency. It could be a safe haven in times of crisis. Birch Gold will help you convert an existing IRA or 401k into a tax shelter IRA in physical precious metals like gold and silver. It's time to start thinking about your investments and your future. You need to consider diversifying into gold with Birch Gold. Text Candace to 989898 to claim your free info kit. With an A-plus rating with a Better Business Bureau, thousands of happy customers and countless five-star reviews, I trust Birch Gold to protect my future. You can too. That's Candace to 989898. Okay, now it's time for some topics to show. So this isn't a joke. Bud Light has partnered with trans activist Dylan Mulvaney for March Madness. So if you're a guy and you're sitting back and you're like, I love basketball and I love beer and who represents me, I'm sure you're thinking Dylan Mulvaney, a pervert who dresses up like a little girl and describes himself as a little girl and is documenting his days of girlhood despite the fact that he's something like a 28-year-old man, I'm sure you're thinking that he really represents you. And so this definitely made sense for Bud Wiser to do that. For Bud Light to do this, take a listen to Dylan Mulvaney announce that he's the latest spokesperson. Hi, impressive carrying skills, right? I got some Bud Lights for us. So I kept hearing about this thing called March Madness and I thought we were all just having a hectic month, but it turns out it has something to do with sports and I'm not sure exactly which sport, but either way it's a cause to celebrate. This month I celebrated my day 365 of womanhood and Bud Light sent me possibly the best gift ever, a cayon with my face on it. Check out my Instagram story to see how you can enjoy March Madness with Bud Light and maybe win some money too. Love ya! So why does this make me so angry? First off, it's that repeated stereotype of women being stupid. It's womanface and what is the stereotype of a woman being stupid. I kept hearing this thing about like March Madness and I thought that maybe we were all just having a tough month, but I guess it has something to do with sports and I don't know what sport it is because girls don't know anything about sports. So we never heard of March Madness ever and thank you Dylan for wearing womenface reminding us all how women just don't like sports and have never heard of March Madness because I assume we've never heard of college basketball, we've never done a bracket which I actually have done and which I do every single year because it's fun to do a bracket with your friends and you don't have to be explicitly a man or woman to do that. But okay, let's keep leaning into the stereotype and Bud Light has thought this is funny and this is promoting anything. If you think that's bad, don't worry because also this little pervert is going to get into a bathtub and tell you all about March Madness. Take a listen. We thank you for your patience. Wonderful. There in case you're listening to this podcast and you are not watching it, it's just Dylan L'amaney splish flashing in a bath with bubbles because everybody knows girls love bubble baths and Bud Light and dancing and people should be upset about this. I have to ask the question, who is the intended audience? Again, men that participate in March Madness, women that participate in March Madness, who is the intended audience when you see this pervert in a bath living out his fetishes and his fantasies as a little girl. I don't know why they're doing this. It begs the question, who made the decision? Is this a diversity, equity, and inclusion person or did somehow Sam Adams, a different beer company get a Trojan horse in there and convince Bud Light to tank its own company because it is going to hurt Bud Light, obviously. This is now, they're associating themselves with transgenderism. There's nothing less manly than a grown man dressing up like a little girl. This is not how, if I was in a boardroom and I meaningfully wanted to help a company, I would never offer that you have a transgendered weirdo sitting in a bathtub splish splashing with bubbles pretending to be a little girl. So who's behind this? Why are we seeing this corporate push for transgenderism everywhere upon every stage in an every room? Why are they trying to convince people of this evil that they can choose their gender as easily as they can select their clothes? Who's behind it? Let's keep the question going because Kelsey Ballerini, who is an up-and-coming country singer and who is from Nashville, I actually have friends in common with Kelsey Ballerini, I have personally never met her. She's from Nashville and obviously you would expect that Kelsey Ballerini would have been devastated by the shooting, which took place last week, the shooting which claimed the lives of three nine-year-olds and three adults as well. And she did the right thing by mentioning the shooting which she took the stage at the CMT Awards to perform her hit songs. She did the right thing by mentioning it. Then she of course did the democratic thing and basically called for gun reform. What we need to do is give the government more power. I'm really sad. So I'm going to dance on these graves by now doing the bidding for the Democratic Party because I really want to be accepted into Hollywood. So original Kelsey, but if you think that's bad, as a natural resident, what she could have done is she could have reached out to the families and maybe reached out to some of the nine-year-olds that were at the school that had to race out and had to be reunited with their families and said, hey, would you like to be a part of my performance? That would have been maybe something really powerful that if you wanted to do something special to highlight the tragedy, that could have been something great allowing these kids to come out and enjoy a night. But instead what she did was she decided that perverts should be invited on stage and she invited drag queens and she turned the stage into rainbows. Take a listen. I'm going down to it. If you go down, I'm going down to it soon. Yep. The lyrics there were, if you go down, I'm going down to. She also posted that same message with just the drag queens on stage with her to her Instagram which reminds you guys all that it is very important when an innocent nine-year-old Christians are slaughtered, it is very important that you do the right thing by reaffirming your support to the LGBTQ community of which one of its members did the slaughtering. That's what she did. She took the stage, she did that. And I hope that in your personal capacity, you never listen to her music ever again. I'm so sick of what has happened to country music scene, the fact that every single person has understood that what it means now, if you want to have any success, is that you have to become tremendously woke and you have to support evil. And they won't do it. These people are willing to trade their souls because they just want a little bit of fame. And so she hit the stage and she intentionally did this. All she had to do was not let anybody on stage, by the way. She could have just performed her songs and sat back down. But as I said, if you want proof that Satan is winning, what they must do is reconfirm their support of Satan and everything that he is bringing to this earth in this moment in transgenderism, one of the greatest lies ever, of course, convincing a man if they can be a woman or whether they be a man or having men living out their fetches and perversions dressed up like women or dressed up like little girls. Well, great job, Kelsey Ballerini. Way to support the things that really matter. What a missed opportunity. Okay, obviously we need to mention the fact that tomorrow is Tuesday, which means we are all waiting with baited breath regarding Trump's indictments. Allegedly, this is going to take place and I'll tell you what you can look forward to. We'll cover it much more extensively tomorrow. He's expected to arrive at New York City courthouse at 11 a.m. tomorrow morning, hours ahead of his scheduled arraignment in front of Judge Juan Merchant, which is scheduled for 2.15 p.m. The proceedings are expected to take 15 to 30 minutes with extensive security around the building expected to search everyone in the courtroom twice. The details of the indictment of the former president are still under steel, of course, because they don't want us to be able to tear apart what it is that they are indicting him for. But they're expected to be related to the 2016 Hush Money payments made to adult film star Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougall, which the DA's office has been investigating for five years. According to legal experts, Trump is likely to be fingerprinted and will take a mug shop. There is not expected to be a perp walk or public arrival because of security reasons. Trump is also unlikely to be handcuffed as a result of an arrangement made between the former president's legal team and the district attorney's office. Lastly, of course, this attorney Alvin Bragg is behind this. He has been investigating former president since before he became the district attorney. Actually, a member of course, he kind of came out and said, if you elect me, I will get Trump. He ran on the platform of basically saying, you are showing me the man and I will therefore show you the crime. About 50 to 60 members of the press are expected to be allowed in the actual courtroom where the proceedings will take place. I'm interested to know who exactly got those press passes. There will also be two backup courtrooms for security reasons and reporters will be forced to stay in the courtroom after the proceedings and as the former president is escorted out of the building. Now, what will happen thereafter is completely unclear who will be able to decide for himself whether he wants to exit the building through a side entrance or out the front door. And if he's smart, he will go through the front door. Obviously, he will use the images of him being walked out of the door. Of the courthouse for fundraising. Obviously, we have seen already how the polls have been impacted by this wrongful indictment. Trump supporters, I are feeling reinvigorated and I do think that this is going to carry him to be the Republican nominee. So we will see what happens tomorrow. As I said, we can't cover much of it today. And hopefully at a certain point, we'll find out what he is even being indicted for. I want to jump into this really big story that took place over the weekend. Andrew Tate has been released from prison. Now, just to back up, I've had so many conservatives. I just honestly thought it was quite disgusting that conservatives, when he was arrested, just said, we don't like him and so we're going to support this arrest. What a bizarre thing. I don't care whether you like Andrew Tate, whether you believe in his ideas or whether you think he's a misogynist. I don't care if he actually is a misogynist. You don't lock someone up for no reason. And when I say for no reason, I mean that the Romanian government did not, the entire time that he was in prison, which is since last year, they held him in a small cell, he had access to nothing and they did not bring any charges against him. They essentially arrested him so that they could investigate him. How could you consider yourself a conservative and support that madness? Well, he and his brother have been released from prison and here is what he said on his way out to take a listen. I just want to say that the judges today made the right decision. I respect what they've done for me and they will be vindicated in their decision because I'm an innocent man and I can't wait to prove it. Hello Andrew. Freedom at last. Woo! Yeah! Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! You like it too. My family, brother, my family. It's a little bit emotional. I've been in one room since last year, so it's a little bit emotional. I want to give respect, firstly to the judges who heard us today because they were very attentive and they listened to us and they let us free so I have to give absolute respect to them. I truly believe that justice will be served in the end. There is zero percent chance of me being found guilty of something I have not done. I maintain my absolute innocent and I think most people understand this and I look forward to being home. He also followed up with this tweet. He wrote, since last year I've been in 24-hour lockdown, no yard time, pacing a 3-meter cell with zero electronics or outside contact. Absolute clarity of mind, real thoughts, real plans, vivid pain, one hour home and I can't stand my phone. Some habits die hard. We must defeat Chetan, which is a, I assume, Islamic for Satan. I just again cannot comprehend how any person does not see how evil what happened to him was. To be clear, he spent three months in a 3-meter cell with access to nobody but his own thoughts. Would you survive that? Could you imagine if that happened to you and no formal charges were brought against you and then the outside world and all of their freedom was saying that you deserved it somehow because they don't like your rhetoric. They don't like that you smoke cigars and that you're disrespectful toward women who, by the way, many oftentimes are disrespecting themselves before you can even get a chance to disrespect them. Could you imagine this? I'm just completely baffled by the conservative response to this. What happened here is horrific. I commend him on his strength. I don't know that I could do that in isolation for 90 days. I don't know that I could do it and every time I see evil, I'm going to speak up against it. I don't care how that makes other people feel based on his language and what he says about people. It doesn't matter to me. I am hoping to have the opportunity to interview him and I am also hopeful that it was perhaps this exposure, people talking about this evil that made it so that they could not once again extend his detention. By the way, they're calling it a detention. We didn't arrest him. We just detained him for 90 days and we took all of his personal property, which they did. They took his cars. Just detaining all of these things for what reason, what's behind this doesn't really make sense. It's obviously a flawed system of government and repeatedly flawed system of government that we are seeing all across the world right now, especially in the Western Hemisphere.

All right, so Andrew Tate has championed that experience, which is unusual because people love to play the part of victim and this circumstance, he actually was a victim. He's still being respectful to the prosecutors and he is, I think, very commendable in how he's taking all of this. Well, on the flip side of that, we have people and this repeated race to the bottom, people trying to figure out how they could be more oppressed than the person before them. I always say, if you really wanted to win all the awards, you would just be a black, transgender, disabled person. I think that would probably put you right at the top of the knee. You just handed awards. Oh my gosh, this person's really a victim and nobody can say anything about you and nobody can judge this person whatsoever. Well, this was a real headline. There is a mind-blowing number of Paralympians who are faking the severity of their disability abilities to make them look worse than they really are so that they can win medals. Athletes and officials are claiming. This was an ABC investigation and they realized that they were all of these athletes that were exaggerating their impairments in order to win medals. Former athletes and officials have called for fundamental reform describing a culture under which classification rules regularly bent and broke in with few punishments for those prepared to exploit a weak system. The scandal threatens the credibility of the games, which is the world's third biggest sporting event generating tens of millions of dollars in revenue. High-ranking officials have expressed concern about intentional misrepresentation of disabilities with one stating that the system does not work and another saying there were no repercussions for those who cheat. Of course, because how could there be repercussions? There's persons in a wheelchair. You can't say anything about people in wheelchairs. You can't say bad about a person that says that they don't have arms or a person that doesn't have a leg. How can you reprimand them? They're victims. You just think this is a story that really underscores the times that we are in today. That people are on this, as I said before, race to the bottom, constant looking for awards and medals and attention for their various illnesses. And what is happening here is what is happening in the online world. Every time we turn on your phone or Instagram, somebody's announcing something horrific that happened to them. They are looking for a community of other victims to give them support. The end, they want to see if speaking about their disabilities and perhaps their shortcomings will garner them further attention. Usually it does. That's the truth actually, is that it actually works. If you put yourself out there as a class, a victim, and then you pretend that you're championing your victimhood, you usually will get attention. So that's the state of things today, guys. People that are being locked up for no reason. People that are pretending to be more disabled than they actually are. That is, I suppose, the Black pill for America. Maybe I should change my name to Black pill Black or something like that. All right, guys. That's all we have for today. Let's jump into some of your comments for last week's episode. Dar Sheeran writes, hello, Candice. I doubt you'll ever see this. As a teenage girl, your videos are so helpful and inspiring. I find your intelligence and eloquence quite amazing. You always make a smart point and include humor in every video. Every after school, I watch your videos and they always make me smile. I can tell you from watching you in the rest of the Daily Wires videos and podcasts has made me a smarter, happier person. I used to want to be single for the rest of my life and be a billionaire all my own. I was a delusional feminist, but now all I want is a simple life in the countryside with a kind, smart husband, and a farm with chickens and to be a mom of many kids. Thank you so much. I used to think happiness was in material things. Now I think it is in truth in the family. I have a question for you, which is what was your wake-up call or a spark that caused you to become a political commentator? Thank you. I love that comment. It makes me so happy that you've, I guess, realigned your life goals to be much more desirable, aspiring to family. If you take anything away from everything that I say, let it be that you should aspire to family. That is the only aspiration, in my opinion, that leads to happiness. For me, my wake-up call was honestly Trump's election back in 2015 when I wasn't supporting him whatsoever. I was very shocked because despite me not supporting him, I thought that the media was being very dramatic in their assessments of him because he was already a public figure and they had never accused him of being a racist, a sexist, and a homophobe and all of these things. He was very liked by the media. He obviously had his own show on NBC. And I got suspicious about why that was. I started to question whether or not they were brainwashing people to have certain thoughts rather than encouraging people to actually think. When I began actually watching Trump in his own words and hearing what he had to say, and then weighing in against the media interpretation of what he said, I realized that the media was engaging in outright propaganda. And in this circumstance, it was propaganda against the then nominee and in support of Hillary Clinton. A couple of comments regarding the Guenthert-Poultrol diet, some people that disagreed with me. One person tries to throw over, okay, but surely she is much more healthy than someone like Lizzo who eats junk and seems to have no goals for health. At least one of the poultrols not eat junk is concerned about not spiking her blood sugar and she exercises. Surely that is better than eating fast food and weighing 400 pounds. You can pick between your two evils. I do not promote anorexia and I don't promote fat people. I don't know which is less healthy. Presumably, yeah, you might live longer if you eat less and you live like one of the poultrol. Sure, I'll give you that. Catherine Tural writes, I think a line needs to be drawn between intermittent fasting and anorexia. Everything moderation is key. Too much salt will kill you, not enough salt will kill you, not enough water will kill you, too much water will kill you. Focusing on a low inflammation nutrient rich diet is key. Some intermittent fasting can heal cellular damage but excessive fasting can cause damage. The same is true with exercise. Eat whole foods, avoid processed food and get moving outside as much as possible. Yes, a lot of you guys thought that I was attacking intermittent fasting, not whatsoever intermittent fasting can be extremely helpful. The problem is that she breaks her fast with bone broth. That's not a diet. Not even vegetables are the only two things that she mentioned that she ate throughout the day. That is not a diet. That is anorexia. I'm going to call it anorexia because that is what it is. You can intermittently fast and eat something of more substance when you break the fast, but I do not believe that anything that Gwyneth Poultrol is promoting is healthy. I do think that for a lot of young women growing up and seeing her lifestyle, it encourages anorexia. That is all that I'm going to say about that. All right, guys. That's all the time that we have for today. I'm going to talk about some exciting exclusive content coming up on Daily Wire Plus. Click the link in the description and subscribe right now.
