    "text": " I am unashamed. What about you? So we're back on the shame podcast. I'm still at the southern layer down here at my place in Gulf Shores. J.C. had all your family in. I had that guy. We did. First time they kind of be back to me. You know, I don't get in on the scheduling of all these activities that I guess my wife is in charge of that. But I look up and every time the family comes in, we all get together. It's like we're doing some kind of retreat. We're at a camp. But I'm like, where's the schedule? It's like we're going here. Because she's like, hey, we're leaving in 5.30. This was on Friday afternoon. I was like, oh, okay, well, I never asked where we were going. I went to want to fail. You, this is, I got, you'll get a kick out of this. So I actually went, I got in a vehicle with my family. And we went to a gender reveal party. Yeah, I feel terrible about missing that. Yeah. Well, it was my first one. And you know, I didn't know if it was, if in the Christian world, this is a response to the confusion that seems to be going on in our culture about what gender they are, or, you know, just gender issues. So now what they do is that this was, so people close to us, you know, the woman, she's pregnant, you know, everybody's happy. But people want to know, is this a boy or a girl? So they, we get together, they have a meal. And that's, that's what we did. So here was the problem from my perspective. So, because I was kind of bewildered with what's going on. I mean, I look, they had a prime rib on the grill. So I thought, well, this will be good. So they said, okay, we're ready. So we all go outside. So the couple, they get out there and they had what looked like, like some kind of canister in their hands. And now I was looking around because I wasn't sure what was fixing to happen. And everybody had their phones up. And so they were giving a little speech. We're thankful, you know, for all our family and friends here to support us. Well, then they like pump this canister. And I would say it was the equivalent to a small bomb going on. I mean, I jumped. All the babies started crying. I mean, this thing was loud. And so then people started hollering. And I said, well, which is it? Is it a boy or a girl? And Missy said, the, the color of the confetti, it was blue. That means it's a boy. I said, well, you might should have told me that I didn't know what the choices were. And I didn't know what they were doing. So when the confetti blew out blue confetti, that meant it's a boy. That's why everybody was hollering. But I didn't get in on the payoff. Because I didn't know. So I said, well, so if it had been what pink, it's a girl. And they said, exactly. I try to stay out of that tight. I don't like canisters blowing up. I mean, it was it was confetti to show me a point. Yeah, I didn't know this was a thing. And how did you? Well, you're aware that people do this? I was. I've seen it. In fact, there's been some interesting because, you know, you do this enough, there's been some mishaps. There was one out in California. And the thing blew up and wound up starting to fire. And everybody's running every direct. It's not funny. I'm sure for them. But I mean, nobody got hurt. But like, so sometimes now there's been enough of these happen around the country, Jase, that there's when the mishaps happen, they become the viral videos. Throw the mishap ginger celebration of life though. It was look, I was down with it. I was just, you know, what made me think we're in Mark where all these people are gathering up. And Jesus, he's doing things. And there's a lot of people, they're uncomfortable with what's going on in the gathering. They're bewildering. He's like, what's going on? But I literally was, the what's going on. And this is like, you've never seen this? I was like, no. You know, why didn't they just say it's a boy? But they're like, it's, that's why I said, maybe it's a response. We're celebrating that, Hey, you know what? It's a boy. Okay, we can know. Yeah, I mean, I'm Jackson. I enjoyed it. But it just seemed like it was, it was a, it's a new thing that's going on. I thought you would, you'd like to know, I mean, we ate good. And I thought was there, what else is going to happen? No, it was pretty much fire off the canister, announce that it's a boy, take the pitchers, do all that, have a nice meal. And then I was like, well, what's next? And Mrs. Like, well, that's it. Where you ready to go? I was like, well, yeah. Were they all these Christian people? Yeah, I mean, I mean, I didn't, there was a lot of, there was a lot of people there. There were some people there I did not know. But this thing was like, it doesn't matter about believers or not, because this is people been doing this all around the world. And it actually predates. It's just been going on for a while now. It predates some of this gender stuff. So it's just a way to, I'm like, that is a good thing. It celebrates that one is we can know we do, we do know what gender is. And that also, it's the celebration of life. But you know, it's interesting, J. So you were doing that. I was as a dinner party down here with Earl Powell, chef Chris, who, man, I never know what he's going to cook, but he's a chef. And so it's always going to be delicious. And so we had New York strips and many of all these great dishes. And you know, with a chef, the difference in them and us, because I can cook a steak, you can cook good steak, J. So I mean, we can cook some good food. But they always got that sauce, you know, that something you pour over it that just really makes it sing. And that's what he did. But we're so we're there and we're like eating the appetizers, she's cooked for us. And his daughters are there. And all of a sudden one of them says, Oh, it's, it's, I think she said real time. It's real. She gets an alert on her phone. And so apparently, either once or twice a day, this is a new thing. Apparently it's a fad. They were all into it, but I've never heard of this for. So your phone gives you an alert. And within the next two minutes, you've got to hold your phone up and take a selfie of what you're doing. And it takes a picture of you and what you're doing. But then it also takes a picture of everybody else in the room. This was the app. So I don't know what what it means. But twice once or twice a day, you're supposed to stop and let everybody know that's on this app, what you're doing in that moment. And I think they called it real time. But it's a little bit harder to this comes off with that cell phone. You just kind of remember, Al, I've never purchased a cell phone. So I may be missing out on some key areas. Yeah, where are we at with it? Are you ever going to do that? No. No. Okay. You have vowed a life of phone celibacy. I mean, two times a day, you have to get into your schedule that somebody's going to say, what are you doing? Well, but Al, that's, believe it or not, now I didn't know we were having gender identification parties, but I have heard of that. And the reason they did it from my understanding is because on all these other social media platforms, these people use filters and airbrushes and a lot of people are just, it's not even them. They're putting a picture out. That's not them. So the idea of the social media site to do this was this is unfiltered, authentic. It's a they're really going off. They're really going after authenticity. So and if you've been yourself from time to time, it shows that you're behaving. Is that what? No, it just shows this is really who I am because you got to remember the problem. I have a social media and the reason this, this will probably be successful is because you're, people are given a portrayal of themselves. Kind of like the fair say. This is the image you want to portray is what you go with. And so they say, well, in order to get around that, we're going to pick a random time twice a day. This is the only time you post and you don't know when it is. And I think you have 60 seconds to do it. Two minutes. Okay, two minutes to do it. Because they're going to feel they're going to take the pictures and they're going to post because the phone, whether you like it or not, has become a part of the physical anatomy of people's makeup. It is right beside ears, eyes and nose. I'm not afraid to endorse something that I just I'd rather have doors. I'd rather have quietness, tranquility, and without without any fanfare. I just I think it's interesting now that even the world is wanting some authenticity. But go ahead. Now that's that's true. That's a great that's a extra great application. So dad, you'll love my joke. So so they looked at me and they were like, have you never heard of this? And I said, no, I had literally never heard of it. I said, no, I didn't even heard of this. I said, but you know who loves it? And they were like, who? And I said, my dad. And so it was a it was like a beat. And two or three people said, really? Like, you know, they were so shocked that you would have been into this. And then somebody else just busted out laughing because I was obviously being sarcastic. But I waited a beat. I didn't give anything away. And then of course, everybody started laughing because it's like, can you imagine feel twice a day stopping what he's doing to take a picture of himself and everybody in the room? I'm not prepared for that. But it made me think I sure want to ask him about it on the podcast. Because it's funny. At 56, maybe. But 76. No, I don't believe you. I don't think it's 56. You just said, no, but it's a thing. Maybe it's 16. Maybe. Yeah, I think 16 is probably a better accurate illustration. Yep. Well, so since we since we had two things, two big dinner parties, I guess it gets us back to our text in Matthew chapter two, because Jesus had the big dinner party with all the sinners. And I put that centers in quote, because really they were all sinners, but only half of the group there recognized who they were. But that's going to lead into and the way you brought it up in the last podcast, and we talked about it in overtime was the we need a scandal sermon. This is the first of three of Jesus's scandals here. The first one was 80s eating with tax collectors, which was a was a no can do and a don't ever do for the for the good Jews that, you know, felt themselves self righteous. What's what's going to lead and what's the true outlook when grace when great, I'll give you a profound statement when grace creates a scandal in your church. You may be in the wrong place. I mean, because that's what happened here. Now granted, that's why I said when we read tax collectors and centers, when you think mafia, because I think that was a really good picture in your mind. If you see the supposed leader of your religious institution out there hanging out with this ref Ralph in a party like atmosphere, the last thing you're going to be thinking is this is anything religious or good. And so one of the things that was missing in Judaism and the following of these practices was grace. Another thing was missing was a relationship with God. But you know, if you're the creator of the universe, it would be one of the few places where you see people of all backgrounds that love each other. Well, you come together as a group of humanity there. That's true. I mean, that's a that's an excellent thought when when love being shown towards other people, if that causes a scandal in your church. You know, for group of individuals come together like that, it turned into a scandal. The reason was that they're looking around saying, well, they don't think like we do. So what are we doing with them? I mean, it's I mean, humanity is to bring them together with true love for one another is a giant step that's needed, but it's rare. I mean, look at all of what they've done to that. I mean, everything is you're a racist. If you don't do this, and don't do that, you're this, you're that, I mean, it just goes on and on and on. He said, why don't we all come together and just human beings. You know, there was a story in Luke, Phil, in Luke 18, 9, and I think it goes into with the thing. Hey, James, before you read that, let's take a break. So we talk a lot about the pro-life movement on our podcast because we're also engaged. We have different ways of doing that. Jase is currently fostering a child and has also, you know, others in our family have adopted children. These are all part of the pro-life movement because it's more than just saving a baby in the womb. It's also trying to provide a way for these babies to live and to thrive. And so that's all part of the pro-life movement, which I think is probably in as good a shape as it's ever been because there's so much pro-love in that pro-life. And one of the organizations is that we love that sponsors the podcast is 40 Days for Life. We've had Sean Carney, who's their CEO on our podcast a couple of times. They have a million volunteers in over a thousand cities around the world, and they have what they call peaceful vigils where they're just praying. They're praying that, you know, women won't choose abortion. They're praying that women won't even show up to abort babies. And so it's having a huge effect. It's changing hearts, it's changing minds, and we fully support this organization. And so glad that they're supporting our podcast. So we're asking you to check out their locations where they are so you can volunteer and get involved. Check out their podcast, which is great information. They also have a free magazine that 40 Days for Life.com that keeps you updated on how abortion is ending in a post-ro-America, which is what we've been praying for for 50 years. So that's 4-0-40-daysforlife.com. Check them out. I think it goes into what we're discussing, but in Luke 18-9, it says, to some who were confident of their own righteousness and look down on everybody else. Jesus told this parable. Two men went up to the temple to pray one a Pharisee, the other tax collector. The Pharisee stood up and prayed about himself. God, I thank you that I am not like other men, robbers, evildoers, adulterers, or even like this here, a tax collector. Speaking of making somebody feel uncomfortable, I fast twice a week and give a tenth of all I get. But the tax collector stood up at a distance. He would not even look up to have him beat his chest and said, God have mercy on me, a sinner. I tell you that this man rather than the other one home justified for God, for everyone who exalts himself will be humbled and he who humbles himself will be exalted. I mean, I just think it gives you the picture. I think that that's what's going on. Pouring that whatever. That's a good observation, which is one of the reasons why you don't need to be checked on twice a week to see if you're up to no good or not. You know what's interesting? Because we're getting into this fasting section. It's really interesting. The passage I just read where he said, I fast twice a week. Well, I looked that up and really the only time that people would fast at the most would be once a week. I mean, he threw that in twice as in, I'm going over and beyond what is required because I'm so righteous. And you remember the section when Jesus got on the sermon on the mount when he picked those three things that we kind of do. When we give, he's like, don't be like the Pharisees who, you know, they want to have a pageantry about everything about, look how much I gave. And when you fast, they disfigure their faces and say, so I mean, what he's going at is this is coming off a party type atmosphere. And these are the type of people who would go to a wedding, which is a celebration, but they're fasting. And they're like, do you want some of this prime rib? And they're like, well, no, I can't, I'm fasting because I'm better than you. I'm more religious than you. I'm even denying myself the celebration here because I'm so holy. I think that's what was going on. So, and the other thing was a prayer. Remember when he said, don't stand on the street corner and go on about your prayers, but your father who sees what is done in secret in both cases, that's Matthew 6, I think it's 5 or 6, chapter 5 or 6. So I'm going to read this in Mark 2 18, it says, no, John's disciples and the Pharisees were fasting. Some people came and asked Jesus, well, how is it that John's disciples and the disciples of the Pharisees are fasting, but yours are not? Jesus answered, how can the guest of the bridegroom fast while he is with them? They cannot. So long as they have him with them, but the time will come when the bridegroom will be taken from them. And on that day, they will not fast. They will fast. Yeah, on that day, they will fast. Yeah. No one sows a patch of untrunk cloth on an old garment. If he does, the new piece will pull away from the old, making the tear worse. No one pours new wine in old wine skins. If he does, the wine will burst the skins in both the wine and the wine skins will be ruined. No, he pours new wine into new wine skins. So it's an interesting analogy. And you say, what in the world is going on here? But you see two groups that have collaborated. And look, you got to remember something. I think it's a key point here. Most of us assume that John's disciples, John the Baptist, would automatically put their faith in trust in Jesus because they were cousins and he prepared away. But you're seeing right here that that's not necessarily case. And it shouldn't shock you because where's that in Acts? Is it in 19 or 20 where now this is after Jesus died and was buried and raised and they're going around cheering Jesus. And they run up on a group of John's disciples who had never even heard of Jesus. So when you start putting it all together, you got to remember that the only way they would know, because John the Baptist preached for months and months and months out in the wilderness and all these. And you know, Jesus was only there on one day where he baptized him wrong. But if you wasn't there that day, you might have just missed it. John the Baptist, because he took a Nazarite vow, you know, even before he was born. I mean, he was going to be very strict on food laws, on the idea of he never drank his whole life, you know, never took a drink because these Nazarite vowels were super serious people. So he would have been, even though he was strange to the current leadership, when it came to stuff that they cared about, he was a model of, I mean, you talking about hold the line on what they thought was important. So your point is well taken, that the Pharisees would have viewed John pretty favorably in his disciples, whereas they did in Jesus. When he was drinking with the sinners, they did conclude that they said the religious people, he has a demon. Jesus made the poem. I mean, somebody as straight-lined as him, and even then they said he has a demon, and in that one, pointed to Jesus, he's a liar, a drunkard, whatever he's doing. Yeah, well, we're going to get that into chapter three. We're going to get into this because, which I think even to give you a preview of what's to come, in their minds, they were kind of stuck here because they're seeing these miracles. Well, how do you answer that? And we're eventually, there's a quote from C.S. Lewis that has been said over and over again through the years, and I think it's a great quote, and he gets it, in my opinion, from Mark chapter three, because you basically form the opinion, well, either Jesus is God, Lord of all, or he's a liar, or he's a lunatic. But the problem of that logic is if you're not wanting to address him as Lord and the Son of God, which is the problem here. Well, you've got to explain how he's able to do these supernatural things. I mean, just think about it. So one of the things that come up, but they're like, well, he must have a demon, because then that at least gives you access to the spiritual world, and that's the power. Because after a while, you're like, well, he's not a magician. First you might think, well, this is all a trick. You're looking at it. It's like, well, I'm in the hands, the guys were fixed to read, the guy's hand is shriveled up. And then all of a sudden it's not the dude had leprosy, and then he then he doesn't. The guy was paralyzed and he's walking around carrying his mat. I mean, crazy people don't have that kind of power. And so they're like, well, he must be a liar. And so he's actually worth their money. He's not charging him. When he can't be just just some dude, how is he able? So that's the narrative going on. So that's why all of a sudden they began attacking him because it made him feel really uncomfortable. You know, the first scandal was, all right, he's down there at the cartel, you know, having a party, and you claim to be some kind of religious front. We know he's not that because he wouldn't be running around with them. Then all of a sudden they're like, well, you know what it is? Well, he's not fasting. So let's try to attack him on that. Well, then what is his answer? His basic response was why I'm here. The same as it was in chapter one, he said, the time has come. I'm here. You should be celebrating. We can't celebrate because you're running around with the real with your friends are not welcome here. This means you're not welcome here. You have no pedigree. You're quoting yourself, not some people that we respect. And so then scandal number two comes up, which is he's like, he tells us illustration. I love this because they're probably like, what's he talking about? But when you think about who he's talking to and what he's saying, he's like, I didn't come here to patch your your little religious system. I'm not trying to put patches on that. I'm doing away with the whole thing and giving you a whole new way to go. Well, you know, what do you just think if you went to a church building and they want your opinion on what needs to be done. And the guy says, okay, fire everybody and burn the building and come with me. That's the equivalent of what he just said. They're like, well, you you you you're you're demon possessed. I mean, are you you think this old boy, it would make you mad. If somebody came to your church and said, fire everybody, all the leadership, we're firing them because they're all sinners. I don't care what they're trying to portray. And we're burning the building and we're we're going to go down the road and go out here and try to help you know, the people that we should be helping cartel members prostitutes and well, how many people you think would follow? Probably not many. I mean, how is that? Do you agree or that may be a little over the top? But I think that's the way they've received it. I agree. And I got a good illustration. But first, let's take a break. So one of our sponsors, Human In has come up with a really unique product called Tarte Cherry Gummies. And they're really a great way to help reduce inflammation, especially from your exercise or, you know, it's kind of supports your metabolic health.

And what's ironic is this one of the men in on this discussion today years ago, I don't know if you remember this dad, there was we were going to renovate we had to put a bunch of money into the building was falling in. We either got to put money in at bulldoze at something and dad who's you know, pretty young elder at the time. And I wasn't an elder yet dad said fellas I tell you what we need to do. We just need to just let's get out of this building. We don't need a building anyway. We'll just meet down at the Civic Center will rent someplace. Well, he said, you know, still need to meet we meet in homes will impact people for the kingdom. And when then we won't have this collar of debt around our necks. And I just remember everybody looking at you like, that's insane. We can't you can't get rid of our building. I mean, this is this is where we meet. But do you remember that dad? You were just looking at it totally practical like, yeah, we could do this. We could just walk away. And so I think the illustrations actually witnessed that and the illustration is perfect because that's exactly what he was saying. I'm not here. I'm here to introduce a whole new thing. Don't you think it's ironic to that he used a wedding feast, which was about the biggest celebration they would have in the first century and wine as his two illustrations, which by the way, just in terms of legalism, that's two things that they wouldn't been on board with either. So not only is he making a great illustration at the point, he's using the the two festivity related things. Because you remember his first miracle in John was turning water into wine at a wedding banquet. Yeah. And again, he was told her my time hadn't come. One of the exceptions to the required fast was a wedding. You could you could like get a reprieve which I was like, this is what happens when you're basing your whole existence on a bunch of rules. Because then you could just schedule a wedding on the day of fasting so you wouldn't have to fast. Which shows you the problem with having a ritualistic type narrative for how you're basing your faith on because you can always manipulate it. Because look, when we we get to the Sabbath, which is pretty much the last paragraph, but then it comes up again in chapter three. Well, that's what really made them mad because we're talking about they took the idea of the Sabbath, which when you read it in the Old Testament is you don't work on this on this day, this this seventh day. That's all it says. Now, now they added volumes and encyclopedias type of because then they they had a problem with trying to figure out what exactly is work. And so they made all these laws and traditions based on that idea. And so what you see what Jesus is doing by causing all these scandals, he's taken all these these thousands of conversations and thousands of manifestos that they've come up with about on who you can associate on how you go about fasting and pray all these these traditions and rules that we're implementing. And when it got to the Sabbath, they just went bonkers because I mean, I was going to make a list of the most ridiculous and frivolous ideas that they had on what you couldn't do on the Sabbath. But look, there was so many to choose from about, you know, if you raise something up, then you couldn't put it in your other hand, you would have to raise it back down with the arm that you brought it up with. And like, if you went to eat an olive on the Sabbath and the olive was bad and you spit it out, then you would have to replace something like the olive, not in its entirety, in your mouth, because that would be work to make the situation to relieve yourself of the situation. And so they were getting into the design of what you then could put on your mouth in your mouth after you spit out a bad olive where it wouldn't constitute work. And it becomes a tradition when we get, he keeps doing battle with them and in performing all the miracles. But Isaiah was right. He said, when he prophesied about you hypocrites, as it's written, these people on me with their lips and their hearts are far from me. They worship me in vain. This is a few chapters in the future. Here we're going to go look at rules taught by men. You've let go of the commands of God and are hold on to the traditions of men. You have a fine way of setting aside the commands of God in order to observe your own traditions. You know, people who stay in a place of worship for a long time, in this case, we kind of wrestle with at least a thousand years. You give them a thousand year reign. Individuals, Al, will come up with some of the most cockam many things you've ever heard of. And things of food, what you eat, these food laws, you know. Jesus told them, He said, you so dull, don't you see that nothing enters a man from the outside can make him unclean? It doesn't go into his heart, but into his stomach, then out of his body, and saying this, and just think about this, in lieu of what was going on there, Jesus declared all foods clean. I mean, I mean, it was hard for him to swallow. But look, it's not even just a religious thing. This is a mindset because I got three letters for you, Jason. You tell me if you agree, you see this in modern America. I've been dealing with this for the last three years down here in Gulf Shores, H-O-A home owners association. The people voluntarily give other people control of what you can do with your house and your yard. It's unbelievable. And these people, you talk about legalists, they'll take one of these covenants for a neighborhood and they'll drive around. And if your grass is one inch taller than it should be, you left your trash can out, you can't do this. They're sending emails, they're sending fines. I told Lisa, I was like, you find us a place where we can go in the one, there's one rule, no H-O-A. Yeah, once you do a rule-based system, you get into thousands upon thousands upon thousands of situations. If they ran up only one time, some of my neighbors said, oh, you going to cut this grass? I said, the fall, fall, whether I get it, it'll lay right down. And they looked at me and I just walked up and they were looking at me mad. I don't think you're H-O-A material. A lot documented. It'll go right down in the fall. I said, right now, pretty tall. Hang on, James, because I want you to tell the story from the show. Let's take a break first. So if you want to know what the left's real plan is for your kids, just look at the reaction to the work that Patriot Mobile did in multiple school districts in Texas. It seems like they're kind of losing their mind. Patriot Mobile has been a long time sponsor of our podcast and their America's only Christian conservative mobile phone provider, but they're also a great force at work for conservative values. They kind of, they help fund conservative causes. They help fund candidates that believe in the sanctity of life, freedom of speech, the Second Amendment, and we're winning with companies like this.

I mean, they literally came down and when, you know, when the TV people heard I had a big riff with the other people in my neighborhood over these chickens. They were like, can we film that? I'm like, sure. And it was so embarrassing for them because these are believers. These are people in my family, you know, married in, in who are running the HOA. But they had so many rules, which was basically you can't have any kind of farm animal running around in your yard. But they eventually were so embarrassed by taking a look at how their views were viewed upon by people in the world saying that they were like, okay, well, all they did was make an amendment to that. Now you can and they just called it organic because you eat things that do with chicken, the eggs or the actual chicken. And so then that idea trumped the idea of somebody, I guess just being offended because you had a chicken running in your yard. Because that's what I kept saying. I was like, why does my chicken running around in my yard? Why? How is that bothering you? Well, it came down to I finally got them to admit it. They just didn't like the visual of that. That didn't seem sophisticated enough. It seemed to there was a lot of that going on here. On the episode, J's, you go, you'd have a HOA meeting, you have this impassioned William Wallace speech about liberty and freedom. It was great. And they got it from the actual speech that I gave the original HOA. Exactly. So what I loved about the scene was that mom thought it was a eating gathering. So she brings like a she prepared some food and she takes it in there. And you know, that was kind of part of the joke of it. And so y'all or dad is like, well, let's get out of here. You know, we're leaving. And mom goes back in and gets her food. She said, I'm not even my food for these people. Yeah. That was really funny. But anyway, that's what Jesus is tearing down these walls. And look, it's difficult to have this going on for thousands of years. And then, you know, you're not hearing from God for the 400 years. And then here comes Jesus. And he's just turning this whole system on its head. And it's causing rage, anger, plots to kill him. And I want to go and get into the Sabbath part because I think it piggyback. So before you do that, I want to make one point before we leave the fasting. It shows you how people are because because like they made an assumption about Jesus because they weren't following their little pattern. But here's what's interesting. You know, back when we first started the book in Mark chapter one, he doesn't mention it, but we know it from the other gospels, Jesus fasted for 40 days. And nobody knew it, except for him. When he went out there in the wilderness. So here's a guy you're saying, why didn't he fast, you know, like us? And on our little one day a week, our little program we have, what they didn't know was the son of God had already gone out in the wilderness, fasted for 40 days. Which is almost unheard of and took on the devil. Yeah, well, they had them when I looked at the history of this, and it was a tradition. I think 40 was the max, but they had fast for one day, two day, three days, seven day, 21 day. And I think 40 was the, I mean, you, if you want to be the holy of holies, they had a 40 day fast program, which is, I think, why Jesus did the 40 days. And look, they, and fasting is a good thing. Even today, I think it's a good thing where you're, you know, you, you, you focus on the sacrifice that and brokenness that you're enduring, but it, it helps you in meditation and, you know, on earth and provides clarity. I'm not against fasting and I encourage people to do it. But what they were doing was using it. They were using this ritual. It had an emptiness about it because they're now attaching that what you're doing as far as rituals attached to who you are in your, your holiness or the lack thereof. So that's what's wrong with this system, because then you're always oppressing people because you're like, well, you're not as good as us. Because look at your group. How come they're not fasting? Our groups are better fasters than you are. Therefore what? Therefore we are more righteous than you. At some point, the ones that are shaking their head saying what the world's going on is a system of works. Never works. No, no, it don't because it does the opposite of what you said earlier. It doesn't enable you to love each other or forgive or extend grace. All the things that Jesus brought. So, I mean, Jesus is saying here, look, it's time to celebrate because I'm here. But the problem is the only people that are celebrating are the cartels and the prostitates, these few fishermen, and you got a tax collector. Well, these are the, they're like, well, there must be something wrong with this. And so that's why I think, you know, people, a lot of people said, well, this, well, how does this apply today? I would apply today. Like, what we were experienced yesterday, a lot of people have been going to church their whole life, you know, where where we were at yesterday, Al, here's a bunch of people trying to get off drugs, a bunch of drunkards, it was a rough crowd. I mean, it was a rowdy, rough crowd. And then all gathered up that had a weekend retreat. This was kind of the cherry on top here, you know, and above all that, you've got a former gang member who's been incarcerated as the preacher. Well, I guarantee you some of these people who have been sitting in the same pew for 20 years, they probably went out there and there was somebody sitting in their pew. So they're already uncomfortable already because I'm not sure how this is going down. But well, I'm not sure howling this can be attained if I have to sit in a different spot than where I've sat for the last 20 years. And all of a sudden, there are people hollering out randomly for seemingly no reason, like, like so loud and make you jump. And it was just really emotional, it was real passionate. You know, a couple of the songs had a rock feel to them, you know, as in, this is rock music with Jesus lyrics. I don't know about that. So I mean, if you weren't prepared for it, it would really make you uncomfortable. It just didn't seem like a, you know, a religious type gathering. But so what I'm saying is after what I'm reading here, it would be incorrect to start making judgments and assessments based on that based on what I'm reading here. That's correct. Because I mean, it's a no, it's a that's a great illustration. Let's take our last break. So, Jay's, you know, I've talked before about the power of counseling, especially in family situations.

Look, Jesus, Jesus people that are converted, look, they're messy. People out of the world are messy and they're they don't know the rules in quotation. But they don't know the rich. They don't know because they're not there viewing this as a building where we're all gathered. But they're not viewing this as a, you know, as some kind of place where you need to have a certain decor. They just throw that on its head. But to me, that's part of what you do when you're bringing people to Christ. I think it's a great illustration. Are there a few people going over the top and being disruptive? Yes. Is it to be expected? You have to take somebody's never been in the church building all his life and his life's a wreck and he gets excited about Jesus. Look, you see all kinds of things, you know, they had a little bell on the on the cross and they the invitation was you go and ring the bell. What I thought was funny is the first person who goes who goes up and there were many that were fixing to do it was so excited about it that they broke the bell. Well, now what? Because that was going to be what we all do. But the first person rang it so hard that they broke it. And I thought, this is what happens when you get people out of the world. They're like, no, I'm not going to ring it. I'm going to break it. So let me read this next section now. And it's quite low. I want you to read that in this last section so we can flesh it out a little bit. I feel like we need to read it because although it seems non applicable to today, I'm telling you, it's the same thing that you're seeing in these other scandals. And it's so, you know, it applies to even what we're going through today. So in verse 23, it says, one Sabbath, Jesus was going through the grain fields. And as his disciples walked along, they began to pick some heads of grain. The Pharisees said to him, look, why are they doing what is unlawful on the Sabbath? Now, remember, I've already told you that all it said in the Old Testament is you don't, you don't work. You take that day off. So they've attached some amendments to this and said, you can't walk along in a field and pick some heads of grain off because that constitutes work. Well, this wasn't what they normally do. These were fishermen and you know where it's headed. They were hungry. He answered, have you never read? Now, he didn't say that. He brings out an example in the Old Testament. I think it's 1 Samuel 21 and you can read the story. Haven't you read what David did when he and his companions were hungry and in need in the days of Abiathar, the high priest, he entered the house of God and eighth consecrated bread, which is lawful only for priest eat. And he also gave some to his companions. So Jesus has brought up an obscure story that they were probably aware of, that they probably avoided because they couldn't make sense of it. To answer the question, then he said to him, the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath. So the son of man is Lord, even of the Sabbath. Now look, when he said that, you talk about a scandal, this is the worst possible thing because these people have devoted their lives to getting the rules of the Sabbath right. And for him to come up with some kind of story where these guys were hungry and that all of a sudden he's like gave them a principle that they are totally against, which is the Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath because they're operating the Pharisees like man is made for this Sabbath. You have to get this absolutely 100% correct in all the details. Because they had changed the definition. He picked a few grains of wheat. Well, right, because that constitutes work. And that's why I said that this is a thousand year debate on what exactly is work. And so then he even goes further saying the son of man is Lord of even the Sabbath. So now he said, I have the authority. I invented this. I control what you're trying to figure out on what do you write? I control that. It's my idea. This is not going to end well for him. But he did interesting, Jase. He gives his human distinction, the son of man. He didn't say, so the son of God is Lord, even of the Sabbath. He used his human on earth description to say, I'm still Lord. Well, I think he's using that in my opinion because he's going back to that Daniel reference that they were familiar with. This is, I'm here. Every story that we're reading has this theme of, I'm here. This was predicted. The king is coming. The eternal kingdom is going to be established. I'm here because he just said to bridegroom here. Now he's like the son of man here. So it's an obvious reference to me. That's why I said in that illustration that I always use when I'm speaking to nine Christians. I always start. I hold up the Bible and I say, Genesis to Malachi, Jesus is coming. Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, Jesus is here because that was his emphasis here. I'm here. The time has come. Son of God is here. Extra revelation. I'm coming back. Well, what about a physician? Are we not going to heal somebody on the Sabbath? What if he dies? And so they actually, in some of their subordinate laws, made an allocation to where, I tell you what, if a guy's bleeding to death, it's okay to put something over the gushing way. But that's it. So basically you're like, in your rules, we're going to give him a shot at survival because we all know he's going to bleed to death. We need to figure out what we need to do for this guy. So it came into this. What can you help others? They're like, no, it can't help people because that'd be work. So Jesus, they can't say he's a doctor because he's actually not doing anything. Wherever is the quietest thing about getting his donkey out of the ditch? I mean, yeah, that's a good one to read. So let me finish reading it. So then he said they were silent. He looked around at them in anger. And look, by the way, this is the only time in the New Testament. It ever says Jesus got angry. There's other instances where he, you know, and he went in the temple and he cleared it out because they were keeping people from going inside and turned it into a money deal. But this time it says, all right, he's hot. He looked around them in anger and deeply distressed at their stubborn hearts and said to the man, stretch out your hand. He stretched it out and his hand was completely restored. Now you would think there would be some positive moment here. He gave the speech. They don't have an answer because either way they're going to be hypocritical in what they say because the bottom line is Jesus is way ahead of them. He knows what we're going to be doing. I would have said, I would have concluded, okay, sorry, I'm with you. I would have thought you're the son of God, evidently. And you did come up with us, Sabbath. I'm sorry, I got you wrong. I want to go up. The next verse says, the Pharisees went out and began to plot with the Herodians, which is a group that they detest had nothing in common with. They're not even religious group. They're a political, you know, group who are being used because they knew if the only way we're going to be able to kill Jesus is we're going to have some kind of political group who has the power and authority to do it, to do it. So they go out and or buddy buddy with the Herodians, who guess what? They ain't keeping the Sabbath, the Herodians are not. Not only that, they were known for their corrupt sexual behavior and dishonest gain methods. So now you're throwing in cahoots with people who doesn't have a moral fiber in their being. And why are you throwing in cahoots with them so that they might kill Jesus? Yep. All right, let me stop you. Let me stop right there. We're out of time. Man, that's that's rich. But we're going to impact some of that in our overtime segment. So if you want to follow us over there and hear a little bit more about this, blaestv.com slash unashamed is where we'll talk about that. So we'll see you on the other side."
