    "text": " Bad government and bad policy can literally be deadly. Almost 100 people died in Hawaii's Lahaina fires. The most wildfire fatalities the country has seen in the century. But months on from the event, it seems like the media and local and federal governments would rather we all forget what happened. I'm Lauren Chen, and to uncover the truth about that day in the aftermath, including through exclusively obtained 911 calls, the Blaze and I travel to Maui for this first-ever Blaze original documentary. And this is just the start of Blaze Originals. A new docu series featuring your favorite Blaze TV hosts as we investigate the most important regions of our national theater covering groundbreaking issues and standing in the void left by the elimination of investigative journalism. Watch what really happened in Maui, a Blaze original streaming now on BlazeTV.com, and use the code Lauren plus to save $36 off your annual subscription. Today Gavin Newsom vetoes a radical trans bill. But why? Bob Menendez indicted on bribery and corruption charges and a government shutdown may be looming, but don't threaten me with a good time. We've got all of that and more coming up and it all starts right now. Welcome to the news and why it matters. I am Sarah Gonzalez and Democrat California Governor Gavin Newsom vetoed a bill late Friday night that would have required judges and child custody cases to consider whether a parent has affirmed their child's gender identity in their ruling. AB 957 proposed that courts deciding custody cases must consider whether each parent affirmed the child's gender identity and added parents affirmation of their child's gender identity to the state's standard of what constitutes parental responsibility for providing the health, safety, and welfare of the child in a court of law. Simply put, when parents divorce and go through a custody battle, judges can use this bill to remove children from the home of a parent who refuses to participate in the delusion of transgenderism. Now co-author of the bill and monkey poxapologists, the aptly named Scott Wiener, expressed his dissatisfaction on the platform formerly known as Twitter posting, this veto is a tragedy for trans kids here and around the country. These kids are living in fear with right-wing politicians working to out them, deny them health care, ban them from sports and restrooms, and erase their humanically. Literally none of that is happening. California needs to unequivocally stand with these kids. The level of right-wing misinformation about this bill was astounding. All this bill did was ensure that in custody disputes, a court would take into account the kid's gender identity and whether parents would be supportive of the kid as opposed to tormenting the kid. Okay Wiener. So why would arguably the most radical left governor in the country veto a bill that pushes through more radical leftism for Democrats, ultimately leading to more chaos and disruption of the family unit, which we all know is exactly what they want. We'll knew some statement on the veto said, I appreciate the passion and values that led the author to introduce this bill. I share a deep commitment to advancing the rights of transgender Californians, an effort that has guided my decisions through many decades in public office. That said, I urge caution when the executive and legislative branches of the state government attempt to dictate in prescriptive terms that single out one characteristic legal standards for the judicial branch to apply. Other-minded elected individuals in California and other states could very well use this strategy to diminish the civil rights of vulnerable communities. So, his excuse to his own people, the mean bigoted judges that still exist in this state might take the kids away from a mentally ill parent indoctrinating these kids, and we can't have that. But he knows better than that and has never stopped him before. We're talking about a governor who happily promotes a statewide curriculum to teach kids about anal sex, a governor who fought to remove parental consent to abortion, who fights to allow schools to keep students' gender identities secret from their parents. So why now? Well, it's simple. Joe Biden is collapsing before our very eyes. There's complete chaos at the southern border, and although he and his team keep touting, bi-nomics as a good thing, according to a Washington Post ABC poll released over the weekend, only 30% of Americans approve a Biden's handling of the economy. Three and four Americans say the economy is not so good or poor, and the same amount have a negative perception of the state of the average income amount. 74% of Americans believe Joe Biden is too old to run again, and nearly 60% of his own Democrat base want a better nominee, according to the latest poll released yesterday. So enter Gavin Newsom. He's like Joe when it comes to destroying whatever he touches, but younger, more vibrant, and instead of being the puppet who strings are pulled in whatever direction his puppet masters want, Newsom is all in on the radical ideology he promotes. Don't believe me? Just look at the poll that is now California. So is this a move to appear more reasonable, more moderate to a larger voting bloc? You know, just in case here to discuss this and more, we have Chad Prather, host of the Chad Prather show. Hi, you're on, Chad. Hello. I wanted to say the teleprompter says, oh, or if that was just you'd be passionate. I mean, I, I wrote it. I scripted it as a poll. So it was me being passionate. I just wrote it that way. Also here James Polis. He is host of Zero Hour, which you can find also here on BlazeTV. Thanks for being here. Of course. And you are, do you still live in the whole that is California? I am deeply embedded in inside the inner ring of the whole in question. That AIDS memorial they just put up in the park. It was so deep. I have almost come out the other side. Okay. So then so tell me, am I misjudging things? Am I just now to believe that Gavin Newsom is like, oh, oh, we, well, we don't want to take too much power because then the other side might wield it against us. I've never heard something like that from him before. Well, I think you are correctly judging it. I mean, you look at Gavin, he spent a long time in a hole of his own. The eight years of being Lieutenant Governor of California, thankless task. Jerry Brown had to put him in his place and say, like, no, you will wait. Yeah. Do nothing and you will like it. And, you know, he's a very vain guy. I think that anyone can see that even by California standards. And so this is like, this is, you know, this is his prime and he wants to put it to good use. But the terrain is very questionable right now. So you got Biden, is he in, is he out? There are some people who want to keep him in so that if it all goes wrong, they can sort of hand the bag of everything's about today, hand that bag, maybe even to Donald Trump himself, like, okay, buddy, you're back in. The bad news is we ruined everything and now you have to take care of it. So Gavin status right now is kind of a big question mark. He wants to push things along, but he doesn't want to go too far. He hasn't really touched Ukraine. He's picking his battles very carefully. And this is one where I think he has the opportunity to be a moderate on transing the kids. Of course, we will use technology, this fabulous technology that we've invented. What we'll use it for to permanently disfigure children for the rest of their lives until they sue. And here's where I think the moderate sort of angle comes in where he wants to be a guy who's insulating the state from probably the inevitable lawsuits that will come raining down on everyone involved with this atrocity that is being perpetuated on children who are now in many cases old enough to begin to sue and they're doing so. So watch that. Yeah, I totally agree. I think that's going to be the pendulum swinging back is going to be not that we're going to change these crazy people's minds about it all. They're just going to be scared that they're going to be sued into oblivion. Yeah, California is not only morally bankrupt, but they're economically bankrupt as well. I mean, you saw with this idea of giving reparations to all of their citizens and they said, yeah, we don't have that money to give. And he pushed back on that and wouldn't push that any further. The other thing that they have got to do is they got it. They've got to make sure they win the Hispanic vote and they're losing the Hispanic vote. The Democratic Party is losing the Hispanic vote. And I think it's a single issue voter problem. And that is on this trans issue because the family values of the Hispanic voter, they're not going for that at all. They don't like this idea. And so California certainly is dependent on that. And if you look at the trends in the polls that you just showed with the people who are not satisfied with Joe Biden's performance, they're not better off. They're losing a lot of not only Hispanic, but the black minority vote. When some polls out there, depending on what you want to choose to believe or not, has said that that has dropped in 2020 from 83% all the way down to 62%. So they can't keep pushing these issues like this about modifying children and then keeping parents out of the child's life and having a say in it. And Scott Wiener, he tweets like a pedophile. And so when they read stuff like that, they're going to push back on it. And I think a guy like Gavin Newsom is it is smart enough, but at least smart enough to realize that ain't going to fly for long. Yeah, this is really crucial. I mean, it's easy to look at California and say, wow, they're going to turn so blue that it's just going to create a hole in the space time continuum. But this coalition is unstable. And then you can pump in as many illegal immigrants as you want. But, you know, you, you wait a couple generations. And what you find out is you got a lot of people sitting there going, okay, no essay when they're shopping off their child's genitalia. So, you know, he's he does have a tough job. And I think he's he's a talented politician as far as it goes. And he's he's working as hard as he can to make sure that the state of California doesn't have to pay reparations to detrans to kids. Yeah, and it's weird, you know, Merrick Garland called these parents who came to the school board meetings, domestic terrorists wait another generation when they start showing up with machete. I am okay. So I want to go through this poll that I mentioned earlier, the Washington Post, ABC poll. I want to go through some of these numbers here because it the they're not good for Joe Biden. So you can't blame Gavin Newsom for like, in, like when he talks to the press, he I think he's very careful about what he says, he's like, Oh, I'm all in on Biden, you know, we've you got a back Biden, we're backing Biden. But then he's over there scheduling debates with Ron DeSantis. Yeah. Why is that? Well, I think part of the part of it is the numbers here that he's seeing come out day after day, 37% job approval rating for Joe Biden, 56% disapprove that that is not what you call good question. Would you say you yourself are better off financially than you were when Biden became president? 44% said not as well off 39% said about the same only 15% said better off the state of the nation. 25% were positive 74% negative. And is Joe Biden too old? I don't it doesn't let me see is Joe Biden too old for another term? 74% say he's too old. So the list goes on 23% approve of his immigration, how he's handling immigration 62% disapprove gas prices, 87% have a negative view of gas prices under his watch. Food prices 91% of people have a negative view of food prices under the Biden regime. So and then by the way, the same poll head to head Donald Trump or Joe Biden 52% say Trump 42% say Biden. I would like to state very emphatically. This poll is a giant outlier and I would not take that to mean, oh, Donald Trump is totally in and he won't have a problem and this look, everyone's going to vote for Trump. I don't think that it is as cush as this poll makes it out to be. Maybe that's just me. I don't know how you guys feel about it. Well, there's already been some damage control. So it's not a complete fabrication. Right. You've already had media rolling out. Oh, people are really dissatisfied with Biden and Trump. This is why we need to maybe find someone who's younger and can bring the country together. This is going to be the narrative. Biden obviously made some kind of deal with the powers that be to like, okay, Joe, you can run toward the sunset as far as you can go. And when you finally collapse face down to the dirt, we will drag you off and replace you. But until that moment, okay, go see what you can do. We've seen what he can do. And it's he's obviously, you know, he talked about gas prices. He is on empty and doesn't, you know, credit card isn't going to get a much more gas. So I think they are making preparations. I think it's an open question. Who is going to step up into that breach? I'm not sure that Newsom wants it, even though it's very tempting. So it's going to be it's going to be interesting stretch here. Ron DeSantis is still in the mix. Trump doesn't have it in the bag. So big question marks. I think a lot of people Americans just trying to make it to the holidays, even though, you know, we just got to Memorial or sorry, Labor Day. This is kind of going to be just like just just on fumes until until January. So people are feeling feeling the heat. Joe Biden is one of them. Why don't you think that Gavin Newsom wants it? I think that he's in a wait and see mode as much as everyone else. I know all things be equal. He wishes that you're president already, but not in the cards. Okay, got you. Who's out there who's, you know, so it's treacherous and everyone wants to make it through the minefield of 2023 without having to pick up their arms and legs and the battlefield. I just think it's so funny. Can we, I can't stress enough how funny it is to me that we have these conversations about who is going to take Joe's place if they in fact finally go, all right, we got to we got to get him out of here. And everyone is under the understanding that like, it's definitely not going to be Kamala. Like we just we just totally skip over her. We're like, I mean, they're not going to do that. The obvious is she was the first one out of the Democratic primaries and with less than one percent. So nobody likes her. And she's literally nobody likes her. I mean, she kind of speaks in some kind of weird rhyming code like a Dr. Seuss book without the creativity. She hasn't redeemed herself since she's been repeating words. I mean, we all know how she got her political start. And I mean, Willie Brown, you got to hand it to him. Anybody that can look at your naked laugh like that and you still perform, that's amazing. And she definitely has the cackle. That's not what I would prefer in a woman when I'm standing. Anyway, they want Joe out. The fact that they're willing to push these numbers, this is an ABC poll. I don't trust the poll either. But again, the fact that ABC is pushing this out there and actually talking about it, like I found it very humorous to watch Donna Brazil attempt over the weekend to try to spin these numbers and all of her little we got to stay in the kitchen and all this kind of stuff's like, well, back when you sold Hillary out, you don't want to stay in the kitchen because you don't want to walk past a window. You're afraid you're going to get shot through it. But let's forget about that. The DNC wants Joe out or they wouldn't be letting this stuff come out. But the problem that they have is Joe actually believes he's president and he doesn't want out. Yeah, he likes where he is. I mean, 50% of the time he's on vacation out on Royal Bay Beach, he likes this scenario, right? He doesn't really take any accountability for anything that he's doing wrong. He just goes out there and talks about LLJ Cool J and nobody knows what he's talking about it. And it's a cush gig for him. He believes he has power, but they want him out. They got to get him out. And I think that time's coming. They definitely don't want Kamala. There is a case for Kamala, though, and we should just in case like, so Biden is not really president in the way that we've come to think about these things. The regime is its own deal and they are running the show as they wish. And maybe Joe can sort of stop them here or there. I mean, he didn't like Afghanistan. He managed to pull that one out of the fire. But that's about it. And every time he does this, it's like not only like physically exhausting to him, but it reduces his political capital. So if he's gone, he's sort of like the white man in charge is removed from the scene. There's going to be this gnarly free for all, you know, the Buddha judges and all these other so everyone who represents one of these rainbow coalition tribes is suddenly going to be fighting each other in an effort to claim the ring. But none of them can really unite the party. So what do you do? Well, you turn to the person who's already there, Kamala, and you just scoot her, wheel her chair over to the Oval Office, and you have this figurehead who's not really in charge. Everything continues to roll on his normal. That's a scenario. It saves in moving costs. That's for sure. Okay. All right. I mean, the country will go to hell, but I can totally see that. Already there. Yeah. Great point. How far away are what's different about that scenario? Nothing. Yeah, we're in one of Dante's outer rings. Okay. All right. Let's go ahead and we're going to take a quick break, but we'll be back with more. First, we want to thank our sponsor, the segment relief factor. So relief factor is there for those of you who, you know, you've reached the age where you just live in constant pain. Maybe it's arthritis, tennis elbow, you got knee pain, you got back pain. I know about relief factor because I got in a car accident many years ago that messed up the discs in my neck. Not ideal. And I just thought that I was just going to live in pain for the rest of my life. Well, it turns out relief factor was a solution to that. It is an all natural anti-inflammatory that was developed by doctors, but it's not like a prescription. And the best part about it is that it's not going to, it's like, you know, you get the topical creams and you rub them on your shoulder or wherever you're in pain, and it feels great for 10 minutes. And then you're in pain again. Relief factor, because it's an anti-inflammatory, it targets the inflammation in your body, which is the root cause of your pain. So you can completely get rid of it rather than just putting a band-aid on it. So look, about 70% of the people who order their three-week quick start, which I'm about to tell you where to go get it, they reorder it because it's working for them. So order the trial pack. You will know within those three weeks if it's going to work for you, but it overwhelmingly is working for all of those people, including myself. So check it out, see if you could be one of them. It's 1995 and you can get it at relieffactor.com. Democrat Senator Bob Menendez has been indicted on bribery charges, among other things. So three criminal counts, conspiracy to commit bribery, conspiracy to commit honest services fraud, and conspiracy to commit extortion. He's accused of having an improper relationship with three New Jersey businessmen who allegedly paid him and his wife in exchange for him using his influence in Washington, D.C. God, this sounds really similar to another story about another Democrat that we keep hearing about, but I don't know, that might just be me. So there were piles of cash found in his home, like stuffed into coats and drawers and there were gold bars and like a hundred thousand dollars worth of gold bars, which is like, I feel like not typically where people save their stuff, but I want to play Bob Menendez defending himself against these charges during a press conference earlier today. Watch for 30 years, I have withdrawn thousands of dollars in cash from my personal savings account, which I have kept for emergencies and because of the history of my family facing confiscation in Cuba. Okay, let's play one more of him. He says, look, again, I don't, I want to get y'all's take on it. Obviously, we don't have all of the facts because that's what the investigation and indictment and upcoming trial are for. He's guilty. But he's, well, he would argue with you, Chad. He says he's going to be exonerated. It all makes sense. Okay, you might be thinking that like it's weird that he has these ties to Egypt and it's weird that he has all of this cash stuffed in his jacket and all of these gold bars that are like hidden in his closet. You might think that that's weird, but he says that he's going to be completely exonerated. Watch on Friday, the Southern District of New York, board charges against me. I understand how deeply concerning this can be. However, the allegations leveled against me are just that allegations. Guilty. For anyone who has known me throughout my 50 years of public service, they know I have always fought for what is right. My advocacy has always been grounded in what I learned from growing up as a son of Cuban refugees, especially my mom, my hero, Evangeline Hernandez. Everything I've accomplished, I've worked for, despite the naysayers and everyone who has underestimated me. I recognize this will be the biggest fight yet, but as I have stated throughout this whole process, I firmly believe that when all the facts are presented, not only will I be exonerated, but I still will be the New Jersey's senior senator. So one more thing on this, the indictment also charges him with providing sensitive US government information that secretly aided the government of Egypt. So prosecutors say he met with Egyptian military and intelligence officials passed along non-public information about employees at the US embassy in Cairo and ghost wrote a letter on behalf of Egypt asking his Senate colleagues to release a hold on $300 million worth of aid. These the heat that it totally exonerated. So I just want to make sure that I got this right. A career politician in New Jersey is suspected of improper relationships with multiple businessmen. Yeah, are you shocked? And to go even further, a guy who has been a public service, this is his own words. Because I was just on the phone with my gold guy at UnitedPatriotcoin.com. I was on the phone with my gold guy just earlier over at UnitedPatriotcoin.com. All right. I was on the phone with him and we were talking about this story over it's called Trey at UnitedPatriotcoin.com. A. Yeah. I was talking to my guy because I too keep gold in silver. I do too. I do too. I have it. I think it's a smart. They're not in my jackets in my closet. They're not in the jackets. No. They're not just sitting around. They're not just hanging out. They're in a very specific place. There's a very specific financial track you can follow to see where I made that investment or, you know, made that exchange or something like that. But Menendez just said with his own words that over the years as a 50 year public servant, I have consistently taken thousands of dollars out of my bank account. Now, I don't know what the New Jersey senior senator makes, but it's not so much that you just can be pulling cash out of your savings consistently and just going out and buying gold bars and things like that unless somehow he's making more money somewhere that we don't know about. Right? So, I mean, you got to be doing pretty well, right? To be able to go do something like that. Because again, if you will look at, if you look at the pictures on the cover of the New York Times, you see these gold bars. You do the math on how much they found there. It's more than just a couple thousand dollars. Well, my understanding is a lot of money in value. Is is bro actually like typed into web search, how much is a kilo of gold? I find it really amazing that that he's like, this is going to be my biggest fight yet. And this is a guy was accused of like improprieties with Dominican children, like under age. So, and this is what he considers to be the most difficult one. So, you know, not his first rodeo, but not a brilliant man. Yeah. It's a great point. Well, and you know, it does give you some added context, not that we didn't already know it, but added context of like, these people are never going to vote term limits for themselves. Why would they do that? Why would they do that? Why would they do that? Let me tell you Chad, just to answer your question really quickly, the salary of a United States Senator is a hundred and eighty two thousand, a hundred and eighty nine dollars. You may think that that sounds like a lot if you're from middle America. If you live in DC, that ain't going to get you very far or New Jersey. Right. And again, he was driving around and what was that a Mercedes there? I believe so. BMW Mercedes, something that was a luxury car. It was a nice small Mercedes. Is it e-class like Cabriolet? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. It's so, you know, I mean, he's living, that looks like a nice neighborhood to me. Look at that Japanese maple growing across this tree. I mean, it's a beautiful little place. He's living there in the Garden State, right? So he's guilty. I just bottom line is guilty. That's all I need to say. Well, you know who else, I think thinks he's guilty is AOC. And when AOC, your own party, wow. No, I'm just going to say, they're setting him up to be a fall guy. Obviously. So he crossed the wrong person. We don't know who that is and we never will know, but he crossed the wrong person. And that's that for Bob Menendez. So you're going to rotate him into the White House. I mean, why not? It seems to be that resume of corruption that works. So let's play AOC. She was asked on CBS's face, the nation, about these charges filed against Menendez. Let's listen to what she had to say. Senator Bob Menendez of New Jersey, as you know, has just been indicted on bribery charges. Should he resign? And what do you think of his statement that it has to do with him being a Latino? Well, you know, I think it's the situation is quite unfortunate, but I do believe that it is in the best interest for Senator Menendez to resign in this moment. As you mentioned, consistency matters. It shouldn't matter whether it's a Republican or a Democrat. The details in this indictment are extremely serious. They involve the nature of not just his, but all of our seats in Congress. And while, you know, as a Latina, there are absolutely ways in which there is systemic bias, but I think what is here in this indictment is quite clear. And and I believe is in the best interest to maintain the integrity of the seat. I want to emphasize that all people are, they must be extended the presumption of innocence until proven guilty. But, but, I'd like to check her pockets. Well, yeah, I mean, I mean, you're right, because they're like, well, we don't we want to pretend like we think this is really wrong. So nobody comes knocking on our doors because we're all doing it. Hey, she's a sag actress recruited to play the part of a congressional official. It's all totally above board. I mean, I found interesting that she went out of her way to say that she is Latina not Latin X. This is Bob's big chance he needs to come out and say, I stand for Latinx Americans. That's a great point. I mean, neither, not a divider. That's a great point. I mean, the interviewer like set her up so perfectly to use that Latina as an excuse. And she was just like, Nope, I'm going in for the kill. I'm playing climate change. Climate change. Climate change and carbon. It, I mean, that is the, the root of all problems really is, is fun to change. Oh, I like where your head's out there. Okay, let's go ahead and enough of that. Let's go ahead and take a quick break. What was that website again, Chad? United Patriot. I was kidding. I didn't. I know. We're going to get in trouble for that, but we. Yeah, use your show. I didn't do it. You're the one moderating. All right, let's take a break. Mm. Just the moderator here. I want to thank our sponsor, FastGrowingTrees.com. Listen, James at this point is like, what the hell did I get myself into?

Did you know that when a news site puts Google ads on its articles, they're also giving Google the ability to suppress any article they don't like and make it virtually impossible for you to find. It's true. Virtually every news site in the country uses Google ad exchange, which gives the big tech giant incredible power to control what you see. At Blaze Media, we've had enough. We're doing something about it. The Blaze.com has been revamped to get rid of every last ad. That makes us the only conservative news site that's truly independent from Big Tech. Have a look for yourself and learn what you can do to help join the fight against Big Tech censorship. Visit the Blaze.com today. All right. It's six days from now. We may see a government shutdown. I know they keep saying this in the mainstream media. It's a bad thing. They're like, oh no, it might be a federal government shutdown when all of the other, it basically runs normally to you, but they're federal employees that don't like all of the IRS agents and all the, oh no, what are we going to do without these people affecting our lives? That sounds awesome, first of all. But they always come up with these 11th hour bipartisan, bipartisan spending agreements. And this one in particular that they may come up with could actually be a catch 22 for Kevin McCarthy, Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy, because if he does agree to the spending that the Democrats want him to, Matt Gaetz is like, yeah, we're going to file a motion for him to vacate his position as Speaker of the House. So I want to, I want to play Matt Gaetz on Sunday morning with Maria Bartiromo. You got it. Thank you. On Fox. Ask me. I love her. Do you? Oh yeah. So she spoke with him on Fox News about pursuing this, you know, the government shutdown and why he's standing strong. Here's what he had to say. So tell me why you are threatening Speaker McCarthy and trying to shut down this government at a time that the Republicans have finally gotten some upper hands here in terms of wins able to investigate President Biden on what looks like bribery. Yeah, we don't put our pencils down in the investigation of President Biden during a shutdown. So the premise is false. Second, if Kevin McCarthy was actually serious about pursuing the Bidens, he would have sent Hunter Biden a subpoena by now. That's how you know this is sort of failure theater that you're observing during the first year of Democrat control of the Congress. They brought in Donald Trump Jr. three times over nothing, over a nothing burger. And so we seem to be fundamentally unserious in our oversight. But what is serious is the fact that we are spending more than $7 trillion a year, bringing in around $5 trillion a year. And I want to fund the government. I'm not pro shut down, but the way to fund the government is not the same way we've been doing it since the mid 90s, where it's one upper down vote on the entire government all at once. We should have separate single subject spending bills. Kevin McCarthy promised that in January. He is in breach of that promise. In Matt Gaetz's defense or to his credit, I should say, why else did those, what were they? 18, 20 Republicans that held strong whenever McCarthy thought, like, I got this in the bag. I'm obviously going to be Speaker of the House and they held strong and made them come to the table with all of these demands. And one of them was that it only takes one of us to file a motion to vacate. So if you screw up on any of these promises that you are giving us right now, we're going to follow through with that mechanism. Like, what is the point of negotiating all of that if nobody actually intends to follow through with it, I would say? Yeah. I mean, in Gaetz has that punchable face. I've said that so many times that smug look, but you got to love it too. Because he will, I mean, you got to give it to him. He's the nuisance of the GOP. It's like, you got to California for it. And the slickness are as converging. So slickness conversion. That's so true. It's so greasy. But you know, you're right. You got to commend him. I mean, he's been the one who's consistently, at least he's the rhetoric to try to hold Kevin McCarthy accountable. And I hope they do. Because again, I know McCarthy's part of the uni party. You know, it's all one big wrestling match there. Well, the jokes really tell themselves on this. And it's hard to keep perspective. You know, I think that the natural compromise, given the interests of the two parties, is you shut down the US government, and then you just transfer a sliver of that budget over to keep the Ukraine government going. Everybody's happy. Yeah, the laundry that a laundry mat stays open. Yeah, laundry mat has to stay open. It is interesting though. I mean, Gates wants to be more powerful to keep the heat off of them. You know, lots of people trying to trying to take him out of the race. The Republicans want to make sure that they're not sort of boxed out with McCarthy becoming their their figurehead. And then the the Dems actually want to make sure that that Biden's status remains a question mark going forward. So it's all, you know, musical chairs. And I think, you know, Kevin McCarthy, California Republican can't be long for this world, right? Yeah, I, you know, the thing perplexed me with this McCarthy thing was Marjorie Taylor Green, who was just always considered so like far right. I think she's a lovely person. I know her, but like, in the in the media, as her votes go, she's considered like so far right. And she, when all of the speaker stuff was going on was like, let's vote for McCarthy. I think he's they were thunder buddies. It was so weird to me. Yeah, it was weird. I should they were snuggled up awful close. I mean, she obviously wanted that to happen. But why? I mean, obviously, there was some sort of a deal that was brokered. I just wish I knew what it was. So anyway, I think I'd like to know about the inner workings of Washington. Well, I would like to know where James got that shirt. Like I'm really digging that denim right there. We can talk about that offline. That is your kind of shirt. Okay. All right. Let's go ahead and take another quick break. We'll be back with more, but we want to thank our sponsor Hillsdale College. So, you know, history, economics, the great works of literature, the meaning of the United States Constitution. Did you study these things in school? If you've gone to school very recently, probably not, or even if you did, perhaps it's time for a refresher. Time and technology have changed a lot of things, but they have not changed basic fundamental truths about the world, despite the left's attempts to try to rewrite history. Since 1844, Hillsdale College has been providing an education and faith, freedom, and character because they believe that a virtuous citizen is the best defense for liberty. That's why they've taken some of the core classes they teach on campus, and they've made them available for free online. They've got 39 free courses to choose from. They're very easy to follow. They're self-paced, so you can start whenever you want. You know, if you want to start right now, in fact, you can. You can enroll now in Hillsdale's not-for-credit online courses program. It's free. It's fun. And it will change the way you understand our country, the world, and your place in it. You can go right now to hillsdale.edu slash y to enroll. Again, this is free. There's no reason not to do it. It's very, very easy to get started. It's hillsdale.edu slash y. So I don't know if you guys have noticed, but there has been an uptick in people, parents protesting schools, school boards, curriculums, things of that nature. And I want to play the Department of Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, who criticized parents who were protesting against some of this controversial curriculum at school board meetings. And I just want to get your thoughts on what he said. Watch. You've said that public education and public schools are under attack. I'm wondering whether that's something that other education secretaries have had to grapple with. You know, I've been in education, you know, about 25 years. Not including the time I was in high red as a student. I've never seen it where it is now. There was civility. We could disagree. We could have healthy conversations around what's best for kids. I respect differences of opinion. I don't have too much respect for people that are misbehaving in public and then acting as if they know what's right for kids. There's a team that's fighting for kids and there's a team that's fighting against kids. Well, here's the problem. When I'm talking about my children, I am the one who knows best for them. That's kind of like my entire role and the idea that Miguel Cardona thinks that because he's spent 25 years in higher education, by the way, I'd love to live there for a second. Keyword, higher education because we all know what they're taught in higher education. Miguel Cardona thinks because he spent 25 years in the industry that he knows what's best for my children. I mean, I would just say if he's upset about the people, the parents pushing back and coming and protesting these meetings, maybe he could instruct his teachers to stop teaching our children about butsex. I went off on this topic last week in my show talking about, I don't know, the social media influencer talking about children and their rights and how parents don't have the rights. The children have all the rights. Well, there's two groups of people, there's others but there's two specific groups of people that don't have rights when it comes to my kids. Politicians, I throw in educators with that. They don't have any rights when it comes to my kids. And the second is the kids themselves. They don't have any rights either. As long as you're in my home, I'll listen to you. I'll take your opinion and your ideas and your counsel. But at the end of the day, my rights is all that stands. And that comes to politicians, educators, everything else. What I say in my home is what goes. Period. End of story. That's it. Now, does that mean I'm some overbearing, over dominating bully or something like that? No, that's not the point at all. But when it comes to authority, you have to have some. And that doesn't mean everybody just has a right and a privilege to do whatever they want to do within a household. And that also means that educators don't have the ability to come in and say whatever they want to say to my kids either. Now again, I say get your kids out of the public indoctrination government schools that are out there and take charge of your children's education because you got assholes like this who are very clearly telling you they're not even trying to keep it a secret anymore that you don't have the rights to parent your children or speak out on behalf of your children or else as I said earlier, people like Merrick Garland will call you a domestic terrorist. Yeah, I mean, maybe that's why there's no civility anymore. James, perhaps parents don't appreciate being called domestic terrorists for showing up at the school board meetings, the schools, which by the way are paid by our freaking tax dollars. And you think that we just can't have a say in what you guys are teaching our kids and then you call us domestic terrorists. Yeah, maybe there is a lack of civility at this point. Well, we're a few new cycles away from being told that actually to have children is an act of domestic terrorism. This paradox that you're talking about where it's like, you're a child, you have rights, and then one day you have a child of your own and you don't have rights, you become the enemy. You know, like people ask me, like, why are the bots taking over? Why is AI taking over? And it's because of guys like this who's like sub chatbot level of like response to these questions. There are people fighting for kids and people fighting against kids and like, well, if you really want to sit down and figure out who's who, you're going to come up with a different answer than Mr. Chappai. Yeah, and another thing we talked about is this new trend that they're pushing right now of the bio bubbles where now you don't even have to carry a child in a womb anymore. We could just grow them in these bio bubbles. I mean, what could go wrong with that? Well, the problem with that is you say, well, medically, you never know, maybe somebody can't carry a child. And so we're just going to birth this child in this little fake amniotic sack here. And it's like the matrix all over again. And then guess who owns your child? They grew the child. They want clones. So they own the child. Today you get rid of parents rights and tomorrow you get rid of parents. That's exactly right. It's again, and you go all the way back, 1917, 1918, when the Bolsheviks took the children out of the homes when they took over again, because again, they wanted to grow good communists. They took them out of the home. They didn't want the parents influences. They put them in these schools to indoctrinate them so that they grew up to be good KGB. Well, this is the thing you get rid of parents and you get rid of humans. We're not human beings anymore. Right. Well, we're parasites. We've been and you're unborn, by the way, that's the other thing, is there's articles out there talking about how your unborn children are parasitic. So of course, as long as they can label and your parasitic when it comes to a living or carbon producing organism that is killing the planet, this is why it leads to the rhetoric of people like Bill Gates saying, Oh yeah, we got eight billion. We really need to be down about one. I do think that just kind of going back to the school thing for a second, I do think that this was one issue, one aspect of COVID that the left didn't see coming, which was that, well, I mean, we're, you know, we're going to be shut down and we're going to be able to control everything, but oh, wait, now kids are going to be doing homeschool. They're going to be doing Zoom calls. They're because it wasn't this the precipice of all of this, that the kids were doing Zoom calls, the parents were listening in to what was actually being taught. And they were like, hold on, what are you asking my child? And now all of a sudden, you know, we see more kids being homeschooled, we see more parents getting active at school board meetings, like the parental involvement I feel like is at record highs because of COVID, which I just don't think that they expected to happen. I think they overlooked it. Yeah, heightened all this stuff. And you know, what a what a, I don't know if it's irony or something darker than that, that this manufactured virus is what caused it. It's always tempting to quote from the matrix and situations like these, like you were a virus, Mr. Anderson, a cancer spreading it right. And that's the view point about humanity. You look at Jeffrey Epstein's favorite scientist who he brought up from Princeton to give him his keycard and his his phone line and an office at Harvard, Martin Novak. And what was Martin Novak's specialty? He wrote a book on it called Super Co-operators. You can buy it off Amazon, I'm sure. And the thesis of this book was basically, hey, we need to look at bugs and viruses to understand how to really coordinate the social activity of human beings. This is the plan. Yeah. All right, we got to take a quick break. We'll break back. Chad mentioned Joe Biden talking about LL Cool J earlier. Let's, let's revisit that moment. Two of the great artists of our time representing the groundbreaking legacy of hip hop in America. LL J Cool J. By the way, that boy's got a man who says bigger than my thighs. I think he's an MC light. Both of you. Thank you. Because they're both have the light off. On the mic, you know, you're, you're all here and listen to the new edition. Mike Bivens, 40 years producing music. So lots of unpack there and we only have a minute, but LL J Cool J is not actually his name. It's not the first time he's called a black man boy, except this time he caught himself. And I'm very curious as to why he keeps commenting on men's biceps because he's done that several times about him being bigger than his thigh. Several times. Like in the last couple of months, he's watching my watch. Every time he has an anecdote about his, his relationship with black Americans, he talks about his own legs. His legs. Yeah. Yeah. We're watching my show. With that next, we'll talk about it in depth. Trust me, you don't want to miss this expert analysis. Wait, are you the I'm the expert on Joe's legs. He's a little L L J Cool J ladies love cool James. You boys watch. All right. Make sure that you tune in next to the chat Prather show and check out zero hour. Thanks you guys for being here.
