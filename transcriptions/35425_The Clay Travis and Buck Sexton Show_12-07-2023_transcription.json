    "text": " Welcome to today's edition of the clay Travis and bucksxton show podcast. All right second hour of clay and buck kicks off right now Thanks for being here everybody and We mentioned Joe Biden in the last hour his prospects for the 2024 election. Will he even be here? But what about Kamala Harris? Her name came up. I'm telling you this is something we're not gonna spend too much time on it. Just wanted to run it by you here clay whenever I see a Kamala Harris Gaff clip now. I have to stop and say hold on a second Is this a new one because we just had one we just had one a few days ago I can't even remember exactly what it was now. I think it was something about You know culture culture right yeah culture is like when there's the thing of culture where people are being cultural And are really focused on the creation of culture Here is a Kamala Harris moment for you all on transportation Professor Harris has some thoughts for you on transportation here play it. I again want to thank the secretary for your work This issue of transportation is Fundamentally about just making sure that people have the ability to get where they need to go It's that basic Yes clay Transportation is about making sure people Can get to the places they need to go Now there's a part of me that says oh My gosh, this must mean the Democrats are in a panic because what happens if she has to ascend in one way or the other to the presidency But you know I even heard this from some Democrats. She was a senator from California The system propped her up. She's now the vice president of the United States I think that the the systems that we have or rather on the Democrats are the systems that they have are Working with very with very different sense of how you assess and how you build candidates that maybe we're used to like I just feel like they can they can make anybody vice president some online Yeah, I think this is the problem with a unit unit party system and and I think on a larger scale with how we determine who is in positions of authority in Some way other than the meritocracy Because I can't imagine that there aren't hundreds of people listening to us in California right now Who would be doing a better job as vice president than Kamala Harris of all different backgrounds of all different? individual talents Kamala Harris is to me buck evidence of cosmetics mattering more than anything I think they decided in the Grand power brokers of the California Democrat Party This is a good look for us to have a woman who is half black half Indian who is the right the right multi ethnic mix to represent California now and Then they just pushed her through no matter what and the thing I wonder on because I haven't met her face-to-face I do wonder clearly for public events buck. She's a disaster She's one of the worst communicators that has ever existed but you know sometimes people are really good one-on-one and They're better one-on-one than they are in a room and I wonder whether that's Kamala Harris because I've never met her one-on-one Maybe she is very likable and more personable on an individual level. You know what I'm talking about sometimes people project better in Rooms speaking to a thousand people then they do one-on-one Speaking to one person and the reverse can be true too a lot of people are very good in that hey Personal interaction basis, but you put them up on the stage and they shrink and they they get worse I Because I I am boggled by how to explain Kamala Harris otherwise because I don't even think she's talented Even if your criteria was hey, we need a black woman who's half Indian I think there are black women who are half Indian in California who are way more talented than she is right? Even if all that mattered was the cosmetics I don't even think she's talented in that limited group of people I just I keep coming coming back to this though when Joe Biden was by when Joe Biden was Obama's vice president Everybody was like this guy is a clown. How could he have become vice president and some people would say well? You know he was a senator for like 40 years before this so he knows how to do something and With with Kamala Harris He'd say she wasn't a senator for long, but she was a senator in California very big very She was the attorney general of the state book. That's the part that really blows my mind She was in charge of all law enforcement in the state of California This is what I'm this is what I'm saying. I know that right now The numbers all look so weak for her, but the the system is so powerful that they've been able to elevate Really sub-media He's Joe Biden is a sub-media Equity and he's sitting in the Oval Office as president of the United States right now So I just feel like we have to remember that anything is possible. I oh yes well. Let me just say this There are a lot of really dumb politicians in both parties Yes And I would say that's the thing because I came out of sports I tended to have more faith in the overall intelligence of politicians when I wasn't focused in politics all the time I think there are a lot of people that are very poor intellectual representatives of This country right in both Congress the Senate and governors You know they say that everybody who's in the Senate looks around and sees themselves as president because they're surrounded by the other senators I think that there are So many people that are virtually incompetent that exist in Political office and I didn't have that that opinion before I actually got involved on the side of politics I meet a lot of politicians Democrats and Republicans and I think you I wouldn't want you to work at my company You are a numb thumb school. Yeah, well, you know never underestimate the ability of people to Fail to meet expectations and politics over on the view You like that you like that. Thank you. I already know this speaking of dumb people another transition Joy Behar She is picking up on because this is the most this is going to be the pablum that is that is you know Give it out. This is going to be what is The propaganda that is ladled in mush onto the tables and the plates of people who are just Low information voters across the country are gonna hear Joe Biden's actually it's not so bad He's doing a pretty good job. And in fact the economy She says here economy is pretty good play 20 by the way this whole notion that the economy is in bad shape It's not that's not true and we are helping no Headline the right wing in this country doesn't want to help the Ukraine. I mean I've never seen such a lot Perception matters with the economy and like consumer prices have been up 15% over the last two years if people go to the store So I'm just I know it's dumb and a lot of people are saying oh my god Why do you put us through this but this is going to be the line an economy that is not awful and in free fall is Good enough under Joe Biden because you know what they're gonna do they're gonna compare it They're gonna look at all the numbers clay in 2020 during covid They're gonna look at the unemployment number which based on how they gauge unemployment's low. It is low right now I'm just I'm telling you. This is the way it's gonna go. It's the the winning Republican campaign is going to have to do more than say the economy sucks They're going to have to say here's how we're going to make it better for you in a way that is meaningful that changes things that matters I Haven't I'm not really hearing a lot of from any of the Republican can you know there's a lot of talk about other things About what would be done specifically to make the economy better And and I think that that's gonna have to be that's gonna be a more of an uphill climb then a lot of people on the right recognize right now because I Mean look at look at the 2022 elections Not what we thought it would be Economy is worse than than it is right now at least inflation was worse than it is right now We're felt that way to people Yeah, look Biden I mean you know that they're going to try to sell that Joe Biden Economy works because they're trying to try it out Biden Biden economics as a as a thing And they've got dumb people like joy Bayhar out there trying to sell this as a good spot to be in what I would say in general Is I think you have to lay out Joy Bay are has no idea what America's actually like let me just start here And this is one I mean so the idea that she is speaking as to what she thinks the economy is But she lives on the upper West side in Manhattan She probably hasn't driven a car in 25 years She probably hasn't gone into a real grocery store and bought things or gone and taken kids to a fast food restaurant Or gone to a traditional movie in 20 some odd years. This is where we started off the show by People innately feel things and you may not be able you're a truck driver right now I was talking earlier as we finished the first hour I was like can you imagine if we cut 50% of the federal government? I think the federal government would still work if we cut 50% of lawyers and said hey you have to go find real jobs The economy would be fine if we cut 50% of truck driver jobs the entire economy would stop within a week and You guys out there listening to us right now driving all over the country with your labor keeping this country moving You know what it feels like moms and dads know what it feels like I mentioned just going through a a fast food restaurant and When you got three kids in the back and you got a couple of their friends with them or whatever and you order a bunch of hamburgers And french fries and they say at McDonald's that'll be $75 That's not normal and I know every single person out there who has that experience feels that So the Republican candidate it's not so much the numbers and this is where this is where I think the Republicans fail It's Expressing the feeling and I understand like I'm a fax guy But you have to be able to connect the facts to an emotion and I think what Republicans fail at a lot of times is The facts tell a story, but the emotion is what people connect to and you understand What inflation has done if you go through the drive-through for a fast food restaurant or buck This is why gas prices crystallize things so much people have to go to the gas station every week That was making fun of joy Bayhar I bet she hasn't filled up a gas tank in 20 years But when you go there and you watch that number keep ticking up and It's a lot more than you used to pay it gets it makes you really angry And I don't think Republicans do a good job of explaining the nitty gritty of hey This is what happens when you go to fill up your tank This is what happens when you take your kids to McDonald's they don't really connect and tell that story Because 9% inflation is tough to understand. What's a percent? What's 9? What's normal? That doesn't connect people know the feel of What things cost they feel it we don't do a good job explaining that feeling They're gonna look at the 3.6 percent unemployment rate. I'm telling you I've been saying all this is also goes to why I would think that Biden would be on the way out If if the economy was in a really obviously bad place, right? Then I think if it muddles along like this and really I think what you see with the way the Fed Changes interest rate the whole point of the interest rate changes. Yeah, it's fighting inflation, but it's like they're extending out a recession As you know, they're pulling the bandaid off as slowly as possible Because the numbers don't have the same impact when it's just you know when it's incremental over a long period of time So the recession that everybody thought was gonna hit and hit hard it's hit But it's kind of extended over many many many months So you get used to the inflation you get used to the high prices And you feel like investment being down and other numbers that should be higher. Well, it could be worse This is gonna be the it could be worse reelection campaign when it comes to economy for Joe Biden and for some people that'll be enough Yeah, and we come back. We should mention this too uh, the mortgage rates are out of control now And that's a story that I think republicans have to do a better job of telling because I know there's Probably millions of you out there listening to us right now If you're fortunate enough to have a two and a half or three percent interest rate You're not going to move for the next 10 or 15 years Because mortgage rates are now up to basically seven and a half advancing on eight percent This is crazy. I want to talk about it because I think it goes directly to the way things feel And needing to connect with things feeling wrong as opposed to just looking at the numbers But my pillow celebrating 20th anniversary Can you believe mike mentland del's been at this for 20 years now?

We're talking during the break No, I don't hear anybody talking about this out on the campaign trail for example buck And you I think the bidenomics arguments are so important But you have to put it in context and you have to make people understand it I think this is one of the challenges I was making fun of joy behar But I think a lot of these politicians are also Isolated from the real world in many ways because they're on the campaign trail They're not living as many as much of a normal life as you would anticipate and so it puts them a little bit out of touch A friend just texted me. She's getting a new place 8% That she's gonna have to pay on the mortgage right now 8% and so Buck if you are fortunate enough, I'm one of these people. I bought my house a bunch of years ago. I refied I've got a two and a half percent mortgage rate Locked in 15 years. I don't know how many years we have left on the house or whatever else I would never pay my mortgage off Because I could never borrow money again at two and a half percent Well, a lot of our listeners. I hope you were fortunate enough to lock in a two and a half or three percent interest rate But this is important in terms of understanding. I know you're buying a place right now in florida Which is miami like the hottest craziest market anywhere But the idea was that as interest rates rose the prices on houses would come back some Some somewhat substantially was the expectation and that would make homes more affordable But I think this is important to understand from a pure pocketbook perspective What's happened instead is a lot of people with two and a half and three percent interest rates Are not putting their house on the market because they can't afford to sell that house and move into a new place And pay a seven or eight percent mortgage rate And that then factors in in a big way like you're probably seeing this on the trail as you get out and have been looking for houses Yeah, it's not for the problem you have in miami and other place in florida is people who maybe paid Years and years and years ago 200,000 dollars for their house 300,000 dollars for their house They're getting offers of eight nine hundred k and you turn on you say, oh, well, why wouldn't they take that's amazing? Right? I mean come on. You're gonna get like triple the problem is where do you go? Unless you want to move to a different state and and a lot of people are locked into those much better rates So to cash out even in a market that's tight People have to be able to find a place to go to which makes the the housing market continue to be in some of these places very expensive very difficult to uh to find uh the house of your dreams Seven or eight percent a lot of people then don't put their houses on the market Which means the houses that are on the market are still appreciating Which means we're in a tough spot and I know a lot of you out there you're having a new kid Maybe you had somebody you want a downsize you can't move you're locked in because of how rapidly mortgage rates have risen That's a real issue going on everywhere Uh when a service member or first responder dies or is severely injured in the line of duty Who is there for them or the families left behind who's helping our homeless veterans and our nation to never forget? 9-11 the tunnel the towers foundation that's who foundations in the line of duty programs comprised of its gold star fallen first responder smart home and veteran homeless Programs all of which are dedicated to honoring our nation's heroes and their families They do 80 runs walks climbs a year dozens of golf idlings and the tunnel the towers 9-11 institute educating kids and kindergarten through 12th grade To help our nation keep its vow to never forget more than 95 cents of every dollar you donate goes to its programs Never forget the sacrifices of our country's greatest heroes donate 11 dollars a month to tunnel the towers at t2t.org That's t the number two t dot org We haven't talked in a few days, I think about rfk jr. Who is still out there getting a lot of attention and um people are looking into What is it exactly that the long-term play is here? um rfk jr occasionally says things clay where I go oh man I really like that a lot So on coven really that's where he that's where he gets me when he talks about the covet stuff Um, we've got to get him back on and we've we've been in touch with his team. He is running around He's he's been a little busy. We'll get him on at some point Hopefully soon to answer other policy questions. I mean basically he's running as a democrat Is so I assume he disagrees with republicans on most things that aren't coven related Although he did sound pretty reasonable recently on the border But uh here he is again talking about covet and bad policy and he's even said that he would be willing if you were president to prosecute fauci if uh malfeasance was further malfeasance was uncovered play nine do I think that he Committed crimes. I think he caused a lot of injury. I think that uh He particularly by withholding early treatment from americans I you know, we were act up the highest f count in the world We only have 4.2 percent of the club's population But we had 16 percent of the covet deaths in this country and that is uh, that's what's from bad policy So there are many many things that we did wrong in this country and uh, and some of those were Uh, I would say knowing knowingly that um that some of the things that were done by public health officials that time That they knew that they would be harmful So knowingly harmful Um, I think that what you could put in that category One thing he leaves out is that the us we know that uh, wait Was the primary covet comorbidity after age that remained true even after all the data everything's been looked at Um, so the us was in a worse position that way than a lot of other countries though Though not all countries there are some western european countries, uh for example that are very pretty close to similar Uh average BMI rates but clay when you look at the intentionally bad things that were done Um, I mean lockdowns very high on that list the masking policy, which was always absurd moronic and people who believed that it should be embarrassed people who enforced it should be you know should feel awful about themselves and uh Also, I would say the suppression of herd immunity as a concept in medicine which was one of the it's not a lie that gets spoken about as much but it is one of the biggest lies of all When they acted like if you'd already had covet that shouldn't really make any difference in how you go about your your day-to-day life What kind of risk you are to people that was insane? imagine how much different things would be if We had had the right leadership at the time and they had come out and said hey The number one thing you can do on an individual basis to combat covet is Exercise as much as you can and lose as much weight as you can Because that was the truth right the nump you can't control your age. It's not like if you're 78 suddenly you can say okay Well, I'm gonna be 68 instead But if you weighed 290 pounds, you could say okay. I'm gonna try to get down to 250 I'm gonna exercise instead. We told people to do the exact opposite buck We told them to go to their rooms go to their homes and don't interact at all sit on the couch and watch Netflix and That to me leaving aside what I think is the biggest part of this public policy health failure, which is shutting down schools I'm sure yesterday even the New York Times had a front page news story where it said hey That whole pandemic learning gap. It's not getting erased. It's actually growing more substantial and this democrat party which claims to care about equity Actually created the least equitable outcomes in any of our lives by keeping Predominantly black and brown students out of school the most Further creating gaps between them and white and asian students who were more likely to be in school But buck one thing I wonder when I every time I hear our kjr I would vote for rfk jr, right people out there say oh my god how whoa I would consider like if you gave me met romney Or rfk jr. I would rather vote for rfk jr than met romney That's okay. No, that's a tough one. That's a tough one. That's a tough one. I'm just like I'm just saying Well, I mean mit rom is not running. I get it, but he was the nominee not very long ago I know and so And so or paul ryan you told me hey you can get rfk jr. Paul ryan. He was the friggin You know the speaker of the house. I would vote rfk jr So what i'm saying about that you would vote for rfk jr over paul ryan. I would Oh man, I mean I again I have to hear I have to hear what rfk jr Thinks because I think that paul ryan Is is a republican is he somebody who's a stout. He has no that. Yeah, sure. He has no spine I want spine over because you're gonna make whatever comments you're gonna make Out there on the campaign trail. I want somebody that actually has a spine stand up for something And I think rfk jr. Does so my point on this buck is I bet there are a lot of people out there listening to us in new hamster right now And I haven't heard anybody discuss this in february I think rfk jr is gonna win new hamster for democrats Partly because independence can go vote everybody forgets in 2016 when trump won new hamster A lot of people were deciding buck between trump or bernie sanders Especially in new hamster. There are a lot of people that just wanted a disruptive candidate I think in 2024 What people want the most is a candidate that's going to be honest with them I I think that more than anything else and there are lots of things rfk jr is saying that I disagree with but The single thing that I want the most from a politician in 2024 personally Is honesty on covet and a reckoning for everything that we've gotten wrong on censorship And the first amendment and everything surrounding covet rfk jr is right on that I think paul ryan would come out and say hey, I think you guys need to go get your boosters I think he's a stooge in that way for big corporate governance Do you think if you had a choice between? Andrew tate or mit romney or paul ryan would you go andrew tate? I would vote andrew tate over vote those guys go andrew tate So here here he is tucker who is doing his show on on twitter these days tucker on twitter He had a lengthy sit down with andrew tato over two hours Uh here is what now now tate just severance up to speed on this we've talked about him before on the show Uh, yes. He is controversial. Yes. He says things that Um, we would not agree with or you know, whatever, but he also says some things that I think are important for people to hear There's a reason he's the most Uh was the most googled man I think on the planet for a few months last year. That was at least the story we heard A clay has said many times that his his sons and people young boys in their teenage years love Andrew tate now. He is under house arrest in romania for um human Alleged human trafficking when he discusses the charges They do sound Very flimsy the whole thing sounds very strange Um, he's not accused of using force on anybody. He's not accused of threatening force against anybody Um, but anyway, but this is now we haven't actually seen the Romanian Prosecution present its case. So we'll see but he talked to tucker, but this is about covet actually here's what he said about Are a lesson that we should take from the covet reality play ten It was interesting for me because and I want to be an optimist But I lost so much faith in humanity during covet I really if you would have told me how covet would have gone down. Yes before covet. I'd say no way We're not that bad. You know like I thought the people aren't that dumb But when I experienced covet, it's it's actually scary. You see how the not sees managed to do what they did You see how they managed to put people in concentration camps. You see it Now I mean, uh, the last part obviously he's getting to a uh an extreme but just the notion of a disappointment in in humanity With how there was a general reaction to covet. I I felt that very acutely as well I I felt it very much about new york city about about my fellow new yorkers at the time Not all of them obviously not the people who were listening to me on radio They were listening to me because I was speaking the truth about how insane new york had gone if co Here's a good question for you buck if covet didn't happen would you be speaking to me from miami right now? Nope Nope Um that I mean it changed so much for so many people I think because There there was also a sense of not just I don't want to be around for the next time They go insane But there was a sense of if I don't do something about this And take my tax dollars away from some of these places Am I really going to be able to just keep complaining about this right? I think a lot of californians had felt that way a lot of new yorkers have felt that way and and it's uh It's something that we're still dealing with and I don't think we've dealt with it very Effectively at all. Um, I think the fact that there hasn't been more of a willingness to have some kind of a You know truth commission. I don't know what you would really call it about everything that happened there But they made a lot of people complicit in it And I think that when rfk jr. Just to bring it full circle when he says he'd be willing to look at Crimes that were committed against people Um that should be the that should be the mentality It should be that we have not gone past this the statute has not run Let's lock some people up over locking millions of people up based on lunacy I 100 agree with all that buck and that's why Do you feel like mit romney would say that do you feel like paul ryan would say that associated with koban I look i'm not i'm sitting there. I don't know I I think that there are tons of people listening to us right now that agreed with everything you say and also We're going to agree with everything I say right here, which is If you got the biggest issue in any of our lives wrong koban was the ultimate test for government in our lives some of you lived through vietnam I did not But the legacy of vietnam lingered for a generation people didn't trust their government They were lied to for vietnam. This is our generation's vietnam And I feel like there are tons of people all over the country around our age buck listening and some older and some younger That want there to be a reckoning so desperately for the lies that we were told that party is swept off in many ways There are lots of things rfk jr. Would say that I would disagree with but mit romney wouldn't say what you just said paul ryan would not say what you just said there are a lot of republicans out there that are just like well We didn't know any better. Let's just move on No, when the government fails And worse than when they fail when they lie to all of us and there is zero accountability My number one issue as an american citizen is I want those people held accountable And I think rfk jr. Would try to do it. I think a lot of republican candidates would but that's my number one issue So I would be willing if you told me hey mit romney who's like, you know pharmaceutical companies are really good Paul ryan who's going to sit around and say you know we need to give tax cuts to johnson and johnson and fizer Because of what they did to get this covet shot ready and rfk jr. Is going to be like f that We need to hold these guys accountable. I'm voting for the guy who says f that we need to hold these guys accountable Of party if that's the choice Very interesting Innovation refunds my friends they've helped thousands of small businesses with their erc tax refunds Are you a small business owner who started filing for the erc tax refund and maybe got stuck halfway Some companies have a super complicated process or don't have anyone with experience to help you navigate that process Innovation refunds hears this all the time and they can help you finish today Even if you started your filing with another company Innovation refunds team of independent tax attorneys are experienced in understanding ways that different kinds of companies can claim tax deductions As a result of the pandemic innovation refunds has been helping eligible businesses claim their erc tax refunds since 2021 And they may be able to help your business too Go to their website innovation refunds dot com to see if you qualify there's no upfront charge They don't get paid unless you get paid call them at 843 refunds.

She is Convinced that america is filled with the dumbest people on the planet because it's not only that she is not a very good communicator herself. It's that she begins with the proposition of I am talking to a not particularly astute kindergartner She talks to the entire american public Like she is a kindergarten teacher and not even a kindergarten teacher for kids that are capable of learning like For kindergarten kids that need Extensive help with basic communication skills and ultimately that's telling on her Way more. I just anyway, we're gonna play that for you Buck I we're talking about rfk jr. In the craziness Did you see? What they are now trans activists have a new name for the vagina I will say the penises and women have vaginas as we memorably learned in kindergarten cop You were talking about uh, Arnold Schwarzenegger earlier the new documentary on Netflix They are trying to introduce a new name in the trans community for The vagina Do you know you have any clue that I tell I'm never if I told you this you told me and I legitimately Thought that you were making it up for a second and just seeing if I would go for it because The it really does see more and more like the the trans activist community It's just trying to see how far they can push the insanity. It's never enough. There's no end to it Well, they're already talking about men who minsterweight and men that's chest feeding now instead of breastfeeding I've I've come across this like looking up, you know basic, you know, medical stuff, you know And you're like, oh like you know, I have like a ring in my ear and you google something And I've come across now on on some of the big medical sites. They'll refer to you know Oh, you should be aware if you're if you're a person who gets a period Of the and you have to take you a moment to process as you go Oh be aware of the following if you're a woman Yeah, they don't want to write woman anymore. Yeah, no, they listen. It's not pregnant woman anymore. It's pregnant person So the new and I can't make this up the new word for vagina That the left is trying to bring to the american public Bonus hole They are I I I I I swear to you. This is true They are now trying to refer to the vagina as a bonus hole Presumably Because everyone has the other hole Women buck don't have a vagina They have a bonus hole I Can't and I know all of you out there like this. What did What in the world is going on? a bonus hole Good luck with that if you if you're if you're going home with the the wife Hoping to get lucky the bonus hole buck Gonna let you take this one out to the end here clay you're you're you're on your own buddy I don't think I don't think that's gonna aid in your romantic aspirations for the evening I just I you you hear some of this stuff buck And I just I can't help but just laugh. I mean I I shared this story online because I wanted to see the comments and they're amazing But what are they doing? They're they're degrading your ability. They're degrading the ability of people to think and speak the truth about anything"
