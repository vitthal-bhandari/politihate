    "text": " Welcome to Rising We Have a Great Friday Show for you today. I'm Jason Nichols. I'm joined at the desk today by the Washington spectators. Amber Aethi. Did I get it right? Aethi? You did. All right. Go ahead. I'm glad that I didn't say Aethi. Amber, great to be with you this morning and it's great to be with all of you. Filling in for Robbie and Brie today, we tied him up. We put him in the basement and we are here today for you. I know you love it. Amber, what's going on? Hey, we've got lots to get into. Up first, President Biden is expected to announce his re-election campaign next week. According to new reporting from the Washington Post, the president and his team are eyeing this upcoming Tuesday, the four year anniversary of Biden's 2020 campaign launch as the big day. Meanwhile, on the other side of the aisle, new Wall Street Journal role polling released today finds former President Donald Trump tops the GOP primary field, even as he faces prosecution in New York. Support for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, who previously enjoyed a narrow lead over Trump in the journals December poll dropped 14 points amongst likely GOP primary voters. He now trails 13 points behind the former president. So what do you make of this? You know, you're the resident conservative. What do you make of this? Yeah, it's interesting. I mean, I first, it seemed like Floridians in particular were really disturbed by President Trump's attacks on Florida Governor Ron DeSantis when he went after him ahead of the midterm elections and after his campaign announcement and tried to flip the script on COVID. But since then, it doesn't seem like DeSantis has gained any momentum whatsoever. And maybe his strategy of kind of sitting back and not responding to Trump has not served him very well. Yeah, I think you have to be a fighter. People are looking for a fighter. And Donald Trump, one of the things that he does really well, even with his issues on COVID and the vaccines and all of that, even when he was criticized by his own base, he stands up to them. He's like, you know, I'm the boss here. And I think people like that. People embrace that. Ron DeSantis comes across us, like I've said this several times, he comes across small. He comes, he's not the biggest guy in the room. You don't look at Ron DeSantis and say, he's our leader. And I think that's why you're seeing a lot of Florida Republicans, Rutherford, Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu, Stu, Byron Donalds, yeah. Byron Donalds, Mass, all these guys who are Florida Republicans. And you know, they were trying to, the DeSantis camp was trying to keep them from endorsing Trump. And they've gone with Trump. And I think it's because Trump has that CEO feel and he's an entertainer. And that's something that you can't, that's in your spinal cord. Yeah, you can't teach that Trump is actually very funny. And DeSantis, I don't think has that same charisma. He's obviously very intelligent. He's very tapped into his policy decisions. He keeps a very small circle, which is one of the things I always criticized Trump for was he was horrible at picking personnel and surrounding himself with the right people. But the things that I'm hearing from conservatives is that when they watch DeSantis try to work like a handshake line, it's just awkward. He doesn't relate to people very well. He's naturally an introvert. And Trump is the exact opposite. He's really good at connecting with people one on one. Yeah, and all of our presidents in recent memory, you go back to George W. Bush, he was not a good speaker. But one of the things anybody I know who's met George W. Bush says, you connect with the guy one on one. Barack Obama is a generational kind of talent in politics. And then even Joe Biden, even with his sniffing the hair and all of that kind of stuff, you shake his hand and he connects with people. And I think that DeSantis just doesn't have it, whatever it is. And I think a lot of Republicans are starting to realize that he's not the guy. And I think maybe he'll have a chance in 2028. That's a possibility. He could be a strong candidate, especially if he's going up against someone like Kamala Harris. I think that's true. These are two people who just are not necessarily good interviewers. We saw DeSantis flub, the whole Ukraine issue, which I think a lot of Republicans saw him as kind of waffling and going on both sides of the fence. So he's kind of, he seems like he's just kind of looking for a lane. He doesn't know where to go. He doesn't want to offend people. And that's the exact opposite of Donald Trump who projects strength. I think against the Kamala Harris, he could do well. But I'm not convinced Kamala Harris is going to be the nominee in 2028, whether Joe Biden wins or loses. So I think he's got a chance down the road. But as you stated, there are certain things you can't teach in politics. And I don't think Ron DeSantis has it. He was lucky to win that Florida race. The first time against Andrew Gillum. Andrew Gillum, I think, for all his issues is an incredibly talented politician. And he was lucky to win that race because we started to see some of those scandals start to bubble to the surface. DeSantis is not one of those talented guys. And he's latched on to the right culture war policies that were popular with Republicans. But they're starting to actually see him and Trump is Trump is the man right now. The other thing that I'm hearing is that in regards to a potential DeSantis campaign is that because of how much of a micro manager he is and how involved he is in every single decision, it's really hard to to grow that type of operation on a national level. I mean, what is he going to be doing? Hopping into every campaign briefing call and asking about exactly how many doors are being knocked in this precinct in Iowa, it's just not feasible to run a national campaign. That way, you have to be willing to offload responsibility to other people. So something that works really well in the governor's office might not work so well when you're trying to run for president. But I wanted to ask you about Biden's ambitions because he's set to announce his reelection campaign. And as bad as I think Biden is and as as low as his polling is, I don't see any other Democrat that could take that that the reins right now. No, I think Biden number one, he's an incumbent. And I think it would be a big mistake for anybody to go against an incumbent president because it makes it seem like your base doesn't have it figured out. You picked the wrong guy. So I've been saying, I know a lot of people and their problems within mainstream Democratic politics, their problem with Biden isn't really his policies. It's his age. That's the big issue. So we look at what Biden has done. And I know that conservatives and many other people are upset with Biden for many things. But when you look at what he's done, he said he was going to be this uniter, right? But we've seen some bipartisan legislation under Biden. So they may not like him, but we got bipartisan infrastructure. We got the Respect for Marriage Act. We got the bipartisan Safer Communities Act, which, you know, we got the first major gun legislation in 30 years. That was broadly popular. I think that Joe Biden actually has a lot to run on. He's been hampered by inflation and by some of the things in the financial sector. But when you look at even his base, which is people like African American voters who are upset, I think, about the lack of action on voting rights and a few other things, he still can tell some of the economic gains that have happened in the fourth quarter of 2022. We saw that African Americans gained the most in terms of wage increases. So I think he has stuff to run on. We're going to see how this all works out. And we'll be back with more rising after this. The U.K. has agreed as a green light to become a member of NATO. This, according to NATO Secretary Jan Stoltenberg, who said this week that all the countries in the transatlantic military alliance have agreed to admit the war-torn country to the club after the war with Russia is over. Here's Stoltenberg speaking with reporters during his first visit to Ukraine since the start of the invasion. Let's take a look. All NATO allies have agreed that Ukraine will become a NATO member. But the main focus now is, of course, on how to ensure that Ukraine prevails. However, German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius said Thursday that the door is open for Ukraine to join. But quote, this is not the time to decide. Here to discuss more on this is Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Davis. Thank you so much for joining us, Colonel. Always my pleasure. Thanks for having me. So is this the right time? It seems like there's a bit of a discussion happening among world leaders as to whether or not this could potentially inflame tensions between the Ukrainian and Russian war. You know, I don't know what Stoltenberg's intent is or what the senior leaders of NATO think is going to be accomplished by making statements like this. I don't know if they think it's going to deter somehow Russia when it hasn't done it for the last 14 years. But this is almost certainly going to have the exact opposite impact. If anything, this will cause Russia to just even more sternly decide that no negotiations are useful and that they need to double down on trying to win their war militarily. Because look, we got to understand that NATO advancement in Ukraine up to the Russian border was one of the major sparks for the war in the first place and to talk about that last year. So I don't think this is a good idea. And interestingly enough, about an hour ago, Viktor Orban of Hungary, a NATO member, when told that all NATO members agreed that Ukraine would become a member of NATO, he said, what? No, I don't think that's the case. So I'm not sure that there's the unity that Stoltenberg is saying there is. So I have a question and that's about Finland and Finland joining NATO. Do you think that that's made a difference for Russia? Are they upset about Finland joining and has that escalated things? Has that played any role in any of this? Well, it certainly has been bad from the Russian perspective. I don't think that Putin ever thought that Finland and Sweden would join NATO. So it's definitely a negative from Russia's perspective and something they miscalculated on. But I don't think that it's going to play too much of a military role because when you look at the literally the military geography of that part of the country, that poses a lot less of a threat and a risk of ground invasion into the Russian territory as the territory in Ukraine would if Ukraine became a NATO member there, which is why they've said that Ukraine is their non-negotiable red line that they won't allow without continuing to fight the war. I was seeing some chatter on social media from people who were convinced that this was Stoltenberg trying to embroil all of these NATO countries into a world war. Do you take that cynical of a view on it or do you think maybe he was just trying to create this unification where it didn't quite exist? I don't think that Stoltenberg or anybody in NATO desires a war with Russia because they know that it would be catastrophic for us and almost certainly lead to nuclear escalation. So I don't think they desire that, but I think there's a bigger problem or at least a compounding problem that I think they believe that by saying these kinds of statements that they can project power, that they can cause hesitation and Moscow. But I mean those efforts have fallen so flat for the last couple of years in particular and throughout this war, I just don't know why to continue doing things that have demonstrated they're not going to work. Well, so I have a two-part question. Number one, does Ukraine right now meet the requirements to join NATO in terms of democracy and protection of minorities? We had heard that they were decades away before the war. Are they any closer? No, they're not. And it's 100% certain that that's not the case that they're any closer now. As a matter of fact, the reason why Viktor Orban is against even talking about extended NATO membership to Ukraine is because of the minorities, the Hungarian minorities in the western part of Ukraine, which are being in his view, they're being abused and they're not having their rights and they're having a lot of their rights taken away. Many of them are being what he says is being pressed, gamed into military service to go fight when they don't want to. So there's a lot of problems with that, but just across the board, I mean by NATO's own founding documents, Ukraine is nowhere near liable to join the alliance or qualify. In any case, there's no way that they do. So, Lieutenant Colonel, I have one final question and that is about, does this, you know, what Stoltenberg said, does this actually empower the Russian propaganda arm and their justification for the war? You know, they've been saying things about NATO and NATO has been a big enemy within the Russian populace. And people were saying that perhaps the war was getting unpopular. Do you think Stoltenberg saying that Ukraine is going to join NATO actually empowers Vladimir Putin with his own people? I don't think that Russia, you know, thinks that the war is going well or that they're against it or whatever. I think most of them are resigned to it, especially if you look at the polls, but this absolutely plays into the theme that the Russian government has been using since the outset that this is not a war between Russia and Ukraine. This is a war between NATO and Russia using Ukraine as a weapon against them. And certainly there's lots of physical evidence to support that view from the Russian perspective in that their economy, we're attempting to destroy it with all these sanctions. We're giving all these weapons targeting information to their enemy ammunition, everything to kill Russian soldiers. So I mean, from their perspective, it very much is a proxy war and that it's NATO against them. And this just helps, I think, fuel that. According to a Washington Post report, the leak of Pentagon classified documents that detail the fight in Ukraine revealed that the United States warned Zelensky that he would not be able to hold on to the city of Bakhmud. But despite the warnings, the grim and grim assessment, Ukrainian forces have managed to keep a hold of this key stronghold. What do you make of this intel? Look, that was the right call. I was saying that I think as far back as December that the reasonable prudent thing for Ukraine was to evacuate from Bakhmud and reset up on unexisting already prepared defensive lines a little bit further to the west from where they could extract a much higher cost on Russia. But the reason why they have held on this far is because they have continued Ukraine has to throw many of their reserves and many of the forces that they had trained for an offensive in the spring or the summer. The intent was for Ukraine to launch an offensive to hit Russia. But by holding on to Bakhmud when it was militarily untenable, they have basically delayed the process, but they have sacrificed up to tens of thousands of troops that they needed for an offensive, which now puts the offensive, either making it have to delay further or making it have a smaller chance of success. So I think that this is going to come back to Biden. Well, thank you so much, Lieutenant. We really appreciate your perspective on this very important issue. More rising after this. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Dick Durbin is asking Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts to testify before Congress. According to The Hill, Roberts is facing pressure from Democratic lawmakers to investigate details surrounding the undisclosed transactions and free trips Justice Clarence Thomas has taken, which were reportedly paid for by Republican billionaire and donor Harlan Crow. Democrats on the Judiciary panel have expressed support for a quote binding code of ethics for scodist justices, which according to The Hill, Roberts did not welcome back in 2011. In a letter to Roberts, Durbin wrote, there has been a steady stream of revelations regarding justices falling short of the ethical standards expected of other federal judges and indeed of public servants generally. These problems were already apparent back in 2011. And the court's decade-long failure to address them has contributed to a crisis of public confidence. The status quo was no longer tenable. The time has come for a new public conversation on ways to restore confidence in the court's ethical standards. I invite you to join in political reports. Durbin said Roberts' testimony on ethics issues would improve public faith in the High Court. Senator Lindsey Graham weighed in on the matter saying, I would support his decision not to come if that's what he wanted to do, The Hill reports. So what do you make of this? Should he come and testify or not? I just feel like this is all big to do about really nothing. The, I mean, the ethics standards have only changed very recently. So a lot of these so-called free trips and things that were happening before friends were not things that he would have necessarily been required to report in the past. And it's pretty common amongst go to justices to have friends in high places. I mean, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, if you were looking at some of the travel that she went on with friends, we didn't really have the same reaction to that when she was alive. Because these people obviously don't get paid. They're not able to have the same level of income that perhaps politicians have or are able to make after they leave Congress. So they end up becoming friends with these people who are able to sort of treat them in these ways. Now, obviously, there's always going to be the question of whether or not this is influencing their ability to be judicious, judiciously impartial. But that would be a question we would have to ask of every justice on the bench, not just Clarence Thomas. No, absolutely. I agree with you on one point. That is that the ethical standards have just kind of been written when it comes to the gifts. And I think most people on the left don't think the gifts were the biggest problem. It's not about what happened in terms of him taking him on vacation and things like that. It was the financial transaction that occurred over the land where he got paid, the real estate. That, of course, dates back to the Nixon era when you had Abe Fortis who got $20,000 from a guy named Wolfson who was a guy on Wall Street. I know it's kind of funny Wolfson Wall Street. But he got that money. He actually gave the $20,000 back. But he was still forced off the court. And when we look at what other federal judges have had to deal with in terms of their ethics, Clarence Thomas not disclosing that is an actual issue. I was with the whole thing about him going on a trip with his friends and even using the private jet. You're allowed to have friends. You're allowed to travel with your friends. If your friend wants to pick up the bill, pick up the tab, that's one thing. It's different when you don't disclose a financial transaction. In addition to that, Harlan Crow has had some business before the court, not directly. But he certainly funds organizations that actually do have business before the court and actually have done business before the court. So could there be some influence peddling? I will say that Clarence Thomas has always been Clarence Thomas in terms of his politics at least since he was in law school. It's not that I think that Clarence Thomas, this may have changed some of his views. I don't think he was a liberal justice and then got some money. And then Harlan Crow took him on a trip and he was like, all right then. And then I always said change. But that is, in my view, an ethical violation based on what we kicked other justices out for in the past and the fact that he should have disclosed a financial transaction, he says he lost money on it. But it doesn't matter. You still have to. Yeah, I mean, so he's amended his form. And this is not uncommon again for scotish justices to amend their filings. Katanji Brown Jackson has had to do it. Ruth Bader Ginsburg has had to do it. She didn't report the sale of a stock, for example. So I mean, this is, I just don't think it's as big of a deal as it's being made out to be based on the historical precedent for it. And even public public, public, which first reported on this lack of disclosure, didn't even write a follow up piece about the amendment or claims like they some major victory against Clarence Thomas. So I don't even think that they are propping it up as this major ethical violation that it's been made out to be in the rest of the press. Again, I think it's all about the rules. First of all, we need to iron out more rules. And that's why I think Chief Justice John Roberts needs to go before Dick Durbin in the Senate and talk about the rules and the ethical rules for the court. Because I think it's not right that you have someone who has a lifetime position for the right who always talks about. And people like Lindsey Graham, who talk about the three letter organizations and the bureaucracy and the unelected bureaucracy. You have basically people who are unelected who have a lifetime position. And they're kind of given free rein to do what they want. And I think that that's really problematic. They need to iron these rules out a little more. And Chief Justice Roberts needs to go before the Senate and talk about what the rules actually are for the Senate, excuse me, for the scotest justices. But I think we can see that this is a violation. And again, based on historical precedent, based on the fact that Abe Fortis was forced off the court for $20,000. Again, $20,000 in the early 70s was a lot more money. But he actually gave the money back, but he was forced out by the president pressured him. Other justices on the court pressured him to vacate his seat on the court. And we see that if this happened to one of the lower federal courts, that person would have been had a serious reprimand or even had to leave the court. And I think that to let just the really powerful judges, the nine of them get away with things that we would punish some other federal judge around the country for, I think sets of really bad precedent. And it's against what a lot of conservatives are saying about these, you know, the three letter organizations, the unelected bureaucracy. I'm all about rules being applied equally. I would say here's the deal that I would want to make. If Chief Justice John Roberts is going to come testify about the new ethics rules, then I also want an update on the investigation into this leaker of the DAWS decision because what's going on with that? We still don't know who that person is. I mean, there's only so many likely suspects, right? So let's do both at the same time. Let's kill two birds with one stone. No, I hear that. But also we have to remember that Alito was talking about that at his private dinners and talking about what he was going to do in terms of DAWS and abortion altogether. So the leaker could be Alito. It could be Alito. Which is really kind of... Well, that would be fun. I don't know. Let's do it. I mean, all of them need to be held accountable. And I'm not just saying that about the conservative justices. You know, I'm talking about if Katarji Brown Jackson does this or Elena Kagan or Sotomayor, if they are, you know, sitting there and getting money and... For sure. Everybody has to disclose. I think we're in agreement on that. All right. Great discussion. We're rising after this. Capitol Hill is up in arms over the debt ceiling fight. According to new reporting from The Hill, both conservatives and moderates are less than pleased about the newly unveiled debt limit bill, leaving party leaders scrambling to shore up votes. Here to break it down for us is The Hill's own congressional reporter, Michael Chanel. Good to be with you, Mikey. Can you break it down for us? Thanks, guys, for having me. Yeah. So essentially what we've been talking about this debt limit, right, for the past three months trying to figure out what's going to happen, how could Democrats and Republicans get on the same page. And for those three months, we've been at a stalemate. We've been at a standstill. Both sides are digging in their heels. But we saw some movement this week. House Republicans introduced their debt limit bill. It's their proposal of what to do with the debt limit as we're creeping up on that summer deadline. And essentially what this would do is it would raise the debt limit by $1.5 trillion or until March, the end of March of next year, whichever comes first. And then it also is paired with what Republicans are saying amounts to $4.5 trillion in spending cuts. Of course, this has been something that House Republicans, specifically conservatives, were pushing for during the speaker's race back in January. And so now those concessions that Speaker McCarthy made, they're coming to term and we're seeing those spending cut proposals. So House Republican leadership is hoping to bring this bill to the floor next week to pass it and then send it to the Senate, where it really has no chance of moving, obviously Senate controlled by Democrats. But the only thing is, it's not an easy path to 218 votes in the House right now, despite the fact that this was a bill crafted by House Republicans. As mentioned, as you guys mentioned, moderates and conservatives both have some misgivings about this bill. Some are saying that they're leaning no. We've even heard a few say there are hard nose, there are still negotiations happening behind the scenes to potentially change the text of the bill to bring more House Republicans on board. But the reason why this is crucial is because House Republicans are working with a very slight majority, right? They can only afford to lose four votes, assuming that all Democrats vote against it, which Hakim Jeffery suggested just this week that that's going to be the case. So again, House Republicans are hoping to bring this to the floor next week. It is not a sure thing that it has the votes. There's going to be a lot of wrangling and negotiating happening behind the scenes in the coming days. Well, meanwhile, President Joe Biden has said that he's only interested in a clean bill to raise the debt ceiling. So even if they are able to hammer out some of these differences within the Republican caucus, what are the chances that anything that goes to the president's desk is going to be signed? Yeah, so that's another part. The short answer is there's no chance, right? But just to back it up even a little more, when we're talking about this Republican bill, it's not even going to get past the Senate. Again, it would be subject to the 60-vote threshold. That would mean that at least 10 Republicans would have to be on board. There's no appetite. I mean, there's no, that would mean that at least 10 Democrats, I'm sorry, would have to come on board. There's no appetite there in the Senate. So really, what this bill is being seen as is the opening salvo in what are going to be these really high stakes negotiations for the debt limit. This is House Republicans' way of saying, this is what we want to see in a debt limit and spending cut proposal. This is what House Republicans would put our way behind. But obviously, the White House is not going to get on board with this. So this is sort of the opening flagpole in the negotiations, and we'll see where we can go from there. The only thing is, is President Biden and Democrats have been adamant that they want a clean debt ceiling increase. They do not want to see spending cuts. Again, both sides are really digging in their heels. There's no indication of what the answer to this issue will be, which I will say has to come soon because analysts and experts have been saying that the debt limit, we will hit the debt limit over the summer. Goldman Sachs came out this week and said that based on tax returns that came in, it looks like we could hit the debt limit early June, which is very early. It's compared to the August, July timeline we were talking about. So lawmakers are going to have to start moving because there's been a warning that the economic effects of a default, which obviously the U.S. has never experienced, could be cataclysmic. So there's going to have to be some movement here. House Republicans are trying to inch that along, but again, both sides are digging in their heels. So where we go from here remains to be seen. So is there a sense that on the from far right Republicans that they think that these negotiations or what Kevin McCarthy is proposing doesn't go far enough? Is that what it is? And moderates want perhaps a little less? Is that where the disagreement lies? Sort of. Yeah, that's essentially broadly speaking what the issue is. So there are some conservative Republicans, Matt Gaetz, Chip Roy. They want stricter work requirements for some of these entitlement programs for things like food stamps and things like Medicaid, Social Security and Medicare, though, are not being touched. They're not included in this bill. So some of those conservative Republicans want the work requirements to be beefed up. But then you have someone like Congresswoman Nancy Mase, who is known to be a moderate within the conference. She's concerned about some energy provisions that are being repealed from the inflation reduction act that House Democrats passed last summer. She said that something like solar energy is really important in her district in South Carolina. So she's voicing some concerns about that. So to get to your point, yes, a lot of the general confines of it is that conservatives want more, moderates want less. But there's one more angle to this is the fact that this bill is 320 pages long. It was just released this week. There are a ton of provisions in it. It's not just that debt ceiling increase. It's also all of the spending cuts. It's other provisions. I mean, HR one, that massive energy package that House Republicans just recently passed, the entire HR one is in this bill. So we're talking about a massive piece of legislation here. A ton of lawmakers are still sifting through the details, trying to figure out where they stand on it. But in terms of the ones who have some misgivings, I spoke to some conservative Republicans this week, they're happy with how negotiations are going. They said that Republican leadership is being receptive to some of their requests. So that's some good optimism that we don't always see on Capitol Hill. But again, in terms of where this goes, they are not at 218 votes yet. So there's going to definitely be more discussions. Meanwhile, here's what White House press secretary, Korean Jean Pierre, had to say on the matter. The way to have a real negotiation on the budget is for House Republicans to take threats of default. When it comes to the economy and what it could potentially do the economy off the table, House Republicans need to get to work and stop the delay and put a bill on the floor that's going to avoid the fault. So it looks like Republicans have now offered something. And then the other question I had as a follow up to Korean Jean Pierre's statement was that last week Speaker McCarthy said that he actually hadn't heard from President Biden. Has that changed? Right. So the last time President Biden and McCarthy met on this issue, specifically a meeting on the debt limit, was back on February 1st. President Biden has said that he is not going to have another conversation about the debt limit until House Republicans released their annual budget, which they have not done. It was meant to come out previously, but it's been delayed. They've sort of been kicking that can down the road. So yeah, President Biden, Speaker McCrudden, they've met on different matters. They took part in a St. Patty's Day event together on Capitol Hill. But in terms of meeting specifically on the debt limit, no, they have not. And just recently this week, there was a phone conversation between President Biden, Chuck Schumer and Akim Jeffries. And there was a readout from the White House afterwards, and they called on House Republicans to, let's deal with the debt limit, let's pass a clean debt limit increase. And then we can talk about budget negotiations later, because again, that's going to be a thing as we move into the fall when we are closer to the end of the fiscal year. So yeah, I mean, again, this just gets back to the main idea that both sides are being very, they're being very adamant about their positions. We're entering into a massive game of chicken that has serious implications for the economy. But again, over House Republicans are trying to move it a little forward, but we'll see if they have the votes to do that. All right. Well, we'll definitely have to hear more about this, Mikey. Thank you for coming on, and we'll be back with more rising. This Supreme Court is expected to decide by tonight whether a commonly used abortion pill should continue to be accessible. The Biden administration had requested an emergency stay to keep the Food and Drug Administration's approval of the pill, Miffa Pristone, in place. A lower court banned it, but just as Samuel Alito put the brakes on that court's ruling. Meanwhile, Donald Trump's campaign made it clear the former president does not support a national abortion ban. The former president and 2024 GOP presidential candidate believes that abortion should be decided at the state level. Trump's stance drew ire from anti-abortion advocates. The leading organization on the matter, Susan B. Anthony Pro-Life America, called his position morally indefensible. The group's president said in a statement that, saying the issue should only be decided at the state's as an endorsement of abortion up until the moment of birth. Even brutal late-term abortions in states like California, Illinois, New York, and New Jersey. So, what do you think about this? Is this going to be trouble for Donald Trump? I think it's trouble across the GOP. I don't think anyone knows how to talk about this issue in a way that straddles that line between being pro-life and also recognizing that polling doesn't really reflect that Americans necessarily agree with the most pro-life individuals on the issue of abortion. Most Americans do agree with restrictions, especially on late-term abortions. But, for example, when Governor Ron DeSantis signed this bill in Florida last week, banning abortion after six weeks, that's not a popular position. So, I think what Trump is probably trying to do is say, look, I'm pro-life, but I want citizens to be able to decide how they feel about abortion. I understand the backlash from pro-life groups because, look, if you believe abortion is murder, as I do and as they do, then there's no gray area that you're going to be happy with. Right. And it's interesting, you know, I think on the left, people are going to play ads of Donald Trump in 2015 saying that he thought people who sought abortion should be punished. And, of course, that's not going to bode well with young voters, with college-educated women. They're not going to like the fact that he was basically saying, you should be punished if you try to get an abortion. I also think that the organization that we just talked about, them saying that in New York and California, you can get a late-term abortion, that is not really true. So, I looked it up and I see that New York's Reproductive Health Act allows practitioners to perform an abortion on a patient who is 24 weeks or more away from the start of pregnancy if the fetus is not viable or the abortion is necessary to protect the patient's life or health. So, again, this idea that there are these liberal states where you can get an abortion at nine months pregnant is not really factual. Most cases, it's about viability, and if you find out later on that they're not viable, then you can terminate a pregnancy. Yeah. Some of these laws are tricky though because in some of the cases, when you look at the actual language of the bill, for example, the one that was being proposed in Virginia, what they define as health of the mother is actually quite vague. And so, they do open up the possibility for if you find the right doctor, they will perform the abortion for you even if your life isn't actually at risk. Sometimes they'll cite, for example, potential emotional damage stemming from the pregnancy as a reason to flush the fetus out for protecting the mother's health. So, it's a case-by-case basis. There are instances where these bills do in fact keep that language very vague intentionally so they can still perform the late-term abortions while claiming that they're doing it in rare instances. Well, see, the interesting thing about that is I don't know, and I know a lot of people on the left, and I don't know a lot of people on the left who believe that abortion is okay by choice after viability. Now, viability for many is before 24 weeks. It's more about, it's more like 20 weeks where- Yeah, because it's changing because that's based on a scientific question of how early we can keep a baby alive outside of the womb, which has gotten earlier and earlier as our technology has advanced. Yeah, no, absolutely. And so, it's, you know, the estimates that I've seen have been about 20 weeks. And most people say, you don't even know, you may not even know you're pregnant within six weeks. I mean, that's such a short window of time, and it doesn't give women an opportunity. And so, it's basically an abortion ban in Florida. And most women, particularly, as I said, those college-educated women who decide elections because they're kind of swing voters, swing voters in Pennsylvania. I think Florida's pretty solidly read now, but at one point, they would swing states like Florida. They're not happy about things like this. And calling it, by the way, that six-week bill, they're calling that fetal heartbeat bill is a misnomer. I just want to say that, you know, the science- Are you going to say that the heartbeat's just the chemical waves going through the baby? Well, here's what I'm going to say is that- Is that what- That was what the- Was it the Planned Parenthood president? Well, I'll say this. Well, they're not completely wrong about that. And I will say that at six weeks, you're not even a fetus. You're an embryo. So, calling it a fetal heartbeat is a misnomer because it's not a fetus. And also, you don't have a fully formed heart. That is a fact at six weeks. So, calling it a fetal heartbeat when you don't have a heart and you're not a fetus is definitely a misnomer. I definitely understand why somebody who believes that abortion is murder, you are alive at the point of conception. I wonder, and I guess my question I have several questions for a lot of pro-life people. But my first question is, and I think that the GOP would be better served if they actually address this. And that is, if they started to talk about things like maternal death, which is a big problem in black communities, if the GOP actually went out and said, we have a plan to curb this because this is a problem. They could actually make some end rules. And infant mortality, which is highest in those states that actually banned abortion. So, these are, you want to say, late-term abortions. That's a super late-term abortion because people are children are dying after they are born. And Republicans haven't really addressed that. Well, I think we can walk and shoot gum at the same time. There's a common, well, I think there's a common misconception that pro-life people only care about unborn children. And it's just not true. If you look at basically any statistic that talks about resources going to pregnancy centers, to daycare centers, to religious charities that help women who have just given birth, particularly single mothers, the vast majority of that funding comes from pro-life individuals and Christian individuals. It's not coming from the people on the left who love to yell at pro-lifers and say, you only care about a child before it comes out of the mother's womb. It's just not true. Yeah, well, I think it's part of that is aided by, you know, there was all this will-adopt-your-baby, don't abort your baby. And they do adopt more children than- Yeah, but there are 400 other- There are 400,000 children in foster care. Foster care is a different situation. So, yes, those are children. I understand that, but what I'm saying is that there's a difference in where foster children are allowed to be placed. You don't just get the volunteer to take in a foster child, in most cases. They usually- We absolutely can. But most of the foster children that are in foster care right now are actually not able to be placed with these volunteer families because they have familial connections that they're attempting to get them connected with. So- Yeah, I think that there are- Particularly with older children, as we've seen in Washington, D.C., I'm sure you remember Wednesday's child. Do you remember that when they used to come on television, where they were always trying to get them- That might have been before my time. Might have been before your time. But they would try to get children homes and get them adopted. And yet, we don't see Republicans actually going out and trying to attack these issues for the health of mothers and for the health of their children. But this is a topic that we could debate forever- Sure, we could. And we could have a discussion about- We didn't even get to talk about what's it called, Miff or Pristone- Yeah, Miff or- How all the statistics about how it's safe are totally false. Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. It's been around for 20 years. But either way, what hasn't been around for 20 years is rising and we'll be back with more of it. There's a big difference between talking and reporting, especially right now with a fire hose worth of news coming your way. You know what helps? Having reporters in the field. I'm Brad Milke from ABC News, and that's what we've got on ABC's Daily Podcast Start Here. Every morning, Start Here takes you across the country and around the world for a quick, smart look at the stories that matter. It's fast, it's straightforward, and sometimes gasp. News can even be fun. So let's meet up tomorrow morning. Listen to Start Here, wherever you get your podcasts. Summer air travel is expected to be even more of a hellscape than normal, with a lack of staff compounded with rising prices and continuous delays. Disaster is looming ahead. Here to help us break it down exactly how dire the situation is. Is news nation Washington correspondent Evan Lambert? Evan, welcome. And what's going on with summer air travel? Yeah, thank you for having me. And I'm so sorry for the bearer of bad news, right? But there are a lot of factors that are coming together to potentially make this situation with air travel this summer. Pretty parry, pretty bumpy to use a pun, right? So it's a factor, a couple factors that are all kind of coming together at the same time. So first you've got this shortage of air traffic controllers and of pilots. And because of that, the FAA has allowed airlines to cut back some of their summer schedules. And so you have fewer flights that's likely to drive up prices. So that's one thing that people might be dealing with, but also that demand, right? So coming out of the pandemic, everybody wants to go somewhere. We saw that last summer. That's likely to happen again this summer. So TSSA, he says that it is expecting record screening demand, people going through those checkpoints. So that's something that they are going to be pairing for. But you might expect delays while you're waiting to go through security as well. And then if you are planning any kind of international trip, and even if you don't have one scheduled, this is where you might want to pay attention, right? So the State Department says that it's processing times for people either renewing passports or getting new passports are at really an all time high. It's at 10 to 13 weeks of processing time to get a passport. And that just compares in February, it was at six to nine. So you can see that it is increasing. And that doesn't even count the time for you to send things in and get some of those things back. So it could be a very long time to get a passport. Of course, there are some options to expedite it. But even if you think at some point you might go somewhere internationally, you probably should get a passport now, even if you don't have a trip planned. Well, I'm definitely feeling very grateful that my passport is up to date. Evan, what is behind the staff shortages that you were mentioning with pilots and flight crews? Is that just leftover from the pandemic? Does that have anything to do with vaccine mandates? What's driving that? Essentially, it seems to be leftover from the pandemic. So we just really saw that problem get worse and worse coming off of when really there weren't a lot of flights going anywhere because of the shutdowns and the health procedures, right? So you had a lot of older pilots retiring. And then what's unique to air travel and to pilots and their requirements, they have to retire at age 65. And so there's really not this pipeline of younger pilots in the numbers compared to some of the older pilots. So that's that's causing that problem as well. And so there had been some talk among airlines in the FAA. There was a proposal to or I should say is a proposal to raise the retirement age to 67 instead of 65. But that hasn't been resolved. So you're just kind of seeing those problems continue to happen with the air traffic controllers, similar thing carry over from the pandemic. And it really might take months and months to see any of that improve. There is money in President Biden's proposed budget for 2024, $25 billion in the transportation secretary had been talking about this to hire more air traffic controllers to fix some of the technical problems that they've had with the notice to air missions system that caused some problems. If you'll remember earlier in the year widespread delays and grounding of flights believe that was in January. So both of those things, both the air traffic controller shortage and some of these technical updates depend on that money in the 2024 budget. And as you know, it's going to be months before any semblance of a budget passes. So it's something that certainly is going to affect people through the summer, but potentially even longer. So Evan, I want to ask you about TSA. Are lines going to be longer? Is it going to be more difficult to get through security because of what's going on in the shortages? Are they suffering just like the airlines in terms of staffing? I think maybe it's a little bit less for TSA of a staffing problem and more of just this pre pandemic demand coming back and even maybe surpassing. So the TSA administrator spoke to Bloomberg, I believe it was just a few days ago and said that they're really predicting what could turn out to be record demand this summer as far as people hopping on flights. So you're going to see that reflected in the length of the lines. So obviously, if you have TSA pre check, that might save you a little bit of time. If you are considering it, you might want to get it to try to cut off some time in those lines. And the administrator, TSA administrator said, look, they are preparing for it. They're going to do their best, but they're kind of just laying out the expectation out there that people might need to be patient. So you could definitely see those long lines this summer as you're trying to get to your destination, hopefully for vacation. So what are some of the other recommendations besides maybe TSA pre check if people have to fly this summer to make their trip go a little bit more smoothly? I mean, I think it's just right setting the expectations. So you might have delays in the flight schedules. You might see higher prices because of the shortages of some of the summer schedules that the airlines are implementing to deal with some of some of this and just on the passport front. Even if you don't have international trip scheduled, you might want to think about getting the passport. If you know that you've got somewhere to be at a specific time you have a trip booked or you might just want to pay for the expedited handling of the passport, that's directly through the state department. I believe it's about $60 and that will cut off several weeks to that process. I want to share a story. So there's a friend of mine that I know in TV news, she was getting married at a destination wedding in Mexico and her mom did not have a passport, was going through the process and it really came down to the line. She almost missed the wedding and I was just really invested in that social media post about this. Was she going to make it? Thank goodness her mom did make it. They actually made a last ditch effort through their congressman's office to try to get things sped up. So that is something that you can also do as well. If you're facing that deadline where you think you might miss a trip, reach out to your senator, to your representative and see if they can make a phone call and try to get something moving a little bit faster. I'm not even really quite sure how they do that but that's definitely an option where people can reach out to them and in this case it really helped and made my friend's destination wedding. So how much of this falls on P. Buttigieg? We saw what happened in with Southwest and the fallout from that. How much can people point the finger at DOT and at P. Buttigieg? Yeah, I mean, look, that's a popular talking point and it's easy to go after the people that are in charge there right now. They're just responding to it and saying that they're going to do everything they can. That's why they're pushing the money, there's $25 billion that's in President Biden's budget that is supposed to go directly toward travel to air traffic controllers to improving some of these systems that we've seen have technical problems and cause grounding of flights and delays. But a lot of it does rest on the airlines themselves as well. So a bit of shared blame here. They've got to deal with air staffing issues, get people hired and trained. And it's from what I've been reading really is just this lack of people that want to be pilots or or young pilots. The makeup of most pilots are it's kind of a second career for them. So with the pilot shortage specifically, maybe it's a change in culture where we've got to get younger people more interested in doing that at an earlier age because we're facing all these problems with this mandated retirement age. And that proposal to extend it to 67 might pass at some point and might help when it comes to that. But just many things that are all just happening at the same time that make for potentially some problems this summer when it comes to traveling and flying. Well Evan, let me just say I hope you get an opportunity to fly out and get a vacation and get some some sun and get a tan. Thank you so much. We'll be back with more rides. The charges have been dropped against actor Alec Baldwin for his role in the fatal shooting on the set of his film Rust cinematographer, Helena Hutchins was killed when a prop gun that Baldwin was holding fired a live round. He was originally accused of extremely reckless acts and charged with manslaughter. Prosecutors in the case say charges against Baldwin may be refiled in that their follow up investigation will remain active and ongoing. Baldwin has resumed the filming of Rust this week 18 months after the shooting according to the Telegraph. The production will take place at the Yellowstone Film Ranch in Montana. The original production took place in New Mexico where the Rust movie productions reached a settlement with state workplace regulators last month quote over serious violations to telegraph reports. All right. Are you surprised that the charges were dropped? No because it seems like they're continuing to investigate. And they want to get more evidence. So it's kind of a temporary thing. It seems like they really want to get them. So I'm not at all shocked that they dropped these charges for the time being but they're making it clear that they're not saying that he's not guilty of a crime and that they may revisit this and that they're continuing to investigate. So if I'm Alec Baldwin, I'm not you know I'm not feeling like I'm home free at all. I don't know him and his wife posted this cozy Instagram after the announcement was made. So maybe they're feeling a little sigh of relief but I agree. I hope they continue to investigate because here's the thing. Anytime a gun is in your hand, you are responsible right? I mean I have heard from numerous Hollywood actors and people who've worked in the entertainment industry in the aftermath of this shooting. And the thing that they consistently say is yes it is the armors job to make sure that they are not live rounds on set. But it's also the person who is ultimately pulling the trigger to double check their work. You should always be making sure that that gun is either unloaded or loaded with blanks before you sit there and pull the trigger. Yeah I think they're also you know some of the culpability lies on him because he's the producer. Like this is his film. And so if there are live rounds on set ultimately the guy at the top is the one who is responsible. And Alec Baldwin clearly failed here. Now is he criminally liable? That I don't know. I think Helena Hutchins family certainly should hold him civilly liable. They certainly should sue Russ Productions and he's actually reigniting this film. I don't know why are they still filming right? I mean I feel like it's kind of a slap in the face to her family to even continue production on this. I mean yeah okay you spend a lot of money you want to finish the movie whatever but people somebody die on set. I mean how do you keep going after that? I can't imagine morale is particularly high on the set right? I mean it seems like it's almost in poor taste to do so. And I wasn't going to watch it anyway to be honest with you. I'm not into like modern westerns but I don't think I could watch a film like this knowing what what occurred. Well and the sad thing is there are a lot of people who probably feel the exact opposite way who want to watch it because of the scandal surrounding the movie. And that's another piece of this that adds to that icky feeling which is they're profiting off of this tragedy because this movie received so much more publicity than it would have otherwise if Helena Hutchins hadn't been killed on set. Yeah do you think Alec Baldwin has reached out to Helena Hutchins family? Do you think he's like because I haven't heard him make any public statements about it really. I think he had the one tearful apology or public statement maybe but I don't know if he's reached out to her family privately. I certainly hope so but yeah I don't know he's just kind of known for being kind of a distasteful guy in the industry. Nobody really seems to like him that much. He apparently has a history of being kind of gruff and rude on set. Yeah so it's. That's kind of a media thing though. I mean yeah I mean I don't know if it's true. I don't live in Hollywood but that's just what they say. Yeah I mean even even in our media realm there are some gruff people out there who are not necessarily they could not get away with it at my day job like talking to people a certain way. I've been on set with certain people. Some people we probably know probably in common. I'm like if you were anywhere else like there's no way you'd be out on your backside. There's no way you could talk to your subordinates the way that you do in media and that includes Hollywood. But I mean he's he may be I don't know if he's a good guy I don't know if he's a bad guy but I know that he bears some responsibility in this. Whether it's criminal responsibility I'm not saying that. I don't know if he deserves to go to jail but he certainly should make things right with Helena Hutchins family. Yeah and we do know that there are still the charges against the armor who I think is the primary person to put blame on because again that's the person that is responsible for checking all of these weapons making sure there aren't live rounds on set and if I remember correctly the original reporting was that the armor and some of the other individuals who handled the firearms on the movie set had gone out to the shooting range the gun range the day prior and that was how the live rounds got back into the set which is so irresponsible right. Yeah what the heck. I mean that's there's no excuse for that really. Can you put gunshots in in post-production like there's so many amazing things that you can do in post-production I can't imagine that you that you can't make a gunshot look real in post-production without actually even having to fire a blank because my understanding is that blanks aren't they don't come without risk risk. You're still risk when you fire a blank it's still shooting a perj until you're ready to shoot and I don't know it's just such a weird culture in Hollywood that you have this slate of anti-gun celebrities who have no problem like wheeling and dealing with firearms on a movie set and unfortunately I wonder if it's led to this mindset where everybody else is responsible for handling the weapons and we just do what we're told and pull a trigger whenever they tell us to maybe that's what possibly led to Alec Baldwin being a bit negligent here I don't know I don't know I don't want to necessarily say that you have to believe in gun ownership or firearm ownership and you know in order to have a gun in a movie no but you should educate yourself right. Absolutely and and I mean isn't that the the armors job like they they are supposed to educate people who are handling firearms how to operate them safely and certainly not mix in live rounds I mean that's that's just insane and it's tragic my heart goes out to lina hutchin's family I mean that's it's it's really heartbreaking but we'll be back with more resin and he was that that was six-year-old kensley white one of three victims that 24-year-old robbert robert louis singletary allegedly shot after a basketball rolled into his yard the suspect was caught in hillsborough county florida after fleeing from where the incident took place in charlotte north carolina it's unclear what prompted singletary to unload a barrage of bullets on kids and neighbors but according to neighbors he had yelled at children before and they tell cnn singletary was new to the neighborhood and appeared to dislike kids this is not singletary's run-in with the law police revealed that he was charged in december with assault and kidnapping for allegedly attacking his girlfriend charges on that case are still pending what is wrong with people i mean that's the the bottom line on this story yeah it's disgusting i mean how how could you see a little girl running into your yard i think it's ever appropriate to shoot at her yeah i mean i think it's we have some serious issues in our country with with people with mental health issues and and violence i do want to make it clear that most people with mental health concerns are non-violent so i know a lot of times it's like it's mental health it's mental health there are lots of mentally ill people i know people who have mental illnesses and all of them that i know are non-violent and the majority of mentally ill people are not violent but you do have people like this um who go and shoot at not only at the child and they also shot at her parents right and in addition it's over a basketball you know and and we see another guy in another case where he shot some kids who had made a wrong turn and drove up his driveway of course we have Ralph Yarl who got shot for knocking on a door you know without any questions and he shot him through the glass sliding glass door didn't even you know see what was going on ask questions i think that one of the things that we do need with these people with mental health issues and and of course their charges are pending with with this assault that single terry is being investigated for um i think one of the issues is we do need red flag laws there are people out there who commit violent acts and still have access to firearms and that's the case in north carolina where this actually occurred yeah i mean i definitely think an assault should obviously preclude you from having a firearm but the concern about red flag laws is as you mentioned there are tons of people who have mental illnesses who are non-violent right and i'm concerned that the law would treat all people with mental illness equally and use that as an excuse to take away their second amendment right yeah we actually agree on that um i think you know if we're gonna say that the second amendment is a constitutional right you can't take away people's constitutional rights because they have a disability exactly you know so i i agree with that but if you have committed a violent crime oh yeah you know of course for a long time there was the boyfriend loophole where you know which again this would actually qualify where somebody has been accused of a or convicted of a you know a domestic assault and they were still able to get weapons and then a lot of times they would end up killing their girlfriends or their wives um i think that we do need for people who have been convicted of crimes in their lots of states including north carolina that don't have red flag laws because some people in the gun lobby believe that any gun control measure is on a put on us on a path towards total disarmament which i think is a disingenuous argument i mean i think owning a gun uh is like you know it's a privilege in some ways it's a right and others comes with a responsibility absolutely um i mean everyone who owns a firearm should be taking care to know understand how to use it to understand gun safety rules i mean i advocate for everybody who buys a firearm to make sure that you're taking training classes um but the other thing that should they be required i'm sorry to interrupt but i'm um i'm wondering you're not sure no no serily because you know i learned from my parents how to how to handle firearms and and i went out hunting with my dad when i was a young kid maybe seven years old and i understood firearm safety because i learned from him i did have to take a hunter safety course before i went out on junior hunt day but the idea that i wouldn't have been able to shoot with my dad in my backyard until i took a class i don't think it's quite right um so it's i mean there's some nuance to the situation but the other thing that is crazy about this is the fact that this guy had such a serious charge in terms of the assault on his girlfriend and he was out like roaming free i mean i think there needs to be a conversation about how we uh how we decide which people are let out on bail and which people stay in jail until they go to trial because i feel like if you are accused of a serious violent crime like this it's kind of crazy that he's just going about his day like having a firearm that he can wave around now now the firearm part we agree on but the only thing is that you know in the interest of civil liberties a person hasn't been convicted they've been accused and i think you know if we start saying hey you have to stay in jail but then you could use that same argument for whether or not you can take away his guns right because he's only been accused so it's you have to find that balance between the civil liberties and not unfairly targeting people who have been falsely accused of a crime but also making sure that you're protecting public safety and that's a very fine line to balance i think a temporary temporarily taking away when someone's been accused of a violent crime temporarily taking away their firearms because you think just like if you go to jail they're going to take away your belt you think they may do harm it's a possibility they could do harm to themselves or to other people i think that that's different than saying you must stay incarcerated we're going to lock you up you know when you haven't been convicted by a jury of your peers i think that you know those are two different things and one is you know punitive and the other is in the interest of of public safety and of course if somebody has shown themselves to be dangerous and they've gone before a judge and the judge says we can't even risk having you out on the street that person should stay incarcerated but i think that you know speaking of going down a path i think that if we start taking away civil liberties in that way where it's like you have to stay locked up it could send us on a dangerous path yeah i'd be curious to know what evidence they actually have in this case because of course that plays into it as well i mean did the girlfriend come in you know covered in bruises and whereas there's video evidence because that of course all plays into whether or not someone stays in in jail pending trial but i mean going back to the idea of like what has to be in your mind to do something like this it seems like over the past five years and i'm sure the pandemic and the lockdowns accelerated a lot of this people are just like revved up it feels like something has changed where people are much quicker to jump to some kind of nuclear option when they're dealing with disagreements or situations where they claim to feel unsafe and that's something deep in our culture and our society that has to be addressed as well yeah i totally can can see where you're coming from with that i do think violent crime is not nearly what it was in in like the late 80s early 90s so i wouldn't want to jump to a conclusion that we are somehow more violent than we were then well i just mean like but when you look at for example mass shootings i mean we've had guns have been an intricate part of american society for the country's entire existence but it seems like only the past 20 to 30 years that these mass shootings have started to become more common so there's something psychologically that has changed in our culture to make them more common and then on the violent crime issue yes violent crime is down from the 90s but over the past three years particularly when the lockdown started it has spiked to levels that we haven't seen since that time and in particular quite there random random violent crime is up which is you know when strangers attack strangers so and carjacking syrup which are uh truly to murders according to the Brennan Center which is a of course a public safety think tank so i mean there's real real issues with crime right now yeah no and one of the things we do know according to the DOJ when it comes to mass shooting 77 percent of mass shooters obtain their firearms legally but we got to wrap and say we'll be back with more rising after this how's republicans have passed the bill banning transgender women and girls from school sports teams expanding the debate around transgender athletics to a national scale the bill is titled the protection of women and girls in sports act and was sponsored by representative greg soupy of florida it was passed in a party line 219 to 203 vote and according to the hill it is the first quote stand-alone bill to restrict the rights of transgender people considered in the house the legislation would amend title nine to recognize sex as quote based solely on a person's reproductive biology and genetics at birth i think it's probably no surprise Jason that i am in huge support of this bill um i played sports all throughout you know my young life i played club sports in college and i actually played on teams that were mixed gender so when i was at george town our club field hockey team was allowed to have men on it because it's not a very popular sport for men in the united states and even then we had rules that you could only have two men on the field at a time as a recognition that there's a basic unfairness because of the mismatch of biological advantages that exist between the sexes yeah so it's interesting that you say that i mean i i was looking at something by a guy named dr eric valene and he is someone who advises the nc double a and he's saying that a lot of these rules are not grounded in science now i'll say this i'm not when it comes to transgender young people i'm much more concerned with other issues than sports i'm concerned with things like suicide i'm concerned with bullying i'm concerned with homelessness those are the issues when it comes to transgender people that i'm much more concerned with than whether they play sports and as a matter of fact um transgender people make up about 0.4 percent of the population and of that 0.4 percent there are estimates that um about 1.8 of them you know 1.8 of school children now identify as trans i don't i think that's an overestimate right but let me just say trans the trans kids that play sports that's 12 percent let's just give it let's call it 1.5 percent 12 percent of that 1.5 are trans athletes so this is not some big sweeping issue where you're seeing it everywhere and as a matter of fact we can take a place like utah in the state of utah there are four transgender athletes out of 75 000 athletes at the k-12 level it may not be a big issue but it's an issue that matters on the individual level to those girls who are missing out on going to their state championship okay who are not able to stand up on the podium because they were beaten the swimming pool by by a man that matters to them right and that's an issue of basic unfairness and the other part of this that i think conservatives actually don't talk about enough is the safety aspect and i mean that in two two ways one safety on the field if you're playing a team sport and you're up against someone who has this massive biological advantage of strength and speed it is far more likely for a woman to get hurt in that situation i've seen it firsthand on the field hockey field these guys are running through women like it's nobody's business because the level of athleticism is just so different and then there's the issue in the locker rooms because you have women on track teams in the north east who are talking about how they're in the locker room with someone who is having an erection while they're changing and the school tells them actually you're the problem and you need to pick a different locker room if you have a problem with it because this person says that they're a woman i'm not okay with that yeah well we're talking about girls not not women for the most part we're talking about girls and boys not women and men but i'll say this so there are a couple of things number one going back to that that doctor eric valene he talks about people talking about a biological advantage and that depends on the sport so for example you know men are generally and boys are generally taller so that you might have an advantage in swimming of course we had lee at Thomas she's six five she's got a six five wingspan she's going to have a little bit of advantage even though she lost a lot of those races she won a couple of them but she lost many of them as well but in a sport like gymnastics it actually doesn't benefit you to be a man so a lot of this depends upon the sport the other thing that i'll say is a lot of people you know this has gone both ways because there was a trans male athlete born female her name was mac bag or his name excuse me it was mac bag and he was four he yes he was forced to keep yourself up there i know it's confusing no it is it is i mean we we learned we learned language a particular way we learn our pronouns in a particular way but i'm not going to disrespect mac and mac was forced to compete against the girls mac wanted to compete against boys in in wrestling and ended up winning a state championship against girls because they wouldn't let him compete against boys and people were upset either way it was there was somebody who was upset that this person was able to compete against girls so it's really a lot of it sometimes comes down to winning and when the ap reached out to state leaders in a lot of these places that have banned transgender athletes they asked them do you have any examples of any trans athletes in your state so states like tennessee they asked jim justice in west virginia i interviewed governor christy noem uh in south dakota and what you found was none of them could cite any examples of trans athletes they're just like talking about well it could happen one day i mean i suppose you could buy snow plows for phoenix because it could snow one day but this is not really an issue it hasn't been an issue and even in the states where they do have trans athletes they're so rare a lot of young trans people would rather you know do makeup tutorials you know then you know then actually play a sport um again louisiana banned trans athletes there are no known trans athletes in the state so i think this is when we're talking about trans issues on the on the left and the right we should be concerned on the ones that are actually causing people harm causing people to die a lot of that comes down to like i said suicide um a lot of it comes down to homelessness a lot of it comes down to bullying those are the issues that i'm most concerned with but when we're talking about these sports issues it's it's a very effective thing as we you and i discussed it's very effective because it takes away this kind of feminist argument from the left and kind of puts it on the right where they're saying they're protecting women and girls and the left hasn't really come up with a response for it but i kind of air on the side of you know kind of i guess the libertarian or classical liberal kind of response where it's kind of like all right like you know i'm not really offended by trans athletes playing sports i think there's a woman and as a former female athlete and as a young girl who was in those locker rooms i just find it to be so obvious that on the issues of fairness and safety and respect for women's faces biological men shouldn't be in there it's inappropriate and this issue goes beyond sports too it's a question of should biological men be housed in women's prisons there have been cases where women yeah and then that's the same idea of having that ability to have privacy from members of the opposite sex there's been cases where biological men have gone into saunas or gyms and been in the women's locker room and consistently women are told that our instinct to feel unsafe in that situation is wrong and there's a wonderful book called the gift of fear and it talks about how we have these gut instincts and this ability to protect ourselves from potentially unsafe situations and we are teaching young girls right now to ignore that gut instinct when a biological man comes into their private space and that could have really dangerous effects for them later in life when they are refusing to listen to that thing in their head that's innate that says this is not right yeah i think um you know early in my teaching career i used to talk to some of the football players and they would be afraid of a gay athlete in their locker room now it's not even an issue they don't even think about you know that the fact that someone could be gay or someone could be sexually attracted to them now it's not an issue and when we talk about people being afraid when it comes to sexual assault women get sexually assaulted by straight men in most cases and girls get sexually assaulted by straight men in most cases it's not trans people when it doesn't bear out in the same boat but let's actually move on this is a really good conversation and it's one that we're not going to resolve today but you know um we have to actually talk about what's going on next week on rising robbie and brie will be back with you to break down all of the twitter drama that went down today this was fun amber i love these conversations we're definitely going to have to do this together again very soon thank you so much absolutely i really enjoyed it be sure to like share and subscribe so you never miss any content and for those of you who like to
