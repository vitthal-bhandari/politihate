    "text": " And now, the world's most exciting podcast, The Savage Nation, home of borders, language, culture. Here he is, Michael Savage. Dr. Gress, a pleasure to have you on the Michael Savage podcast, and you new book The End of Woman House Smashing the Patriarchy has destroyed us. I've heard that phrase for so many years. Up the patriarchy, it started, as I know in my lifetime, with Bella Abzug. How far back does it really go, Dr. Gress? Well, it certainly predates Bella. It actually goes all the way back to the 1780s, 1790s, with Mary A. Wallstonecraft. That's where I started my research. And it just like snowball keeps building and building and building. And please tell us who that is in the 1780s. I wasn't around then. People think I was, but I wasn't. So Mary Wallstonecraft is considered the grandmother, godmother of feminism. She wrote this work called The Vindication of the Rights of Woman. And she's writing at the time of the French Revolution and very much inspired by Thomas Payne and a lot of the radicals at that time. Her husband was actually a man named William Godwin, who was really one of the first anarchists and promoters of getting rid of marriage and all of these kinds of things. So they're very much part of the romantic movement, philosophical movement. But her idea was really to get rid of any kind of hierarchy. And she was really moving towards a egalitarian ideal. Savage. Michael Savage, a host like no other. Did you know that last month the G20 announced a plan to impose digital currencies and digital IDs on their respective populations? That's right. Central bank digital currencies essentially allow the government to track every single purchase that you make. Listen carefully, they could even allow officials to prohibit you from purchasing certain products or easily freeze or seize part of all of your money. It's crazy. In essence, they enable the government to take more control over your finances, every dollar you spend concerned Americans are right now diversifying their assets into physical gold with the help of Birch Gold Group, the only gold company I trust. If you want a physical asset held in a tax sheltered retirement account, I want you to call Birch Gold. For yourself, would you please text Savage to 989-898, text Savage to 989-898, text Savage to 989-898, and they'll send you a free info kit on gold. What do you got to lose? The easiest way to become a Birch Gold customer? It's simple. If you have an IRA or a 401k from a previous employer, just gathering dust, Birch Gold can help you convert it into an IRA in gold. And you don't pay a penny out of pocket. Please, text Savage to 989-898, text Savage to 989-898, and you're going to get a free info kit on gold. Then call them because if digital currency becomes a reality, would it be nice to have some real gold to fall back on? I am very serious about this. You ought to be too. Birch Gold is the only gold company I trust. Right now, text Savage to 989-898, free call, text Savage to 989-898, and you're going to get a free info kit on gold. Text Savage to 989-898, because if digital currency becomes a reality, it'll be nice to have some gold to fall back on. And Birch Gold is the only gold company I trust. So please, text Savage to 989-898 right now. Don't you agree with me that overthrowing the patriarchy was an attempt to introduce a matriarchy? Yeah, well, I mean, we get to that for sure. Absolutely, that comes another century later. It takes a hundred years. So wait, 100 years the matriarchy arises in the form, let's say, of Hillary Clinton. Let's pick her as a matriarchy. That's 200 years later. Okay, so going ahead now, here we are with trans women athletes, women themselves, and now considered to be the problem. Drag queens, as you say, performing obscene parodies of women, females and slave from men's pleasure. Where is feminism today? I don't know where it is, Dr. Gress. Where is it gone? Well, I think it's gone where they intended it to go. I mean, the early feminists asked the question, how do we help women? But they didn't ask, how do we help women as women? Because they saw fertility as really the problem. So they've asked the question, how do we help women become like men? They said fertility is the problem? Fertility is really the issue because that's what makes us different from men. That's really makes us vulnerable. This is why women had, you know, often women had incredibly hard lives. And so they were trying to navigate around that. And so, you know, in the 1960s, this is really when things are, you know, light up much more than they had been. Right. The movement just really explodes. But you can see this real idealization of the masculine over the feminine and over women. And so this is really where this kind of schizophrenic relationship comes in, where, you know, women are supposed to be, you know, empowered in all these different ways. But it's really at the expense of certainly fertility, but all these things that typically were understood as women. So we haven't really said anything good about being a woman, you know, for 50 years. And so this is why you've got all these young girls who are thinking, you know, I don't want to be a man, but I don't want to be a woman. You know, Abigail Shrier talks about this in her book, A Reppable Damage, that these young girls that are transitioning, they want to be like non girls. They don't want, you know, they're not ogling girls and lifting weights. They are just trying to avoid the female body because we don't really understand what woman is anymore, obviously. Are they are they androgynous? Would you say androgyny is where they're at? Yeah, I think that's and that's where they've been trying to go. I mean, in the 1970s, it was very clear that this idea of getting rid of gender, even in the 70s became what the 60s, the clothing became unisex clothing. Mm hmm. Remember it well, because I lived through it. And as the styles change where men were wearing women were wearing men's clothing, men would not yet wearing women's clothing. Yeah. Women were wearing the bell bottoms and the, you know, the look was very unisex in the 60s. It was cool looking. Everyone liked it. It kind of had a nice sexuality to it. At least that's what it's it felt like. So now look where we are today with its female monkey, its fake women now, completely fake women. Yeah. Telling women to be silenced and shut up and go away. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's exactly what what's happened. Fake women, you just put on a skirt and lipstick and you can, you too can be a woman. No, I understand transvestia. And it's been around since ancient times, the clothing chain, I get that men dressing as women for let's say internal sexual gratification. It's not an anomaly per se. It's not a very common phenomenon, but it's not really that weird in the scope of human history. Wouldn't you say that's true? Yeah. No, I mean, I think what's gotten weird is just the fact that we've normalized it and we've trying to make it look like this is somehow normal adult behavior. And of course, that's is all coming from this idea that, you know, we can remake ourselves into whatever we want. You know, it goes back to Nietzsche and filtered through Simone to move far and whatnot. But these are the radical ideas that I don't think we really realize how much they have taken root in the culture and the philosophical references because I've read all of those people. Did you say Nietzsche? I did say Nietzsche. Why would why does Nietzsche play a role in this thinking? So he's this, you know, he wants to break out of all kinds of taboos or things that he thinks are controlling and containing people. You know, he wants the Uberman, the man, a great man, the Superman. That sort of has the capacity to reinvent himself in any way possible. So this is, you know, gets passed on through Jean-Paul Sartre tickets, you know, Simone de Beauvoir picks this up and existentialism. And this is really at the source of it is this idea that we can kind of reinvent ourselves into anything that we want. It's just a matter of will instead of really looking at the body. And you know, we see this in a lot of the feminist rhetoric too, just this, the language talks about this idea of essentialism. You know, you can't actually associate a woman with her body anymore. And you know, it's these kinds of intellectual distinctions that they've made that, you know, all of our throughout history. I'm sorry, as someone who's collected sculpture and painting is my whole life, I grew up in an antique business store. And I've studied art in many cultures. I mean, women have been glorified, deified for their beauty in every culture going in primitive societies, even in carvings, the woman's body is deified. Yeah. And fertility is deified by every primitive culture. Right. Right. And these are the things that the culture has been really pushing, you know, feminism has really been pushing to get rid of because this is a way in which, you know, it's obviously coupled with Marxism too. There's a whole power element. And you can see that power, I think, especially with regard to the way that men have, you know, reacted or been treated by the movement. I mean, I think most men genuinely love women and want to do what's best for the women in their lives. And, you know, most men, I think when you talk about the subject, feel like they have absolutely no voice whatsoever. And they know better than to even engage in a conversation about feminism. But that's a real problem, you know, when it's a part of this topic. You're a professor, aren't you currently? I'm not currently teaching anyone other than my children. Can I ask how many children you have without getting personal? Sure. I have five kids. Oh my God. Okay. So you're not just writing an intellectual book. Right. Dr. Cari Gras is writing a textbook. I might become that. It might become that. It's that I think it's a page turner though. I've been told people have been reading it pretty quickly because I didn't want it to be just another academic book that, you know, 50 people read and nobody, you know, these ideas don't get out there. So I think it's a pretty readable book, not just a textbook. So you are really into this whole feminist movement. What it's done to family, what it's done to women. And the education books, quote unquote, and now being injected into our children's minds in schools have innocuous things like pride puppy, born ready and prince and night. And what do they really teach children? They're aiming now at the little kids to do one with these books. Dr. Gras. Well, part of it is just to sexualize children at a very early stage. That's part of it. But it's also to sort of normalize all of these elements that have are part of the LGTB plus community. I mean, that that's really the effort. And it's also a way to kind of divide and conquer. I mean, all of this is being done kind of around the parents, you know, working around the parents or hiding it from the parents. And this is just another, you know, marks his way that the family is being fractured because the government and the schools end up becoming kind of big brother or, you know, the gentle guiding leader that the children are supposed to follow and they're not supposed to be listening to their parents anymore. So it's, again, just another iteration of how do we destroy the nuclear family? Right. But, you know, really destroying the authority of the parents. That's a very good point because I remember when I first studied Marxism, God, I don't know how many decades ago, their number one goal was to decimate or destroy or atomize the family, man plus woman, because they said that bond is too strong for the state to dominate. Yeah. And actually that's what the battle is right now. You know, there was a great book in the 60s that was a big hit called Our Bodies, Our Sells by the feminists. I'm sure you've read that along the way, right? Our bodies ourselves. I don't see that. I didn't read that. I spent a lot of time more with certainly Betty Friedan's work and then Kate Millet was another one and the whole Frankfurt School. Okay. Well, your next book could be Our Children, Ourselves, get even with them. But okay. So you have a book called The End of Woman, How Smashing the Patriarchy Has Destroyed Us. And you know, as you speak, Dr. Gress, I'm thinking you say, okay, the object of Marxism is to destroy the family, replace the family with the state as the father and the mother and the family, make the state the family. But then I think of warfare. And I think of the Russian Bolshevik army, which was very heavily people with women who fought alongside the men in the forest against the Nazis, for example, in combat positions. They were given guns. They slept on the same cold ground. There was free love, so to speak, in the woods for survival, if not for everything else. The Chinese army. Mao's army was filled with women, wasn't it? Yeah. Women's soldiers. Yeah. And it's interesting to see how much, actually the Chinese women really resisted communism. They were like, I don't want a job and to work in the fields and then to go home and take care of my family. So it really wasn't until the later revolution that they absorbed it. Whereas American women, it was presented and very, you know, wasn't this warfare like the Soviet takeover. It was very much through the culture that that's how all of these ideals were taken on. And Betty Friedan was, you know, I have a ton of research in my book about Betty Friedan's communist connections and how she was really trying to get women to think like communists, to think of themselves as the as an ideal worker. Of course, she did it in very clever ways. She used a lot of psychology and, you know, kind of this, but pressed into that victim mentality of, you know, the home is a comfortable concentration camp. You're like, you call it that. Do you use that? Oh, I agree with her. In my house, it was. Oh, that's hysterical. Well, it ain't. Well, it ain't. I'm not an old European guy. It's like European family first generation American. You know, the father definitely was the ruler. I mean, he beat anybody, but he certainly was the boss. He was he was he'll do she let's put it that way. Right. Right. You know, you probably were starving like those in real concentration camps and you know, of course, that's all about. So the hyperbole is pretty remarkable. But, um, but yeah, she's using a lot of psychology to try and push women into the workplace because that's she really believed that that's where our our freedom would come from, you know, right along with angles, right along with Hitler, actually whom she hated. But, you know, this is the idea work will set you free. And that's what we have seen at Auschwitz. I mean, this is the women who entered when women entered the workforce. We'd be equal. Is that the point? We would be free. That's where we would get our freedom. Yeah. That was that was her idea. Savage. The savage nation is savage. On the man.

Thank you very much. Okay. Your book is very interesting in many ways. And the end of women how smashing the patriarchy has destroyed us by Carrie Gress 50 years of feminism have had the opposite of the intended effect and have granted primacy of place to the traditionally male sphere of life was simultaneously devaluing the typical attributes, virtues and strengths of women. Could you explain that sentence? That's a complex sentence. Yeah. Well, I think it's that idea that I mentioned previously about the idealization of the masculine that women are going to be happier when they're independent women. Like, have sexual relationships with men the way that men typically have had with women, that free love idea. They don't need men for money. They don't need children. In fact, children and husbands have become really the enemy and the obstacle to happiness is in feminist ideology. So yeah, that's the idea. But also simultaneously is getting rid of the notion of motherhood as something that is essential to womanhood. And I don't just mean that biologically. I mean, obviously many women have children, but not all women are going to have children. I think women have the capacity to mother others psychologically and spiritually. And that's one of the gifts that we have that has been really denigrated in. Much of it's been really replaced with resentment and sort of like what Betty Friedam was listening out of us. This belief that we're being treated unfairly or that we're victims, no matter what's happening to us. And as a result, it's also kind of created this entitlement. So yeah, there's been a shift in the way that we see ourselves as women. But what's replaced it is the sense of entitlement or resentment or victimization or fear of missing out. And you can't really build a civilization on those ideas, you know, on rage and anger, especially when it's directed at men or children. Several dictators built their societies on fear, rage and hatred. Are they still in room? No, but the society doesn't last. It just ends up in in in in in a tyranny. So yeah, many people died as a result of this hatred. And now this hatred towards the male, particularly you'll notice, I'm sure that it's only directed at the white male. Yeah. I've seen any hatred directed at males of color, so to speak. It happens occasionally when they're being featured with women, then they become sort of the default, but not very often. It's it's you're right. It's definitely well, okay. So does this get turned around? Is there enough of an uprising against this whole trans hysteria? It's like a mass hysteria in reverse here. Yeah. And I'm not only are we wrong and sick and mentally cruel to deny trans sexuals access to our most vulnerable vulnerable population, but they're actually somehow healthier than the normal people, so to speak. And there are normal people at the risk of sounding, you know, antiquated. There are normal people. Yeah. Yeah. Majority people are rather normal gender wise. They're real plus their exes. Their ex exes and XY's is a lot of us. A lot of X is an ex exes and XY's. Of course, there's a spectrum. I understand what the sexual fluidity is myself, and I understand there are people on the spectrum of gender identity. I see it. I've lived with it. I understand that whether it was the gym teacher of the 50s or go back to the cultural icons, Amelia Earhart, the American, the great American solo pilot who disappeared. Somewhere over the Pacific, she was clearly a uni gender woman. Wasn't she? Yeah. Well, I think she certainly has those kinds of characteristics. But I haven't dug much into him. She could have been a gym teacher in Queens, New York when I was a kid with a whisk and a soccer ball. Right. And that was a good. Tom Boy. What about Tom Boyce? Where do they fit into all those? I don't know. I mean, I think that's the danger. I was a Tom Boyce, I played with my younger brother more than I played with my older sisters. I played tennis and was very much involved in athletics. I grew up in Oregon. I can imagine if I grew up in Oregon now with those similar interests. I might fall prey to some of this. Yeah, I think that's it. We grow out of it and we have different stages. That doesn't mean just because there are things we're interested in, things that boys do that doesn't make us boys. Here's how I see it. And tell me what you're the expert. You know, I've raised children. And when children are young, they do a lot of weird things. A boy will put on his sister's clothing. A girl will put on her brother's clothing. They change roles because that's part of being a child. Yeah. And what you have to do that doesn't mean that they are that other gender or that other sex. A child's mind is not fully mature until they're 20s, according to all biology that I have read. So how can they say that a 10 year old really is trans and they need surgery or medicine? To me, that's absolutely child abuse. No, I think you're exactly right. I think that it's, you know, these are ideas that are popular in the culture right now. They're also incredibly lucrative. And I think it's lucrative. Luka, we mustn't forget the Luka. Yeah, don't forget that. Yeah. And it goes along with the narrative, but the real tragedy is just the fact that so much of this damage is absolutely irreparable. You know, there's not this idea that puberty can be somehow paused and not damaged by the hormones that are being pumped in to do that is just insane. And you know, I think that we're going to be seeing more and more lawsuits from people that are detransitioning. And I think that's probably where that the end will happen again back to the money because this is going to start costing people a lot of money because the damage that that's being done. But right now it's absolutely, you know, there are people that don't think this is child abuse, that think that this is the right and good thing to do. And you know, it's just, it's horrifying to see how we've gotten to this point. I mean, normalize things. You're remaining on 10 year olds. Savage. The Savage Nation. It's savage. Uncut. Unfiltered. And raw. My current article the other day by Annette Benning, a good actress, very good actress. So she has a daughter who became a boy. And she says that basically we all should have a transgender child who we benefit from. And I said, are these people really that crazy? And why by the way, I asked myself, do so many in Hollywood have these transgender children? It's a higher than normal number of percentage of their kids wind up transgender. I wonder what that what is it because they live in fantasy or there are no limits. There's no instruction because actually setting limits with children requires work, commitment and a strength of character to say no to a child. It's easy to say yes to a child and just keep giving them candy by letting them do what they want, right? Yeah, no without a doubt. So yeah, I think it's a great question to look at these pockets of where it's really coming from and what parents are teaching or not teaching their children. And yeah, really giving it into the fads and the trends and all the crazes. But yeah, it's kind of a matter of. You say that what 20% of young kids now think that they're trans? It's incredible what the numbers are between trans and queer and all of this. I mean, this is this is the movement in the. I live north of San Francisco. So I mean, I do go out and look. I know I sit in restaurants. I look at people and don't sit and judge, but I observe it's different than judging necessarily. I observe everything. I'm like a very keen observer of life. And every other table, I mean, I see a kid who looks like a trans or someone who is of one sex and looking to be dressing like another sitting and chatting with the families or the friends. Like it's a part of the norm today. In the very liberal area. Yeah. And that's the influence. I mean, this is, you know, we all know that teenage cultures like this, that there are going to be people that are the trend centers and the influencers. And now it's just sadly just so easy to find on phones and and the centers, trend centers, influencers. In other words, they actually think that they're the cool ones. Yeah, they're they're they're cooler than the normals. And. Yeah, Abigail Schreier, but pulls this out beautifully in her book because she talks about how the girls that are drawn to this, a lot of them are on the autism spectrum. They're all very bright. They're a little bit awkward. And by transitioning, suddenly they have the limelight and the attention that they have been craving for, you know, maybe their whole life. That's true. Yeah, they suddenly become the center of attention and very popular and, you know, they're being praised by everyone, including our president. And why is he embracing this? When there are so few people who are actually trans, what in the hell are they thinking in the Biden family that by reaching out and antagonizing most of the country, especially parents of regular children, how many trans people do can there be who vote? Yeah, well, it's not that it's more just the appearance of sympathy. And, you know, I can't, I don't want to speculate what's going on in the Biden's minds, but I think that the big thing is just appeasing that the cultural elites and, you know, this is the problem is this this has come from feminism. And feminism has been the gateway drug to the woke culture that we're existing in. And there is this patina of kindness about all of this that, you know, this is a kind thing to do to affirm the child who thinks that, you know, the little girl that thinks she wants to be a boy. And nobody wants to look like the mean guy. And that's how it's being, you know, really portrayed in the culture. So it's not just about piecing the trans, it's about appeasing those who, you know, think that the trans element is actually good. And, you know, the feminist movement has been leaning towards this, again, by this idea of erasing gender entirely. And so this is part and parcel of the movement, the ideology. And now we see this infighting between those, the feminists who are for trans and those who aren't. So that's what's going to happen when you have an ideology and it's not built on truth is you, you, there's no way to really adjudicate it because it's really built on something that's not actually true. So your book, okay, Dr. Carrie Grest, G. R. E. S. The end of woman house smashing a patriarch as the strotist. I want to ask you a question. What can parents do to protect their children from radicals? I'm sure you have that in your book, correct? You know, I don't actually my my colleague, Noel Mary has written a book called a wake, not woke that goes into that. I'm not going to talk about it a lot more directly, but my, my, what I think needs to really happen is just we need to start understanding what a woman is and not get, you know, stay in the space where we can't define womanhood anymore. What is it? Well, the short answer is obviously an adult female human, but I think a woman is actually a broader definition. And again, I have a whole chapter on this really goes into the idea that a woman is meant to mother, whether biologically, psychologically or spiritually, which means that she shelters, nourishes, protects and provides for the needs of those around her to become the people that God made them to be maternal instinct. Remember the word that antiquated term going back to the dark ages of when I was raised. I remember when I was in high school and going into college, the guys would talk about girls in all the different ways that boys will talk about girls. But then some of them were very clever. They would say, well, why don't you try to get her maternal instinct to kick in? And if she'll like you more than the guys who didn't want to go with the frontal approach, what would the approach? Right. You know, like the broken bird and the maternal instinct would kick it and the girls would all protect the poor boy. You're laughing because it was, that's guys tried every trick in the book to get girls to like them. Right. Of course. Oh, that is really sweet. Actually, did you say that sex sexist? I said, it's really sweet. Actually, sorry. I don't know from another universe. So either way, I sometimes, you know, it's time and other time, but the maternal instinct was seen that women had a maternal instinct. And they were guys who were sensitive guys who were not so much conning the woman as expressing who they really were. And they needed a strong woman to take care of them. Yeah. Yeah. Well, there's that. And I, but I think the, the biggest struggle we're really facing is just the, the complete absence of an understanding of what it means to be woman and kind of the demonization of wanting to serve others, wanting to raise children. Demon is seeing, seeing children as, you know, something that's bad for us. Because if you look at the statistics, women are not getting happier. I mean, this is one of the motivations for writing this book was we're not seeing, you know, we're seeing an increase in depression. Suicide rates, substance abuse, all of these things just continue to keep going up and up and up. So feminism is not providing a way to improve the lives of women, certainly, especially in the lower classes where we're seeing not just the breakdown of marriages, but actually the, the evolution of a new relationship. The psychologist Lionel Tiger described this term, biorogamy, where women are actually married to the state. That's their relation. What is the word? Biorogamy, biorogamy, biorogamy, that's the one from me. Yeah. You're married to the state. Good one. We're actually married to the state because that's who's providing for the financial needs. And, you know, it's not a new idea. I mean, this is what the Obama administration did with that, that woman, Julia. Remember that imaginary woman, Julia, that they, they trotted out as, you know, the ideal woman who never needed a man in her whole life and that the state was just going to take care of her. When was that? When was that presented? And what I think it was around the first, um, the first several years of Obama's administration. Oh my God, a biorogamy. I'm not connected with Obamacare, I think, too, was sort of part of that. All the reproductive health pieces were coming in. You're calling it Obamacare me, Obamacare me. Yeah. Yeah, that's a good big daddy. In other words, marriage to the state. It'll do. Yeah. So Dr. Dr. Gress, if a person has. Comes home from school. So let's say they have a 10 year old child, boy or girl. And the boy or girl comes home and says, you know, mom, I, um, I think I'm trans. Yeah. What should a parent do in your Well, I think that you obviously have to do a lot of talking and communicating and listening, but you also need to figure out where that idea is coming from. I mean, it's obviously come from school. That's a problem is coming from influencers. It's probably coming from multiple different places. Um, I think it's important to look to at the again, that question of attention and what, what needs are being met by that statement. Um, are you, is this a child suddenly have a different kind of status at the school or among friends? Um, so I think that, you know, there's, it's a really hard thing to navigate. I know that parents have gone to really extreme. Lengths to make sure and to protect their children when those conversations start happening to taking them out of schools, putting them in different places. I think that, um, you know, the hard part depends on where you live, how active the schools are in terms of hiding things. Um, what the laws say, you know, what where parental rights start and stop. Um, so I guess that, you know, that's one of the key things is for parents to, to know what the laws are in the state and then also have a relationship with the school and really be aware of what's going on. The borders, language, culture, the savage nation. Actually, the funniest cartoon I saw, I don't think the light of it is who put it down. I, I wanted some act, a very famous actor. Said I was a man trapped in a woman's body. Help. No, I was a man trapped in a woman's body. Dot, dot, dot, dot, then I was born. I thought it was the most thing I ever saw as a cartoon. I forget. Yeah. I don't know who, one of the very, it wasn't Mel Gibson. It was not James Woods. It was one of those people. Right. I was trapped in a woman's body that I became that I was born. I thought it was funny. So I sent it to someone I know who's a rather liberal therapist. And she said, huh, but I'm not going to bash trans. I support them. Yeah. Well, you know, I mean, that's where we're at. And I think we just have to be careful about what we're letting our kids be and who we're letting, you know, talk to them and a lot of it is coming, you know, encouragement is coming from those who see it as this great thing and this great boon for society and this great next step of progress and society. And that's the society in history has ever gone this far into this sexual deviancy because that's what it has to be called. And it can be said almost in a in a non-marole way, a moral, sorry, nothing to do with morality. Of course, called deviancy because deviant mean deviant from the norm, norm being x, x, x, y society, which society has gone farthest from that head around norm. Ancient Greece. Yeah. Well, I mean, other than ours. Yeah. I mean, I would say maybe the Romans. I don't I don't know. I'd have to think about that. We don't I mean, was it was Greece? That's quite gone. Was that what? I don't know. I think it's a good question. I know, you know, one of the things I talk about my book is is the work of J.D. Unwin, which if you don't know his work, it's fascinating. He said he said in 1930 sociologist talks about the collapse of cultures and he said that he, you know, he wasn't kind of it was an agnostic. He didn't really go in with an agenda. But he said he looked at 80 cultures and the the pattern of destruction that happens. And he said, there was one thing that happened in every culture. And he said, as soon as I saw that happen in a culture, I knew it had about three generations. It had about 100 years left before it would completely collapse. And that was the the premarital sex as soon as that allowed in the culture. Three things will happen. One is end of monogamy. The second is the absence of faith. Faith will go away from the culture. And the third one is the absence of reason. Reason will dissolve. People will only be able to work off of emotions. So it's fascinating to obviously look at our own culture and see, you know, clearly all three of those things have come to pass. We're very much in a post rational culture and, you know, faith is dimension monographies. It feels like it's anybody thread. So, you know, I think that there's a lot to be said for this on a societal scale that, you know, amore. I think your reference to being amoral is a really important point because people get too wrapped up into the idea that, oh, this is just your opinion. Your what your church says or whatever. But these are actually have real consequences for the future of our country and, you know, just life the way that we know it. You know, I'm a I live near the water and I observe bird life all the time. I particularly seagulls you can learn like from seagulls. But I watch ducks swimming by in the water, you know, near salt water. And, you know, when when things get confusing for me, even at my age, I find looking at nature. I'm a botanist by training, for example, everyone understands the fundamentals of reproduction with repeat plant or animal. And I think that a way to help children is to actually take them to see animals. You see the mother duck with the little duckling swimming behind the mother duck. It's the cutest thing in the world. Yeah, go on since the beginning of time. They're not confused. There's the gander. There's the goose. There's the mother, doctor, father, eggs. Yeah, all that. How do children not understand that right away? Well, I think that they do. But I think that it just gets so wrapped up in all of these other realities. They're, you know, pushing into the life. We're disconnected from nature in the society that we're living in. It's a media society. What do you call social media society advertising society? Totally disconnected from reality. Like a kid who grows up on a farm certainly knows what a boy and a girl horses. Right. You're not going to talk about that. They know what a cow and a bull is. And you don't go milking the bull. Well, in America, they would say the bull can be milked. They they they they what they do. I'm sure Biden would say in fact, they would make for a good citizen. Is a bull that could be milked. Well, anyway, Dr. Grass, your book is great. And I recommend it to everyone listening to this show. It'll straighten a lot of people's minds out. The end of woman house smashing the patriarchy has destroyed us by Dr. Carrie Gress, G.R.E.S.S. Any final words for the savage audience? No, I just thanks so much for having me. It's really fun chatting with you and obviously getting perspective on all of this crazy stuff. Well, I sure I should need it. I don't get it. But you know, I have to go back to one layer. I saw the the ad agency behind the whole Bud Light fiasco. Yeah. Yeah. How could they think that a beer that is so fundamentally aimed at the redneck or the the guy, you know, I don't say redneck in a pejorative way either. The working American man who drinks a Bud Light. Why would he identify with a transsexual? Why? Well, you know what? It had no one had pushed back before. There had been small pushback, small boycotts, but nobody had done it on this massive scale before. So I think that they just thought it's working everywhere else. Or this is we've been effective. No one's cared before. This can't really hurt us that much. So I think that it was just they finally, you know, poked the wrong ball in the eye. You think that that's the turning point because the corporations sure embraced this whole woke thing. Yeah. I think I think what Target seeing is phenomenal in terms of those numbers. I mean, that this the boat between Target and Bud Light, it's a signal that people have had enough. And I think they're feeling in the pocketbook and other people are watching. You know, I watch ads. I'm a big TV watcher, not only, not just the news. I watch a lot of stuff on television and I've been a TV observer since I'm five years old. I love television. It's a great, great relaxation for me, especially movies. So I watch the ads when I'm on cable in particular and they they're so great. You don't see a heterosexual couple or and I see that changing slowly now. They're reintroducing quote normal couples again. And of the same race, by the way, if you can believe that shocking. They're showing white men and white women together. Every other ad was a mixed race or a gay couple or a trans couple. Hugging for an ad for diabetes or every ad for a drug was shown with gay women walking around in the woods after they were healed with this miracle medicine. They suddenly were able to hike again. They could do mountain climbing again. I said, we come up with this stuff. It's what I'm saying is my observation is it looks like it's moving back toward the norm now. The you repeat, right? Do you think that we've gone past that? You know, I'm sure hope so. I mean, I feel like it's just the overreach has just been incredible. And I think that's it's heartening to hear that maybe we have reached. You probably don't have time to watch television. I do. I like to watch movies, particularly Bunwell Move. I saw some great TCM movies the other day by Louis Bunwell, but in the 60s and 70s, and we're awesome. He was a surrealist, of course, Spanish surrealist. And to me, we live with Bunwell, B.O. and UEL and people don't know who he is. He did some great movies. But the point is, if this is not surrealism, what we're living through today, I'd like to know what is. And let's hope to God that people like you with your book, the end of woman will bring us back to some realism. And I thank you for being with us on the Savage Nation podcast.
