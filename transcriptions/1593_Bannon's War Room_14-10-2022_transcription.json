    "text": " This is what you're fighting for. I mean, every day you're out there. What they're doing is blowing people off. If you continue to look the other way and shut up, then the oppressors, the authoritarians, get total control and total power. Because this is just like in Arizona. This is just like in Georgia. It's another element that backts them into a quarter and shows their lies and misrepresentations. That's why this audience is going to have to get engaged. As we've told you, this is the fight All this nonsense, all this spin, they can't handle the truth. War room, battleground. Here's your host, Stephen K. Bannon. Thursday 13 October in the year of our War 2022, we got a lot to get to this afternoon. We're going to get to economics politics. And of course, this incredible controversy over transgender ideology. Dr. Murray and Grossman is going to join us here in this. I'm going to start with Steve Moore. Steve, thank you very much. You saw the, Tommy, first off, talk about the producer price index print and today the print on consumer price index, the worst in 40 years. And if you look at the underlying analysis, it even gets worse. Because I start off with a speech that you gave in Delaware the other day about the seven ways I think Biden is destroying the American economy. But how's that manifested when you look at both the producer price yesterday and the consumer price, sir? Hey, Steve, good to be with you again. These numbers are disaster. Let's not forget that we have one and a half percent inflation at the month that Trump left office. So in 21 months, we've gone from one and a half percent to eight and a half percent inflation. I wouldn't have even thought that was possible. I want people to know the proximate cause of this disaster in terms of runaway inflation is the $4.1 trillion that Biden has spent and borrowed and printed. So he's flooded the American economy with cheap dollars and that is causing this tragic inflation. The average family has lost about $4,100 in purchasing power in the last 14 months under Biden. That's a huge reduction. By the way, there were up over $6,000 under Trump. Now they're down $4,000 under Biden in terms of people's buying power. And we're talking about middle class people here, Steve. And then finally, you look at what's happened to people's savings. I see the market is up today and I can't really explain why that is given these abysmal numbers. But even if you take into account the better numbers today, the stock market when you adjust for inflation is down almost 15 to 20% under Biden since he entered office. So people's 401k plans, seniors retirement plans are being vaporized by these policies. Now the reason it's up, and we'll talk about this a lot, the reason it's up is that the market believes that Jamie Dimon and these guys have now, and Powell and these guys are rattled enough, you're going to get a green span put that they're not going to continue to, the, the doves are going to win over the hawks. That's why people are hoping for more easy money. But let's go back to the underlying thing of President Trump had full spectrum energy dominance tax cuts where they were, and I didn't agree with all the tax cuts, the tax cuts were there meaningful, focused on bringing manufacturing jobs back. We had no inflation, and I think 11% real wages increase from working class of people, from people blue collar or white collar, non-college graduate over college graduate. This, we just finished your $10,000 swing, the $6,000 bump with Trump, the $4,000 subtraction for Biden. That is, that is because we've had 18 months in a row consecutively of real wages declining. Let's go, let's turn, but I want to turn to your, I want to turn to your seven ways that America is being distracted. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. So this math is not complicated, right? So we've had eight to eight and a half percent inflation in consumer prices and five, maybe 5.2% rise in wages. So the math here is easy. Americans are losing 3% of their purchasing power each month. And by the way, a lot of people think, you know, when you buy the essentials, the inflation rates a lot higher than, you know, 8%. And you know what group that's really getting clobbered here is seniors. So seniors inflation rate is closer to 9 to 10%. I mean, I fell down on my, off my chair laughing today when Ron was playing the, the chief of staff of Joe Biden, one of the three or four most powerful people in this administration put out a tweet today, say, isn't this great news that, that so, so security payments are going up by 9%. Well, see that one up by 9% because the inflation is running at 9% you more on. And so that just means our deficit is going to be larger. Seniors are not better off of this. They're getting crushed by inflation and they're losing their lifetime savings. How is that good for seniors? It means that also the Fed, as you mentioned deficit deficit gets bigger and inflation that has to be paid for. We're not saying there shouldn't be a cost of living. I said, but they're saying they're going the best in 40 years or the best in 40 years is because inflation is out of control. Cola, the cost of living adjustment is a cost of living adjustment. It's not a thing to celebrate because you'd rather have a zero cola and zero inflation. No, this shows you that lies, Miss. Go ahead, Steve. Yeah, there. Treasury went up to 4% for the first time in many, many, many, many years. And so it was about 1%. I think when Trump left office, so think about what that 3 percentage point increase in interest rates means on the government debt. We've added probably one to $2 trillion to the debt for nothing for nothing just because we have to pay more money for the massive amounts of government borrowing that we've been doing for the last 30 years in this country. I mean, that $1 to $2 trillion, we're getting nothing for that. We're not getting roaches, bridges, schools. We're not getting national defense for that. It's just money that's going out of our country to foreigners because of the higher interest rates. What do you say, Janet Yellen yesterday, and we talked about a little bit this morning, is warning about a lack of liquidity in the Treasury market. I mean, these things used to sell automatically. People didn't even get big commissions for selling because it was automatic. It came from the Treasury sold them. And the guys who are buying those are kind of tucking them away. Now, obviously they're saying because lack of liquidity, you're going to have to increase the interest rates even more than today. How does that just explain the audience? How that rolls down everywhere into their own personal finances? Steve? I'm going to have to take a look at the question. Steve, did you hear the question? You were asking me about the interest rates. Yeah. I mean, I see those rates potentially continuing to rise because the flood of debt out there. By the way, Steve, think about this. This is not just the United States problem. Over the last three years, the developed countries of the world that are supposed to be run by smart people have spent $25 trillion. It's $25 trillion. I mean, they borrowed that much money. That's never happened before in the history of civilization. Who's going to finance all of this debt, Steve? I mean, you were in these markets. Who's going to buy all these government bonds? I'm not going to buy them. So what has to happen here? Because here's the thing. They're talking in D.C. right now about a continued resolution, which is just the fact they haven't passed an appropriations bill. People should understand the scam of all these committees. The reason they don't press a program is because they're going to have to be a real deal. People should understand the scam of all these committees. The reason they don't press appropriations bill, they never want to have to give the American people kind of a, oh, oh, we're going to have a one and a half or two trillion dollar deficit annually. So they wait, then they had these CRs and the game is just to kick it down the road 90 days at a time. But essentially, it's another train and a half dollars. And we have the debt ceiling coming up in the first part of the year. Steve, how is the Biden regime, which essentially is going to end November 8 with the landslide that we've got coming in the house and the Senate? How is this going to be? How is this going to be? How is this going to be worked out? Well, Steve, I mean, first of all, let me say this that, you know, on that debt that you were talking about, you know, I love Biden saying, oh, I've reduced the national debt when in fact, you know, he came in his first year, they spent three trillion dollars above the budget. And then this year, they're only spending an extra one and a half trillion dollars. And he wants to step out about my back for that. I mean, is that the most absurd thing you've ever heard? You know, no president in modern times, maybe ever in American history has been as financially reckless as this president. And he's running around saying how he's reducing the deficit. I mean, what a lie. So walk us through right now, Intel's already announced that it's going to be big layoffs and Intel. That's a proxy for the overall economy. You're an economist. As you see this thing going forward, walk me through what's going to happen here. You've got you got market in the market today. The stock market definitely bounced back because people are anticipating that pal and these guys don't have the stones that continue on the Volcker path. They think that they're going to be too rattled by the politics of this. So they're looking for what we call the Greenspan put more quantitative easing easing of interest rates. No bump in the next in the next session. People think the doves are going to win out. What what is you forecast out? Tell me what you see. Well, I don't understand why financial markets think that's a good thing if the doves went out because then what are we going to do? We're going to have eight nine percent inflation from now until Kingdom come until we do something about two things. I think the Fed does need to raise rates some more, but much much more important than that, Steve, is it doesn't matter how much the Fed raises interest rates. If you've got a government that continues to spend one, two trillion dollars each year more than it's bringing in. I mean, as I said, I'll ask that question again. Who's going to buy all of these bonds? I think that, you know, the Treasury Secretary is right yet at yelling that at some point people just stop buying the bonds. And then you think the interest rate is high now. It's going to continue to go up. I saw mortgage rates in many markets. Did you see this Steve today? They went over seven percent. We haven't had seven percent mortgage rates for, you know, years and years and years. I mean, this is, in my opinion, Steve, this is a financial disaster. It's a calamity. And none of these people in the Biden administration have any idea how to deal with it. And they're putting it all on a drone Powell. But I don't think he knows how to deal with this either, frankly, because we've never had this kind of level of massive overspending and borrowing. Right. You've, I want to go back to the percentage over the GEP. And here's, by the way, the audience, you understand, here's who the buyer is. It's you. We essentially buy it because the Japanese insurance companies, the Chinese Communist Party, the Gulf Emirates, they've only got a certain, they got a certain cap, a certain limit. What you do to enhance more buyers also is you juice up interest rates. You give them more yield. So the search for yield by these countries will have them by Treasuries. I happen to think we may be heading to a sovereign debt crisis in the United States. But Steve, you're an expert in deficit. Let's get to that. You're expert in deficits. We're now what? 150% over GDP. That rule of thumb by rebening these guys is that this time it's totally different. Every country that goes above 100% says, oh, we got it this time. All of them end up in financial collapse. Why is the United States going to be any different? Well, I mean, we do, we are the world's currency. So we do have a big advantage in that. But I'm worried about how fun that's going to last. And as long as we continue to debase our currency. And I've got to tell you that my thing about seven ways to destroy a country, one of the ways you destroy a country is you debase its currency. And that's exactly what's happening under Biden. And then you cause a financial crisis. And that's what's happening with all the government debt. And this is, if you, I'm sure you've heard of this, Steve. Have you heard of modern monetary theory? Oh, big time. We talk about it all the time here. I think that's going to, I think that's been proven to be a fallacy that deficits don't matter. Right. By the way, Wall Street and Braced it, they didn't say it, but they embrace modern monetary theory, which basically deficits don't matter. You can spend and spend and spend. And by the way, if it ever comes to a problem, you just raise taxes. Right. You just raise taxes to pay for it. That is a, that's a joke, right? So I think you're right. Well, if anything good has come out of this crisis, it is that modern monetary theory has been proven to be, I think you called it a joke. I think it's, you know, it is, it is a crisis by people who want to continue to grow the government at an item. And they said there'd be negative, no negative effects of all this spending. Well folks, how do you like it now? How do you like eight, nine percent inflation? How do you like the fact that we can't, we only have enough energy in this country? How do you like the fact that we're running deficits so large that it's put our country in great financial turmoil? And when you add that to what all the, I think it's so important to put this in the international context of what the rest of the world is doing, where they're, they're following our lead and spending and spending and spending and spending. And the private sector is getting crushed and crowded out by this massive increase in government. And that story never has a happy ending. Want me through the seven ways, because I want to answer about the politics of, of money right here. Tell me, you gave a speech. It was in Delaware. It was covered by the epoch times. I think the best broad sheet out there. And then it was picked up and it was made the lead story in zero hedge, which everybody on Wall Street goes to. So walk us through the seven ways to destroy a country. Okay, I'm going to do it really quickly. So people always ask me when I give speeches about what's happening with our country right now in the economy. People ask me, is this intentional? And I always say I don't think it's intentional. People are just incredibly misguided and incompetent, not intentionally full of malice. But if it were intentional, then you would do exactly what Biden has done. And very quickly, number one, you would, you would stop enforcing the border, right? You would just have no borders for the country. And that's what's happened. Number two, you would destroy its energy sources. Of course, that's exactly what's Biden's doing by canceling our coal and our oil and our gas production, which is 70% of our energy. Number three, you would ruin its finances by borrowing so much money that the country just becomes essentially bankrupt. That's what's happening under Biden. Number four, you would debase its currency. And that's what's happening with this runaway inflation. Number five, you would put your political opponents in jail. And Steve, I mean, nobody knows more about this than you do. And I'm Peter, like Peter Navarro. And I, you know, I really literally at night, I am worried that there's going to be a knock on my door because I work for Donald Trump and they're going to come with guns and they're going to put me in jail. I mean, that's what's happening to our country. That's what tyrants do. They put their political enemies in jail. And then the next thing you would do is you would let crime run rampant around the country in big cities. That's happening. I think I may have left out one, but you've got the picture that this are the most civil, you've taught me this, Steve Bannon. Most civilizations, most great empires throughout history have been just from within, not from invaders outside the country. It's the rot inside the country. And that's exactly what's happening in America. I've got one more minute, Steve. So that's my take on this, though. I guess I'm sure. Real quickly, just hit me with you've been going around the country. What do you project right now? As you look out to November 8th, you've been around for freedom works or prosperity council. What do you see happening in November 8th? I think there's going to be a wipeout of any Democrat. You know, I think Democrats are in big trouble. Steve, I'm going to make a prediction on your show. I think you're going to see a lot of Democrats lose. Nobody thought so out coming. Even Democrats in blue areas of the country, I think, are in grave danger because Americans are on to this. They are so upset about what has happened to this great country of ours. So I'm looking at a big wave, a red wave, very much like what happened in 1980, 1994, 2010. Steve Moore, how do people track you down? How do they get to your writings? How do they see your speeches? How do they get all your content? Go to the committee-dunley-spusperity website. Get our outline. I know you get it every day, Steve. It's free. I'm not selling anybody anything. Just sign up online and we'll give you this information that you and I have been talking about for free. Five mornings a week and just sign up for the newsletter. If you don't like it, you can not subscribe. Steve, thanks for what you do. I have to tell you, I don't know if it's keeping you up at night, but I worry that those FBI agents are coming to my door. That's been happening to so many Trump people. You and I are very much at risk. I have a bigger face that I have a much bigger worry that we're going to have a financial collapse. I think that we are heading towards a financial apocalypse that this country is going to have a very tough time pulling out of. The generation under 35 years old is going to be wiped out forever. Steve Moore, thank you very much. One of the President Trump's of ours. Absolutely incredible. People can get that piece. I want to make sure everybody gets this up on Zero Hedge. I posted it on Getter, but I want to make sure we put it. It's called Seven Ways to Destroy a Country. When you look at it, it's actually quite eerie how much of that has gone on the last 18 months. Of course, we're paying the price of that. Boris is going to join us a little bit later to talk about the practicality of the politics of all this, but I want to bring in Dr. Miriam Grossman. She's been at the cutting edge. Dr. Grossman, I know you sat in for Steve Moore's, which are really more financial or some political, but another way to destroy a country is cultural or go after the family. The way to go after the family is the children. Walk through it. You become such a big name in this movement to kind of put rationality back into everything that's going on. I guess it's gender affirming surgery or gender ideology. Can you walk us through what your background is? How you get engaged in this and what's your fight right now? Sure, sure. Thank you, Steve, so much for having me on. I'm a board certified child, adolescent and adult psychiatrist. And I became aware of what we were teaching children about gender 10, 12 years ago when I was at the hospital. I was actually studying sex education. I wrote a book called You're Teaching My Child What? And it was mostly about sex education without the gender part, but there was one chapter about gender. You see, we have been teaching kids a very dangerous approach for gender identity that people have not really become aware of until recently. And that is that we've been telling kids that they can basically choose whether they're boys or girls and that they if they have any anxiety, depression, social problems, or any of the many, many different things that kids and teenagers suffer with, then they really might consider whether they might be the opposite sex. And they use these extremely rigid. Stereotype of boys and girls and they present these notions that are almost laughable that, you know, any girl that's not into really girly things and dresses and makeup and so on or any boy that's not into sports or. You know, all these stereotypically masculine things that you could be the opposite sets. And, uh, this is a doctor, Dr. Grossman, Dr. Grossman, hang on, hang on, hang on, because I want to. This thing of the transgender, this thing of the ideology into the parents, parents rights in the surgery is kind of dropped on people like an anvil over the last, let's say, six or eight months is kind of cool. But you've been at this beginning. I do want to go back and spend a couple minutes about how the whole sex education, this has been something that's been in a public education for many, many decades. Right. We're just seeing now maybe the more radical fruits of it, but can you go back? I just want to make sure people know that this is in spring whole cloth in the last five months that now people are seeing this that you and others have been following this and warning people about this for a long time. And people, quite frankly, like in a lot of things, they were too busy. They just don't pay attention. So go back and talk about how this even got embedded in the system. I mean, how do we even get a public school system where the purview of what the parents should be teaching the child in the closeness of the family and how the parents believe that should be delivered. According to either their religious beliefs or their cultural beliefs or their family heritage and traditions, how they do it as a family as parent to child. The past that on has been really superseded by the state in this way, public education says, go back. Let's hit the rewind button because I want people to know so many people come up to me and go, how did this happen? Where did it happen? I said, hey, no offense. No, he's paying attention. But I think it's been going on for a long time. The actual intrusion of the state in doing this. And this is just a difference in degree, not a difference in kind. Dr. Grossman. Okay. You are correct. This is going on for a very, very long time. And when modern sex education began in the 60s, it began with the, with the goal of taking over from the family because parents, frankly, weren't thought to have the right ideas at that time. They were old fashioned. They were just coming out of the 50s. You know, it was these people that came together and and created modern sex education. They wanted a sexual revolution. They wanted to, they wanted to advance the idea that kids are sexual from cradle to grave and that any sort of sexual behavior is wonderful. The problem is when sexual behavior is restrained by the Judeo-Christian values by society. That was considered the issue. They believe that even infants are sexual. Preachers. And so they certainly had an agenda and they believe that, you know, they need to reach kids very early. And they need to bring this into the schools. And present it in such a way that it. It sounds like it's educational and that it's based on health. It certainly was educational, but it was not based on health. It was based on the ideology that sexual freedom and sexual rights are the most important things to teach our kids that they have that they are sexual beings. Hang on. Hang on. Hang on. I want to go right there about the sexual being sexual freedom. The, the, the institutions of the Judeo-Christian West in your mind at that time in the 60s, right? The Jewish tradition, the temples, the Christian, whether it's a Catholic church or the, or the Christian in the nuclear family had been going on. I don't know for millennia, right? It was there any evidence, any evidence at all that those traditions were met, regardless of religious form, but the Judeo-Christian civilization was having a problem. Promogating that information given that we had large families, happy families. There wasn't an issue about family formation. There wasn't an issue about population decline. There wasn't, was there any evidence at the time that this was not being passed down appropriately for those cultures and civilizations? Well, that's a good question. I think that at that time they would have pointed at out of wedlock births with what they were called at the time and venereal diseases. STDs, we call them now, and they would have argued that young people are not getting the information that they need about their sexuality. I mean, this is what they would have argued publicly, but privately, and there's plenty of evidence about this, they really wanted to change the culture, and they wanted to take sexuality outside of the confines of the Judeo-Christian framework outside of marriage, outside of heterosexuality. And they wanted to increase the bandwidth, the scope of sexual behaviors that would be acceptable and created a different kind of a world. And this came out of Kinsey, you know. Let me just go get a minute here, we're going to hold you through 30 seconds. Did anybody try to fight that? I mean, I know you wrote books, but was there any organized effort of parents or religions or whether the Jewish religion or the Christian religion was the churches, temples, organization, rabbis, priests? Did anybody really try to stand up and say, Hey, we don't want this to happen? Oh, absolutely. The most conservative and traditional of religious groups certainly fought it, but it was just too big of a monster to fight. I mean, the 60s came and you know what happened in the 60s, and there was a revolution. Dr. Grossman, hang out for one second. We're going to come back in just a moment. We're going to continue this to find out how this exploded over the last year. Dr. Miriam Grossman, who's one of the leaders in this to understand this effort and to fight it.

On the outside, they're saying it's about out of wedlock marriages and sexual hygiene and all that sort of something. It goes on for decades. It obviously gets even more in truth in the public schools than you have the gay pride, the LGBTQ. All of a sudden, it appears that in nowhere we're debating and teaching, there's pornography in schools, these books, and we're teaching transgender ideology. Then it leads our greatest institutions, Boston Children's, the Philadelphia Children's, the Great Institute of Medical Institutions Vanderbilt, are actually doing these surgeries. Walk us through how we got there. It seems like out of nowhere because everybody comes to me and says, hey, how did this happen overnight? So where are we right now and how did this just kind of explode? It appears to the average person and even the average parent over the last six months to a year. I mean, it has exploded. Well, it's been going on a long time in terms of the material, the educational material, the ideas that have been put in front of our kids about gender and about male and female, teaching them that the so-called gender binary, that there's only male and female, is actually an oppressive idea, a dangerous idea, and one that they should reject. That's something that's been taught to kids for a very long time. I have material that goes back to the 90s and the 2000s where Planned Parenthood and other organizations were definitely putting this stuff in front of kids. I wrote about it in 2009. It really wasn't picked up. I think that it was maybe considered just so fringe and so bizarre and so impossibly crazy that we were telling these, you know, telling our kids this that they should change their bodies to fit with their, whatever their mind is telling them at the very moment. I think that people felt that it was just too fringe and just, you know, just too extreme. But all that has changed. And now we see that it has become very mainstream in the schools and it's very cool to be transgender right now. It's not cool to be strictly, you know, identifying as a male or female. It's much more cool to be somewhere what they would call sort of either in the middle in that spectrum or to be identifying as the opposite sex is considered much more cool. And it really is almost like a fad, except that it's a very, very dangerous fad and it leads kids and parents down a dangerous path. And it ends with surgeries that are irreversible and that leave young people disfigured and sometimes sterile. So this is a very serious business that we're talking about over here. And, okay, but hang on, but hang on, hang on, slow down. To get to the surgeries, I got to get to Vanderbilt or to Harvard or to a child boss and children. The kids that are sitting there is very cool in the things. How did this actually walk me through the educational infrastructure? How did our elites or how did this get embedded as a hardcore ideology, both in the libraries with the librarians and in actual teaching itself, the content and the training of these teachers. It just didn't pop up out of nowhere and kids don't know. I mean, they're what they're exposed to to say, hey, this is cool or not cool. But how did that ideology get essentially hardwired to where parents go to school board meetings and they're pushed back in challenge and these guys are not going to back off. They're not going to back off one inch. In fact, Glenn Youngkin wins on this very people in on CRT in this very point. And we are now finding out in school, people coming to us, parents coming to us and saying, essentially, youngkins victory had very little change. The schools are still not backing down. There's still this pornography. There's still this ideology and the transgender stuff is probably as bad as it was when youngkin was first thing and youngkin wants to run for president on this very topic. This shows you how dug in it is. So how did it actually the content in the training get down to a public school level? You are correct that these ideas are baked in. You are educational system are sex education and now unfortunately, even into the medical system in the if you look at the American Academy of theatrics. They are just 100% you know, with the program. It's just like there's a regime and they are the apparatrix of them. They're just regurgitating this false unscientific philosophy about gender and and and how to treat gender confusion. So how did it happen? I mean, you know, it's difficult to just put it in a few sentences, but essentially, you know, as sex education develop and became, you know, got a lot of lot of funding money and also the ideas of sexuality and gender. You know, became very strong within universities and academics and gender theory became a foundation of feminism and and really took off at the universities, you know, teaching these kids stuff and, and you know, you had, you just had a whole, a whole framework of an educational framework, both second, you know, higher education and the whole field of sexology, anyone that wanted to become a sex therapist or study human sexuality had to go through this system that was basically, you know, indoctrinated them into this one way of looking at sexuality and gender. So you are correct. Yeah, go keep going. It is baked in. It is baked in. So at this point, if you take your child to the pediatrician and your child is artistic or has some anxiety or depression and happens, you know, when the child has that 10 minute alone with the. Which they are content on always doing. They take your child, especially if it's a teenager away from the parent or they ask the parent to leave and they ask these sensitive questions for the kid. And if the kid says, well, you know, I'm really struggling. I think that I, I'm not sure about my gender and they've heard about this. It's cool. They've heard about it online. It's all. It's all over the place at this point. I mean, it's all over. You know, Disney and it's the Internet and YouTube and there's hardly a place where you don't hear about transgenderism and how there are people that are just born in the wrong body. And it could happen to anybody. It's not a disorder. It happens. And the treatment for that is to bring your body. To change your physical body so that it then meets whatever you feel you are in your mind. And so kids hear this. I'm sorry. No, keep going. No, keep going. And they go online and especially during all the all the lockdowns, you know, kids were spending hours and hours and hours online. They were on YouTube. They were on all these other platforms and there's thousands and thousands of kids on there who are telling recounting their transition stories of, you know, how they went on blockers, blocked their puberty and they felt so much better. And then they went on girls, you know, talk about going on testosterone and they're very excited about all the changes that that brings and they feel so good. And they're just all pumped up. And these kids are spending hours and hours online and they're listening to this stuff and they just think like, why not? These kids are so happy. I want to be happy. I'm miserable. I don't fit in at school. I don't feel good about my changing body. I don't like getting my period, whatever it is. A lot of it is very typical, you know, teenage kind of thing. But they are led to believe and they are indoctrinated to believe that they might be born in the wrong body and they therefore should explore that possibility. And the exploration we want to have the exploring. We want to have you back on the. Yeah, I would love to come back on. There's a lot to say. No, no, no, no. This is, I will tell you and look, everybody knows this is not my line of country, right? We are. We're very much economics capital markets, national security politics, but the reality is, and I will tell people this in the, in the, and you heard Steve Mortis went through the civil rights to destroy country. This may be the most important thing we're dealing with right now because you're seeing the nuclear family under assault and you're seeing the children being turned against. This is like the malice culture revolution when the Red Guards were taught ideology to attack the family and attack their parents. The same thing in the French Revolution. That's why I say this is much more radical than even the Bolsheviks, right? This is this is as radical as Mao Seitang. Yeah, go ahead. Yes, ma'am. I just, I would like to share with you in your audience. I spoke to a dad yesterday from Connecticut. He told me the following story. He has a very emotionally disturbed daughter. She had multiple psychiatric hospitalizations as she was suicidal during one of those hospitalizations. She heard about being transgender, and she started to go in that direction. He would not accept it. He would not accept that she was a boy. He just wouldn't hear about it. She was his daughter, and he wasn't going to budge on that during one of her hospitalizations. Child protective services came in and they would not allow the girl to be discharged to her family for that reason because the father refused to call her by a different name, a boy's name, and refused to use male pronoun. This father has not seen his daughter for three years. The Department of Child Protective Services took her away from a loving, wonderful family. This could happen to any family. People need to know that you're not immune. This is what's going on. If you don't, if you insist on living in reality, and you will not go along with your confused child's new identity, your home is considered unsafe, and your child can be taken away and put into foster care indefinitely. This is what's happening in our country. Dr. Grossman, how do people follow you? How do they get to your website to find more about your career? How do they find how they follow you on social media? My Twitter is at Miriam-under-sport-grossman. My website is Miriam-grossman-mv.com. There's a lot on there, a lot of articles and interviews. Please get educated. No family is immune. You need to know what's going on before you get ambushed by this. Before your kid comes home and says, Mom, Dad, I'm not your daughter, I'm your son. You need to be prepared. And you can be. You can be. Dr. Grossman, I also want to, every time I give a speech, every time I go to CPEC or people want to make sure that we tell you what a fantastic job you're doing in leadership. In times like these, in these uncertain times, it's leaders like you that people can rally around and people feel a level of stability and comfort. So from our entire audience at the war room, thank you so much for doing what you do. We know you're under assault every day, so thank you for fighting the fight. Well, you're welcome, and I won't think of doing anything else, but thank you for your kind words. I appreciate it. Thank you. Dr. Miriam Grossman, one of the fighters in this area, I got to tell you, let me bring in Boris for a second. Boris, you know, we deal in politics or capital markets and things, but this thing is so scary. And when I've gone around and given these speeches and I talked to people offline, it's obviously financing capital markets, but this is like a specter that's holding and hanging over families that you just heard the story right there that Dr. Grossman talked about. People are worried about this to a level they've never been worried about anything in their lives and their families could actually be destroyed by this. Any thoughts? Any thoughts? Observations analysis? Steve got a lot of thoughts on it's honor to be with you. Obviously Tom Cohan, today on the political side, capital market side, but you know, on the family side, as a father and a proud father of a wonderful boy, I will tell you that that and you know, I just have to shame myself I'm using some call for language. The people who are pushing this on our children, okay, better stay away from my kid. They better stay away from all our children. They better not even think of encroaching on what is happening on our kids. They better not think on encroaching on parents that are not think of encroaching on the individuality and the gender of our kids. Our children, our children's mind should not be polluted with this non-tech and it is absolutely this woke radical agenda is as scary and as offensive and intrusive as it possibly gets. And it is a huge problem for families and Dr. Grossman was right with God to be vigilant. We've got to protect our children and we cannot have them be exposed to this radical vote. As you see on social media, the pictures are staggering. Oh, so proud of the gender blockers for my hormone blockers. It is absolutely crazy. It is absolutely nonsense, but it isn't to be laughed off. It's dangerous. And it is true to be vigilant about and to be protected. Want me through the politics for today. And I actually kind of forgot about it because the capitals, I mean, we've been on as you know, we've been on the road. We've been going out to campaign, seeing what's going on, going out throughout the country since July, basically before CPAC. D.C. is empty. The capital is empty. Everybody's back campaigning. The Democrats, you know, see this as an existential election for them. What happened on January 6 today and they're going after President Trump, but is anybody listening? No, no, no, no, they're a total failure. And so today they try to end this supposed to the last hearing and they said they passed a resolution that's complete Stalinistic, which hallway where they go around the vote. Yes, a resolution to say a resolution to subpoena President Trump for documents and for for testimony. Now, without talking about any potential response, but the whole the whole show trial mode of it was just so un-American. You truly think it's a real committee. A real committee would have a nine to nothing vote. A nine to zero vote with nobody opposes. It is staggering. It is shocking. It is un-American. It's unconstitutional. But it's exactly what we expect in the radical Democrats because what they've done for seven years, not public hearing hopes after hopes, after hopes against the American people. So the sum total, I mean, cable would not pick it up. Cable would not pick it up in prime time. The networks wouldn't pick it up. It was on cable at one o'clock in the afternoon on a Thursday when the consumer price index comes out. Everybody's talking economics. The markets are thinking about, hey, you know, Powell can't possibly keep raising interest rates because the politics here is too terrible. The next, in fact, the next rate increase would be, I think, four days before the election. They'll clearly get soft. They're looking for a green span put. There's so much global news. There's so much financial news or so much economic news. But this thing just kind of is kind of petered out. The Democrats made a huge bet. This would be a big difference. Even morning Joe said this morning, it's not what the country's thinking about. No, of course not. And the Democrats have overshot just like they always doing. They're doing it again. I mean, you've got this change lost by 40 points in our home state destroyed by President from destroyed by mad. They're destroyed by the war in Boston. And this Jamie is up there trying to lecture the American people even though she's been kicked out of her party. And she's been kicked out of Congress by her constituent. So yes, the American people have tuned them off because what's happening in our country, the complete disaster, the southern border, the criminal disaster all across the country. The mess we are in economically, national security lives, security of domestic security lives. And of course, criminally is so overwhelming. And yet you cut these, this can't go root for the switch on setting up. You know, claim that they're there, they're somehow doing something for the American people. It is a complete and total charade. It's a complete and total joke. This committee has been even more of a failure than we've done. Anybody could have expected because they haven't done any of that. They haven't investigated the fraud, the overwhelming fraud in Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona, Nevada, Michigan, Pennsylvania. And they haven't talked about President Trump so much peacefully and patriotically and authorize thousands of troops to protect Washington, DC on January. So it's because she knew it was going to be an overwhelming crowd. They haven't talked about any of that because they're trying to lie to the American people and they failed. And that's why Nancy Pelosi's Congress approval rating is in the single digit. Give me a quick. We've got about a minute and a half. Want me through this red Sonomis building. We're fighting in Rhode Island, Connecticut, Maine to New Hampshire and nine, nine seats in play and close to wins for the Republicans in New York State, California, the Rio Grande Valley, Oregon. Brother, we're in these deep blue states in deep blue territories. We're by one 10, 12, 14 points. One in quotes. These districts and we're now competitive. What do you see? Do you think Nancy Pelosi in this committee gets swept out to see on the 8th? Oh, absolutely. The tsunami is rising. The Mago wave is getting hotter and hotter and hotter and higher and higher and higher. It is only going to get. It's only going to move like this. Non-films like this is only going to energize Mago under leadership. President Donald J Trump further and further and further and get stronger and stronger and stronger. That's what it's going to be. That's what it's going to be. That's what the effect is going to be. We are only going to fight back harder. We're only going to stand stronger. The posh has to keep putting a shoulder to the wheel and continue fighting. That is what has got to happen. And again, you see how desperate these Democrats are. You see these hoaxes they perpetrated against President Trump. It's nonstop targeting, weaponization of law enforcement. It has got to stop and winning in November and it's 24. It's only way it's going to stop. No substitute for victory. Boris, how do they get your morning newsletter and how do they get to you on social media? No doubt about it. BorisCP.com is my website hot on BorisCP.com hot on Get Our BorisCP Twitter. Boris, if you're hot on socialite, how does some of the ground Boris on the scrubs? They strung out both and I will see you tomorrow. Thank you. Boris and those guys are on offense right now. Tomorrow morning at 10 a.m. I will guarantee you it'll be just as lit as it was today. The creditors committee meeting is called for at 10 a.m. Eastern Daylight Time. Where in the war room? We'll see you then."
