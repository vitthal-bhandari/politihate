First of all, he just says stuff that's untrue all the time, and we're supposed to not notice. Joe Biden is constantly lying. I remember when there was this whole game they played about tracking all of Trump's lies. Trump has lied 10,000 times, 50 million times. Remember, they actually had a number that they would put to it. And they would include things like Trump saying that he was the best or the smartest or, you know, just statements of bravado or exaggeration. Because the lives were crazy. They were suffering from Trump's arrangement syndrome. That's obvious. But when we look now at what the Biden administration is supporting and what they're promoting from the White House, they're in favor of transgender surgery for minors. This is official White House policy. They are supportive of drag queens twerking in front of small children at these drag shows that keep happening all over the country. And they'll say, oh, it doesn't really happen. Notice one of the tactics of the left is to make something commonplace and to push it as an agenda item to ram it down our throats wherever they can. And the moment you notice they say, what are you talking about? That's that's so rare. That doesn't really happen. Why are you making such a big deal out of it? Big it. Oh, we're making a big deal out of it. No, they make a big deal out of it, but they do it incrementally. And so as you notice as the proverbial frog is boiling in the pot, they say, what do you mean? What are you talking about? Oh, get back into the pot. The water's not boiling. What's the problem? They keep doing it because it works because people aren't waking up to this. They don't understand what the tactics of the left really are and what their ultimate goal is. I mean, here is Joe Biden, for example, seeming to say that Justice Thomas of the Supreme Court wants to ban gay marriage. Play clip one. The courts extreme conservative majority overturned Roe v. Wade on the right to choose in his concurring opinion, Justice Thomas money even further. And he wrote the following quote, we should reconsider all the courts substantive due process presidents, including Griswold, Lawrence, Obergefell. That means he thinks we should reconsider whether you've got the right access to conception. And yes, we should reconsider whether you have the right to marry who you love. And that's not only the challenge ahead. But a person can be married in the morning and thrown out of a restaurant for being gay in the afternoon. This is still wrong. No one's being thrown out of any restaurant or any with a country for being gay. This is a make believe problem that Joe Biden is addressing here as president from the White House. And to pick one line from one Justice Thomas Descent and act like that is the the GOP agenda. And that is all of conservatism is it's intentionally dishonest what Biden's doing. And he's hoping to be inflammatory because this plays well to his base. And that's all that really matters for Democrats, right? That they are able to dominate the narrative. The country's a mess. We've got a lot of problems right now. Everyone's very aware of what the problems are. They just raised rates again by half a point. So we're going to have and we're getting really close to what's going to be the deep recession, I believe that's going to hit in 2023. There are a lot of indicators suggesting that that is on the way. But in the meantime, the Democrats want to focus on the social issues. But let's understand Joe Biden was elected because he was supposed to be a guy who was traditional, trustworthy, a uniter, you know, good old Joe Biden. You can trust Joe. He's not some radical. This White House supports 14 year old girls having their breasts removed so they can try to become boys before they even gone through puberty. This White House supports that calls it gender affirming care. The White House supports it. Not some fringe left wing radical, you know, nonprofit organization. You know, the actual White House, the executive branch of the federal government, Joe Biden invited to the White House to help us celebrate this and celebrate the signing of this of this law, an anti police non binary drag queen. These are the people that are celebrated by the Biden administration, the kinds of individuals who are celebrated by the Biden administration. Sam Brinton, the non binary deputy assistant secretary in charge of nuclear waste disposal for the Department of Energy, fired after stealing not one but two suitcases on different occasions from airport carousels, women's suitcases. I can only imagine because he wanted access to the women's clothing and took some weird pleasure in this guy had a top secret clearance. Oh, that common guy non binary, which was what does that even mean? It's ridiculous. We all know it. And yet here we are being told, except this or else, except this or else they keep pushing this on everyone. They are pushing ideas that they themselves, the libs said were radical and crazy 10 years ago, maybe even five years ago. Now it's except this or else. And we are toward the very bottom of the slippery slope here on these issues. And they turn around and say, Oh, no, but if if they don't go all the way, if you don't agree that there should be drag queens twerking in front of three year olds with their parents cheering this by the way, because that's how effective the lib propaganda is. You're a bigot and you want to get rid of interracial marriage, gay marriage, contraception, all of that. Wait, what that is the argument that Joe Biden makes just to be clear. Go along with all of this or all those other things, go away and you're a bigot who wants to get rid of all those things. Stunning, isn't it? But they play the game for keeps. You got to give the commies credit that they're not bound by honor, truth, reality, none of that stuff matters. It's whatever is emotionally satisfying to them and whatever keeps them in power. That's it. Everything else. Totally negotiable. Everything else is just a question of their needs in the moment. This White House is appalling. Joe Biden isn't appalling moron and people had voted for him thinking that he was going to be some stable, steady hand on the government were fooled. They were fooled, swindled. They should be a little embarrassed about it. And the true believer Democrats who went along with all this, they're lost to reality. I mean, there's nothing you can do to convince them to stop being so crazy. I do want to talk about the border here in just a second. And what are we going to do about the border that is now a superhighway for the not only the illegal immigrants coming into the country by the millions, but the drugs that are pouring in specifically fentanyl and methamphetamine that are destroying destroying this country. I mean, they are destroying our cities. They are hollowing out towns in rural America. What is going on right now with this drug abuse problem and how it's all coming across the southern border and a lot of the chemicals, the precursor chemicals have come from China. So the Chinese are able to use the drug cartels as a cut out to poison the American people. What's the Biden administration doing about it? Nothing. Nothing. In fact, they want more of it. They're like, yeah, let's let's keep this border wide open. Let's make the incentive structure clearly favorable to illegal migrants coming across who then have to be processed by border patrol, who then can't stop the drug traffickers, including illegal migrants who have backpacks for all this stuff who run across the border. I mean, the whole thing is a disaster. Biden doesn't want to do don't what doesn't want to do a thing to stop it. Democrats, 15 years ago, we're saying, yeah, we need to we need a fence. We need to secure the border. The bipartisan fence act of 2006, you can look back at it, Congress passed legislation, got to create barriers, got it, got to secure the border. Remember John McCain, build the dang fence. That was a line for one of his campaign commercials. I know he's a Republican kind of, but there are all these Democrats that were on board for two now. It's a free for all down there, total free for all. So how you can prepare for your financial future, given the really uncertain economic times we're already in. And the fact that I think we're going to hit a big recession next year, what do you do with your money? I mean, you're not getting good stuff going on in the stock market for the last year. That's for sure. Look at your 401k and you're not getting good yield and savings. You're losing money to inflation. How about investing in real estate? I've done it. So I'm not telling you to do anything that I haven't done. And I've done it with considerable success so far. And it's only growing, only getting better. I started with my friends at Dun for your real estate. That's who you need to be working with. If you've never invested in real estate before, you want to think about how to do it, how to do it in a smart way with people who will answer all of your questions and take you through every step of the process.

Begin your real estate investment journey today. Trust me, you will be so happy with the results. And when you learn more about being a real estate investor, this is something that just makes sense for the long term, telling you it's a really, really sound strategy, really good plan. Let's talk about that border, my friends. Here is Kevin McCarthy saying the Democrats have destroyed the border. And he says, we don't even have operational control anymore. Play clip 10. They don't want to work at all. They have destroyed this border. We don't even have operational control anymore. Think about what your story just portrayed. 1.5 million fentanyl pills in one week. One crossing from 42 different countries. This didn't used to be this way. And what's going to happen in one week from now when Title 42 is lifted. So all your viewers understand what that means. Title 42 simply says when someone enters our country illegally from another nation, we send them back to their country. When you do that, it stops illegal immigration from coming. But this, this administration will not uphold that. They won't. They won't deport. They won't secure the border. They won't do interior enforcement. They have no interest in any of it. And in fact, even some Democrats are recognizing what a challenge it'll be because Title 42 at least allows for some individual male adult migrants to be turned back and turned away once that goes away. Who knows what's going to happen? I mean, here is Representative Henry Quayar, a Democrat in Texas saying the Biden administration doesn't care. This is going to get out of control. Play 13. It's okay to listen to immigration activists. It's okay to do that. That's one perspective. But who's listening to the men and women in green and blue? And more importantly, who's listening to our border communities? I live in Moreto, Texas. I live in the border. And again, I don't just go visit there. I know and I talk to the mayors, our county judges, commissioners, landowners, other folks there. And nobody's listening or should I say the administration is not listening to them. It's about time that they pay attention to border communities. Yeah. Of course, the administration is not listening to them. Why would they? They're going to tell them the border is a mess and Democrats are going to say, yeah, exactly. That's how we like it. Just future Democrat voters in their minds, mostly, who are coming across because they're going to push for an amnesty. That's where all of this is is heading. I mean, you've got people who are so slimy and dishonest in politics like Gavin Newsom walking around saying, yeah, you know, we've got to go to the border. We've got to do everything we can to address the issue. Here he is, Blake, look 12. The fact is what we've got right now is not working and it's about to break in a post-42 world unless we take some responsibility ownership. And I'm saying that as a Democrat. I'm not saying that to point fingers. I'm saying that as a father. I'm saying that as someone that feels responsible for being part of the solution and I'm trying to do my best here. Part of the solution. What does the solution look like of your Democrat amnesty amnesty? That's it. There's no other solution they really want to talk about. Securing the border. No, making it easier and more orderly for people to just walk into America without any regard to our actual immigration laws or the needs of the American people. That is the plan. That's what they're hoping for. Everything else is essentially just noise, right? We need to talk about, oh, we need bipartisan action. No, no, no, they want a wide open southern border because they think it benefits the Democrats by enlarging the welfare state in this country. The needs for state, local, and yes, federal resources to go to illegal immigrant communities, to pay for all their health care. They want people who are dependent on the state and they want people who are going to vote Democrat. Everything else irrelevant to them. Sovereignty, the effect on communities, the effect on taxpayers, the lawlessness, none of that matters. Assimilation being overwhelmed. It doesn't matter. They don't care. Democrats cheer as the country's load bearing walls crumble all around us. It doesn't make any difference to them. They're the ones that are making it happen. They're all in favor of it. And there's the FTX collapse, which is, you know, I'm fascinated by this guy. So that bank been free. He made like a few billion dollars from pretending to run this amazing crypto exchange. The guy who is in charge of trying to put the pieces together afterwards here, John Ray, who's the CEO who took over after the bankruptcy. That's what he does. He's, for example, was involved in the aftermath of the Enron bankruptcy, trying to make sense of that. And he's out there telling everybody about this FTX mess that there's basically no record keeping that this was just all on the fly that these, these polyamorous vegan nerds in the Bahamas were just doing this stuff like they were running a business out of the college dorm room. Playclip two. The FTX group is unusual in the sense that, you know, I've done probably a dozen large, you know, scaled bankruptcies over my career, including Enron, of course, every one of those entities had some financial problem or another. We have some characteristics that are in common. This one is unusual. And it's unusual in the sense that literally, you know, there's no record keeping whatsoever. It's the absence of record keeping. Employees would communicate, you know, invoicing and expenses on, on slack, which is, you know, essentially, you know, a way of communicating for chat rooms. They use QuickBooks, the multi-billion dollar company using QuickBooks. Well, we're going to find, I believe there's already $70 million that we know of that was donated to politicians, including through the illegal means of hiding the source of the donations. I think we're going to find that the payoffs were actually much bigger than that. And the bribes were into the hundreds of millions of dollars. And I'm not even sure we'll ever know the full extent because moving money around in this crypto world is very hard to track, very hard to trace who's moving what to whom and how it's called cryptocurrency for a reason, right? It's supposed to create some basis for anonymity for the user. Yes, there's a blockchain that keeps a ledger of the transactions, but the actual user behind it, who knows. So finding where all this money went, I think is going to be very difficult. But trust me, when I say this guy was buying off the apparatus, he was paying off Democrats left and right in every way that he could as an insurance policy for the scam because this guy was running a massive Ponzi scheme, but he gave money to the right people, the right gernos, the right Democrat politicians, the right nonprofits working to defeat climate change, stuff like that. And that's all that it takes in order to give yourself some layer, some, some extra added armor against the regulators and all the rest of it. Thanks for hanging team. Back with you tomorrow, Thursday. Talk to you then."
