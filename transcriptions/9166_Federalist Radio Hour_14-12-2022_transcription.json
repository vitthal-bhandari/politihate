    "text": " We're back with another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Jaczynski, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. As always, you can email the show at radioathefederalist.com. Follow us on Twitter at FDRLST. Make sure to subscribe wherever you download your podcasts as well. Today, I'm so happy to be joined by Riley Gaines. Riley is an all-American swimmer, former NCAA swimmer at a very, very high level, a very successful former NCAA swimmer who is now a spokeswoman at IWF and doing some activism work and advocacy work on behalf of women on her own. Riley, thank you so much for joining us. Of course, thank you so much. I really appreciate the opportunity to really shed light on. The issue I'll be talking about. Thank you. Yeah, no, of course. I mentioned this before we got started, but I'm also a senior fellow over at IWF and had the privilege of hearing you speak at a gala recently where you were honored. I thought you were fantastic. Then when IWF announced that you had jumped on board as a spokesperson, a spokeswoman, actually, I should say we should be sex-specific here. I was really... I was really traversal. Right. Right. So, talk to you. I'm so glad you were able to join us. And maybe for folks who aren't familiar with your story, I'm sure a lot of people are. But for people who aren't, could you tell us a little bit about your background as a swimmer? Yes, of course. So, I just recently graduated from the University of Kentucky where I swam all four years. And are you from Kentucky originally? I'm actually from Nashville, Tennessee. Okay. So, just a quick little three-hour drive. I love Kentucky. It was close to home. Lexington is just a beautiful city. But this past year, my senior year, this was the first time I became aware of a swimmer named Leah Thomas, which a lot of people are familiar with that name now. It was about November of last year, which is about the middle of our season. And the swimmer named Leah starts posting the fastest times in the nation by multiple events. And you're just looking at this on paper. You're like, how bizarre. I've never heard of this person before, which is pretty weird in and of itself because, like most sports, your top tier athletes know each other. When you're posting nation-leading times, you've never heard of this person. Go on paper is a senior and a female from the University of Pennsylvania. It didn't really make sense. But an article was posted a couple weeks after Leah Thomas was posting these times disclosing that Leah Thomas was in fact formerly Will Thomas. And swam three years on the men's side at U Penn. So Leah was ranked first in the nation in the 200 freestyle, the mile at this point. And I was ranked third in the nation in the 200 freestyle. And so I was concerned. I was wondering, is this person going to be a threat to me when competing for a national title? But I truly thought to myself that the Insta-Blay would never allow someone who just switched over to the women's side three years after competing at a Men's D1 University to compete with the women. Because like I said, on paper, last year, this was a guy who was ranking in the 600s as a male. Surely they can look at that subjectively and realize that allowing this person to compete against the women and jump this much in the rankings, which is not common. That's not a thing that happens in swimming. You know, overnight you don't jump from 600 to number one. But sure enough, I was proved wrong by the Insta-Blay. They announced that Leah Thomas would in fact be competing against us just three weeks before we were set to compete this past March. But Thomas and I competed against each other in the 200 free sell. And this was the day, the second day of the meet. And that first day Leah Thomas won a national title in the 500 free sell, becoming the fastest female in the country, beating out Olympians, American record holders, the fastest biological females to ever swim. But that next day, like I said, we competed, we tied. We went the exact same time in the 200 free sell. I have to say that's pretty impressive, Riley. I'm impressed. Well, thank you very much. It is impressive. And it's something I'm proud of. Finishing fifth in the country is a huge honor. And so it's something I've worked out my whole life. And so it is something I'm super proud of. But when you tie with someone who's six four and a biological guy, even if they're mediocre guy at best, it's on accomplishment. But we tied. And so we go behind the awards podium where they hand off the little trophies. And the official looks at me and says, great job. Y'all tied. We don't really account for ties in terms of trophy. So we're going to give the trophy to Leah. Great job. Yours will eventually come in the mail. And so I look at him and I'm like, OK, I understand, you know, you only have one trophy, but can I ask you why you're adamant on giving this trophy to Leah? And he says, well, we're just doing this in chronological order. And I say, OK, what are you being chronological about? Because I'd love to know. And he said, well, for photo purposes, Leah has to hold the trophy. You can pose with this one, but you'll give it back and we'll eventually send you one in the mail. And that's when it just dawned on me that not only were we being forced to compete against male athletes, change in a locker room with male athletes who still had full male genitalia, we were being sidelined to men at an all females meet. And I at this point was done waiting for someone else to stick up for us because truly up until this point, I thought a coach or someone within the encibola or someone with some sort of authoritative power to make some sort of change would, you know, stand up for this because like I mentioned earlier, it was blatantly obvious how unfair it was. But that's not what we were seeing. And so I really thought to myself, is we as women and we as female athletes aren't really just stick up for ourselves. How can we expect someone else to? And so I kind of took it upon myself to start being more public with my opinion and my experience. You know, I saw the picture and the picture on the podium going viral. And I wanted to ask you about that experience because I imagine a lot of folks reached out to you after seeing that. I imagine a lot of them were probably Republican politicians, conservative groups. Maybe I'm wrong, but can you just give me a little bit of an insight into what it was like after that picture and the news just in and of itself that Lee and Thomas had tied with the woman. What was that experience like as it sort of became a story around the country? Well, in the moment, it was kind of this like this feeling of mixed emotion because like I mentioned, I was proud to have finished that high up. A lot of backlash I've received is like, you got this, like you, that's not even a participation trophy. You had four other women beat you. That's it in the country is a huge honor. And so I was proud of myself. But at the same time, and I was extremely proud of the girls who beat me and did the seemingly impossible by beating a 64 man, I was like, wow, this is awesome. But it is this feeling of just disheartened it, of course. But these past couple months, I knew this would be something that blew up, especially when I was kind of telling this trophy story, really highlighting the injustice and severity of what we as female athletes were dealing with in terms of how we were being sidelined. But man, it's been overwhelming. By no means when I initially started speaking out, did I really know what to expect. I never felt equipped in a sense where I didn't have any sort of political science background, no sort of journalism, no sort of public speaking. And so that's all been new to me. What did you major? I realized. So I majored in human health sciences and health law. I was actually set to go to dental school this year. But I decided to kind of put that on hold for a year and take a gap year because I realized if I didn't use my platform and my powerful testimony to help advocate for women and women in sports, I would be doing a disservice to myself, to my teammates, to other present female athletes who are emotionally black-milled into silence, to these future generations of female athletes who have no idea the implications this will have on them. And of course, for the past female athletes who have fought relentlessly for Title IX. So I've just thrown a wrench at my life plan. But I have learned to be okay with that. I realize how important this conversation is and no one in my position is willing to have it. I have so many people who reach out to me every day and Olympians, people with really high profiles saying, thank you for doing what you're doing. I appreciate you privately, but we can't stand with you publicly. I hope you understand. And it's almost like, no, I don't understand. I wanted to ask you more about that because you mentioned along the way, I thought it was so interesting to hear you say this, you kept expecting the NCAA to step in. This is unthinkable, right, that you would let someone who's suddenly posting crazy times for obvious reasons. You serp the competition and as a competitor, you were thinking, well, this can't go on. I mean, this is obviously something has to be done. What was it like as an athlete during the sort of deliberative process as the NCAA was trying to figure out what to do with it as the other swimmers at that top tier were trying to think about the issue? Like, what was the conversation behind the closed doors like? Everyone, there's very few people you will talk to who is a female athlete who is in support of what happened, but no one wants to be labeled as hateful. No one wants to be transphobic. No one wants to be a bigot, but I finally realized, does it make me a hateful transphobic bigot to understand and recognize that women deserve equal opportunities? We deserve privacy. There are two sexes and you can't change your sex. We deserve safety. We deserve fairness. Does that make me a transphobic hateful bigot? Because if so, then that's something I'm willing to accept. But the conversations, they were, you know, who do you talk to? No one was standing up for us at this point. So who do you go to that would be willing to if no one was? So it was a very intriguing time these couple months between November and March. There was a lot of curiosity. I'll admit, I was very curious as to what this would look like, you know, like, will we share a locker room? What, you know, what is this going to be like for us? And of course, all those questions were answered. But majority of people I've come in contact with and I've really tried to get a broad perspective on this issue. I've tried to speak with anyone who has a differing opinion to me. But I can tell you about 95% of people wholeheartedly agree with what I'm doing. I believe that. But that's so sad because I remember as this was happening last year, even to get good reporting out of the situation and to read stories, it was so hard because nobody wanted to talk to journalists, which I don't blame people for at all. But to just as a member of the public to try to understand what the heck was happening, it was so hard because nobody wanted to speak up at all. It was just like radio silence. Right. And if people were speaking up, it was one sided. And that's what I really realized throughout this process is how the media works. Oh my gosh. I just know that I'm kind of in this position where I'm understanding with my own eyes, I'm seeing what's happening, but it's getting reported differently. It's like, hold on. That's not what happened. And that's not really the narrative that existed. This is totally being fabricated to push along an agenda. We talk about internet privacy here all of the time. So most of us know that our internet service provider basically knows literally everything we do online. I mean, it's just true.

I when I'm teaching journalism, one of my favorite questions to pose is, do you have you ever watched or read a news story about something you know really well? Maybe it's your hometown. Maybe it's just a subject that you're really into and you realize this is completely off base. Like this makes no sense whatsoever. Well, you have to imagine that happening in basically every single different subject. So Riley, how much worse is the media than you thought it was going into the space on your experience? I always joke with my husband. I'm like, I wish I could go back to being naive because now that I'm I open, I can't stop thinking about it. There was an instance this summer, I believe in July, I spoke at CPAC and Donald Trump was speaking, giving a speech and he called me to stage with him. And so I had no idea this was going to happen. So I was pretty shell shocked. This was in front of thousands and thousands of people. And so I get up on stage with him and he he you know goes into kissing on the cheek, but I thought he was going to whisper something in my ear. So I slightly turned my head and the media took this and ran with it. They said that anti-transformer is repulsed by Donald Trump's kiss, all this stuff. And I'm like, that's not what happened. I just couldn't hear him. I thought he was going to say something to me. And so I slightly turned my head, but everyone was the media. I was running with it. And so I'm sitting here being involved in the story. And there I saw one article that had quotes from me. I'm like, I never even said that. Wow. Oh my gosh. And so seeing that firsthand is like, oh my gosh, I wasn't repulsed by Donald Trump. I what? This is so crazy. There's been tons of that regarding this issue. Leah Thomas in one event placed eighth in the country at our NCAA championships made the top eight heat, which is an incredible accomplishment in and of itself. But that night totally through the race did terrible deliberately and got eighth place. And I think this was strategic in making it seem like trans women can't in fact compete with women and not win every time. But had Leah Thomas been going the times that Leah went earlier in the season, Leah would have won no doubt. But that's beside the point. But these media outlets were posting that Leah got last. Leah got dead last in the NCAA's placing last in the nation. And it's like, no, Leah did it. Leah got eighth place in the country beating out 15,000 other people. So they're reporting Leah got last, but in reality, that's not the case. They just have no idea how NCAA swimming works, right, right. Or they do and they don't care and they want to push along that Leah got last. But in reality, that's not what happened. Mm hmm. Yeah. I actually wanted to ask you about that too, because the fifth place finished thing. I imagine you've gotten a lot of people come up to you and say, Leah Thomas got fifth place that is clearly proof. I mean, for women, including yourself, we're able to compete with Leah Thomas. What is the, as somebody you just said, you think it was the eighth place was strategic. What is the backstory on why Leah Thomas sometimes isn't beating women? Right. I think it's very simple. I think it's to make it seem more competitive than it really is. If you were to watch that race and know absolutely nothing about swimming, you don't even, you don't have to know anything about it. You can see Leah Thomas not trying as hard as the other females. You can see there's no kicking going on with the legs. You can see at the 100 meter mark or the 100 yard point when Leah Thomas just stops trying. It's deliberate and it was obvious. And so for me, I'm super ecstatic to play Smith in the country. I think it's a huge honor, but I'm not ecstatic to do it with someone who didn't even have to try. It makes a mockery of what I've dedicated my life to, what the other female athletes have dedicated their lives to. We at a collegiate level practice six hours in the water every single day. But to tie with someone who didn't even have to exert all of their energy, all of their physical ability, it's just the feeling of frustration. Really. Yeah. That's I actually. Thomas, go ahead. Had posted, I was going to just say, Leah Thomas had gone much, much faster earlier in the year. And so just knowing that, and I'm talking seconds and swimming seconds is a lot. This is a sport measured under the 100th of a second. So that tells you all you need to know right there. Right. And I hadn't heard that. I had it. I mean, I'd realized that some of that had happened, but I didn't hear that argument. I guess now that I'm remembering, I heard a little bit of it back in March and everything, but I didn't realize that. And that seems to be such a crucial part of this. And it brings me to another question, which is, what did you did Leah Thomas do this as an activist? Is that your sense that this was advocacy on behalf of trans sports competition? Was it personal? Did you get a sense of, you know, I mean, doing making strategic losses? That seems to be activism, plain and simple. Right. I don't want to say I think Leah Thomas totally transitioned just to make a point or just to win these swim meets or, you know, make themselves more relevant in the swim world. I do think there was some internal struggles going on with some identity problems and things like that. Why are we as female athletes forced to deal with someone who has internal struggles? You know, why are we validating this person's feelings at the expense of so many others? So I start to speak for Leah Thomas in that regard, but I do think in terms of the race strategy, if you're looking at it, you know, just statistically day one, one a national title beating everyone by body links. Day two got fifth, day three, place eight. To me, that's strategic. And if you watch the races, you would understand as well. It's pretty obvious what was happening in terms of the effort displayed. What's your right? That is activism. Yeah. It's sort of realizing that there's a useful sort of tool to be made from somebody in that situation. And I'm sure there are a lot of political ideological interests that glommed on to Leah Thomas and encouraged different things. I'm sure that that was, I mean, no matter who you were, I'm sure that was a difficult time to navigate, although Leah Thomas has been very much celebrated. Has that surprised you at all? I mean, it has very much divided the country, but at the same time, I mean, hasn't Leah Thomas been nominated for Woman of the Year awards? Yes, which is the highest collegiate honor for females at all period. It's a prestigious achievement. It's something that encompasses your character, your leadership, your academics, your service, your, of course, your athletic achievements. And so it takes all of those things and embodies it into one person. And so I found out I was nominated for the award and I was so excited. I was like, wow, each university gets one nomination. And so at the University of Kentucky, I was their pick, which we had the number one WNBA draft pick. We had a world record holder and track so many amazing female athletes who were doing so many amazing things. And I got nominated. I was like, oh, my gosh, this is a huge, huge honor. But then they released a full list of the nominees. And when I saw Leah, Leah Thomas's name on that list, it devalued the award to me completely. This was worse than Leah Thomas winning a national title because at this point, it wasn't something that just happened by chance because initially when Leo was able to compete with us in civilays, I thought maybe these rules had been in place for a while. Maybe this is something that happened pretty quickly in the instability didn't have time to kind of readdress it. And so I looked it up and the rules had been in place since I think 2010 or 12-ish. And so, you know, that's 10, 12 years these rules have been in place. And so I tried to give the instaub list some grace even with how the situation was handled. But of course, I was stupid to give them any sort of grace because when they nominated Leah Thomas for this, I realized this isn't something that happened by chance. This is something they're encouraging. This is something they're celebrating. And this is something they want to highlight. I think it's pretty ironic. The instaub le uses this word equity. Continuously. Oh, my gosh, they love the word equity. And I'm like, do they know what equity means? They use it in reference to Title IX and everything Title IX has created. But now they're allowing this across lots of sports. And so I'm kind of just like, do we need to get a dictionary out? Do they know what equity is? And so... Why do you think the NCAA, again, an organization that represents athletes and has long been very proud and emphatic about its support for female athletes? What on earth is motivating the NCAA's decision to double down here? I think one money. Money is just... That's why all these large organizations are caving to the demands of today's woke fads. I think they don't want to be viewed as anything other than inclusive. But sports don't care about your feelings. Sports is the one place that your feelings, your identity, your identity doesn't matter. It's your biology. It's what you're working with to be so successful anatomically and biologically that puts you on that pedestal in terms of sports. There are other places like the workplace within your personal relationships. Those places, they don't rely on biology. That relies on the social construct where your gender and such, your sex, doesn't matter. But sports, these things do matter. So why are we ignoring that? Why is the NCAA doubling down saying that their decision to allow this to happen is backed by lots of science and research? I would love to meet any sort of medical professional, especially any sort of medical professional who specializes in sports and the differences between men and women to tell me that men don't have any sort of advantage regardless of the amount of hormone suppression and for how long you've taken it. Because even then, with hormone suppression, there are certain factors that contribute to success that will never be diminished. Like, of course, your lung size, your heart size, obviously your height. I know it's on silly, but men have a 40% larger throat than women, which was a huge effect in swimming. So there's so many things, even with hormone suppression, that will just never be mitigated. Yeah. No. And you know what's crazy is there are doctors, medical professionals out there who will make these arguments because they're sort of similarly under the sway of ideologues and kind of want the plot it's and the to be celebrated by ideologues and make these just absolutely absurd claims that fall apart. And that's why, again, right, I know like you were going to dental school and everything, but this is like this is desperately, desperately needed, especially from young women and people who have dealt with it. And one of the things I was wondering to see if you had any insight into, I always think about what's happening at the high school level, where scholarships are on the line, college educations are on the line. Have you seen this playing out similarly on the high school level as people are competing to get slots in places like Kentucky? How could this affect young women who are even more reliant on getting to the college level in the first place? Exactly how you said it. Scholarships will be taken, they are being taken. I believe there's an instance in Washington that allowed a male track athlete to take a female scholarship. There's actually a story of a young girl from Vermont. Her name is Blake Allen. She's 14 years old, plays volleyball. She has a transgender athlete on her team. One day they go into the locker room and the transgender athlete comes in there, sits on the bench. This is watching the girls undress in the locker room and doesn't undress himself or anything, just watches everyone else and then starts making inappropriate comments. And so Blake, who's the young girl, walks out of the locker room and tells the event administrator that she felt uncomfortable. She was then suspended from school. Her dad lost his job and she was forced to write an apology to a public apology and the dad was as well to which they both declined. And then they filed for a lawsuit. As soon as they filed for the lawsuit, the school dropped the suspension of course. But this is something that's affected her greatly. And she's been reaching out to me for guidance and for all the things because she knows I've been public on this issue and she tells me, I get these hateful comments telling me to kill myself, I can't deal with this like you can. She's like, how do you do this? And it's just really, really terrible to know that someone who's 14 years old is getting death threats from people who claim to be tolerant and inclusive and accepting and loving. And all of these things when in reality, that's not true. So this is greatly affecting the high school level. I always wonder also that at the high school level, if you have a transgender athlete just in your state, in your conference, I have to imagine that affects scholarships too because you're placing differently. Thus, you're like less competitive for a scholarship. Does that make sense? Is that the case? Yes, very much so. And it affects where, you know, oh, well, this person has a biological male on their team. Maybe we should recruit biological men so we can compete with them. And so it's this terrible cycle, this vicious cycle that these schools and these teams are being faced with because they want to be competitive, even if it goes against their moral standards and they're, you know, ethically what's right. Some teams are willing to compromise to have chances of success. How did social media affect the way the story played out in your opinion? I'm actually sure it helped you in some way, find an audience and find people who were supportive, but even just on a personal level between everyone that was forced into this strange situation, all of you guys that were swimming at that level at that time, how did social media affect the unfolding of the story? I think it was nice to finally give a platform to someone other than just what the media had been running off already. And that's something I've gotten a lot of flack for is, oh, you only do right wing media. You're a right wing princess blah, blah, blah, all the stuff. And I'm like, here I am. I've reached out to several left wing media outlets, central, moderate media outlets as well. I've gotten turned down from every single one. They're not willing to have me on. They're not willing to talk about this with someone who's directly been impacted, someone who has an experience and someone who has truth behind their story. So but I do think it's been nice that I have gotten to do a lot of media with it, a lot of it being, of course, right winged, which it feels like I'm kind of preaching to the choir, which is why I wanted to expand the audience of who really heard because it's great when I'm on Fox all the time. But those people agree with me. I want to reach people who are on the fence or don't know the real facts behind what's happening, which is why also I've partnered with IWS is because we have the same mission in terms of the audience we're trying to reach, which I think is just so fantastic. Social media has been huge. Lots of parents have reached out to me thanking me because they don't want to see their daughter ever in a locker room with a guy. They don't want, you know, opportunities taken away from their kids. But of course, along with all the good, there's been some negative. Lots of, you know, people saying these terrible, awful things about me, which I've realized are all just personal attacks because no one can invalidate what I'm actually saying because I'm not speaking opinions. I'm not speaking something that's deeply rooted in any sort of transphobia or anything like that. What I'm saying is exactly what happened in scientific facts. So I get a lot of, oh, you're bad at something. Maybe you should just try it harder or you're just transphobic or you're ugly and I'm like, okay, whatever. I'm fortunate that I have such an amazing support system within my family and my husband and my friends and my university. My university has been so fantastic to me since speaking out, which I'm realizing is totally an anomaly. That is. I'm really surprised by that. Yeah. No, I have been very fortunate in my athletic director at University of Kentucky. Oh my gosh, he's the greatest. His name is Mitch Barnhart. I could not say enough good things about him. My coaches as well, Lars Jorgensen. So if there are any potential future swimmers or athletes looking for a university, I promise a university in Kentucky is the best. But I'm fortunate that I'm secure with myself. I realize these people saying these terrible awful things about me are insecure. They're the ones with no profile picture. They're the ones who had never ever dreamed of saying this to me in real life. And it's coming from a place of their own insecurity rather than anything bad they actually had to say about me. And I'm fortunate that I'm strong in my convictions and my beliefs and I stand firm. Yeah. One person I've seen mentioned your story a good bit and who actually was at the gala where you were honored as Tulsi Gabbard. And to your point about wanting to reach people sort of outside of the traditional conservative media space. I know the left is sort of no longer wants to own Tulsi because she's had such a strong stance on this issue and others. But what's it been like to talk to people like Tulsi Gabbard and to on the occasions you had to connect with folks on the left? What has that been like? It's great. Tulsi is just such a leader across so many aspects. I have admired her for a while and just how she stands firm. And so to really spend some time connecting with her these past couple months really, she's become a friend. She is just someone who I know is willing to do the right thing regardless of the cost. And so that's something that I truly admire and I think we as a country should value more of because there are so few people regardless of where you fall on the political spectrum who are willing to do that. Willing to denounce your own political party because you realize it's changed. It doesn't fit your beliefs. That's really rare. And it's something that I've realized is rare dealing with people across the country all over the political spectrum. On the right side included, there are some people who you can tell aren't genuine. But she's one of the ones who really, really is just intentional. And I think that's something that speaks a lot of her and what she's willing to do for this country. So yeah, her willingness to be outspoken on this issue to me seems to indicate a sea change. And one of the questions I had for you is whether you're sensing something similar because there's always this to borrow a phrase. There's always been clearly a silent majority on this particular issue of people who just have common sense about it. Most Americans are pretty supportive of people deciding to identify however they want. We're pretty conservative on this podcast, but the rest of the country, there's a lot of acceptance of all of these different things. And on this issue though, most people are with you. Most people understand this is completely ridiculous, but most corporations and most media outlets and most public facing people have just not been willing to make that argument and have in fact demonized people who made that argument as though as you said earlier, Riley are transphobic bigots. So are you sensing that the people, the sort of common sense majority are taking this issue back? Are you seeing that in any like serious changes, whether to the NCAA to state laws, to universities? Is there anything concrete or is it just kind of a vibe shift? It's definitely I feel like I feel like there's of course been a vibe shift, but I feel like what's happening as of lately in regards to all of the student ideology stuff, whether it be in the education system that's been falling apart. And of course was a big topic in and of elections. I feel like people will start standing up and using their voice more. People who typically aren't your political people, who aren't your people who are going to be super outspoken on issues. There's a couple things in life you don't mess with and I think one of those is people's children regardless of what age. And so I feel like people will start to use their voice more, which will then in turn these companies, these larger organizations who have put in place all of these policies that go against the larger majority, they will reconvene and reassess. That's my prediction. But of course, I know I've been known to be naive before in thinking the Insta-Blay, maybe all of it happened by chance, but I truly think people will start to use their voice because that's something that's crucial. My last question is about the locker room issue because I think this gets glossed over in a lot of the coverage about the fairness in sports, which is such an obvious issue and it's a powerful one because it's common sense. But as somebody who was in this situation, Riley, I know some people might be dismissive of what that's like. And especially in your case where it's a high profile transgender athlete with the sort of eyes of the world upon the situation and it's a little bit different. But at the same time, I wanted to ask about that experience from your perspective and about the issue more broadly, what your worries are for other young women. Right. I will say in regards to the locker room situation, I think people have this preconceived misconception that if you are swimming in the female's category as a transgender, you've gone through reassignment surgery, you fully align with a female. But that is so far from the truth. All you have to do to compete in the female's category is say, identify as a female. They are welcoming with open arms. And so when you're in a locker room, which I will say in swimming, it's not a modest place in the locker room, the female locker room. These suits you put on, they take about 15 minutes to put on. So you know, you're fully naked for an extended period of time, but you've done it your whole life. And so you feel super comfortable in that situation being surrounded by other female athletes who are doing the same thing as you. But when I was at that swim meet, our instability championships and the locker room is a buzzing place. You get to see friends from all over. You haven't seen all year across the country. It's so much fun. And then you turn it's dead silent. It gets dead silent and you turn around and you see someone who's six four with male parts, searching other girls on dress. How can we be okay with that? How in the world have we allowed this to happen? And silence about this part of it, because you're right, the fairness piece and the safety piece, those are pretty easy to see. But the locker room situation, what in the world? But then again, you're stuck with who do you talk to about this? What do you say? Do you be like Blake Allen and go to these event coordinators and then potentially risk getting suspended or your scholarship taken away or losing out on opportunities? And so that piece of it to me is disturbing because Leah Thomas at this point was so fully attracted to women was still engaging in acts with women. Of course, identifying as lesbian, which is a whole different conversation and very confusing. But how are we okay with this? Stopping someone from just saying they identify as a woman with ulterior motive from going into a woman's locker room. And you've seen this all around the country from places like the YMCA, Planet Fitness, all of these places who have fully welcomed and accepted transgender people, transgender women and the female locker room. But yeah, and even if it's not done in that sort of cynical, hypothetical, which surely will happen and has happened, as you explained, it's already a deeply uncomfortable situation for women. Right. That's why women have a basis. And look at what's happening in women's prisons. There's been tons of stories of trans women identifying as women going in there and impregnating other women. Now, not a biologist, but I know a woman cannot get another woman pregnant without any sort of other things going on there. But that's happening. It's happened across the country. So it's not even just sports at this point. It's affecting is there's lots of examples. Well, Riley, I'm so glad that you have at least delayed your plans to go to dental school and are working so hard on this issue right now because your voice is really important. Your experience is really important. And your willingness to share about your experience and to do so with moral clarity is just in valuable. So thank you for all that you're doing. I think it's really brave and really appreciate you coming on the show, Riley. Well, thank you so much. And again, thank you for just the opportunity to shed light. More people, this more people need to hear it. And so I appreciate you guys giving me an outlet. It's very, very much needed and appreciated. And did you say you started a group? I think you mentioned that before we started taping. Yeah, so I started a federal PAC called 9 PAC. It's a political action committee that is willing to endorse candidates who are willing to help restore and protect Title IX, really. We had an administration, the Biden administration actively doing the opposite of that by rewriting Title IX to equate gender identity to sex. And so this past election cycle, I was able to donate a lot of money to different candidates who are willing to stand up for what's right. Is there a place people can go to check that out or website or anything? Yes, it's www.9 PAC.org. There are places to donate and lots of information there and just ways to get in contact as well. If anyone is listening and has been directly impacted or would like to hear more or have any questions, that's a good outlet to reach me by. Good stuff. All right. Well, Riley, thank you so much. Of course. Thank you. I appreciate it. Of course. You've been listening to another edition of the Federalist Radio Hour. I'm Emily Jaczynski, Culture Editor here at The Federalist. We'll be back soon with more. Until then, be lovers of freedom and anxious for the fray."
