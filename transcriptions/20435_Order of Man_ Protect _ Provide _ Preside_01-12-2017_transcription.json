    "text": " You're a man of action. You live life to the fullest. Embrace your fears. And boldly charge your own path. When life knocks you down, you get back up one more time, every time. You are not easily deterred or defeated. Rugged, resilient, but strong. This is your life. This is who you are. This is who you will become. At the end of the day, and after all is said and done, you can call yourself a man. Gentlemen, what is going on today? I hope all is going well. My name is Ryan Mickler and I am the host and the founder of this podcast, The Order of Man. This is a show about becoming a better man in every facet of your life. Your home, your business, your community, everywhere that you have a responsibility to show up. And we're interviewing the world's most successful men. We're sharing those conversations with you. So if you would, make sure you subscribe so you never miss a single episode. Now, if you are new, you might not know that this show, our Friday show, is a little different because you get to listen to just me talk about some things I've been thinking about from throughout the week. But before I get into today's topic, I do want to let you know that I have a new book coming out in February. I am going to be releasing the title soon, so stay on the lookout for that. And I'm going to be holding a book launch party and a meetup in Nashville the end of January. It's January 26th and 27th, 2018. We're going to be having some keynotes, some Q&A activities, and of course, the camaraderie that comes from surrounding yourself with other men who are on the same journey as you and the same journey as I. And when you register, you're also going to get a signed copy of that new book. So make sure you get registered. Do it quickly. Spots are filling up. You can do that at order of man.com slash Nashville. Order of man.com slash Nashville. Now, let's get into this discussion today. I want to talk with you about being a patriarch. The other day I had made a comment in our Facebook group about being a patriarch and somebody suggested that I put that phrase on a shirt, but I thought it would be better to explain that here, what it means to be a patriarch, what it's all about, and some key factors to becoming a patriarch in your home and in your family. Very simply, a patriarch is the male leader of a family. It's becoming painfully obvious that we are lacking male leadership in the home. If you look at divorce rates, they are on the rise and they have been for a while. The amount of young boys and girls who are growing up without fathers is scary to even think about. And I don't even think that we've begun to see the fallout from the leaderless homes that we are experiencing. Already, we see young boys and girls who are confused about their gender. We see violence, addiction, and the fact that sexual misconduct perpetuated by men is seemingly climbing as well. I can't help but think that a lot of these problems could be addressed by worthy and honorable male leadership in the home. That is evident to me that we are lacking. I don't think all of these problems would go away, but if more men would lead their families the way they're meant to be led, much of the negativity that we see in society today would dwindle. And I want to be really clear when I talk about this. I know that there are situations in which the mother is responsible for leading the home. Maybe dad is out of the picture for whatever reason, but regardless of that, a man's influence in the home cannot be replicated. Men and women are different. Women are great in certain areas and men might fall short in those areas. And where men are great in certain areas, women might fall short. And this is why it's so crucial that there be both a masculine and feminine presence in the home. And specifically, I want to talk with you about the masculine presence in the home because that's somewhere we as a society seem to be falling short with. Look, if you're a father and a husband, your job is to lead. Period. You were designed to lead. You were born to lead. And what's really fascinating about this is that the majority of women I talk with who tune into what we're doing here are craving men who lead with honor and strength and integrity. So today of all the factors that make you and I the patriarchs of the family that we've been called to be, I want to talk with you about three specifically. So the first factor is vision. This is absolutely crucial in your calling as the family's patriarch. It is your job to determine the direction of the family and the mission of the family. And as I say that, I know there's a lot of families who don't even have an objective or a mission. But if your family doesn't have a purpose, what exactly are you working towards? And how can you even know that you're on the right track? The truth is you can't. Too many men and by default, too many families are wandering around aimlessly without a benchmark to shoot for or to strive to. I used to have friends that had parents that didn't care about what they did and how late they were out and what trouble they were getting into. Their fathers were more concerned with being their kids as friends than they were with being their fathers. And I used to think and wonder how cool it would be if that was my situation. But I look back and I think how sad that my friends had no leadership, no purpose and no sense of direction perpetuated by the father who's supposed to do those things. Now with that said, I do recognize that a wife and a mother has a say, of course, in the direction of her family, my wife and I lead together. And I've never made a major family decision without her guidance and direction and support. I'm not suggesting that you do it on your own without her input. I'm suggesting that you take the initiative to talk about and identify a vision for your family. That is where it starts, gentlemen. Next, communication. You've got to be able to communicate the vision that we just talked about. If you can't or you won't share what's on your mind and the direction that you would like to go, you're never going to get buy-in from your wife and your children. Now some guys, I know we'll say, well, that doesn't matter. My family's just going to do what I tell them to do. And to that I say, you might be right, but for how long? No one is going to follow a leader indefinitely who cannot be empathetic to the family's needs and desires and wishes and effective communication is about taking all of that into consideration as you articulate the direction for the family. It's not always easy, guys. It's not always fun, but it's not supposed to be. It's challenging to have the types of conversations that you're going to need to have on your path to keeping your family on the right track. But like I said before, you and I as men are uniquely qualified to handle those types of situations. And the third component I want to talk to you about today is that of structure. Every family needs structure and systems and discipline in order to operate effectively. Again, this is the part that isn't necessarily the funnest part, but it's critical. You have a noble calling and that requires strength and grit and fortitude, and it also requires the support system in place in order to help you achieve the mission. Are you meeting with your family regularly? Do your children know what is expected from them and the consequences should they fall short of those expectations? Are there boundaries that are not to be crossed and that are enforced? Is everyone on the same page or is there confusion and chaos within the walls of your home? These are all powerful questions that can be answered and need to be answered in order for you to step more fully into that role of patriarch. I know that there are going to be those who think that maybe this information I'm sharing today or this thought process is antiquated and outdated, and to that I agree. It is a traditional way of looking at things, but I have you consider that the traditional way of managing a home is not the problem, but the deviation from it. I know that there's a lot of factors at play here, guys, and of course there's no way for me to cover every situation and family dynamic. I didn't have what I'm talking with you about right now in my family growing up. My dad was out of the picture and my mother raised me and my sister primarily on her own. I know there are circumstances where it doesn't always work out like this, but if you have the opportunity and the capability, your family needs you to step up. They need your vision and your direction and your guidance, your structure, your support, your discipline, all of it. They need all of you. And not only do they need it, it's your job. You are the patriarch. Gentlemen, as we wind down today, I do want to invite you to join us in our exclusive brotherhood, the Iron Council. This may just be the tool that you need to step up in your family as a husband and a father. I'm amazed, amazed, and shocked, quite honestly, at how many messages I get from men who want to save their marriages and their families, but they're not willing to put in a little time and investment to make the changes. They pretend that they want so bad. If you want something different out of your life, you are going to have to do something different. The Iron Council has all the tools and the resources and the guidance and support and direction to help you become the patriarch of your home. And a leader, a leader in your business and your community, wherever you're showing up, you can join us at OrderOfMan.com.com. That's OrderOfMan.com.com. Gentlemen, I look forward to talking with you next week, but until then, take action, be the patriarch of your family, and become the man you are meant to be. Thank you for listening to the Order of Man podcast. You're ready to take charge of your life. To be more of a man you were meant to be, we invite you to join the Order at OrderOfMan.com."
