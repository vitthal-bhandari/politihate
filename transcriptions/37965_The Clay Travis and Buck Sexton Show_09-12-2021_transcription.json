    "text": " Welcome back in clay Travis Buck Sexton show appreciate all of you hanging out with us We opened up the show talking about a good article good work being done on the pen Pennsylvania you you pen trans swimmer by Joe Kinsey He is a writer at out kick the site that I run if you haven't checked out out kick comm and you're a sports fan And you think the world has gone insane Hopefully we'll make it a little bit more sane for you there and Joe does fantastic work Joe good job on this first story. I know there's a second story from a then additional pin women swimmer that is going up tomorrow morning So I want to start with this question. How did you come to get in contact with these girls? Why did they reach out to you and why do they want their story told throughout kick? Play thanks for having me on listen we we've been writing this story about the Leah Thomas For about 10 to 14 days now and last week One source was tipped off that we had written a story and she was comfortable enough to To do a phone interview and really share her emotions about what is going on with this team And she felt comfortable, you know with the out kick that we were gonna tell her story fairly and we don't have an agenda here we're just telling the story about what's going on and Now we have another another swimmer on the pen women's team that is stepped forward and that'll be coming soon Joe, it's buck good to meet you and good work on the story want to know when you're talking to your source here To the degree you can tell us You know, what are they worried or in this case this this one woman in particular worried Will happen if they wouldn't come forward? I mean usually when athletes are upset about something particularly if they think something unfair has happened whether it's reps or anything else They're pretty vocal about it. Obviously these women on this team who are upset don't want to be vocal What do they think happens if they were to speak out with their names attached to it? Well, well, thanks for having me on buck listen last week these first swimmer was she was just concerned about the general climate in society where she was going to be attacked for having a different opinion and That has escalated last night I was told that we now have a situation where the university Called a team mandatory team meeting last night where the swimmers were strongly advised against speaking to media outlets and they were also told that it is Non-negotiable that Lee at Thomas will be swimming for the women's team But we are here to support you however you want to come to terms with it is what the swimmers were told So we have now entered a different phase of this where the school is definitely taking a stance they're definitely telling these athletes not to speak out and And they're these two women are being brave in this moment where they they risk reprisal from the university How wild is this Joe you have covered sports? For your I mean as long as I can remember I read you before you came over and started working with us at out kick Did you ever think we'd end up in a space where a biological man was competing at an Ivy League school one of the elite academic institutions in the country and Potentially going to set all-time women swimming records as a man swimming as a woman I mean this is it's through the looking glass level crazy isn't it? Clay when I keep putting that towards you know the whole record thing to these women They're just blown away They're they're like us they're completely perplexed on what this means for the the sport other than all the records are going to be smashed in the freestyle race They're looking at the Olympics. They're like what does this mean for the Olympics? So you have what's coming in March is these times are going to win national titles and as a country as a swimming nation There they haven't even come to terms with this because these records are just being smashed over the last two weeks And they tell me the swimmers tell me that these times are going to be lowered clay and it's just absurd to think that They're now being strongly advised against speaking out against something that is going to completely affect them Completely affect the sport these times are going to be lowered clay to the point to where they may never be broken again unless by another transgender athlete It's interesting Joe it comes across in the piece that you wrote for out kick that The coach seems to be on board and actually kind of excited about this is that where things are? I mean now it's very tough to tell I would think as an outsider is the coach towing the line because of just the politics around this and seeming excited or is the coach happy that he I'm assuming it's a he I don't know The coach may actually now have the national champion swimmer on the team You know what I'm saying like a is a do we have some sense from the the people have spoken out about this as Whether the coach is just on board for a top-to-bottom or feels pressured to be on board Well, I think there's two different things going on here buck I think that the first source told us that the coach just likes to win and that he's looking at this Like this is gonna go on my record as a wind and that's great for me. I'm a coach The second source said that this is now become a situation in her opinion that the coach is Just going along with it so that he's not gonna rock the boat. He's not gonna get attacked He's gonna say listen I just have to go along with what the university says and the university says this is what we're gonna do I just have to go along with it and so You have a combination of things going on here. You have the fear of what could happen if you spoke out Versus the love it when it's on my record. So two different things going on Joe I want to read this quote because I read it to start the show And I think some people may have missed it because they weren't listening this Pen female swimmer who spoke to you that's on this team that is now being dominated by a biological man a transgender swimmer Who swim for the men and now is swimming for the women? She said when I have kids I kind of hope they're all boys Because if I have any girls that want to play sports in college Good luck their opponents are all gonna be biological men saying they're women right now We have one before what if we have but what if we had three on the team there'd be three less girls competing That to me is the essence of this right all of these women have been getting up Bright and early in the morning their parents have been taking them their whole lives for them to be able to excel enough For them to be able to compete at an Ivy League level and then out of nowhere a man decides to be a woman And he crushes all of them making their work and their excellence and their pursuit of championships Totally not able to be accomplished no matter how hard they work This represents a straight on existential threat to women sports doesn't it? Completely clay and if you listen to the experts the people that have been fighting for title 9 for their whole lives they They know that they have a come they have a huge fight on their hands here For these women that they had fought four years ago and now all of a sudden look we have this other threat coming and it's Tor it's from a transgender perspective and So these women that are on these teams again, no scholarships clay These are just these just women that get up and want to swim for their school and yet They have to deal with this where they're just getting crushed in the pool I'm being told that in Akron there were tears there were there was no cheering for Leah There were massive cheers for the for the woman that finished 38 seconds behind in the mile so, you know, there's There are some serious emotions going on here and these women they they they they feel like they have nothing Nobody out there to support them. So this is a this is a fight. They're in Joe second story is gonna be up tomorrow. You've got another woman's story. It's an outkick comm Appreciate all the work that you're doing and keep it up my man Thanks, right. Thanks. Thanks so much for being with us. That's Joe Kinsey.

By accidentally reaching for what she thought was her taser was actually her gun and firing it that trial underway right now Also, just you small that we could have a verdict in pretty soon Let you know the latest on that but right now. We are very pleased be joined by our friend Kaley McEnany. She's a former White House press secretary Under president Trump co-host of Fox's out number the fantastic show which I've enjoyed doing very much as has clay Author of such a time as this my faith journey through the White House and beyond new book out Kaley great to have you Hey great to join you buck and clay and the great late Rush Limbaugh's former hours He was a big inspiration of mine and it's great to join the two people have taken over the rain Thank you so much, Kaley. So, you know, I gotta ask you first about what happens in front of Fox News huge Christmas tree burned burned down effectively By somebody who is clearly disturbed clearly has problems there were issues with him even a few days before this They say he's emotionally unwell. He's committed crimes in the past. We're talking about What's leading to the huge nationwide surge in cities coast to coast of murders? And then there's also property crimes. There's mass theft occur in retail theft occurring This is a guy who's already Kaley. He burned the Fox Christmas tree down. He's already out on bail Yeah, and he's clearly disturbed and when he was coming out of the courtroom after being already out after this just happening He denied he committed the arson. He shouted obscenities at reporters And then he asked them for a cigarette and he shouted something to the effect of the moms that want to race their belief daughters They said it on fire. This is a deranged individual It's someone whose father said he was mentally ill and he can't control him and he's out on the street And and buckets like watching something play out in slow motion where you see what happened in Waka Shawn We hope this guy doesn't doesn't do anything violent But you see in Waka shaw the same thing where someone gets out on bail and the worst thing that could possibly happen does where You have people who died at a parade celebrating Christmas. It's like watching his play out time and time again And knowing it is indeed preventable if you didn't have these liberal Creeps who just let these guys back out on the street Kaley, I appreciate you joining us. This is clay I got a wonder when you watch Jen Socky and her White House press briefings How much different does she get treated than you did and how? Glaring is I would imagine that difference to you. What do you notice the most? Oh clay? I it's Really interesting to watch and and my new book for such a time as this my face turning through the White House and beyond I actually do a question comparison where you know I'm asked, you know, why would president Trump hire people who are dumb as a rock, you know versus Jen Socky who was asked about the White House cat. That's not parody. She actually asked about the White House cat Biting incident with the White House dog her first briefing. She was asked. I mean this just I couldn't believe what I was watching She's asked how does it feel for Joe Biden to walk into the Oval Office? He's been waiting for this for so long. I mean these are actual questions being asked It is total softball and still, you know, she doesn't always seem to bring her facts She has missed truth like Republicans wanted to fund the police and no Americans are stranded in Afghanistan And there's no accountability in the aftermath of those complete and total falsehoods. Those are too much many Speaking to Kayleigh Mac and any former White House press secretary under President Trump new book out For such a time as this my faith journey through the White House and beyond Kayleigh The Biden administration doesn't have a lot to point to if really anything to point to that is Well, could we say a rhetorical victory lap, right? There's not a lot that they can say we've done a good job on this This is why you voted for us and they're going into a mid-time This is all the data supports this right now, right? The the Hispanic vote is basically 50 50 between Democrat and Republican right now People wish they had voted for Trump who actually have learned for Biden the last election by pretty Stunning numbers. I mean we're seeing this all across the board Independence things Biden's doing a bad job on the economy on immigration all of this. What are your expectations? For what this White House is going to try to do in order to stop the political bleeding so to speak going into the mid-term Like what should we be ready for them to say? Well, I think we see it and it's no facts no footnotes Nothing of the sort but just convincing their media lapdogs to come running back their lap and say all is well and good start parroting They talking points on the chief of staff wrong claims Twitter feed I mean if you want a case study or a masterclass use Hillary's I guess new term that she's teaching if you want a masterclass Delusion go to the chief of staff Twitter feed I mean you have a dismal jobs numbers come out and then he comes out and says the jobs numbers are actually good Because I guess unemployment tick down by a tenth of a percentage even though we vastly under Paste expectations, you know, he says you should be saying thank you Joe Biden this all comes after Afghanistan and rampant inflation And the polling showing Americans notices that's what they'll try to do They're not going to succeed and this new Ulster journal poll that came out you referenced being tied among Hispanic voters Which is fascinating and a huge victory for Republicans, but when you look at the issues of importance number one is immigration number two economy Number three inflation number four healthcare Healthcare is where the Democrats succeed it is now a marginalized issue in comparison to others and that is you line up having Immigration one economy too that looks a whole lot like what we saw in 2015 2016 when a man named Donald Trump took everyone by surprise and won the election because liberals told us no one cared about immigration Kaylee people have lost their mind on many different issues But what we're starting to see is some of this pushback and we started the show today with a story that I know You've talked about and paid some attention to University of Pennsylvania has a transgender swimmer who is now threatening to set all-time records for NCAA women's swimmers We've got it out kick a couple of different of those swimmers who are now speaking out and telling their story and these women swimmers think it's totally ridiculous What is the spin for we were talking earlier about Joe Biden may be asked about whether he thinks Transgender swimmers should be able to compete like this against women What's the White House spin and what do you think the nation as a whole thinks about the idea? I know you've got a pro athlete that you married What do you think the nation thinks about as a whole when it comes to men getting to choose to compete against women by changing their gender? Yeah, I think there's a collective I roll that that our young women who you know work hard I have a sister who was a female athlete and the SEC at University of Florida She was a hurdler and you know, it's a lot of work tough It's grueling and the idea that you would have to compete against someone who's biologically different from you I mean that is scientific you they are biologically different It is a different gender and that all of your work hard work is for not because you just simply cannot compete on the same level It's devastating for women. It's devastating for girls fourth I mean I was looking at out picks some of the great work you guys have done on this issue and the fact that you have a a You pin female swimmer who has you know been trounced by transgender athletes who have come into these races She has to speak out on condition of anonymity for fear a future employment You know liberals have created this eggshell culture where you cannot speak out against transgender athletes in women's force Where you cannot decry criminal race theory or you're a lunatic Where you cannot lock criminals up they have created this kind of Tender box of cultural issues that they think they're on the right side of because it's woke culture But that will ultimately come back to backfire We saw the same thing in 2016 where you couldn't talk about immigration or you were a racist You couldn't you know talk loudly and profess conservatism or we would decry you as falsely into Sammett or Lee as a white supremacist as they tried to do to Donald Trump They've created that same cultural tender box and I do think it'll backfire most common sense Americans just say hey This doesn't seem all that fair. We're speaking to Kayleigh Mac and any former White House press secretary under President Donald Trump Kayleigh Just mentioned the man's name. I know a lot of people ask and a lot of people wonder Just what's your take right now on the likelihood? We know it's not a certainty We know the man hasn't announced but the likelihood that Donald J Trump may give it another go I'm gonna take a very reserved guest and say 110% he's going to run. I can't imagine a scenario when he does it You know I get the sense he's rearing and ready to be back out there You know that being said we'll see what he decides after the midterm elections But what the great thing is about our party is we have a I mean a very deep bench and from Florida Ron DeSantis is a total complete rock star. I think he'll be president one day. I don't know when that will be but one day I think he will be I mean deep bench. Tim Scott. There are so many others Pompeo my tent is great I mean we have so many thought leaders in our party and I mean you look at the left and Joe Biden I mean if he doesn't run you've got common waiting in the wings. Okay, great. I'll take my chances against her Buddha judge sure take my chances against him. I guess that's the best they've got and I even heard this morning You know Fox and Friends first They were saying maybe even Hillary Clinton could throw her hat back in the ring. Please please do a common Hillary I would I would love a ticket like that. We've got a defense and I think Trump runs But we'll see when do you think that would be awesome? I know for many of our listeners if Trump runs When do you think he would go about selecting a vice presidential candidate and what would you expect him to cuz Cook to consider when he made that choice because as you said there is a really deep bench But given the fact that he could only be president for one more term that would be a default Theoretically 2028 massive favorite to be the nominee. Who do you think would make the most sense? You know, I think you know president Trump has gotten things Always lead him to the right choice there and he did mention Ron DeSantis a few months ago I think that'd be a fantastic choice. I think that that would set him up nicely for a 2028 run But you know that being said I hate to lose him from my great state of Florida Of course, he's governor until 2026 if he wins this cycle and I do believe you will I don't see a chance for anyone else, but you know, I also like someone like Tim Scott I think Tim Scott brings to this party a face a commitment to His order and savior that he brought out quite locally in his state of the Union rebuttal isn't an interesting It wasn't the state of the Union rebuttal rather a rebuttal to the National address the first year of a presidency That's what it's called his rebuttal for the first time I can remember and modern political history was a rating success Normally we laugh at the rebuttal on his is success with his fourth right honest And faithful and hey DeSantis would be great Tim Scott would be great. There's a whole lot of choices out there That would be a great running mate if Trump decides to run Kelly, thanks so much for being with us always great to talk to you and everybody should check out my Four such a time is this my faith journey through the White House and beyond Kelly's new book, which is out Kelly. Thanks so much Thanks so much fucking clay. Have a good one Appreciate you Kaylee.

I think she is talking about the city council today voting And clake we just put a pin in this i'm seeing right now the Pfizer ceo saying I think we're gonna need a fourth A fourth dose just because if people are wondering why I was struggling with the math yesterday It's because the numbers change by the day. We'll come back. We'll come back to that though back to this That just flashed on the screen from cnn New York cities council, okay, and we've got our wor listeners all over the the tri-state right now Who know all about this? I'm sure New York cities council is super left wing Okay, so even if you have eric adams the new mayor Not a full-on marxis trying to destroy new york as deblazio his predecessor still is You're gonna have big problems. You have a very radical left aoc style city council and they're voting today to give 800 000 illegal aliens Sorry voting rights not citizenship voting that they can't do that voting rights for city Office holders so they'll be able to pick the mayor city council members other municipal office holders They will not be able to vote for president members of congress state elections So obviously they can't vote at the federal level they can't vote for state office holders either because this is only a city ordinance, but clay the the democrat embrace of Lawlessness in the service of their political interests is something that everyone needs to Really see for what it is because it's only going it's only going to get worse We have sanctuary city jurisdictions all across the country where local law enforcement is told by mayors I mean at new york is the largest sanctuary jurisdiction in the united states There are they say it's 800 000 most people say it's more like a million illegal immigrants in New York city alone a million It's bigger than most u.s cities uh, so a lot of states bigger than a lot of states and here we have not just the We won't work with federal authorities to help enforce federal law with local law enforcement Which only happens really on the immigration issue. Okay, that's that's one part of it. The other part of it is the democrat party Celebrates and is in favor of illegal immigration they explicitly Rewarded they want to reward people who come here illegally and here you're seeing it They want to get them voting as quickly as possible They still want an amnesty at the federal level the bide administration Would sign it and ram it through in a heartbeat if they could And to people in new york were paying outrageous taxes city tax on top of high new york state tax What if I just don't want to pay what why should I obey that law right? Well, why is that law? Uh, something that i'm bound by but people can be here in violation of federal law They're not even supposed to be under federal law in new york period full stop They get to determine who my mayor is clay that seems like a problem Several things here One i'm not sure this is legal Okay, it's a far expanse and as you said it's local elections not federal elections But you know how this argument goes right If you are allowed to have them vote in local elections soon the argument will become Well, if it's legal for them to vote for mayor, why shouldn't they be able to vote for congressperson? Why shouldn't they be able to vote for governor? That's the logical extension of this argument make no mistake What's going on here? This is a clear attempt to get a opportunity a a a land grab of sorts and then be able to expand it It's a beachhead that could lead to something larger. Okay. It's wild. It's crazy I'm even trying to work through it in my head. I can't remember even debating this in any point of law school Whether a city could decide to allow non-legal residents to vote in a citywide election it's it's really a case to my knowledge without precedent Second San Francisco has done this they've done this too san francisco did this for but hold on just to be clear because you're right about The level and degree of this they did it for school board elections in san francisco With the element being the kids are in school anyway And so they should have a voice in their in their school board That was the argument right but they have not yet done it for mayor or city council They haven't expanded again. It's a pretty expansive argument I don't know what the natural outcome here would be here's the second part of this I'm gonna try to be a little bit optimistic because I think you're right about The desire for illegals to be given increasingly more rights Wall Street journal poll that came out that you referenced and we talked about a little bit yesterday and you just referenced at the beginning of our with uh, Kayleigh mcconating Buck how much does this change? If democrats start not having a massive advantage with hispanic voters What if in 2024 The beachhead to use my beachhead analogy, which we clearly saw Established in the state of florida down in miami and south florida where we got a ton of listeners When the venas wailens and the cubans and all of those hispanic voters came out and Overwhelmingly supported donald trump because they hate socialism and they don't want america to turn into the countries that they left behind We saw that in south texas too in a big way What if that beachhead is expanding because I think it is into the hispanic vote how quickly Would democrats alter their calculus if all of a sudden this Dreamed for massive advantage that they were going to have with hispanic voters with the latinx voters as they like to call them What if that doesn't come to reality buck and the only people like to call them that are our msnbc host Yes, you know the the hispanic community is like, please stop the latinx. They're just really annoying They hate it. The what if it doesn't come to fruition? Well, this is what i mean remember the hispanic as I understand that the polling is showing legal Immigrants and his and the hispanic community people born here obviously within the hispanic community in america Are who's being pulled so the democrats hope to change this dynamic? You're seeing playing out of a not good economy that the hispanic community recognizes is the by administration's not delivering but also legal immigrants, you know talk to a cuban in florida right now about how they feel when they hear that You know 15,000 20,000 at a time in these caravans are coming across the us mexico border and being allowed to stay in the country They they do not like that um, but also beyond that the possibility of amnesty and then you always get into this discussion about people say it's it's 12 million now Officially, I mean it's 11.7 or something like that Space could 12 million officially a lot of people you'll speak to in border patrol or just they say it's 15 million It's 20 million. It's it's definitely more than that and so a mass amnesty uh, would take years and years to even implement fully in terms of getting everybody of the full citizenship and voting rights democrats would want to give them Uh, and they view that as a game changer for their electoral prospects, which is why they even try to sneak it through in the in the big Try to do in the budget reconciliation. That's right. They try to use budget reconciliation to Create outside of existing law, you know 15 million 12 million whatever it is new voters Come into more of this friends. We've also got updates for you as they come in on both the officer potter trial in minnesota and the jussies small let trial in Chicago, lonnoy, we could get clay right we could get a small let verdict Concepable at any point I believe at any moment today So we could even have a and i'm gonna tell you this And I got to say clay clay said this to me and I had to tell him, you know, I it hadn't actually crossed my mind as a possibility and it should What if this jury just finds him not guilty because you know, so sure you nullification Yeah, what if they decide I liked him in empire who cares? I it hadn't real I just had been assuming and you never assume with a jury So I I give myself a demerit for that one When you're a family this holiday season exchange and gifts Let me suggest one that will start all kinds of excitement and anticipation It's a legacy box from the company with that same name legacy box They digitally transfer all the old family videos movies and pictures and put them into digital files or dvd's It starts with one or more family members determining which of those old family movies everyone wants to see again That's what legacy box does for families They bring those memories back to life You send that specially made box off to legacy boxes facilities in tennessee with their special deal on overnight shipping That way the contents are safe and trackable in several weeks time legacy box returns all of those family memories Along with brand new dvd's or computer thumb drives or actual digital files It's easy to copy and share with family and makes for a great gift clay Yeah, there's no doubt and with christmas just around the corner.

Testing or making sure that everyone is vaccinated that you spend time with over christmas We do it a little bit different at the paul household You know my parents will have us down in texas Well about 57 immediate family members And we require that everyone reads the constitution and understand the constitution before they get admitted for family dinner If anybody believes in vaccine mandates or any of the nonsense that fauci promotes They are either going to sit at the kids table or have to sit outside So way it should be fantastic. Dr. Dr. paul senator paul. Sorry we go back and forth great great titles both You might have heard this we wanted to play it for you. Here is the Pfizer CEO Saying maybe a a fourth shot actually would be a good idea I think we will need the first dose with the previous I was projecting that that would be only 12 months After the self-goats and with all the We need to wait and see because you have very little information we may need it faster Dr. paul this senator paul sorry i keep doing that but it's good to talk in medical stuff Why should we think that we're not going to end up getting shots forever and for some people maybe four shots in the first 12 months The first thing to think about is is the person talking to you a disinterested party Now if the guy makes what do you think this guy makes 20 30 million dollars a year He makes more by selling you more stuff and he's telling you the stuff he sells you that you need more of And that it works and you ought to take it more often That's sort of what we need independent people who are don't have a monetary gain in giving you the advice So no, he should he should really just be quiet and nobody should pay any attention to this guy The one thing I would ask and I am an independent voice. I don't invest in any of these companies or any investment in this what I would say is Instead of saying we should get a booster of his old vaccine They have a vaccine for the delta variant What we're finding is that there are many illnesses that are escaping this vaccine You it doesn't prevent infection it may prevent serious illness But what would happen if we actually had switched three months ago to the delta variant vaccine they have it And it's already there and they're studying it. How come it hasn't come forward? You know, biden was going to do all these good things In record time Trump came up with a allowed the vaccine to get through We have a delta variant they've had it for months now What are they doing? Where are we in the trials of it? Has anybody compared it to the wild one? And instead of just blankately saying buy my booster shot you can take it this month and you'll probably get it next month And you'll take it every month for the rest of your life Why don't we find out one whether you need it? It may be that the two vaccines you've already taken Maybe enough to prevent serious illness is there really a study showing that we have less serious illness They say you get some more antibodies produced, which is true, but do we know That when you take the booster you'll have less severe illness than if you've only taken the two vaccines I don't know that that's definitely proven but also what about the delta variant vaccine? Does it work? Does it work any better? What do we have to do to speed up the approval process? We get a flu vaccine every year. How come you know, we're not doing better at allowing a new vaccine to come forward if it would work better Senator paul First of all, thanks for referencing the constitution and also thanks for being a part of the senate voting 52 to 48 last night to reject joe biden's covet vaccine mandate For private businesses over 100 employees for people out there who are following this story somewhat maybe saw this Why is it significant what the senate voted last night and what will its impact be in your mind? Well, all 50 republicans were together against the mandate and and two moderate democrats So I think that does send a signal that there's a significant part of the public that thinks it's wrong to fire people Who don't choose to do what you think they ought to do? You know that somebody you know that just think of the presumptuousness of people on the left Who think they know what's best for us? And then it would they would presume to tell people that they have to fire us if we don't obey what their opinion is On what kind of medical care we seek But it's also incredibly insulting for doctors and nurses who took care of all of us over the last year And they literally risk their lives every day to take care of covet patients A lot of these doctors and nurses got covet last year. They now have immunity All of the studies and these people read the studies Invocate that their immunities just as good as a vaccine or better And yet despite the science in in in the face of the science We're going to actually mandate that they either take a vaccine that they don't need or be fired I don't know. I just think that that's incredibly insulting. It's it's sort of like oh, yeah You took care of us, but you're yesterday's trash and we're just going to dispose of you Uh without any consideration for your bravery or in your service thing for policeman environment They've been out there doing their job many of them are young and fairly healthy But many of them have gotten covet and survived and have immunity But we're going to fire them if we don't obey some democratic edict It's awful and people ought to continue to push back and this is one step forward It won't become law because Biden would veto it But it's still worth showing the public that a significant number of their elected officials think it's a terrible idea to force people to think a vaccine We're speaking to senator rann paul of kentucky senator you are one of the very few people who has been able to Actually ask dr. Fauci real questions in a forum where he had to at least evade publicly if not answer publicly Where do you think this is all going now? We keep trying to see What the end state here is and i'm hearing about a whole new round for a new vaccine Essentially in march that they're trying to roll out. We talked about four doses We're up. What is it now? 68 percent according to john's hopkins in cases nationwide from even a week ago. Wow, it's a quite a jump 42 percent I'm sorry 42 percent uh, seven day average up from a week ago That's substantial. What happens here? I mean, where do we go? In a free society each individual would make their own decisions But the problem is is we now live in a collectivist society where medicine has become collectivized or socialized All the decision making is made by one person Fauci controls all of the funding people are blackmailed and extorted and felt like they cannot give their opinion or he will take their money from them And so it really is a terrible situation But this is the same problem you have when you centralize authority in an economy if the central planner makes a mistake The whole economy suffers for it when when power is dispersed among all the individual consumers doctors patients Then people can sort of choose their opinion choose a second opinion And you also get innovation because some doctors might try one treatment and it turns out it's working Like one of the things they're talking about right now is an antidepressant flue foxy meme And it looks like it also works as an anti-inflammatory But instead of looking for innovation on this you have fauci and others immediately Clamber to shut down any sort of studies. There are studies on ibermectin right now. There are in uh In the in the clinical trials Approved by the nih and yet cnn and these other ridiculous Bias networks will tell you it's uh some terrible, you know misuse of a drug when it's actually in a trial with the nih right now and we don't yet know the answer and uh I don't know we're in a bad situation right now where we've so centralized the authority making that Many people are suffering and there still are some big questions Well, I do advise taking the vaccine if you're at risk and think it lowers your death rate and your hospitalization There still are some questions more people died this year even though we have now vaccinated 97 percent of people over 75 99 percent of people between age 64 and 75 87 percent of people between 50 and 64 and yet more people died this year So there are some head scratching things now they're just blaming it on the unvaccinated But we had a nursing home in kennedy other day 89 people 87 were vaccinated and they ever they all got it again and eight of them died So this isn't as simple as just blaming it on the unvaccinated I think the vaccine is not working very well anymore for even those who are vaccinated might still help Of some to some extent, but they should tell us why we haven't adapted and gone to another vaccine like we do for the flu each year senator paul I'm in tennessee. Uh, I know you're in kentucky Bucks up in new york city. It seems like we have created Red states where most people for the most part are back to pretty much normalcy The only time I would know that covid really existed still is if I go to an airport and people have to put masks on But many blue states I don't know if you saw the video of the kennigartners in portland, Oregon Who are forced to eat outside sitting on buckets socially distanced and 40 degree weather What's it going to take for the entire country to get back to normalcy? Is it an ass kicking for the democrats in 2022 that finally lets them know that people are fed up with All of their shenanigans. What is the solution here to the country embracing normalcy? What do you think? I think electorally there's a huge way building you saw it in virginia You saw it almost happened in new jersey But it's going to be happening at the state legislative level too because people are tired most of the mandates have come from governors Often without the approval of the state legislature, but you're going to see state legislative offices change in some of these blue states You may even see a blue state turn red over some of this The other thing that's going to happen is if you're hopelessly and helplessly Confined, you know behind a mask or behind these mandates in a blue state people are going to move They've been moving because of high taxes But now people are going to be moving because of loss of personal liberty and there have been some champions I think ronda santis has been a real champion down there Not only in freedom, but also in treatment Have you ever heard dr faucy talk about treating covid? No, he thinks wearing a mask all of your face is going to somehow save you But the thing is is you people are still getting it you have been vaccinated There is a treatment the monoclonal antibodies is probably the best treatment out there But you have to get it before you go to the hospital because dr Fauci and his minions have forbidden you get the drug if you're in the hospital So your listeners need to know if any of them get sick You can start to cut you off there, but when you just said that Why would they be forbidding monoclonal antibodies in hospitals? Well, they take they took a a truism and then applied it with a mandate to screw things up The truism is this the sooner you take the monoclonal antibodies the better they work So if you've had symptoms for less than five days and you take them, it's like a 70 80 reduction in hospitalization and death Let's say you wait 10 days to take it for one reason or another You didn't get to a doctor or you were more resistant to going in you come in on day 10 They admit you to the hospital. They say it's too late And so it doesn't work as well, but it's not zero So for example on day five of symptoms it might be 70 80 reduction in death Let's say you're on day 11 and it's 10 reduction in death But they tell you tomorrow you probably go on the ventilator and then you have a third chance of dying Wouldn't you want to take the 10 percent chance that it might help you? It really would be your choice between you and your doctor and in a Largely a very high fatality once you're on the ventilator You you know shouldn't you have the right to try it, but fauci has so Control such control over this that doctors are threatened with being fired the big corporations that own the hospitals are afraid of him and the rules They're afraid of the liability if they don't treat you according to the government mandate But this has never happened in the past in the past Doctors would try a lot of different things as people are dying and then they would sometimes discover some things put together would work But the bottom line is the monoclonal antibodies and likely steroids are your best hope at some point The other thing that they've they put the kabosh on and have Distained and won't prove is inhaled steroids. There's a doctor in Texas by the new in Bartlett and he's treated a lot of people as an outpatient with this And this is the treatment they give you when you're on the ventilator.
