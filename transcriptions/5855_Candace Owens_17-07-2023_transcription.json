    "text": " All right guys, happy Monday. We are back in Nashville And I'm very excited to dive into this story because I've been obsessed with it over the last 72 hours I am talking of course about Carly Russell. Do you know who Carly Russell is? If you don't know who she is, you must have been under a rock for the 72 hours And you're definitely racist if you don't know who she is and also if you do know who she is and you're following the story You're also a racist guys. I don't make up these rules. I don't make up these internet rules Victim to them all the time but the truth is is that Carly Russell is a woman who vanished after seeing a toddler on the side of the highway She then reappeared at her parents house 48 hours later And so I guess the real question is is Carly Russell about to be bigger than Jesse Smollett's Plus that are on the show we're gonna be discussing a doctor who performs sex change surgeries on trans children He admits that they face a lifetime of infertility and continents and sexual dissatisfaction in a of course now deleted video All that and more today coming up on can of sounds Where do we start where to begin I say that I'm obsessed with the story I can't look away I'm refreshing looking for updates and things are getting really weird. So let's just back this up a Woman her full name is Carly Thea Russell as she goes by Carly Russell went missing The world found out about this because of a man claiming to be her brother on TikTok Take a listen my sister Carly Russell is missing My sister was traveling on I 459 at the leaving work here in Hoover, Alabama She spotted a toddler and she stopped to render aid as any decent human being with a hard would do She contacted 911 as she's been talked and then she spoke with another one of our family members my family member here's a screen and then my sister vanishes Along with that toddler her car and belongings were all left at the scene We have no idea what she is This story is not getting the national coverage that it should and we all know why Yep, we all know why heavily implied there is it's because she's black That's the reason that the story is not getting national attention Which of course is so foolish there are so many stories of people that go missing and Usually unless there's some angle that makes it interesting people don't tend to follow up on it It's sad that that's the truth, you know if a crack head goes missing or prostitute goes missing There's typically not as much interest because you think okay They were living their lifestyles in a manner where maybe they ended up dead in some way, right? But that wasn't the case with Carly Russell in fact I hadn't even seen his TikTok I had read a small headline about the fact that she was missing and what instantly compelled me to want to share this story and to Give it as much attention as possible was the fact that there was a toddler that was included You have a woman who's leaving work and she's a toddler walking down a highway She pulls over and then suddenly she's missing. It's even more horrific than that They they find her wig her phone inside of her purse on the side of the highway and by the way the police had gotten there within five minutes of her phoning 9-1-1 and yet still she was completely gone so obviously I Texted in my pictures immediately. I said I want to cover this story on Monday because it's terrifying It's terrifying. You think that this could actually happen to someone and then I made sure to draw attention to it on my Twitter I tweeted this this is one of the more terrifying new stories. I've read in a long time I hope they find this toddler and Carlea Thia Russell so that was the public sentiment everybody was obviously concerned about not just Carly Russell But this alleged toddler that was walking down a highway in Alabama How could you not be concerned everyone prayed for her safe return and then prayers were answered Miraculously Carly Russell turned up 48 hours later at her parents home And of course that yielded more questions people wanted to know okay Should we still be looking for a toddler? Should we be concerned is there a crazy person on the loose is this a gang is the cartel? What has happened here? bizarrely however public sentiment had shifted so at first the brother condemned you if you weren't talking about Carly Russell because the color of her skin, but then you had a few people online who were saying but if you had any further questions About this story now that Carly Pia Russell was home. Well then it's because you're a racist Here are just a couple of tweets to that effect first up. We have a Gabrielle Perry She wrote from the cradle to the grave. There is no humanity for black women No room for mistakes. No graciousness in perfection Immediate vilification in our errors. There is not one moment where our personhood can exist Not even in relief of it not being stolen Hashtag Carly Russell. Oh my gosh. We should not be asking any questions We're just supposed to be happy that she's alive. That's what she's applying Implying here. It gets worse. Another person tweeted this Please stop demanding what happened to Carly Russell The appetite for trauma porn for black people is disturbing from images of our bloody bodies Posted repeatedly following violent death to our children in great distress Give us peace and privacy as you do Carol and and them I guess you're just saying names that they think are white names there being blatantly racist Yeah, but that's it if you wanted further answers and the toddler walking down a highway And we're being told this one was abducted at around 9 30 p.m. At night Then yeah, no, you're just into black trauma porn now that she's home safe You're supposed to just not ask any questions now I want to make it clear that the majority of people did not fall for this trying to racialize this instance You called for natch national interest and attention the story got national interest and attention and now the national appetite would like some closure It would like to know whether or not there is in fact a kidnapper on the loose if there is somebody that is using a toddler To lure unsuspecting victims into a woods if there is somebody who would so in really in front of all of these cars On what is a busy highway? Just grab someone out of their car and take them. That's that's scary stuff Of course there was public interest, but now they were trying to gaslight the public and say no further questions I can tell you one thing that I found suspicious the first thing is just the fact that she got Allegedly dropped off at her parents house. Yeah, that's a bit weird I'm not going to lie who do you know that gets kidnapped and then after their kidnap for 48 hours and held against their will The perpetrator says hey, where do you where would you like to get dropped off? Oh your parents? I'll say I'll take you there. What's the address doesn't sound right? I also thought it was strange that we learned that the parents phoned the police to say that she was home Okay, but they didn't immediately rush her to the emergency rooms that let me know that she arrived in a good enough physical Condition is obviously if she had been raped or she was harmed They would have instantly gone to the called the police on the way to the hospital And of course again, where is the toddler? Where is the toddler? We have a right to know whether or not there is a child that is still missing and potentially at risk and in danger the mother Carly Russell's mother took to Facebook and Again, I would say the sentiments were a little different coming from the family. She wrote this Great morning. My husband and I want to make this statement again as we did last night It's nothing more to add or take away from how we're feeling right now God is faithful and he has answered our prayers. We are so grateful to each of you for all the acts of kindness and Arasti and compassion that you have shown our baby is safe. Thank you father God We do want to ask for privacy at this time to allow us to just love on our daughter and each other with our close family and friends Also, please consider the fact that we have not slept for three nights And we are mentally and physically exhausted to our media friends I promise you will speak with you and give a general statement in the near future as this is an ongoing investigation We consider the media outlets that care not to share the story law enforcement agencies special investigators city leaders to be our friends And we will be respectful of all for everyone that has message or called to rejoice with us We are so grateful for your concern Just as we made a commitment to not entertain negative thoughts during the time that our daughter was missing We surely will not entertain negative thoughts or statements unvalidated opinions or sheer ignorance at such a joyous time We pray that those that doubt God's power miracles and the power of faith Will be encouraged to draw closer to him and learn the power of positive affirmations and unwavering faith We love each of you and are eternally indebted for your support and love the blessed the Russell's So she's saying a lot, but really nothing. She's basically saying it's now time for you guys So all mind your own business and we'll give an update when we're ready because we're tired again ignoring the fact that the public interest is Now shifted toward this toddler who was allegedly walking down a freeway at 930 at night Wearing just a t-shirt and a diaper According to Carly Russell's 9-1-1 call shortly before she disappeared So she calls 9-1-1 she says I see a toddler walking down and then she calls a relative and says I'm gonna check on the toddler and Then her relative hears a scream and Carly goes missing now that Carly's been found They're saying that we should we shouldn't be asking further questions. They're just not going to entertain anything else seems suspicious a Different update came from Carly's boyfriend chart Carly's boyfriend took to Facebook His name is Tomar LaTrell Simmons and he wrote this I don't even know how to start off this post But to only say thank you to my lord and Savior Jesus Christ for saving my girlfriend's life Also, thank you to everyone who shared a picture came out to the Hoover Med to help us with the search parties and who went and proceeded to tell other People about Carly to bring more awareness to her story I have been going non-stop since I received the call that she was missing on Thursday night I know she would have done the same for me So I wasn't going to give up until I saw her face again It was straight tunnel vision even when I would get on social media in my downtime and see some of the false Allegations and assumptions about me having something to do with her abduction would have me discouraged at times I didn't give up and I kept my faith. I just want to thank all of my family friends former teammates and church members who called or Texted me just to let me know that they're praying in here for me You guys don't know how much that meant to me all I ask for everyone right now is to be respectful of Carly's situation She was literally fighting for her life for 48 hours So until she's physically and mentally stable again She's not able to give any updates or whereabouts on her kidnapper at this very moment I also want to thank people on social media If I've been understanding and respectful about what she's been through in these past few days once again I can't thank you guys enough for helping us bring Carly home. God bless you all Hashtag Carly found hashtag Carly Russell. So let's just go back to that sentence that she was literally fighting for her life for 48 hours so She's physically and mentally unstable and not willing to give any updates Again registers to me as odd Because her parents contacted the police say that she was home and didn't rush her to a hospital per se But I didn't want to jump to any conclusions I wanted to wait until the police department made a statement because family members posting on Facebook to basically say stop asking questions Is not of course going to be the statements are given by the police? Somebody is kidnapped. They understand that the public has a right to know that there was a kidnapper on the loose Well, the Hoover PD did in fact give an update I'm Going to read you portions of it because really what they're doing is telling you What happened to Carly on that day? They wrote Carly left work from a business at the summit in Birmingham at approximately 8 20 p.m She ordered food from a nearby business at the colon aid and traveled there We have worked to retrace all of her actions from the time that she left the colon aid until she called 911 And we are well on our way to completing that task at this point in the investigation We have not been able to locate anyone with Carly from the time that she left the colon aid until the 911 call was made Carly communicated on herself home with individuals that were known to her while on her path of travel up to the point Of calling 911 at 934 p.m The conversation with the 911 operator ended and Carly called a relative to be clear Supposed here. She called now and wanted to say that she saw a toddler a white male toddler That was walking down the street in a pamper in a t-shirt Then she hung up that phone and she called a relative of hers She went missing during that conversation with her relative sometime after 936 p.m After telling both the 911 operator and the relative that she had seen a male toddler in a diaper On the side of i 459 and was stopping to check on him Traffic camera footage was obtained which depicted this portion of the incident and that footage is still being analyzed as part of the investigation in Conjunction with the 911 call to accurately determine the timeframe Carly's 911 call remains the only timely report of a child on the interstate Now i'm going to pause here to show you the interstate because apparently there was a camera and its footage is grainy But what you are going to see in this footage is how busy the interstate is which is why it's weird to me Definitely strange definitely suspect if you will that no one else would have phoned in Seeing a toddler walking down the interstate in a diaper. I get if you don't want to stop It's nighttime. I think that's a little weird, but you would at least think that one person Had a moral compass enough to call 911 and say hey, this is kind of weird There's a toddler that is walking down the interstate at 930 at night. Take a look at this footage So that car that you're seeing on the right hand side is carly's you see she has her blinkers on so cars are going slowly around here You can see up ahead. There's a ton of cars on this interstate all slowing down because carly has her blinkers on You would think that since these cars are slowing down that they would be paying attention to the side at people robert neck And they would see carly's vehicle What I don't see in this footage again, it's dark and obviously it's very it could very well be that she saw something that nobody else did Is a toddler walking down the interstate? You see she's got her blinkers on she's got her blinkers on and then she comes to a full stop again I just am remarking at how busy this interstate is my first private store I assume this was like an old dirt road in alabama now I realized a very busy interstate and I instantly thought how strange that no one would call 911 to report this toddler walking down the street, but carly Now let's go back to the police statement It continues Hoover police officers arrived on the scene within five minutes of being dispatched And several other officers arrived shortly behind they located carly's wig Cell phone and purse on the roadway near her vehicle and carly's apple watch was in her purse Investigators with the crimes against persons unit were notified and the investigation immediately began in earnest with numerous leads being followed Many local state and federal agencies immediately offered assistance and provided personnel and other resources to the investigation No stone was left unturned and investigation continued throughout the weekend At 10 44 p.m. On july 15th The Hoover 9-1-1 center received a call from carly's residents that she had returned home on foot Hoover police and fire responded to the residence where carly was located She was immediately transported by the Hoover fire department to uab hospital to be evaluated and was treated and released detectives responded to the residence And to uab to take an initial statement from carly the details of that statement are a part of the ongoing investigation Which is expected to continue over the next few days during the initial portion of the investigation detectives were able to retrace nearly all of carly steps Until the point that she went missing and they are competent That will continue to be the case The end is just they're grateful for the outpouring of support from the hoover community and beyond in all the assistance provided by our law enforcement partners Which are too numerous to name? blah blah blah thanking hashtag hoover p.d Now the first thing that jumps at me at The regarding the statement obviously is what i pointed out to you before which is that she was the only report She was the only person that called in and phoned in this toddler The second thing that jumps at me immediately about the support is what the police are not saying The police didn't say which i think would be the first thing that you would say the public is remain vigilant ladies There's a kidnap or on the loose. We don't have the kid. We've got carly. Thank goodness you got carly But yeah, no, there's there's a kidnapper on the loose lock your doors Make sure that you're traveling in twos. I think that would be The responsible police department that had some information or believed any part of her story that she was actually kidnapped You have a responsibility to inform the public that they need to be aware of this No, they didn't say that at all the second thing that jumped on me Was that carly was only in the hospital for a few hours and again her parents in russia the hospital They standard sent the fire truck and an ambulance over to transport her to evaluate her And then she was treated and released in less than a day That's actually incredible. If you go to the emergency room It's hard to be at the hospital for less than a day But carly managed to do it so despite her boyfriend claiming that she was kidnapped and fought for her life for 48 hours Apparently when the hospital assessed her she was in good enough mental and physical condition to have been released in 24 hours That just jumps at me immediately So yeah, there are a lot of lingering questions here The story is not adding up and lastly he and of course the biggest thing that the police officers failed to mention Is the toddler they didn't say please be on the lookout for a white male toddler wearing a diaper and a t-shirt You would think that if this was a missing person an amber alert of some description of a glauve But the police would have a sketch they would ask carly please describe The toddler that you saw so we can release a sketch and tell the public to look out for this toddler None of that is in the statement simply what they're saying is that they are going to take time to prod just carly's story So yeah, something is afoot It's does not it's not looking good for carly. It seems that her family calling for silence Uh or asking for people not to ask any other questions is weird I think that I would be very forthcoming and say like my daughter is healing But remember that also there's a toddler out there that everyone needs to look for It seems suddenly they have gone very hush hush And of course people are going to call you racist because she's a black woman and how dare you prod a story Just like they called you racist when there were some suspicious things about the jessie smellett story If this does turn out to be some sort of a hoax in any capacity This will be bigger than the jessie smellett story because then you'll be talking about somebody who snatched their own wig And that would just be unbelievable Now what I will add here So i'm paying attention to the internet and what people are reporting from that area and there is a rumor A rumor again. I cannot verify this in any capacity That carly actually plotted this with a 17 year old that she was seeing on the side of her boyfriend And that she escaped with him out of the car that he was also in the vehicle with her And that's the story is her parents are super strict And that her and him were together sort of on the run for 48 hours now again I don't know if this is going to be somewhat lovers triangle But I am saying is that just using my brain here It doesn't sound like there was actually a toddler that lured her off of the road So either she had some sort of a mental break Which in my view would be the best case scenario or she plotted this entire thing For what reason we don't know but the rumors on the internet Is that she was seeing a 17 year old and she wanted to get away with him So we are paying attention to the story. It's all I could pay attention to right now I am just obsessed with it falling apart. I'm obsessed with the public telling us that we're not allowed to look while it's falling apart You know why because I hate liars So that's all I have to say about that Okay, now it's time for some topics to shore So there's a doctor's name is dr. peters. He has pink hair I feel like that's relevant and he lives in portland. I feel like that's also relevant anyways, dr. Blair peters is a surgeon who performs sex chains surgery on Children and he has come out in a since deleted video That has now been circulating social media and Flyer admitted that people that have these procedures children that have these procedures face a lifetime of infertility and continents and sexual Dis satisfaction now as these videos are making the rounds and he's talking about how a lot of this is experimental I'm going to allow you to hear him in his own words shortly viewers were upset They're calling these procedures evil and they're comparing them to nazi era experiments people are comparing this to to frankenstein Why would you be son children? Well, let's hear dr. peters in his own words Who is genital surgery and someone that is underwent puberdal suppression I'm not so much an issue in Someone with assigned female at birth anatomy that undergoes a fouloplasty because we're creating something with a You know free tissue transfer or a flap anyway, but a much bigger issue for an individual that's undergoing a pinot on version vaginal plastic Because we use all of that tissue to basically create devolva as well as lining internal vaginal canal And as a specialty Those of us that do a fairly high volume of genital gender affirming surgery You know, we've maybe done a couple a handful of puberterly suppressed adolescents as a field and no one's published on it yet Ohhsu is we're just putting our first series together as we're kind of learning and figuring out what works but it's really changing things because You don't have enough tissue to line the vaginal canal so you either have to Take a skin graft or take skin from elsewhere or use an artificial product The way that we're dealing with it is by using a robot And we're basically performing intra abdominal components of the surgery so we're using paratinam which is the inner lining of the abdomen to line most of the vaginal canal I don't see what the big deal is they're figuring it out as they perform these surgeries on children Mrs. Kyle let's just want to figure out as you go He then goes on to describe the procedures that they do which is performing wholesale genital removals for non-binary patients Which is an increasingly popular procedure known as nullification so quite literally you are turning people into eunuchs because they Self-identify as non-binary patients. I'm happy that this video is making the rounds I mean we've talked about these procedures on the show. I think education is is the best ingredient here I'm not sure what people think happens or why people believe that this is such an easy procedure and such an easy decision That you should encourage children one way or the other but again when I see these things I'm personally happy that people are learning about these procedures He also goes on the video to address the handful of puberty suppressed adolescents undergoing genital surgeries at OHSU referring to minors who have taken puberty blockers to delay their growth growth spurt with those boy to girl traditionalers He says that surgeons just don't have enough tissue to build the neovagina and must graft the skin from elsewhere So that is what you are hearing when he talks about using the stomach lining to do so He admits that some have a really demanding post-operative care process as I would imagine And he says quote we've seen patients coming back even 20 plus years out from a bad Badgeneoplasty that have something Happened in their life that they just don't dilate and they aren't having sex for a year And they will start to lose a lot of the death which is regarding their neovagina He said that his techniques and success rates were improving as ever more Americans both young and old are opting for genital surgery But that there was still much to learn on this new frontier of medicine He says quote we're going to learn a lot more about it in the next five to ten years as we're just increasing the numbers of these cases So yes, he's a huge advocate for trans medicine I think that you should find this video in his entirety and learn about it If you're someone that is pro-trans and think that it's just a child's choice And it's a simple choice to make then at least do us a favor and become educated about these procedures Not just the procedures but the post-operative measures that these people have to go through Um and what they are enduring for the rest of their lives because there's only so much We are allowed to tell you about it on youtube All right guys now it's time to get into some of your comments obviously last week when I was in france I had a really long discussion regarding homosexuality with brandon tatum I was very pleased to have a discussion because as I've realized just throughout my career And as I said when I was talking to brandon is I have definitely become more conservative On the gay issues as time has gone by and that is just because I am seeing Um some things you just I just thought oh, it's about love is love. I kind of believed all of that Obviously I used to be left leaning and now I am seeing what has happened in this society Since we said okay to great gay marriage and and the fact that we're even talking about experimenting on children And the individuals that are behind backing this Anyways, the first comment comes from age ryan doh s youtube he writes I love watching heterosexuals trying to explain our identity as if we cannot speak for ourselves Being gay is more than just having sex or thinking about sex There's a lot of gay males that actually do love each other It seems like you're trying to make it more perverted because it's no other way for you to explain it Even if I was paralyzed from the waist down. I'd still be with a man It's very weird how anal sex is the first thing that comes to homophobic people's minds as if there is absolutely nothing else keeping to two people there um I appreciate your sentiment, but no that was not been a question that we have what I have actually said to you is that when I am in discussions With my gay friends. It's unbelievable to hear how often they talk about sex It's just the truth and then we talked about the reality which is that two men can have sex constantly every single day and there are no barriers No natural born barriers that are preventing that a woman being you know Just having a baby a woman menstruating these things that prevent your relationship from being centered around sex Which are built into natural order and gay men don't have that we talked about the gay pride parades We talked about why gay pride has become almost synonymous with sexuality What why there are people that are now walking in dog chains? What how has that become the symbol of pride if I said let's have a Heterosexual pride parade people probably show up with their families and their kids No one's gonna say let's wear leather and whips and chains and get on all fours and walk like dogs and call it pup play You know that's true you're listening this and you know that that is true But if I said let's have a heterosexual pride parade nobody would be simulating sex acts Why is that as yourself a very tough question about your own community? It's hard to do that by the way I do it every single day when I'm assessing what's gone wrong in the black community Right when I talk about criminality. I talk about the culture a black culture I'm willing to do that You know it takes a lot to become introspective and to be able to assess what has gone wrong with an attribute that you have You say you're a homosexual will be an honest homosexual about what your community is bringing forth into this culture Next comment alaya awakened writes. Thank you both for speaking on this I'm a bisexual woman and I was repeated repeatedly sexually abused by a female friend when I was six years old Yes, it's possible for a girl to abuse another girl Yes, it's possible for a six-year-old girl to be cruel and domineering and violent into an act of diversity God knows what happened to her to make her that way at such a young age and for it to be deeply traumatizing My first sexual experiences were with a girl and they were non-consensual I believe this is the reason behind my bisexuality and the reason that I attracted a lot of sexual abuse in my life The latter wasn't my fault, but my neuropathways were literally programmed for it I've worked hard these last 14 years to break that programming Not because I believe there's something wrong with love or freedom of choice But I don't want to live with perversity and as I heal I noticed that I'm dropping the masculine shield that I had built and started to Deeply to be the feminine woman. I'm in a relationship with a masculine man The feminine woman that I am in a relationship with a masculine man I yeah, there were a lot of these comments of people that were homosexual and that were coming out and saying in the comments that yes I was abused when I was a child and I do believe that that first sexual experience that you have is very important that it does Establish neuropathways and that is why there are so many as we've talked about with me and Brandon Gaze and lesbian people that were abused sexually in their childhood By someone of the same sex and they that if that's your first sexual experience that becomes again that neuropathway being established of This is what it means to be aroused. I'm happy that we are have had the courage to have that discussion on the show and that so many Gay people and lesbian people Uh felt compelled to comma and to say actually I am one of those people I'm no statistics because those people are silenced because there's this idea It's like no you were just born every single gay and lesbian person was born this way No, some of it is trauma some of it is a social contagion and perhaps a very minute as my The individual I spoke about on the show suggested very very very small my new group of people are Born homosexual in the same way that a very small my new group of people are born in gender dysphoria But the majority of it actually has been nurtured again. That was his suggestion not mine with these comments all but verify it The next comment comes from Sebastian Targaryen the first he writes I was molested by my stepbrother when I was 10 years old Sometimes I wonder if that is the reason that I'm gay when mr. Tatum mentioned the lust it resonated with me. I very well could be confused perhaps I was not born gay If so, how do I begin to heal? How do I begin to go down the right path? Where would I even start? I think about this every day. Thank you, candice PS I also bring this up because recently I believe I've been having natural urges to have a child If that's what I want I want to be a man someone is able to look up to Sebastian obviously I don't I don't have a suggestion for you with how to deal with that because when you're talking about dealing with sexual abuse when you're younger They're first and foremost is a lot of therapy that needs to happen and there's a lot of healing that needs to happen on a spiritual level And when you say that immediately what happens is they say you're recommending gay conversion therapy No, we're recommending that anytime you deal with any sort of a trauma if I was a woman and I was raped by a man Maybe I would never want to sleep with the man ever again Right I would say just all men make me uncomfortable because I endured this horrific rape And then I'd say I feel comfortable with women because you know women are not going to do that sort of a thing to me That would make me not a homosexual by birth But a homosexual because of an experience that I had a choice of being homosexual But again because we aren't allowed to have those discussions people immediately Casting it you if you start saying that maybe you can go to therapy and deal with those deep-seated traumas from your childhood All of us are shaped by our childhood everybody has childhood trauma I have childhood trauma, you know, and it's weird that some people who have childhood trauma are being told not to explore it Because the result of their childhood trauma might be that oh, yeah, okay That's actually what kind of made you gay and want desire other men or desire other women Magdalena rights High canis as always I love this episode normal idea sip a like button But this time I decided to leave a comment as well Even though I agree with some points made for Catholicism I couldn't help but think about many catholic priests that have been accused of gay pedophilia something that never happened within the Protestant church I believe any comment on this it absolutely has happened within the Protestant churches the first comment I'm going to make the problem is that there's so many Protestant churches that no one ever registers pedophilia as a problem because they're like oh just happened in this This section of Protestantism or this section whereas the catholic church is so big and domineering and obviously It's you know, it's a catholic church The first church that people are talk about it. It's been associated with it Not justification whatsoever, but the more important part of what you're saying is that Gay pedophilia happened in the catholic church So it's a problem the catholic church or is it the problem? Gay men that are in the catholic church I shouldn't be in the church because if you're a gay man, you shouldn't be a priest at all Right and it is gay men that are abusing children So whether you're a gay man abusing children at a school or gay men abusing children at a catholic church The issue is that we have homosexual men that have invaded institutions It's not because of you know the education system if you if there was a pedophilia scandal at schools and there have been them You don't then say oh education is wrong like when we had the Penn State Issue, I can't think of the guy's name. Sandusky. I think it was no one said oh the fault is the institution of education But allowed this to happen. No, you wouldn't say that The problem is that a gay man got into position of power and abused men, but people don't think that same way when it's a catholic church The final comment Madison writes this was so eye-opening. Thank you both as a black man who identifies as gay This was an amazing informative discussion. Thank you both again. I just loved Loves love love reading all these comments from gay people and lesbian people that were just happy That someone was willing to have the discussion and not to make it seem like every gay person was born this way or every gay person agrees with this Because the truth is is that everybody has different experiences that leads them to where they are in life And if we don't have the courage to talk about these things for fear of being called Homophobic or for fear of being called somebody who's promoting gay conversion therapy or whatever it is Then we don't get to ever potentially Fix issues, you know and and sometimes encouraging people to go further into perversion as one of the commenters said is not a solution We need to acknowledge, you know that this society is starting with issues and then creating factors of social contagion And you see that the most in the lgbtq too many letters for me to remember community All right ladies and gentlemen, that is all the time that we have for today as a reminder a shot in the dark is available now on daily wire plus So be sure to click the link in the description and subscribe right now And definitely come back tomorrow for an all new episode who knows there might be an update on a carly Russell story. I'm obsessed"
