    "text": " Team Buck, welcome to the freedom hut much to get to today. First off, stop panicking over the Delta variant. No more lockdowns, no more mask mandates. This is a fight we have to win. Plus, our southern border is open to the whole world. And Dick Durbin tells us what the strategy is for the Democrats, an Ivy League lawyer, firebombed a police car. And yet there are a lot of folks who are rushing to defend the suspect and a trans model on the cover of sports illustrated. What are we supposed to take from that? We'll get into all of it in just a moment. But first, I've got to tell you that the Tunnel to Towers Foundation is incredible. They help us keep our commitment to never forget. And this year, the foundation is honoring Gold Star and fallen first responder families with young children and catastrophically injured veterans and first responders with 200 mortgage free homes. Chairman and CEO Frank Siller is paying tribute to the fallen by walking from the Pentagon to Shanksville and on to ground zero, more than 500 miles through six states in 42 days, the month of August through 911. Towers of light are to shine at the Pentagon and Shanksville memorials in remembrance. The names of those we lost to 911 related illnesses are being read aloud at a ceremony on September 12. And on Veterans Day, the names of those we lost in the war on terror will also be read aloud. Do good and help America to never forget. Donate $11 a month to tunnel to towers at t2t.org. That's t2t.org t the number two t dot org. The covid panic is never going to stop unless we make it stop. You know, I've been saying that for a long time. You also know that I've told you there's a possibility of more mask mandates in the future. Even after we get to a widespread level of vaccination, which we already we've already reached in this country, it's already something that we are experiencing. And because of the Delta variant, you're being told, Oh, no, there's different rules we have to apply now, we have to go back to the things we did in the past. No, no, no, lockdowns were utterly catastrophic. Okay, idiotic. They did not work. And no one should have thought they would work. But this is a case study. In in not just years or decades, I would say in centuries to come, people will look back at what our public health establishment did in this country and around the world and say, how could they have abandoned so many core principles of science, of free intellectual inquiry or freedom of speech? How could they have been completely overtaken with groupthink and the herd mentality and really acted like anybody who would question this even from within their own ranks was some kind of a heretic. There is an excellent piece in City Journal written by John Tierney. I want to share some of this piece with you because I think it makes the point incredibly well. Here's what he writes. And the title of the piece is the panic pandemic, which I believe was even a title that we used. Producer Mark, I we I didn't ask you this before we could check. I'm sure we had a podcast where I said stop the panic pandemic because that's what we've been going through. It's an obvious description of the reality that we have been seeing. And so I wanted to share with you this piece because I think he really gets it. I think he really nails it. The United States quote, suffered through two lethal waves of contagion the past year and a half. The first was a viral pandemic that killed about one in 500 Americans, typically a person over 75 suffering from other serious health conditions. The second and far more catastrophic was a moral panic that swept the nation's guiding institutions. Instead of keeping calm and carrying on the American elite flouted the norms of governance, journalism, academic freedom, and worst of all science, they misled the public about the origins of the virus and the true risk that it posed, ignoring their own carefully prepared plans for a pandemic. They claimed unprecedented powers to impose untested strategies with terrible collateral damage. As evidence of their mistakes mounted, they stifled debate by vilifying dissenters, censoring criticism, and suppressing scientific research. If as seems increasingly plausible, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19 leaked out of a laboratory in Wuhan is the costliest blunder ever committed by scientists. Whatever the pandemic's origin, the response to it is the worst mistake in the history of the public health profession. We still have no convincing evidence that the lockdown saved lives, lives, but lots of evidence that they already cost lives and will prove deadlier in the long run than the virus itself. And quote, and this is stunning, isn't it? You hear these words or you read them if you see this piece in City Journal and you say, what the hell were these idiots in charge doing? Lock down? And remember, there's so many ways, and I could just go off on on endless criticisms about this. There are so many ways, though, in which this was doomed to fail from the start as a policy. For one, we never really locked down. That did not happen. There were always frontline workers. There were always people who were required to continue to go about their jobs. And there were human beings who had to be in contact with other human beings. The virus continued to spread. But instead of focusing on protecting those who are truly at mortal peril, the elderly knows with preexisting conditions, most notably obesity, instead of that, we pretended like 22 year olds should be working on Zoom only from their couch in Park Slope, Brooklyn, or in Santa Monica, Los Angeles, or wherever. That's what this thing turned into. So they had people who were working class delivering their food and keeping the lights on for them. While they got to do a lot of virtue signaling about how seriously they take the virus. But this became a religion for people that neither have a relationship with God, nor have come to grips with the fact psychologically that we are all going to die. I don't mean from COVID. I just mean as a certainty, all of us will die. I will die. And I know that. And sure, it's a human condition that you will at some points be, you don't want to die and you try to live up the longest, happiest, healthiest life you can. You take those actions you can to extend your life whenever possible. But you know, you wake up every day with that knowledge and an understanding that there's only so much you can control and you do the best you can. And we all have limited time. That psychological predisposition would have resulted in people thinking, we're going to do what we can. You know, you want to stay away from sick people and you want to stay as healthy as you can. But you can't control this virus. Instead, we were completely misled into thinking that if only we obeyed St. Fauci, everything would be fine. If only that sub-mediocrity and his little lab coat, his little glasses, you know, I just go on TV every three seconds to tell the libs, whatever they want to hear about the virus. Here he is, play club four. Well, Canada is doing better not because we are trying any less than they are trying. It's because in Canada, you don't have that divisiveness of people not wanting to get vaccinated. In many respects, on the basis of ideology and political persuasion. And that's something that we have been saying for some time now. I mean, political differences are totally understandable in a natural part of the process in any country. But when it comes to a public health issue, in which you're in the middle of a deadly pandemic and the common enemy is the virus, it just doesn't make any sense to essentially just regard or don't pay attention to what's obvious, namely that if you look at the numbers, they tell you something very important. 99.5% of all the deaths due to COVID-19 in this country are among vaccinated people. So let's just take him at his word here for a second. That was Fauci just in the last 24 hours. Let's just go. First of all, he's a scientist who compares the US to Canada and immediately, the politics, Fox News, whenever they say divisive politics, whenever these lab coat tyrants get on TV, the blue check MD brigades who are wrong about everything, they love the BLM protests, even when they were telling everybody else, no protests allowed. But BLM protests were about health. I see somebody, especially an upper middle class white liberal who's showy about how much they're into BLM. I not only see a fraud, I see a moron. Just want to say this, it's like people that unnecessarily share their pronouns. No one cares stopping an idiot and it doesn't make you a good person. It makes you a sheep. But you do whatever the herd is doing and try to fit in so desperately. It's pathetic. I just want to note that Fauci missed a science compares the US to Canada. Gee, you know, it really matters a lot when you're talking about the spread of a virus, things like population density. Canada per square per square mile has 11 people. The United States per square mile has 94 people. So almost 10 X the population density per square mile in the United States. Do you think? Should that matter to anybody? Is that is that relevant? I think it matters. I think people should care about this. I think they should think that it's something that we all should pay attention to at some level. But then again, I'm basing this on the science. I'm basing this on what actually we know from the numbers. All right. Okay. It's more like nine times. Who cares? Doesn't matter. It's a lot more population density. And here we are playing this out with the Fauci. I'd still running around saying the delta varied. You got to get everyone. If the vaccines work so well, which they work less well against delta than than they had hoped or than they had told us, but if the vaccines work so well, then guess what? We should be back to fully normal today because if someone is choosing not to get a vaccine, they are making a choice. And that is something that they get to live with. Right. I have not gotten the vaccine because I had COVID. So and my family members who are at high risk have all gotten the vaccine. So it is completely reasonable to say I'm not going to do it. But if I were to get super sick with COVID in six months and you know, God forbid, I end up in the hospital, would people be able to say, well, you know, he didn't get the vaccine? Yeah, of course. But how many years have we gone through now in America where you could choose to get a flu vaccine? Yes or no, one way or the other. And a lot of people died from the flu. And a lot of those people didn't get the vaccine. If you believe in it, if you want it, you can get it and have had plenty of opportunity to get it. The argument for imposing this on people, the argument for mandates and all the rest of it simply does not add up, doesn't add up because you should be you're protected. It's good enough. And giving this to 12 year olds or two year olds as they want to start doing is reckless. And it's rooted in this as a religious belief for liberals, who are not really liberals, the status leftist, authoritarians, progressives. It's a religion for them, a religion replacement. And there's a lot of moral and intellectual cowardice on the left about this point. It's really defined by intellectual and moral cowardice when it comes to COVID. They would not speak the truth. And that's why when you read this piece, for example, in City Journal, where they address what happened here, it's, it's stunning to see how this was politicized so early on, it was used as a weapon against Trump. And what they've really ended up doing in all of this is destroy public faith in the health establishments, willingness to stay out of politics and just do what's best for the patient. Just do what's best to keep people healthy and alive. Do you think any of the lockdowns feel bad about the fact that as the City Journal piece states, quote, one in three people worldwide lost a job or a business during the lockdowns, half saw their earnings drop. Children never at risk from the virus in many places essentially lost a year of school. The economic and health consequences were felt most acutely among the less affluent in America and in the rest of the world where the World Bank estimates that more than 100 million people had been pushed into extreme poverty. 100 million people pushed into extreme poverty. Extreme poverty means going to bed hungry at night, malnutrition. Extreme poverty means not having access to properly sanitized water, you know, you get dysentery, you can die from that too, by the way. Extreme poverty is grinding misery, pain and despair. 100 million people pushed into that according to the World Bank because of lockdowns. Do they count? Does that matter to anybody? No, it's so much more essential for people who have two homes and could flee to one of them during the pandemics. They had plenty of outdoor space to go to, to watch MSNBC and listen to Mattow and the other geniuses over there and mask up double mask. What happened to double masking? You'll notice it's falling out of fashion like a preferred hat or the width of men's ties because that's all that ever was a fashion. It was moronic from the beginning. Well, they admit that? No, they will not. They will not admit it because that would be to accept that they can be wrong. And if they were wrong about that, what else were they wrong about? One thing that I'm definitely right about is how amazing my pillows are. I've got no Mike Lindell, the inventor of my pillow well over the years. And his products have been a game changer when it comes to my sleep. Mike fit me for my very own my pillow.

So the lock downers are never going to budge from what they've said and how wrong they've been up to this point. But you have to remember that it was also largely pushed by journalists as they as he writes here in this city journal piece, John Tierney writes, the panic was started as usual by journalists as the virus spread early last year, they highlighted the most alarming statistics and the scariest images, the estimates of a fatality rate 10 to 50 times higher than the flu, the chaotic scenes at hospitals in Italy and New York City, the predictions that national health care systems were also about to collapse. The full scale panic was set off by the release in March of 2020 of a computer model at the Imperial College in London, which projected that under unless drastic measures were taken, intensive care units would have 30 COVID patients for every available bed. And America would see 2.2 million deaths by the end of the summer. British researchers announced the only viable strategy was to impose draconian restrictions on businesses, schools and social gatherings until a vaccine arrived. It was locked down until vaccine. They didn't really tell us that at the beginning, did they? No, because people would have said, hold on a second. This is now the new standard. This is how we deal with this stuff. Lock down until vaccine really. Isn't that isn't that a little bit extreme, sounded can't everyone tell right away? Hold on a second. That doesn't that doesn't make any sense. We're gonna lock down that long. But they lied. They lied to you. They told you it was two weeks to slow this spread. They didn't say it was stay locked down until the vaccine comes out. And now you can see they're trying to edge into we all have rolling lockdowns until the virus is entirely gone. It's endemic now, folks, it's going to be within the population. There will be COVID outbreaks for the foreseeable future. That is just reality. It's just reality. And they're not going to be as big. They're not going to be as lethal. But it is now very much like the fluid is going to be in circulation around the world. And there will be a seasonality to it. And there will be booster shots and there will be, you know, future variants and all the rest of it. So that means no, we don't go back to the things that didn't work to stop it in the first place, I might add, it means we go back to normal life and people making informed decisions for themselves about their health. That's it. I mean, the so-called Fauciite consensus on the one who calls it that but the consensus of the Fauciites was wrong. And they use social media to shut down those who disagreed with them. They use whatever tools at their disposal to crush dissent. They went after researchers like United is at the Stanford University Medical School. They went after people with impeccable credentials who said, what the heck is going on here? You guys are wrong. This is a bad idea. The numbers don't support it. Shut up, they said, you're helping Trump. That's what it's all about. The problem with the left is that it's emotional for reason. They're so emotionally invested in their hatred of Donald Trump and their desire to feel superior because of their politics, their fellow human beings that you can't really reason with them. You can't have a discussion about things like maybe this is more important than whether you like Trump or not. Maybe getting this right and not crushing freedom, shredding the constitution and resulting. But there's so much unintended consequence of things like lockdowns and masks, I might add. I think a lot of people thought that masks were much more effective than they were. So they were not doing the things that would have really helped like be very cautious about being around a sick person. Oh, well, I got my mask. My mask will keep me safe. You know, just like the doctors wear, they never stop the thing. Hold on a second. Doctors actually wear N95 masks. They don't wear a balaclava or a, you know, a handkerchief with Biden Harris 2020 on it. And they have a clean, fresh mask every time they go into the OR and they keep it on the whole time. They don't and they're and you're talking about somebody who's in a, in an environment where their body is likely being opened up to pathogens already. So you know, you're an extreme circumstance, medical circumstance, but people say, Oh yeah. You know, doctors in the OR. Same thing as mask on, mask off on the plane, mask on, mask off in the restaurant. This is stupid. Everybody should know it is stupid. But there are people who really want to believe they're smart and they vote Democrat and they're left as they think they're so smart. And so it didn't matter how absurd this got because ultimately it was a giant exercise in showing everybody how evolved, elevated and and elite they were in their thinking and in their lifestyle choices around COVID. It's pathetic. It's awful. Anyway, I can't recommend this piece more highly by John Tierney in City Journal, the panic pandemic. It's, it's essential. You should definitely check it out and good work from John Tierney. So there's no argument for changing election voting laws based on fraud. There certainly is an argument when it comes to the outcome of the election. That was clear and it has been to everyone except one former president for a long time. And yet the Republicans went in control of state legislatures or by design trying to make it more difficult for some people to vote. Why? The answer is very simple. The demographics of America are not on the side of the Republican Party. The new voters in this country are moving away from them, away from Donald Trump, away from their party creed that they preach. Instead, they're moving to be independence or even vote on the other side to argue and fight against that. The Republicans and legislators settings are reducing and restricting the opportunity to vote. That's what it's all about. Oh, wait a second. Here's a good old Dick Durbin saying some stuff about some things here when it comes to people and the border and the Democrat strategy. The demographics of America are not on the side of the Republican Party. The new voters in this country are moving away from the new voters. Gee, that's so interesting. So immigration is a tool that Democrats plan to and have been using. It's a tool to outvote Republicans. And what you do is kick the doors to America as wide open as possible. Take those who are least likely to be able to contribute on a net basis. Take those who are most likely to need state benefits and who are going to arrive and immediately be told, Oh, if you're non white, this country owes you something. You are owed by the country you have just arrived in. You don't owe the country. No, no, quite the opposite. Oh, no, you've probably suffered from white supremacy. Wherever you came from all over the world, you came from Sri Lanka, you came from Vietnam from Haiti, from Venezuela, white supremacy is the challenge that you have faced. Whether you know it or not, that's what the left says. That's part of the narrative. So bring in as many people from the rest of whether they speak English or not. Doesn't matter. Whether they know anything about America, doesn't matter. They know that there's good welfare benefits here. They know that the Democrat Party wants them here to outvote those who believe in limited government, who believe in constitutionalism. So this is the plan. And that's why the open southern border is so interesting, isn't it? I know there was a Fox reporter who was down there with hundreds of people trying to just push through in Del Rio literally pushed through border patrol at a fenced area. And it's on video. You can see it. And so we sit here and say, how can anyone tell us that the border is not effectively an open border? You get you get brought into the United States, you get caught. Okay, maybe, maybe you get turned around and deported. Let's try again. You'll get in. Anybody who wants to get here now illegally can do so. It is not hard. And if you're a family unit, you're definitely getting in. If you're a child, you're obviously getting in. So when Democrats get all, all huffy, indignant about what's really happening here at the southern border, just remember that the plan is exactly as we've been saying, which is to bring in more people who are more likely to vote Democrat. And that means importing as many as many individuals illegally and legally from the developing world as they possibly can. You know, not all individuals are going to be able to come to America. Not everybody who wants to be in a country that is wealthy and has relative rule of law. And at least until Democrats are done with it, decent levels of freedom, they can't all come. So who doesn't get to show up here? Who doesn't get to be an American? That's the question the Democrats never answer. They are using these, as as Dick Durbin said, these demographic changes that they are breaking the law to bring about in the first place, they are using this in order to outvote Republicans and create a permanent majority for the Democrat Party. They say it out loud. So as much as I'm sure they want to argue with me on this and pretend that what I'm saying isn't true, they say it out loud. Anyway, now there's also speaking of what's going on all over the world. Wait, did I have? Oh, the Ivy League lawyers, I was going to talk about China, but you know, we'll talk about China tomorrow. Ivy League lawyers headed to trial here. This was pretty remarkable. A two New York City Ivy League lawyers are standing trial for the for allegedly fire bombing a police cruiser. And this will start in March of 2022, a police cruiser and distributing Molotov cocktails during the George Floyd riots last summer. Defense lawyers, this is from the Washington free beacon for Colin Furt Mattis and a Rouge Ramon have been in plea negotiations, but have not come to terms. They will not take a plea bargain. Oh, that's so the pre-trial motions are scheduled for September 17 during selection begin March 14, 2022. That's a pretty bold move to not to not actually take a plea in a situation like this. I mean, they are clearly based on everything we know. They are clearly guilty. There is surveillance footage of this. They are literally on camera fire bombing a police vehicle and police officers were there and witnessed it. You have eyewitnesses and video evidence of it. So explain to me why they would try to roll the dice on seven felony charges, including civil disorder, arson, conspiracy, and federal explosives charges. Okay. And remember, lawyers are automatically disbarred for felony convictions in New York state. I'm just wondering why would they roll the dice on that? If they get convicted, you can get it on seven federal felony charges. A judge can can make you serve some real time. You know, you could go away for years. So what's the, oh, well, we know why. We know why they think they can, they can do this because, quote, the accused enjoy widespread sympathy and support from New York's legal and media elites. Ramon is represented by one of the city's best defense attorneys and a former Obama administration official guaranteed her bail in the amount of $250,000. Both have been the subject of favorable profiles in New York magazine and PR among other venues. I think they believe they can get a not guilty verdict based on black lives matter. BLM black lives. I think that's really the plan here to just look at the sympathy that the left has in New York city for the BLM movement. So they will nullify charges of arson, civil disorder, and, you know, destructive riot. And let me just note, you know, firebombing a police cars, the kind of thing that I used to believe all Americans could agree on was really bad. It's, it's not just about the destruction. Well, that's obviously a part of it. It's dangerous. It's dangerous. As we all know, and yet they won't take a plea because they think there's enough sympathy for them. They think there's enough sympathy for them that maybe the jury just says, you know what the laws don't count. Now I want you to juxtapose this situation with what we just saw play out with James Hodgkins, who's the law, who's the rioter who just got eight months in federal prison for the crime of disrupting Congress. Congress was delayed in what it did, disrupting Congress. Oh, eight months in federal prison for that. Interesting. And they're going to go for multi year sentences. I can assure you against people who were getting, you know, actually either destroyed property, he didn't destroy property. This guy was just there. He was just there eight months in federal prison. Now, how do you get to that? Well, his presence, he was trespassing and his presence was part of a group. They say that was, well, they say all kinds of crazy things about it, but they'll say that it was part of an insurrection that there was a threat to Congress from this, that people were terrified, all this sort of stuff. And it's remarkable as you actually look at this. The federal judge who was presiding over this case called it an active domestic terrorism, damage that will persist for decades, those who fled will be traumatized for the rest of their lives, makes it harder for us diplomats to promote democracy abroad. That's right. This guy, this guy Hodgkins is getting a Paul, I'm sorry, I said James, Paul Hodgkins is getting a, because I confused it with James Hodgkins, sin, who you should all remember, he's the Bernie Sanders supporter who back in 2018 shot representative Steve Scalise as part of an actual mass assassination attempt of conservative members of Congress. But Paul Hodgkins, Paul Hodgkins pleaded guilty to obstruction of Congress. And if you were to read the way the judge set this whole thing up, you'd say, well, it's so clear that what's really going on here is this guy's being punished for at some level. Look, what he did is wrong. And I've always said that you can't write, you can't, you know, break in and disrupt Congress. But you had anti-cavidal people disrupting proceedings on Capitol Hill, blocking, blocking entrances and acting like lunatics. You've had Democrats take over state capitals, trespassing, refusing to let people come and go, blocking the business of the state legislature. Let's go back to the Scott Walker days, what was going on in Wisconsin. So, you know, these kinds of things do occur. The assaults on police officers, I mean, that's, that's the most serious charge. And that should be, that should be punished. I mean, you can't start throwing punches at cops and doing this sort of thing. And people should go to jail for that. I'm on a set, people should go to jail for that. You got to serve some time for that. You can't do that. But trespassing. And by the way, and I say sometime was the officer seriously injured? If the answer is no. But a lot of you are probably saying, wait, hold on a second, Buck, how many BLM protesters who assaulted officers, punched them, spat on them? Ah, yes. You see, this is the problem with actually having principles is that when you try to apply them consistently, you're very disappointed with the American system. You're very disappointed with how our justice system plays out now. There is one side here that always gets more than the benefit of the doubt. They get a free pass while the other is treated terribly for reasons of politics. And that is what you are seeing. That is actually what is happening here.

All right, the sports illustrated swimsuit edition has a has a trans woman who will be on the trans woman will be on the cover. Okay, Laina bloom. And will be the first transgender woman on the cover of sports illustrated celebrated as a symbol of beauty. Now I just I know the left has really lost its mind. I know there there's you know, they're they're crazy at at some level. That much is as obvious on a lot of issues. But on this one, I've just got to say, do I as a heterosexual male? Am I allowed to say that this is to me, you know, sports illustrated can be woke and do whatever they want. But I don't find a man who has physically altered, you know, traits, you know, gotten, you know, breast augmentation, essentially fake breasts and had other surgeries and things done. I don't find that physically appealing or attractive. In fact, I find it, I find it distressing. I find it disturbing. I find it sad. But this is this is not about, you see, this is what the left always does. At first they want tolerance. Then they then they demand they demand. Celebration, right? Tolerated tolerated. Well, now you have to celebrate it. That's the next step. And that's what you see here. I mean, tolerance in the context of transgenderism should be, you treat everybody as a person with respect and decency and dignity. You're kind to people, you don't just scream it against people, right? That's, that's what we could all agree. Tolerant should mean that's not tolerance for the left is no, no, you can't criticize this thing. You can't criticize the situation. That's what they think it is. It's a very different circumstances. And look, I think this is weird. I also think, you know, any guy listening to this, if you were on a, if you were on a date with someone, and by the way, those of you who say that would never happen to me, I mean, it's, you start to look at some of the surgeries, the things they're doing, you know, it's, it's, I'm just telling you, I mean, I've, I've heard, I've heard stories, I've heard stories. And you know, how should you feel about that? I mean, shouldn't a person always have to identify as, as trans? I mean, there are, just so you understand where I'm going with this, there are media outlets like the Huffington Post who will use terms like transphobic for straight men who are not attracted to trans women. So, so look at what they're doing here. No, I'm allowed to, you're allowed to for the guys listening to be attracted to what we are attracted to when it comes to, of course, consenting adults. But that's it. They can't force this upon us. I don't have to celebrate this. I don't have to think this is normal or okay to elevate a person and say this is a, a beauty symbol. But the left is relentless with this. They are relentless. And we are supposed to think that a person who is not not female, you cannot actually change your gender should be attractive to straight males. That's what the elevation to the cover of a sports illustrator is supposed to do. It's supposed to be confusing. It's supposed to be it's supposed to really be cultural pressure on people. And it's just absurd. And it's weird that they do this to the general public. But the left has an agenda and they're pushing it. They're pushing it. So here you go. Oh, what a day. Thanks so much for being here with me on the Buck's Ex and show podcast. Please do spread the word.
